Summary


Following suggestions that the condition of the perimeter wall, adjacent to Gate 'C',
may be relevant to the Hillsborough enquiry, a detailed examination of the wall and
parapet walls over the Leppings Lane turnstiles was made. The survey was
subsequently extended to cover the remainder of the perimeter walls. The wall in
question was found to be distorted and lacking in lateral stability and could be
made to sway when pushed by hand. The parapet walls over the turnstiles were found
to be dilapidated with a loose pier, loose copings and loose/broken infill railings.
Other than these parts of the perimeter the remainder was in a generally adequate
condition, subject to minor repairs and pointing. Recommendations are made
regarding the remedial works considered necessary to ensure the integrity, safety
and effectiveness of the wall and parapets over the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane
entrance to the ground.

1.   WALL BETWEEN GATE 'C' AND SOUTH STAND AT SOUTH WEST CORNER OF GROUND

     1.1   The wall is approximately 71 m (233 ft) long, stretching from Gate 'C'
     to the brick building housing turnstile 19 adjacent to Gate 'D'. The wall is
     not perfectly straight but has a slight curve on plan, being concave when
     viewed from outside the ground, and having an oblique corner at a distance of
     46.8 m from Gate 'C'.

     1.2   It is constructed from 230 mm (9 inches) brickwork, laid in black mortar,
     to a type of Flemish garden wall bond with alternate header/stretchers in
     every sixth course. The rear, or inner, face of the wall is reinforced with
     700 mm x 115 mm (27^ inches x 4h inches) buttresses at approximately 7 m (23 ft)
     centres. The wall is capped with a precast concrete coping approximately 75 mm
     (3 inches) high and the height to the underside of the coping varies from
     2.36 m (7 ft 9 inches) to 2.98 m (9 ft 9 inches). It is constructed on sloping
     ground and the height varies in steps along its length.

     1.3 Mild steel angle brackets, curved outwards and carrying three strands of
     barbed wire, are bolted to the top external face of the wall. Some of these
     were loose and all were rusty and dilapidated.

     1.4    The wall is distorted and bowed along its length and is also out of
     plumb, leaning inwards over parts of its length and outwards over other parts
      (see Table 1, Photographs 1-4).   The maximum deflection out of plumb is
     100 mm (4 inches) leaning outwards. No damp-proof course appears to have been
     provided when the wall was constructed and the mortar near the base has eroded
     and weathered due to damp and frost action. Both faces have been repointed in
     cement mortar in the past but the original black mortar can be seen where the
     pointing has deteriorated.    It is not known upon what type of foundation the
     wall is constructed. However, the base of the stretch between the corner and
     Gate 'D' shows stepped brickwork at the base and it is possible that this is
     the top of a stepped brick foundation.

     1.5   There was some diagonal cracking in the wall at a distance of 40 m from
     Gate 'C' and again at 50 m, the latter extending for the full height of the
     wall. In addition there were areas of loose brickwork at the top of the wall,
     and in places the concrete coping was weathered and cracked, particularly
     where the top of the wall was stepped (see Photographs 5-8).

     1.6   It was found that the wall could be made to sway and oscillate when
     pushed. For example, when pushed near the corner, some 40 m from Gate 'C',
     the wall swayed and a wave travelled to the end such that the lamp pillar
     bolted to the wall near Gate 'C' could be seen to sway and shake. Similarly,
     if Gate 'C' was pushed the adjacent wall was found to shake due to the bolted
     connections between the gatepost and the end of the wall.

     1.7   Advice was given that the wall was significantly distorted, had failed
     as a structure and was unsafe. It was considered to be liable to topple during
     high winds, or if set oscillating by crowd pressure. Consequently it was
     considered that it should be either taken down and recon?;tructed or stabilized
     by buttressing or other equally effective means.

2.   BRICK PARAPET WALLS AND INFILL RAILINGS OVER TURNSTILE BUILDINGS AT
     LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE

     2.1    The perimeter of the ground between gates A-C at the lappings Lane end
     is enclosed by single-storey buildings housing turnstiles 1-16 and A-G. The
     outer face of the buildings has a 230 mm (9 inches) brick parapet wall
     surmounted by brick piers with an infill of ornamental cast iron railings
      (see Photographs 17-20). As the railings do not present a barrier to climbing,
     but rather the reverse as they provide hand-holds, the effective height of the
     wall is 3.43 m (11 ft 3 inches) ie to the bottom of the railings.

     2.2   The parapet walls, piers and railings are generally dilapidated with
     loose and spalling brickwork in places, loose and broken sections of railing
     and loose coping stones on top of the brick piers (see Photographs 10-16).
     The 230 mm x 345 mm (9 inches x 13H inches) brick pier adjacent to Gate 'C'
     has become detached from the wall and is displaced (Photographs 9 and 10).
     The end of the infill railing is fixed to the pier but the opposite end of the
     railing is only loosely held by the next pier (Photograph 11). As a result the
     pier and attached railing are loose and can easily be rocked by hand. They are
     held in position by the wooden post of a large notice board which is positioned
     diagonally across the comer of the turnstile building (see Photograph 9).
     However, the effect of a number of people using the railing as a hand-hold to
     climb over the wall could be sufficient to pull the railings and pier over
     onto the crowd below. The coping belonging to the brick pier above turnstile
     16, adjacent to Gate 'B' was lying on the ground adjacent to the exit from the
     turnstiles (Photograph 20).

     2.3 As can be seen from the Photographs, the front of the turnstile building
     does not provide an effective barrier against determined assault. The fixed
     guide barrier adjacent to Turnstile 'G' provides a convenient foothold and the
     parapet railings a hand-hold (Photographs 17 and 19). Similarly, the panelled
     gate adjacent to Turnstile 16, together with its stay and wall brackets,
     provided convenient means of scaling the wall (Photographs 17 and 18). The cast
     iron railings are, in fact, broken in two at this point (Photograph 18).

     2.4   In view of the general condition of the parapet wall, brick piers and
     railings, and their failure to provide an effective barrier, it is recommended
     that consideration be given to dismantling and reconstruction of the parapet
     as a solid barrier of sufficient height to deter climbers.

3.   NORTHERN PERIMETER WALL

     3.1   The northern perimeter comprises a 230 mm (9 inches) thick brick wall,
     approximately 2 m high, surmounted by a mesh fence to a total height of 4.3 m.
     The perimeter forms the rear boundary of the houses fronting Vere Road and thus
     has no access by the general public. It is generally in satisfactory condition
     and is not considered likely to give rise to any hazards.

4.   REMAINDER OF PERIMETER WALLING

     4.1   The remainder of the perimeter walling is generally provided by the outer
     walls of buildings, such as turnstiles, the south stand etc and there are no
     other substantial lengths of freestanding wall.




                                        2
     4.2   There were some relatively minor defects noted that required remedial
     action and these are listed below.

            (i)   The brickwork above turnstiles 35/36 and the return wall
           behind the turnstile building required inspection and repointing.

           (ii)   The screen wall to the toilets behind turnstile 43 requires
           repairs to the brickwork at the top of the wall.

           (iii)   The parapet wall above turnstiles 82-88 requires repointing.

5.   CONCLUSIONS

     5.1 The North,South and East perimeter walls of the ground appear to be
     adequate apart from the relatively minor defects noted above.

     5.2   The freestanding wall at the South West corner, between Gate 'C' and
     turnstiles 19-22 is distorted, has inadequate lateral stability for its
     height and is unsafe and liable to topple if subjected to wind or crowd
     pressure. As recommended earlier it should be taken down and reconstructed,
     suitably buttressed or stabilized by other equally effective measures.
     Whatever course is adopted the wall should be upgraded to meet modern design
     loading criteria for sportsgrounds.

     5.3   The parapet walls and infill railings surmounting the turnstile building
     1-16 and A-G, between Gates A-C at the Leppings Lane end of the ground are
     generally dilapidated and in poor condition. In addition, the adjacent barrier
     and gate and the infill railings provide hand and foot-holds facilitating
     climbing and unauthorised entry to the ground. I consider that this parapet
     walling should be taken down to sound brickwork and reconstructed as a solid
     barrier to a height that will effectively prevent unauthorised access.

INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL GROUND
SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989


At 8.V?s® on Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Woodseats Police
Station and was transported to the ground at Hillsborough together with other
officers by bus, we arrived at the ground at around 9*30am. I was in charge of
a serial of 10 men and was immediately responsible to Inspector Booth,
'E2' Division.

A briefing was arranged for 10am and this took place more or less as scheduled
with officers gathered in the North Stand. Following this briefing all officers
took a packed meal which I collected for my serial from the Gymnasium. I also
collected a radio and tickets for a meal which was to be provided later in the
day.

At about 11.15am my   serial, together with others were gathered on the Spion Kop,
where we were again briefed bySuperintendent Greenwood as to the particular
problems which we were likely to encounter in that part of the ground. It was
the responsibility of these serials to police this part of the ground for the
durationof the match, with individual serials undertaking specific tasks.

At approximately 11.50am, as per the instruction of the day, my serial were
deployed outside the ground on Penistone Road North. We were to police turnstyles
   to 54 which gave entrance to the kop.

Throughout the next few hours we remained at the turnstyles supervising the
entrance of supporters which as time went on gradually built up to quite a
large crowd. Despite this there were no problems with the crowd and apart from
the odd drunk of- spectator trying to gain entrance without tickets, they were
very well behaved and quite jovial. It never got to the stage where the crowd
could have been considered unruly or out of control. As the start of the game
approached I could hear messages over the radio relating to the other end of
the ground but was unaware of any real problem. Howver, shortly after the start
of the match I received instruction via the radio for my serial to go onto the
playing area. I cant remember the exact content of the message received, but
I former the opinion that spectators at the leppings lane end had invaded the
playing area and that reinforcements were required at that end. I entered the
groundwith my serial and went up to the side of the kop nearest to the South         f
Stand.                                                          |

On reaching a position where I could see the Leppings Lane end I saw a large         I
number of people on the playing area, the game had obviouly been stopped and         r
I saw what I at first thought to be fighting in and around the goalmouth area        t
at that end of the ground. I entered the playing area via a gate in the fence        I
at the kop and ran towards the leppings Lane end. I saw people still coming over     j
the fence. Police Officers on the fence apparently trying to stop people coming      j
over and what appeared to be skirmishes in various parts of the playing area.        j
Spectators were coming towards me from that end and I assumed that some of these     f
were attempting to get at the Nottingham supporters who were on the kop. I           I
honestly believed at this time that      we were on the point of having to deal      |
with a major riot.                                                         {

some distress but again I thought that they had been hurt as a result of

comprehend, it seemed as though everyone wanted to use the radio at the same


It must have been a full five minutes before I realised the true nature of the
problem and by this time some of my officers had gone forward to assist at the
fence. For myself I helped with the injured giving what first aid I could
and also helped to carry some of the injured to the casualty area which had
been set up at the North East corner of the pithh. I was still aware of the
possibility of fighting breaking out between those on the playing area and
those on the kop. ManJ- of those who had managed to escape from the Leppings
Lane terrace were very angry and abusive to nobody in particular. Some had
been drinking and were in my view drunk. Some were so angry and frustrated at
what had happened that I felt that they were itching for a fight and that they
did nofparticularly care who they fought with.

part of a cordon that nad been placed across the pitch as there still seemed
to be a real danger that rival supporters were ready to clash at the first
opportunity.

When the decision was taken to abandon the game my serial was instructed to
revert to the arranged schedule and that was to supervise the loading of the
Nottingham Forest supporters onto the Transport that was waiting in Penistone
Road North. This was done with no problems and when finally the area was clear
we attended a debrief ingin the North Staid. We were eventually stood down at
about b.30pm and were returned to Woodseats Police Station at about 7.15P®
where I went off duty.

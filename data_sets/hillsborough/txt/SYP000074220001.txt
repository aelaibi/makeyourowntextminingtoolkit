The    entire          serial          and      I were       in    no    doubt          as    to    the    nature          of       our

myself       as      to    their          specific          role.

As    the    build         up t o w a r d s       the       match       commenced,              I left         half       of    the       serial

Liverpool            supporters              were      to    h a ve     access.

Whilst       undertaking                  this    duty,       a    large          number       of L i v e r p o o l        supporters

this    direction.

I saw     several            groups        of L i v e r p o o l        supporters,               much     the w o r s e       for

On    seeing       this       the       undesireable                 Notts     Forest           element      assembled            c l ose

by,    and    the       situation             changed           to    one    of      difficulty.

I then       saw    several             Police        Officers             from Sergeant               B a t t y ’s s e r i a l     eject

about     five      persons             from       these        Notts       Forest         supporters,           a n d as a         r es u l t

the    situation             quietened             for     a short          time.

Throughout          this          time     th e      c r o w d wa s        building           within      the K o p      and      it w a s

fast    approaching                a    capacity           situation.                E ntry and         exit     from     the

immediate          area       began        to      get     harder,          and      as   a     result      I r e q u e s t e d my

entire       serial          to    the     raised          section,           in o r d e r       to    reinforce         the      line      of

officers,          who       were       now     experiencing                difficulty            in a c h i e v i n g    proper

s e g r e g a t ion.

With    the    full          serial        of      10 men,           and myself,              now a l m o s t    isolated           from

other     officers,               I maintained                the     c o rd o n ,    with       abuse      being     s h o u t e d at

us    from    each       side,          as w e l l       as     each       faction         of    fans     shouting        and

swearing       and       gesticulating                   o b s c e n e l y at        each       other.

It    became       obvious             to me       that       t he    situation           would        develop and

deteriorate             further          and       in a n t i c i p a t i o n        I signalled           to S e r g e a n t       Batty

and    his    men       to    come       to     our      assistance.

With    the    new       serial          now       backing           up the       cordon,         the     situation           became

easier       for    the       officers             and myself              and a      double          Police     line     was

formed,       with Police                Officers             standing         tightly           behind      one    another.

Faced        with     this       situation,               it w as         difficult          to    perceive             problems          in

any    other        part        of    the       ground,          but      the    overall          i m p re s si o n was          t h at    of

full      and      capacity attendance                         was      expected.

Radio        transmissions                 were        frequent           and    for m y         part    often went              unheard

and    lost        within        th e      general           noise         and    disturbance                of    the    crowd.

As    the     teams        emerged           from       th e     players         tunnel          the    obscene          chanting          and

melee        continued,              but     by     now,       any attempt             to    eject       unruly          fans,      would

serve        only     to      deplete           th e    l in e    of      officers          struggling             to m a i n t a i n

order        and    because           of     th e      capacity           crowd,       e as e     of    exit/entrance               wa s

severely           curtailed.

A    short      t im e     after          play      be g a n ,    I was         aware       of    an    incident          at

the    opposite            end       of    the      ground,          and    saw    fans,          Police          and    players          at

the    Liverpool              end.

My    initial         reaction,              was       that      there      had    been a          pitch          invasion and             thi.

view      was      obviously              shared        by     the N o t t s      Forest          supporters,             wh o

immediately              resumed           their        hostile           attitude          to    the L i v e r p o o l        supporter

near      me.

1 heard         them       shout          in a n       obscene          manner,        and       push a nd         surge       towards

t h em.       This       situation              c a u s e d me       some       concern          and    I rallied          the      police

officers           to m a i n t a i n        the       line.

This      situation             prevailed              for     s o me     minutes.

As    the     first        of    the       Liverpool             fans      ran t o w a r d s       the       Notts       Forest       end,

(now      known       for       makeshift              stretchers)              I saw a surge                forward       of     fans         on

the    Spion Kop and again                          the      situation           was    disturbiing.

When      the      first        of    the       injured were               carried          off    the       area,       through

access        at    the       base        of w h e r e       I was        standing,          the       Notts       Forest

supporters            laughed             and     cajouled           at    them,       probably          thinking          they

sustained           their        injuries              whilst        invading          the       pitch.

As    th e    fuller          circumstances                  infurled           directly          in f r o n t      of    us,     the

Almost        everyone             of       the       injured        personS\was             stretchered            away within             our

Hhi^lst       these       events             were        taking         place,       two     doc\prs        made       themselves

awarVto            me a n d        I saw          that^W^ey             were    eschssi^ted to         the       field     by P o l i c e

I did        not    see       these          officers           until       much       later,       and     I was       informed           they

had    taken        up    rescue             duties          and     that      Police        Constable           Thornhill           was    now

detained           with       a    body .

As    th e    events          continued.-                many      of    the    supporters            of    both       tea m s ,     were

obviously           shocked                and    sickened           by w h a t      they     had w i t n e s s e d       and many

were    making           their             way    out     of    the      ground        quietly.            However,         the

hardcore           of    supporters                   remained,          some     of    them       showing         little       concern

for    the      situation,                  enquiring           conti n u o u s l y w h e n a n d           if     play w o u l d

resume.            I was          even       asked        by L i v e r p o o l       supporters            where       they     could

After        some       time,          when       the     main       operation          had       ended,     it     became         obvious

to    everyone           that          play was           abandoned            and     all    supporters            were       encouraged

to    leave        the    ground.

When     the       Spion Kop                 was        cleared, I took                my    serial     to    the a r e a of          the

Gymnasium,              where          I     saw        numerous other               Police       Officers.

1 was        there       approached                   by C h i e f      Inspector           Beal,     (FI)       and    instructed              to

take    my     serial             on m o b i l e         patrol,         due    to     sporadic        outbursts           of      fighting

about        the a r e a          of       the    ground and went                 on m o b i l e      pa t r o l    using       call       sign

Once    outside           the          ground,           I went         with      my    serial       to iiiddlewood                   R o ad,

Sheffield,              and       stood          by    for     direction          to a n y        incident.

At    5.50      p.m.      (1750)             that        date,       1 was      instructed           to     return        to

             Hillsborough          stadium    to    stand    down.

             At    7.00    p.m.    (1900)    that    date    I was    instructed     to   go   off   duty and   did

             so    from    the    ground.

             I took       no   further   part      in th e   events   of    that   day.

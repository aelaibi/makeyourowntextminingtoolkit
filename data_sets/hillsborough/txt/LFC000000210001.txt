19 September 1989.



Liverpool Football Club,
Anfield Road,
Liverpool L4.


For the Attention of the Club Secretary



Dear Sir,

I am writing to thank you for the cooperation and assistance that your
colleagues have afforded   local Ambulance Officers in arranging for a
professional Ambulance presence at all major football events from the
start of the 1989/90 season.

I feel that the recommendations and spirit of the Right Honourable Lord
Justice Taylor's report dated 15 April 1989, has been implemented in
Merseyside with enthusiasm and this success has only been achieved with
your assistance.

You may be aware that the Ambulance Service Nationally is facing a
dispute concerning pay awards and as' such, Ambulance Operational Staff
have undertaken an overtime ban.      The effect of this overtime ban
locally has meant that professional Ambulance cover can only be provided
by the use of Ambulance Officers (Managers), all of which are extremely
experienced and qualified   Ambulance Personnel in their own right.
However, in addition to this there is a National Ballot with regards to
Ambulance Officers joining their colleagues on an overtime ban, the
result of which will be known on 28 September 1989.     In the event of
the worse scenario being reached i.e. a total overtime ban, alternative
arrangements will be made to provide Ambulance Officers at Football
Venues during normal duty hours.

In conclusion, I do not expect that there will be a circumstance where
we are unable to provide such cover during the current level of the
dispute and will undertake to advise you of any changes which are
pertinent to yourselves in order that appropriate arrangements can be
made.

I do hope the above proves useful in explaining the current situation
and should you require any further information, please do not hesitate
to contact me.

Yours sincerely,

Detective Constable 282

Main Street, Rotherham

CID Main Street




At 8-30 a.m. on Saturday 1 5 th April 1 9 8 9 I paraded on duty at Main Street Police

Station, Rotherham in full uniform for the football semi final Liverpool v Notts

Forest.         We     were   transported       to    the    Hillsborough       Football         Ground    by    South

Yorkshire Police coach arriving at the ground at approximately 9-30 a.m.

Once    at     the   ground we       took up our      seats    in the stand under               serial    40 for the

briefing        which     took       place    at     approximately        10.00       a.m.       given     by     Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield.

On conclusion of the briefing together with DC Pearson I went to Penistone Road

North,       Halifax Road where our duties                 for that date were             to check and park the

Liverpool supporters coaches as they arrived.

We arrived at the top of Halifax Road at approximately 11.15 a.m. where there was

already one coach parked on the                     dual carriageway.        Coaches       then arrived in ones

and twos throughout the morning.                    As the coaches came to a halt one of the serial

would     go    onto    the   bus     and    tell    the    Liverpool    supporters         to    leave    all    large

banners on the bus and explain to which end of the ground they were to go.                                           It

soon became apparent after the first two or three coaches that this had already

been done by other serials stopping the coaches on the outskirts of Sheffield.

We     continued       with   these     duties       with    the    majority    of        the    coaches    arriving

approximately          from   2.15    p.m.    onwards,       several    of    the    coaches       having       already

unloaded        passengers       outside      the     ground       especially       the    ones     arriving       from

approximately 2.35 p.m. onwards.

ALAN DAVIS                                                                    QOR 3^9

We gradually worked our way down back towards the ground parking the buses until

the last one was parked up at approximately 2.55 p.m.                        The last few coaches had

all dropped their passengers before parking.

Even    as    late    as 2.50 p.m.      there were      numerous numbers      of Liverpool     supporters

rushing to get to the ground and the walls of the gardens on Penistone Road North

were littered with empty beer cans and bottles.

At approximately 3-05 p.m. Detective Inspector Meek who was our serial commander

instructed both myself and DC Pearson to return to Claywheels Lane for the meal

that was provided.            We then started to make our way along Claywheels Lane and had

travelled       approximately        half     way    along    that   road   when   Detective    Inspector

Charles,      who was also in uniform               for that day,    suddenly   shouted for us all to

stop and make our way towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground because it was

believed that there was some trouble at that end of the ground.

We then made our way as quickly as we could towards the Leppings Lane end of the

ground       and when we      came   to the    shops near to the entrance to Leppings Lane we

were ordered by Detective Inspector Charles to form up in our respective serials.

It soon became apparent that not all the members of the serials were present in

our    serial,       Police Sergeant Cloak being missing. We formed up and then marched

towards the gates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

On reaching the gates we saw a number of officers from other serials just milling

around       just    inside   the    gates   and    we were    immediately    instructed   by Detective

Inspector Charles to go down the tunnel into where the Liverpool supporters were

stood.

At    this time I thought that there must be trouble between the fans and that we

were going in to sort the trouble o u t .

As we went towards the tunnel I saw many people coming from that direction into
                                                                                                            PAGE 3
ALAN DAVIS                                                                                 QOR 3^9

the compound between the gates and the tunnel obviously injured and remember that

one ambulance was already in attendance outside the ground.

I    then    went     through         the    tunnel     into    the    Leppings     Lane      standing    area    and

immediately saw down towards my left a man lying on the floor.                                 I also saw people

tugging at the wire mesh fencing perimeter fence                           towards my left and thought at

first       that they were trying to get onto the pitch to fight.

I immediately went            to where        the man was         lying on the floor.           This man was not

wearing a shirt.           I would describe him as being approximately fifty years of age,

five feet seven inches, very heavy build with a beer belly and I think he had a

receding hairline, brown hair.

There were a couple of men leant over him I seem to think one might have been his

son.          When I asked what was              the matter one of the youths replied that he                      was

dead.        I looked      at    the    man    and    it was      apparent that he was         dead.     I told    the

youths around me to help me to get him out of the ground because it was obvious

from the hostility of the crowd towards us that I couldn't do anything there for

fear    of    being    attacked.        The   youth who        I think was       the    son,    he would    be    aged

approximately         25   yrs    told me        that    it was       'no usemate      he's    already dead.'        I

ordered these men to help me carry the man                         from the     ground and we picked him up.

My   intention was         to get him onto 'the               playing area      and I shouted to one of            the

officers       on   the    other       side of    the    fence,Detective        Constable      Hubbard      that     I

wanted       to get   him onto         the pitch.        Detective Constable Hubbard pointed to the

small       gate    leading      to    the    pitch     and    shouted   that     it   was     impossible    to    get

through.      I looked towards the small gate and all I could see was heap of bodies

blocking the gates with other Police officers pulling earnestly to get them off

one another.

I told       the men who were           helping me       carry this man that there was an ambulance

ALAN DAVIS                                                                                     QOR 3^9

already outside the ground at the rear and that they must help me get him back

down    the    tunnel.         This     we did with a struggle                    because      a lot of the Liverpool

supporters      were       intent     on fighting and were                   spitting and shouting at us as we

attempted to go down the tunnel to the compound at the rear.

When we got into the compound it was chaotic with injured people lying all about.

We placed the man on the floor and I ran towards an ambulance and asked one of

the ambulance drivers if he'd got any oxygen.                                 He stated that it had been used so

I   rushed     back     to    where     I'd       left    the     man       and attempted           to give       resuscitation

without success.             The compound by this time was becoming packed with hysterical

people and injured people.                    I persuaded the youths I was with to carry the man

from    the     compound        to     the     outside          of   the      ground      to    await       the     arrival      of

ambulances.           Ke     carried       this     man    outside          the   gates     where     there       were    already

people lying injured on the ground.                           We were then joined by Dr John Ashton of

                                                                              He informed us he was a doctor but

after    looking       at    the     man     we'd       brought      out     said    that      it was       too    late    he was

already       dead.    I could        see Police          Constables          1961    Lawrence        Cl    Division       and PC

Tyler C3       division        also    attempting mouth              to mouth resuscitation on a couple                          of

supporters.

Dr Ashton went to as many of the injured as he possibly could as they were                                                  being

brought from the ground and compound into Leppings Lane.

I   could     see     nobody    of     any    rank       at   the    Leppings        Lane      at    this   time     and on      Dr

Ashton's      instructions            myself,       PC    Lawrence,          PC   Tyler     then      started       to    get   the

priority injured into the ambulances as they arrived.                                     It was very frustrating at

this    time because no one was equipped with a radio and we could not appreciate

what was going on only that we had a number of dead bodies and                                              lots of injured

people at the Leppings Lane all in need of ambulances.

Gradually ambulances        arrived and the     injured were        conveyed to hospital with Dr

Ashton advising us on which were the priority cases.

The    dead   bodies   of   fans were put     to one   side    and eventually   a screen Was put

around them although I could not see the man that I carried from the ground and

assumed that he might have been carried by ambulance.

Police    Inspector    Sykes   arrived   on   the   scene     and   detailed men   to go with   the

bodies to the mortuary.

By this time the       crowd had left the ground in a very orderly fashion with only

the odd few shouting abuse.

Once    the   ground was    cleared I went with other officers to regroup in the stand

and eventually walked back to Claywheels Lane and went off duty at Rotherham at

approximately 7-00 p.m.

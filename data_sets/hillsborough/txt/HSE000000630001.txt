INTRODUCTION

I visited the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the 16th, l"th and 18th of
April 1989 at the request of Mr S Nattrass, Area Director, H & SE, South Yorkshire
& Humberside Area following the tragedy which occurred on the 15th of April 1989.

The initial purpose of my visit was to assist in investigating the incident with
particular reference to the crush barriers.

Other members of H & SE staff present during the first 3 days of the site
investigation are shown on the attached list.

During the visits I spoke to Mr D Perchon (Director - Health & Consumer Services,
Sheffield MBC), Mr P Jackson (SEHO, Sheffield MBC) and Mr M Ford (EHO, Sheffield
MBC).

Mr W Eastwood and Mr R Eastwood of Messrs Eastwood & Partners, Kingfield Road,
Sheffield were also present on site on the 17th of April 1989 and conducted a number
of tests on the crush barriers which were witnessed.

CRUSH BARRIERS

Two types of barrier were seen in the central area, the older type having half 'A'
frames embedded in the concrete steps were reported to have been installed in 1966.

New types of barrier utilizing steel box section support pillars had been installed
at several locations and again the pillars were embedded in the concrete steps.
Both types of barriers carried horizontal tubular type handrails of between 60 and
75 mm diameter. In general the spacing across each handrail between vertical
supports was p f the order of 1.23 m (7 ft 6 inches). Barrier heights varied
between 0.8J and l.l5"m and the corresponding details for each barrier in the
central pen are given in Table 1 and on Ralph Brade & Associates drawing No.1340/02.

Barrier height recommended by the Code of Practice 'Guide to safety at Sports Grounds'
should be a minimum of 1.02 metres with a preferred height of 1.1 metres.
                                        1
A sits plan and end elevation is shown in Fig. 1 which also indicates spacmcs
between barriers etc and confirms the position of the two sections which collapsed
at barrier no. 124A. Similar details are also included in Ralph Brade & Associates
Drawing No. 1340/02.
A sectional view of the entry/exit tunnel is shown in Fig. 2 -and in Ralph Brade &
Associates Drawing No. 1340/03.
A general view of the collapsed section of barrier 124A is shown in Fig. 3 where
it can be seen that both of the horizontal tubes had been severely bent prior to
the bending over and collapse of the leg supports. The bottom ends of the latter
had remained in position in the ground although the right hand front column at the
end of the barrier had broken away a small section of the concrete step.

The failure at the top of the central leg of this section of barrier designated
124A/1 is shown in Figs 4 and 4A where it can be seen that the strap has remained
in position although distorted and the rear leg has t o m from a point adjacent to
the lower bolt hole. The horizontal tubes which were badly corroded in the areas
underneath each strap at the top of the respective pillars appear to have fractured
after the support pillars have been bent over and although the tube section is
considerably thinned it appears to have been capable of carrying sufficient shear
force at the strap positions to enable the vertical pillars to be bent over under
the pressure generated by the crowd.

An inner view of the top end of the right hand pillar at connection 124A/4 (see
Fig. 5) indicates the extent of corrosion underneath the strap and underneath the
pillar head behind the gusset plate and again confirms the tearing mode of failure
from the inner edge of the rear pillar at the section through the lower bolt hole.
The metal angles forming the legs were nominally 50 mm x 50 mm x 6 mm thickness
(2 inch x 2 inch x 0.25 inches).

The fracture of the tube section from connection 124A/4 is shown in Fig. 6 where
it can be seen that the end of the tube has been bent and approximately half its
section has broken away at the time it separated from the pillar connecting strap.

The tube which was originally in position between connections 124A/2 and 124A/3 is
shown lying on the terrace steps in Fig. 7 and the fractures at the corresponding
ends of this tube are shown in Figs 8 and 9 respectively. The grass at the left
hand side of the fracture in Fig. 8 confirms that the tube was recovered from the
pitch after the incident.

The top of pillar 124A/2 is shown in Fig. io where extensive corrosion can again be
seen, particularly at the gusset plate which has corroded through. This connector
had been repaired at some time during its life and it can be seen that a section of
steel tubing had been inserted inside the original tubing. The insert was found
to be 50 mm OD x 35 mm ID and was approximately 127 mm long (2.0 inches CD x
1.375 inches ID x 5 inches long).

BARRIER TESTS

During my visit to the football ground on the 16th of April 1989 I was shown a test
rig used for load testing of the crush barriers under the supervision of
Mr W Eastwood of Eastwood & Partners, Kingfield Road, Sheffield who were the
Engineering Consultants to the Club and carried out routine tests annually on
barriers at the terraces. A general view of the front section of the test rig is
shewn in Fig. 11. The front pusher arms of the rig are designed with various
fulcrum points to enable a single load from each of the main pusher arms to be
distributed to 4 points equally spaced along each section of barrier rail. The



                                      2
main pusher arms were driven forward by a pair of hydraulic rams which were
pressurized from a small hand operated pump unit with calibrated load gauge.
A copy of a calibration certificate for the test rig is shown at Appendix I.

During testing, the forward load on the barrier was gradually increased to a figure
of 1.4 tons in each of the main pusher arms and simulated a load of 400 lbs/ft run
across the barrier as recommended for class A barriers in the Code of Practice
'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds' at Annex C paragraph 1. The forward deflection
of the barrier rail was measured as shown in Fig. 12 and the tests were conducted
in accordance with the Code of Practice.

The left hand end of barrier 136 in the south west pen adjacent to the central pen
was found to deflect by approximately 16 mm in the forward direction on application
of the test load. The barrier recovered fully at the end of the test.

Similar tests were performed on barrier 137 in the central pen area and this was
found to deflect by 13 nrn on application of the test load (400 lbs/ft ran).
Barrier 137 recovered fully at the end of the test.

A further load was applied to this barrier to initiate its failure and at
500 lbs/ft run the deflection was 20 mm which gradually increased to 29 mm. The
barrier recovered to 11 mm and had undoubtedly failed under this load. The
condition of the barrier after this overload test is shown in Fig. 13. Initiation
of fracture/tearing had been produced at the central leg immediately below the
gusset plate and adjacent to the lower of the 2 rivets in the rear section of the
leg as shown in Fig. 14. The commencement of twistinc of the leg is shown in
Fig. 15.

Further tests were also carried out on barrier no. 128 which was seen to have
already been damaged. One of its tubes was bent outwards by approximately 55 mm
and was also bent downwards by approximately 25 run close to its centre. These
tests were again carried out in accordance with the guidance given in the Code of
Practice and at a load of 1.4 tons (400 lbs/ft run) the rail deflected by a further
16 nm and returned to approximately 4 nm. These figures indicate a 75% recovery
as required by the Code of Practice.

The load was then increased to 1.75 tons and later to 2.1 tons where a deflection
of 40 mm was recorded together with a recovery back to 13 mm. This severe over­
load was equivalent to approximately 600 lbs/ft run on the barrier but its recovery
was outside the recommended levels.

CCNCLUSICNS/BARRIER TESTING

The barriers tested were seen to meet the load testing requirements of the Code of
Practice 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds' Appendix C Para 1 for class 'A' type.
The results of tests carried out in July 1988 on the barriers in the central pen
also confirm that the units in this area met the load test requirements of the
Code of Practice at the time of their last test although barrier 124A did not
recover fully until the third of the 3 tests recommended by the Code of Practice.
 (See Appendix II).

SITE DATA

As indicated earlier in the report a site plan to scale is shown in Fig. 1 and a
sectional plan of the entry/exit tunnel is shown in Fig. 2 . These details are also
shown in Ralph Brade & Associates Drawings Nos. 1340/02 & 1340/03 respectively.

(For insertion at Page 4 of my report prior to 'Conclusions/Terrace Layout'.)


 I also examinee gates 3 and 4 leading from the central terrace area onto the

pitch.   These gates were of similar construction and opened outwards to the

left as viewed from the terrace.



The effective width of the gate openings were found to be 0.81 - 0.82 m

 (32 inches   approx) for gate 3 and 0.77 - 0.79 m (30.75 inches approx) for qate 4.

Tne gaps in the low wall at the gate positions were found to be 1.0 m wide

 (39.4 inches! and the walls were approximately 1.07 m high (42 inches) from the

lowest terrace step.



The effective opening heights at the two gates were found to be 2.11 - 2.16 m

(83 - 85 inches).



It was noted that the step configurations at the two gates were slightly

different.    Both level concreted approach areas (plinths) commenced at the

third terrace step level but at gate 3, two risers of 0.165 m (6.5 inches)

and 0.22 m (8.6 inches) with an intermediate tread of 0.480 m (19 inches)
                                $4 i <r
were seen.(See FIGJ16, Negs9W)4 -±06/38).   The approach plinth at gate 3 was

found to be1.185 m (46.75 inches) wide and the step-up      from the lowest terrace step

at each side was 0.340 m (13.5 inches high).
   At gate 4 the level concreted approach area (plinth) again commenced from

   step 3 of the terrace and extended forwards to the wall by a distance of

   0.86 m (34 inches) to a single step up through the gateway which was 0.340 m

   (13.5 inches) high.   The concreted plinth area to gate 4 was 1.125 m (44.25 inches)

  wide and the step-up from the lowest terrace step at each side was approximately

   0.190 m (7.5 inches). See FIGS 17 - 19 which confirm the step arrangements at

  gate 3 and 4.

  PEN CAPACITY



  The area of the central pen was approximately 376 square metres and allowing

  54 persons per 10 square metres gives a maximum capacity of 2030 persons.     The

  rated capacity for the pen was stated at 2200 persons on the drawing of the

  site provided by the club.



  In view of the variations in barrier openings in the central pen, further

  calculations have been made of the pen capacity based on the recommendations        ^ ^

  d i l Para 286 of the Code of Practice.




  The total length of barriers in the left-hand side of the pen behind gate 3

  including the 14.3 metres of the front fence was approximately 45.5 metres,

  giving 45.5 x 3.8 x 5.4 = 934 persons.



 The total length of barriers in the right-hand side of the pen behind gate 4

  including the 14.4 metres of the front fence was approximately 48.3 metres

 giving 48.3 x 3.8 x 5.4 = 991 persons.

The revised calculated capacity for the central pen was therefore 934 + 991 = 1925

persons.

Note:-      Please amend figures on page 1 of my report to read



     'Barrier heights varied between 0.83 and 1.15 m         '



to comply with the revised data in Table 1.

                                          3
          The site plan indicates that many of the barrier spacings were outside those
          recommended by the Code of Practice where it is suggested that gaps between
          barriers should not exceed 1.4 m width.

          The slope of the terrace was found to be approximately 14 degrees and Table 1 on
          page 37 of the Code of Practice recommends a horizontal distance between barriers
          in peak viewing areas for the type 'A' barrier of 3.8 m at a terrace gradient of
          15 degrees. Examination of the site plan confirms that in general the barriers
          vere arranged within this figure and consecutive gaps between rows of barriers
oJ*&C i   were in accordance with Fig. 3 on page 36 of the Code except at the areas immediately
o 37      in front of the entry/exit tunnel area.

          Steps on the terraces were found to be approximately 75 mm depth with 380mm treads.
          These were within the limits laid down in the Code of Practice.

          CONCLUSIONS/TERRACE LAYOUT

          The spacing^of the barriers and gaps between barriers did not fully comply with the
          recommendations laid down in the Code of Practice 'Guide to Safety at Sports
          Grounds'. The areas giving rise for concern were those directly in front of the
          entry/exit tunnel which was seen to have a down gradient of approximately 10 degrees
          for a distance of some 8 - 10 m leading to the terrace doorway openings.

          PEN CAPACITY

          The area of the central pen was approximately 373 square metres and allowing 54
          persons per 10 square metres gives a maximum capacity of 2015 persons. The rated
          capacity for the pen was stated at 2200 persons on the drawing of the site provided
          by the Club.

          RECOMMENDATIONS

          If the area is to be re-used as terracing it is recommended that a full site survey
          of the whole of this terrace and the other terrace at the opposite end of the
          football stadium should be made by a competent authority.

          Where necessary, it is recommended that barrier heights should be increased slightly
          in order to comply with the guidance set out in the Code of Practice 'Guide to
          Safety at Sports Grounds' and any barriers which are found to be suspect should be
          either strengthened or replaced with barriers of the new design. The latter should
          preferably be fitted with flat or box section top rails which should be of the order
          of 100 mm vertical depth. Barriers heights should be a minimum of 1.02 metres with
          a preferred height of 1.1 metres.
          Where necessary the spacing of barriers should be adjusted to suit the
          recommendations given in the Code of Practice and additional barriers should be
          provided across the entry/exit tunnel opening area.

          The arrangements for the control of spectators in the area between the turnstiles
          and the tunnel to ensure that the capacity of the central pen does not exceed the
          rated capacity should be reviewed and amended accordingly. In my opinion the
          capacity of this section should be reduced and at least be rounded off to the
          nearest hundred below the calculated capacity.

FUTURE ACTION

You may wish to arrange confirmation of the above recommendations with the Football
Club via the H & SE Area Staff and the Local Authority as soon as the official
enquiry is completed and if the terrace is to remain, most certainly before it is


It is anticipated that metallurgical work and an engineering assessment of the
design and strength of the failed barrier will be undertaken by H & SE RLSD staff
in due course. This work will be the subject of a separate report.

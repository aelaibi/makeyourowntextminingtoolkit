HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY
NATIONAL FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME

I am writing on Lord Justice Taylor's behalf to thank you for
your letter of 22 November with your paper on a response to the
Football Spectators Bill.  I know Lord Justice Taylor will find
this most interesting.

You kindly invited Lord Justice Taylor, on behalf of the Chairman
and Board of Directors of Queens Park Rangers FC, to join them
for the fixture against Chelsea on Saturday 9 December.  Lord
Justice Taylor was most grateful for that invitation, but has
already made other arrangements for that day, so will not be able
to accept.

                                        Dear Lord Justice Taylor,

                                        National Football Membership Scheme

                                         Following the Hillsborough tragedy, I forwarded a copy of
                                         "A Response To The Football Spectators Bill" incorrectly
                                         addressed to yourself at the House of Lords. A second copy
                                         is enclosed, minus the Appendices, which are available if
                                         required.
                                         The paper was sent to the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary,
                                         the Minister for Sport, the Football Association and League etc.
                                         in January this year. A number of issues discussed relate to
                                         crowd control, misbehaviour and violence in soccer with proposed
                                         remedial measures.
                                         Since the Bill became statute, and the scheme is now inevitable,
                                         I have joined A.D.T. Check-In as a consultant, promoting their
                                         personalised ticket voucher system.  In my view, the system
                                         is effective, simple, low cost and a much better option than
                                         the I.D. computer cards with expensive computer technology.
                                         It is a sensible ccnprcmise solution to the current situation
                                         complimenting safety without resulting in the demise of football
                                         as a spectator sport.
                                         The Chairman and Board of Directors of Queens Park Rangers F.C.
                                         extend an open and cordial invitation to our stadium at any
                                         time. We will be honoured and delighted if you are able to
                                         accept.  Our fixture against Chelsea on Saturday, 9th December,
                                         kick-off at 3.00 p.m., with a probable capacity crowd, may
                                         assist your research.

There are no perimeter fences in our stadium, despite considerable
pressure over the years form the authorities to install them.
We express our sincere support and best wishes in your
important and demanding enquiry.

            I am a qualified            anceman employed by Jfefte Nottinghamshire

            Ambulance Service,     I work from Works                ibulance Station.

            On Saturday 15th April        1989 <150*39)
                                               <15i     , I was on duty at Worksop
            Ambulance Station.

            At 1535 hours on that day we received                      essage from Nottinghamshire

                                             1LH*sborou gh football stadium in
            Ambulance Control to attend the Hi

            Sheffield.

            At the time we received the message we were not informed of the nature

            of the incident we were attending,                 however both myself and my crew

            member had been watching the television coverage of the incident at

            Hillsborough and were therefore aware that we were attending a major

            incident.     We responded as we would to any emergency call.

            I was the driver of an Ambulance               registration number D769 O E T , call
                                                                          PAGE     2
                                                                          S3447

sign 8112,    qualified Ambulanceman                    was my crew member

and attendant.                  ^

On route to Sheffield we were informed by Nottinghamshire Ambulance

Control via our vehicles VHF    radio to change radio channel to channel

one, which is the emergency radio channel used for all major

incidents and having done so to book on with South Yorkshire Ambulance

Control.     My crew member was operating the radio as far as I am aware

he booked on with South Yorkshire Ambulance Control but got no

acknowledgment.     We received no specific up date on route to Sheffield

regarding the incident at Hillsborough,       the radio channel was very

busy generally radio messages were sent out to all ambulances

attending the ground as opposed to specific vehicles.          On route we

were not given any specific     ren^vous     point.

We arrived at the Hi 1 lsbor^rtigh Stadium at 15.50 hours     (1550)   the same

day, we had no probl^Kffs^reaching the ground or gai ni ng access, we

approached the ground from the general direction of the Northern

General Hospital.     On approaching the ground we were directed to an

area of the ground by the Police.

The first area of the ground we were directed to was I believe the

Leppings Lane end of the ground,       this was the end of the ground where

the crush had taken    place.

The Police directed    us to reverse    back into an area of the ground

where a number of other ambulances were already parked.          I cannot say

precisely which area of the ground we were directed to.

Having parked the vehicle we received no form of briefing or

information, we were left to work independently.

In this area there were a large number of casualties,         I would say both

living and dead.

We decided to focus    our attention    on living stretcher   patients.

We removed both stretchers from our vehicle and went past about            three
                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                 S3447
or four ambulances parked behind our vehicle to find patients who

required our services.

With assistance of^Police Officers and civilians                  (fooj^feg11 supporters)

we placed tw^r casualties on our stretchers aijxl^ook them back to our

vehi c l ^ r ^ O n arriving back at our vehirle^we found it to be full of

        casualties.      The oelfple who had positioned themselves            in our

vehicle,    between si/SC and nine in total would not remove>feffemsel ves at

our request.           was necessary for us to obtain^Fblice assistance to

remove tpr&m. Although they showed no v i j n e neee towards us they were

aggi&ated as were their friends who were gathered around, when it

became necessary to remove these people from the ambulance aggression

was shown by some of them and it was obvious by both smell and

observations that a large number of them were under the influence of

alcohol.

Eventually we loaded the two patients we had found onto our vehicle,

both these patients we ascertained had been involved in the crush and

were   complaining of crush type injuries.

I cannot describe either of these patients all                  I can remember is that

they were both white males aged in their               late teens or early twenties.

I cannot recall anything about the clothing worn by these patients.                      I

can say having exami neji^our journey sheet for t h ^ t ,Hav f.h^f. nn>, of

the patients we cja/ried gave a name and addfess of



We leftxlfhe stadium at 1600 ho                 1600) and transported the two

patients by Police motor                escort to the Accij           and Emergency

into their care,       I cannot provide any further details regarding the

patients other than to say in my opinion neither patient was injured
                                                                                             PAGE       4

                 to an extent where a fatality was         likely to occur.

                 We cleared from the Hospital ^arfrn arrived ^Ji*trt<at the Football stadium

                 at 16.31 hours    (1631)       same da^

                 On arriving back^lT^the stadium we returned to the Leppings Lane end

                 of the ground where we were informed by the police that there were no

                 more    casualties at that location.      We were then directed to park our

                 vehicle in Penistone Road and to standby for further instructions.

                 The next instructions we got from the police were to make our way to

                 the gymnasium which was being used as a temporary mortuary.

                 We arrived and parked our vehicle inside the ground backed up to the

                 entrance to the gymnasium (mortuary)        the time I would estimate would

                 have been about    16.45 hours    (1645).

                 We unloaded our    stretchers from        our vehicle and went and stood bythe

                 entrance to the    gymnasium.

                 At a time I would estimate to be about 16.55 hours            (1655) w h i 1st still

                 in this position by the entrance to the gymnasium, a police officer

                 approached us and asked for our assistance         in moving some bodies.        The

                 p o 1i ce officer took us to a whi te Ford Transit police personnel

                 carrier which was parked in the area of the entrance to the gymnasium.

                 The police vehicle had three deceased persons laid on the floor in the

                 rear.    As best I can recall     I think there was a young police         constable

                 also sitting in    the re>arf Df the      vehicle with       the bodies,

                 I placed one of    tbe bodies onto        my stretcher       wL#n the assistance ofa

      <vr        number of polj^e officers.       We took tjr\e bc^dy into the mortuary
    Qt2OUrs0)    (gymnasium^*.    On entering the mortuffry^I would estimate there to be at

                 l e a s t ^ o x t y bodies already laid on the floor.    We were directed to

                 place the body in a space quite        close to the entrance door.
i
                 This body I would describe as being a white male, aged early to mid

    \N h V ff-   twenties, about 5*9 tall,      stockily built with a beer belly.           I think

    & ^ r > n <_ he had shortish hair       I can’t remember what colour.       I think he was
                                                                              PAGE        :
                                                                              S3447
naked from the waist upwards and he was wearing               I think brown trousers

and a brown leather belt,            I d o n ’t think he was wearing any footwear.

After placing this first body in the mortuary I returned to the White

Transit Police personnel            carrier and I saw that only one body was

remaining in the w r m c l e .

This body w a y ' l o a d e d   onto my stretcher and again we Ltflfk it into the

mortua          d were directed to place the body d&titn in a position close

to the first body I had taken in there.              I cannot be precise about

what time this was but I think by this time the police were taking

photographs of the deceased.

This second body I took into the mortuary I can only describe as a

white male possibly younger than the first body and of slim build.                    I

cannot recall anything about their clothing.

The three bodies that were in the van as I have already said were in

the charge of a policeman, all            I can say about the policeman was that

he was very young,          very tall and slim,   he was also carrying a plastic

bag containing a quantity of clothing.

Following this        I had no further dealings with any deceased or injured

per so ns .

The vehicle we were using at time of the Hillsborough Incident was

not carrying a de fibulator            it was equipped as a fully equipped

accident and emergency ambulance,            this equipment   includes bolt

croppers,     hacksaw and crow bar.         No requ^e-ts were made for any of our

equipment other than blankets.

We were cleared from the footfall ground at 17.19 hours               (1719) the

same day and returned to✓worksop Ambulance Station,

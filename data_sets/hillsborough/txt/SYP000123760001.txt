 THERE WAS A LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS ON THE HALFWAY LINE WHO REMAINED

VERY INACTIVE AND COULD HAVE HELPED MORE BUT THERE WERE OTHERS WHO WENT INTO

THE CRUSH AND WERE PULLING PEOPLE OUT.          THERE WAS ALSO A LACK OF ORGANISATION

 IN DEALING WITH INJURED PEOPLE.         PEOPLE WERE NOT GIVING PROPER FIRST AID AND

THE NON-INJURED PEOPLE WERE ALLOWED TO REMAIN HANGING AROUND ADDING TO THE

CONFUSION.

Q34

^THERE     ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THERE WERE VERY FEW POINTS OF ACCESS TO THE GROUND CONSIDERING ITS SIZE AND

THAT OF THE CROWD.      THE POLICE DID NOT MAKE ORGANISED QUEUES OUTSIDE THE

GROUND. THERE WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE MILLING ABOUT AND HORSES IN THE MIDDLE.

BEFORE THE KICK OFF A LOT OF PEOPLE CLIMBED OVER THE FENCES FROM THE PENS

BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH.      NO-ONE SEEMED TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE SITUATION AT THE

TIME.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 COULD NOT GET ENOUGH PEOPLE OUT OF GATE IN THE FENCE ONTO THE PITCH.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE DECISION TO OPEN THE. CONCERTINA GATE WAS RIGHT BUT ONCE THAT

 DECISION HAD BEEN TAKEN THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIRECTION TO THE WINGS.      THERE

 WAS NO SIGNS I COULD SEE TO ALLOW ENTRY INTO THE LEPPINGS LANE END, THAN

^JfROUGH THE TUNNEL FACING ME. THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE REALISED THAT TOO MANY

 PEOPLE ENTERED PENS 3 & 4 AND HAD STEWARDS AND POLICE TO CLOSE THE TUNNEL AND

 DIRECT FANS TO OTHER PENS.


Q1S

 PLAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED AND THUS ELIMINATE PANIC OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY OFFICERS ON TRAFFIC AS THERE WAS JUST A

 CONVOY OF TRAFFIC FROM MANCHESTER TO SHEFFIELD GOING TO THE GAME.

 I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THERE WAS NO CROWD CONTROL AND QUEUES ENFORCED.

JACKET ON,       THERE WERE A NUMBER DEAD BODIES ABOUT ME WHEN THE CROWD CLEARED.

Q49 - DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJUREIS TO ANY     PERSON

 TO FEN POLICE OFFICERS     TO CONTROL THE MASSES OUTSIDE,AND    THEY LOST   CONTROL OF

THE CROWD,,NOT ENOUGH TURNSTILES CAUSING A BUILD OF PEOPLE, THE OPENING OF

 THE GATE TO ALLOW PEOPLE INTO THE GROUND, NOT ENOUGH ORGANISATION OR STEWARDS

 IN THE GROUND TO ORGANISE THE CROWD, THE      DESIGN OF THE GROUND AND THEFENCING

 THE SIZE OF THE EMERGENCY GATE, THE LACK      OF A GOOD PA SYSTEM.

G50 - WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND

 ABOUT 4.20 PH

Q51      DID YOU LEAVE ON   THE DIRECTION OF EITHER APOLICE OFFICER,     ASTEWARD,     A

NO.                                                /

053 ~ DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATION^ ON THE/WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

HANDLED AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED            /

 LACK OF FIRST AID EQUIPMENT, AND WHEN IT V ID     ARRIVE ALL EFFORTSTO HELP     THE

 DEAD AND INJURED WERE HAMPERED BY THE FENCING.        I JUST THINK EVERYBODY DID

THEIR BEST UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU JUST CANNOT PLAN FOR SOMETHING LIKE

 "^S.

 G54 - IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY

 IT WAS NOT JUST ONE THING THAT CAUSED THE DISASTER IT WAS JUST A pHAIN OF

^EVENTS.    THE TICKET ''
                        ALLOCATION
                        ■          WAS WRONG
                                        11 . BUT HAVING SAID THAT I HAD A SPARE
 TICKET SO THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME ROOM IF ONLY PEOPLE WITH TICKETS WERE

ALLOWED IN. THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH POLICE AND STEWARDS ON DUTY TO CONTROL AND

 DIRECT THE CROWD AND EVERYBODY TRIED TO GET INTO THE MIDDLE SECTION.

I                      duty at Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the occasion of                                     the FA

                           Cu^ Semi F i n a l between Liverpool and Nottingham F o r e s t .                    I was

‘                      detailed duty on Serial 1 engaged in the perimeter track.                                 My

                           specific duty was in front of the uncovered seats halfway between the

                           players tunnel and the West Stand.                   S g t . Chapman was in charge of

                           the serial and I was not in possession of a r a d i o .

                           I was stood near to a television camera when at about 2.30pm the

                           cameraman commented on how empty was the part of the ground allocated

                           to the Liverpool supporters at that t i m e .

                           The game had just started when I noticed that supporters behind the

                           goal at the Leppings Lane end of the ground were trying to climb over

                           the f e n c e .   I could see Police officers helping the supporters onto

                           the field at that end of the g r o u n d .             Suddenly there were hundreds of

                           supporters on the pitch.              I tried to help the supporters off the

                           pitch but due to the amount that was impossible.                        Most of the

                           supporters I came into contact with were aggressive and tried to get

                           amongst the Nottingham supporters who were sat in the uncovered seats

                           and consequently had to be advised and on occasions restrained.                                 Due

                                                                                R256

*   *    to the amount of Liverpool supporters on the pitch and the attitude of

         most of them I was fearful of a confrontation with the Nottingham

         supporters in the uncovered s e a t s .   It was clear that many of the

         Liverpool supporters had been drinking and many wanted to fight.

         It was some time before the enormity of the incident was realised and

         my feelings about most of the supporters I came into contact with is

         that I would compare them with enraged a n i m a l s .   I am sure that they

         must have been aware that a major incident had occurred and did very

         little to help the Pol ice and in many cases added to the p r o b l e m s .

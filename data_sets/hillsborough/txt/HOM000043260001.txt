    DISASTERS AND THE LAW


    Thank you for your note of 14 March and for the opportunity to
    comment on this subject.

    The clear message I have received during my first 15 months in
    office is that the public in general - and victims of disasters
    in particular - seek one inquiry which addresses all aspects of
    a disaster.  Such an inquiry should, it has been put to me,
    subsume the functions of HM Coroner and include any technical
    aspects (MAIB, AAIB e t c ) .

    In particular, it has been strongly represented to me that
    anomalies such as a Coroner's inquiry inhibited by a criminal
    investigation (for example in the case of the Marchioness),
    causes great distress to victims and/or their friends and
    relatives.

    This is clearly a subject fraught with difficulty but in
    discussions with victims of disasters and their legal
    representatives, it has been strongly represented to me that we
    need to simplify and standardise existing arrangements for
    inquiries following major disasters.  It seems to me that the
    proposed guidance may not achieve this.

    I ask that you draw on any of the above as you see fit as an
    addition to your own draft note dated 14 March.

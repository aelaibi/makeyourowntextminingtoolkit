  Thank you for your letter of 2 0 A u gust to Paul Boateng ab o u t his reply to your
  Parliamentary Question 2 4 3 in which he s ta te d th a t it w a s open to M embers
  to arrange for their c on stitu en ts to view d o c u m en ts relating to
  Lord Ju stice Stuart-Sm ith's scrutiny of th e Hillsborough d isaster in the
  House Library. You will have received an interim reply from my Private
  Secretary dated 9 November.

  Staff of th e Library informed you th at, although an exception had been m ade
  for th e legal advisers to the Family Support Group, th e y w ere unable to make
  further arrangem ents for a c c e s s by co n stitu en ts. Paul B o ateng’s a n s w e r to
  your Question represented a m isunderstanding of th e situation as w e had
  wrongly a ssum ed th e s e arrangem ents could be continued in relation to future
  a c c e s s by your constituents. This has proved not to be th e ca se , and
  I apologise for th e inadvertently misleading nature of Paul B o aten g 's response,
  which reflected th e s ta te of our understanding at th e time.

  Officials have been in touch with th e Library to explore a possible solution and
  I understand th a t the Library has indicated its willingness to loan th e scrutiny
  papers to a library in Liverpool so th a t th ey can be view ed by your
  con stituents. This is subject to th e papers being returned if, at any time, they
  are required by th e House Library. If you are c o n te n t with this proposal,
  I would like to ask you to make th e n ecessary arran g em e nts to put th e House
  Library in c o n ta c t with a suitable library in Liverpool.

  I am arranging for a copy of this letter to be placed in th e Library of the House.

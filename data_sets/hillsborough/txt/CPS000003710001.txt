  Dear Mr Kennedy

  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

  As a result of our enquiries into the above disaster a number of specific
  complaints have been made by members of the Public.

    In some instances these complaints are against Police Officers and the
    complaints are closely related to the deaths of the 95 people who died.

    It may therefore be of value to your office and to Mr Gareth Williams QC, to
    have an early sighting of the statements or questionnaires made by the people
    who have made these complaints.

    Preliminary enquiries have commenced into these specific allegatioiis and in
    some instances the Police Officers concerned have been identified.

    I trust this information is of value at this time.  Please do not hesitate to
    contact me if you require any further information on the enclosed statements.

    Yours sincerely




    J M JONES

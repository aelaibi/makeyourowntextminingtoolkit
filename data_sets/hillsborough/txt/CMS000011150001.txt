Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to the Prime Minister which has
been passed to this department in view of our responsibilities
for safety at sports grounds.     I apologise for the delay in
replying to you.

There is no dispute that a tradgedy such as that which occurred
at Hillsborough must not happen again.  It's lessons have to be
learned.  Football, including the spectators, must look to the
future.

There is little which I can add to Lord Justice Taylor's very
comprehensive analysis contained in his Final Report on the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster.    He recognised that there is no
panacea which will achieve total safety and cure all the
behaviour and crowd control problems at football matches. He was
satisfied that seating does more to achieve these objectives than
any other single measure.   The Report also identified that all
seated accomodation is consistent with the policies of both FIFA
and UEFA. All seated accomodation is, we believe, a major step
towards creating a better, safer environment in which all
spectators can enjoy the game.     That is why we have supported
Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation and are implementing it.

As you are probably aware the government are making available
£100 million to the football industry over a five year period to
assist clubs in installing extra seats.       The Football Trust
expects to provide clubs with a further £75 milliom over a ten
year period, in addition to almost £26 million provided each year
by television and pools companies.      Consequently there is a
considerable ammount of money available to football clubs to make
the necessary ground improvements.

In his Final Report Lord Justice Taylor recommended that all
clubs in Divisions One and Two of the Football League should
provide seated accomodation only by the start of the 1994/1995
season. The Government has accepted this recommendation and all
the relevant clubs, including Chelsea FC, will be expected to
comply with it.
I hope this information is of use to you.

                                            Yours sincerely

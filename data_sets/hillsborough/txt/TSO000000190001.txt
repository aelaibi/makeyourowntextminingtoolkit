Dear

                  Drawings of Sheffield Wednesday F.C. by Goodhall

       Thank you for your letter of 15th June.

    I have spoken to Andrew Collins regarding the drawings and if necessary he
will refer to the Brade's drawings and will indicate to the Judge that he should
do the same.

    I think Counsel were using the Police drawings as they were of a convenient
size.

                                     Yours sincerely,

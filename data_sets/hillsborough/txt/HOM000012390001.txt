HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY FINAL REPORT


Mr Mower's note of 26 January suggests that the media should
be given CFRs as early as we reasonably can - probably late on
Monday morning.

If Ministers decide that the media should be given CFRs late
on Monday morning I would propose that we lay the report
before Parliament at 11 a.m. and that CFRs are not issued
earlier than that.  Moreover, at whatever time CFRs are
released to the media I would propose that they should also be
handed at the same time to the leading Parliamentary figures.
As well as Mr Hattersley, Mr Howell, Mr Blunkett and
Sir John Wheeler we would now suggest, after consulting the
DOE, that CFRs go to Mr Gould and Sir Hugh Rossi, as Chairman
of the Environment Select Committee.

We have also been approached for an advance copy by
Mr Tom Pendry MP, who is the Chairman of the All-Party
Football Committee.  Given the indignation caused to MPs if
they are approached by the media with quotations from a report
which they have not yet seen, I    suggest that he too receives a
CFR and that, at the same time,   we give CFRs to
Mr John Carlisle MP as Chairman of the Conservative Backbench
Sports Committee and to Mr Steve Norris as Chairman of the
Conservative Backbench Home Affairs Committee.

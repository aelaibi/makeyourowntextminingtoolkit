 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED   r
AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I DON'T THINK THE POLICE REACTED VERY WELtV EVEN THOSE STOOD AT THE FRONT OF

THE PENS DID NOT TURN AROUND TO SEE WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS     |

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT IF THE TUNNEL HAD BEEN SEALED BY STEWARDS OR THE 4-IKE PRIOR TO THE

 GATES BEING OPENED THE TRAGEDY WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED.    THERE IS ALSO AN

OBVIOUS REACTION FOR FANS AS THEY COME THROUGH THE TURNSTILES TO HEAD STRAIGHT

      THE TUNNEL AS THAT IS ALL YOU SEE, THERE ARE NO VISIBLE SIGNS TO SHOW YOU

WHERE ELSE TO GO.

 THERE WERE I               THERE WAS A MASS OF PEOPLE PACKED INTO THe^ AREA. B E T W E E N ^

 THE TURNSTILE BLOCK AND THE OUTER IRON GATES, WHICH WERE OPEN.            I WAS SUPRISED       <

 BECAUSE THOSE GATES WERE CLOSED LAST YEAR <1988)         <000088).   THERE WERE A LOT

 OF PEOPLE MILLING ABOUT INSIDE THE TURNSTILES AREA.

 <318

 WHAT POLICE DIRECTIONS DID YOU WITNESS OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES?

 THERE WERE TWO MOUNTED POLICEMEN STANDING OUTSIDE THE IRON GATES WHO WEREN'T

 REALLY DOING ANYTHING WHEN I FIRST SAW THEM.         I SAID TO ONE OF THEM AREN’T

 YOU GOING TO DO ANYTHING, HE DIDN'T REPLY.         I SAW ONE POLICEWOMAN WHO WAS

 TRAPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CROWD, SHE COULDN’T HAVE DONE ANYTHING.

  DID YOU HAVE DIFFICULTY ENTERING THE GROUND.      IF YES, GIVE BRIEF REASON.      j

  A      BECAUSE, THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION, EVERYBODY WAS PUSHING AND SHOVING TO

  TRY AND GET TO A TURNSTILE.      WHENEVER I GOT ANYWHERE NEAR TO A TURNSTILE,

  THE CONSTANT PUSHING AND SHOVING WOULD MOVE ME AWAY AGAIN.        IT WAS JUST A CASE   !

  OF FORCING YOUR WAY THROUGH.

 1 SAW PEOPLE BEING PULLED UP ONTO THE TOP OF THE TURNSTILE BLOCK, BUT I THINK

 THEY WERE PROBABLY BEING PULLED FROM THE CRUSH OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES.        I

 COULD SEE THAT THE LADS BEING PULLED UP HAD TICKETS IN THEIR HANDS, SO THEY

 HAD NO NEED TO ENTER THE GROUND ILLEGALLY.

 YES.    I RETAINED THE STUB PORTION WHICH I STILL POSSESS.

    WERE PUT ACROSS THE HALF WAY LINE AND LEFT THERE FOR SO LONG.        THE AMBULANCE

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A

 STEWARD, A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN

 ACCORD?

 FOLLOWING AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED.

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A

 CRIMINAL OFENCE?

 NO


G17

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON    THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK THE DESIGN OF THE PERIMETER FENCING HAMPERED THE RESCUE

 ATTEMPTS.

 INITIALLY I THOUGHT THERE WAS A LOT OF CONFUSION HOWEVER ONCE THE

 TRUE SITUATION WAS APPARENT,   I THINK EVERYONE INVOLVED DID THE

 BEST THAT THEY POSSIBLY COULD.

 f t

 IS THERE ANYTHING       YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

                                   WAT WHOEVER GAVE THE ORDER TO OPEN

 UP GATE 'C* TO RELIEVE THE PRESSU r K^UTS)IDE THE TURNSTILES MADE THE

 CORRECT DECISION, HAVING BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CRUSH OUTSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES,   I AM SURE THAT IF THE GATE HAD NOT BEEN OPENED UP PEOPLE

 WOULD HAVE DIED OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

Q49

DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU     CONSIDER     WAS AFACTOR   INTHE   DEATHS,   OR

THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

THE DESIGN OF THE PENS PREVENTING THE ESCAPE OF FANS TOO MANY PEOPLE WERE

ALLOWED INTO THE CENTRAL PENS, WHILE THE OUTER WINGS REMAINED VIRTUALLY

EMPTY.

THE DIVIDING FENCES WHICH FORM THE PENS PREVENTED PEOPLE FROM SPREADING OUT
                                                                                               !

^ t S O N TICKET HOLDERS WHO WERE USED TO HAVING A REGULAR SEAT AND CAN ENTER THE

GROUND SHORTLY BEFORE THE KICK OFF.        SOME SEASON TICKET HOLDERS WOULD HAVE HAD           j

STANDING TICKETS AT HILLSBOROUGH AND WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INEXPERIENCED FROM

THE POINT OF VIEW OF STANDING ON THE TERRACES.        THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN USED

TO THE LARGE CROWDS BOTH OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE GROUND.          SUCH PEOPLE MAY NOT

HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE DANGERS OF     STANDING     AGAINST BARRIERS OR BECOMING

TRAPPED UP AGAINST THE FRONT FENCE.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 AS STATED PREVIOUSLY,       I THINK THAT THE INEXPERIENCE OF PEOPLE WHO W E R E N ’T

 USED TO STANDING ON THE TERRACES,        I.E. SEAT SEASON TICKET HOLDERS, MAY HAVE

 PUT THEM IN D A N G E R .

       THE DIVIDING FENCES AND THE FRONT PERIMETER FENCE NOT BEEN THERE,          THE

 FANS WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SPREAD OUT ACROSS THE TERRACES, PREVENTING A

 CRUSH.

     YES.   IT WAS DIFFICULT TO GET TO A TURNSTILE DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

 NO.        WE WERE ONLY AWARE OF THE CENTRAL TUNNEL AND SAW NOTHING TO INDICATE THE

aW     eR    A COUPLE OF MINUTES,   IT BECAME VERY PACKED AND UNCOMFORTABLE, BECAUSE

OF THIS I SUGGESTED THAT WE TRIED TO GET A POSITION AT THE REAR OF THE PEN.

WE THEN MADE OUR WAY TO"TN£ REAR OF THE PEN AND TOOK UP A POSITION IN THE

RIGHT HAND CORNER AT THE REAR    PEN THREE.  THE ACCESS GATE TO PEN TWO WAS
                l      t £L

UP A CROSS THE CENTRE LINE OF THE PITCKJ

THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION TO THE SPECTATORS IN THE GROUND, ABOUT WHAT HAD

OCCURRED AND HOW SERIOUS IT WAS.

054

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

AS A GENERAL OBSERVATION,     I CAN SAY THAT IN PAST YEARS AT MANCHESTER UNITED

GROUND, OLD TRAFFGRD,     I HAVE BEEN PLACED IN A SITUATION WHERE AFTER TRAVbLLING
                                                                            PAGE

  b V TRAIN THE POLICE HAVE HELD US AT THE STATION UNTIL VERY LATE AND HAVE

  ESCORTED 3000 OR MORE SUPPORTERS TO THE GROUND WHERE YOU ARRIVE AT 2.45PM

  (1445), THIS SORT OF ACTION CAUSES SUPPORTERS ANNOYANCE AND PANIC BECAUSE

  THEY WORRY ABOUT MISSING THE KICK OFF.     ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT THE CASE ON

  THAT DAY IT DOES SUGGEST TO ME THAT POLICING OPERATIONS IN GENERAL NEED TO BE

  REVIEWED.

      The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for
   the Environment (M r. Colin Moynihan): The
   am endm ent would not allow the membership card
   to carry a photograph if the holder could be clearly
   identified by other information held on the card.. If
   the membership scheme is to be effective, it is
   essential that, as far as possible, the m embership card
   is im pervious to forgery and fraud. The working party
   that I chaired, which reviewed the main principles o f
   the schem e last summer, looked carefully at the issue.
   It concluded that a com bination o f a photograph
   and electronic readability offered the best means o f
   restricting adm ission to matches to holders o f valid
   card;;. If the card did not meet both those
   requirements, the opportunities for abuse would be
   unacceptably wide.
     I am aware that the football authorities doubt the
   need for a photograph. Their representatives on my
   working party made that clear but— this is the key
   point— it was the view o f the representatives o f the
   Association o f C h ief Police Officers that a photograph
   was essential to the integrity o f the scht^ne, both to
   deter fraud and impersonation and. Jo aid
   identi fication if the holder were involved ;n disorder.
   That is the central plank o f the arguments that m y
   hon. Friends and I have been putting forward in
   resisting the am endm ent, and it is that advice which
   we believe shouid be taken on board throughout the
   Committee.
       My hon. Friend the M ember for Luton, North (Mr.
   Carlisle) made a good speech— if I m ay say so, all
    the speeches from Conservative members o f the
    Com m ittee     were outstanding—in        which     he
    mentioned the importance o f non-transferability o f
    cards being a condition o f the scheme. That is
    essential, and it will be an important feature o f
    the early deliberations o f the Football Membership
    Authority when and if it is set up, subject to the will
    o f Parliament.                                    <
       I am glad to be able to respond to that point and
    to re-emphasise and reinforce the fact that the view
    o f the police and the considered opinion o f the chief
    police officers should be o f paramount importance
    in our considerations. If we consider wisely the
    opinion o f the police, as m y hon. Friends have done,
    we shall reject the amendment.

ON MY LEFT BUT I BELIEVE THEY WERE TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM THE CRUSH.                                    I

Q18

 052

    DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 YES WHILST I WAS SITTING IN THE LEPPINGS LN TERRACE AFTER THE TRAGEDY A

    PHOTOGRAPHER CAME IN AND STARTED TAKING PICTURES IN PEN 3.         I SAW HIM TAKING

 PHOTOS OF THE DEBRIS, POLICE INTERVENED, BUT THREE FANS SMASHED HIS CAMERA.

    I ALSO SAW A PHOTOGRAPHER BY CORNER FLAG FROM LEPPINGS LN SIDE,         IT WOULD BE

^         THE RIGHT,   PULLED A COAT AWAY FROM THE HEAD OF A DEAD BODY AND STARTED

 TAKING PHOTOS,         AS BEFORE A FEW FANS TRIED TO GET HOLD OF HIS CAMERA TO STOP

 HIM.        I THINK THEY GOT HOLD OF HIS C A M E R A .

    G53

    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

    INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

    I FEEL THAT THE TANNOY       SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED AS SOON AS A PROBLEM

 BECAME APPARENT,         TO DIRECT PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE CRUSH BACK DOWN THE T U N N E L .

 THE RESCUE SERVICE IE FIRE/AMBULANCE TOOK THEIR TIME COMING.

    I ALSO SAW A LONG LINE OF POLICE ACROSS THE PITCH NOT DOING ANYTHING.

^DID         SEE MANY POLICE TRY TO BREAK THE BARRIER DOWN,     SOME I THINK THOUGH

 WERE IN SHOCK AND NOT DOING ANYTHING,


Q 19
 Q54

    IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

    I WISH IT TO BE NOTED THAT THE TOTAL LACK OF DIRECTION FOR FANS BY BOTH POLICE

 AND STEWARDS,         BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND, WAS A VITAL FACTOR IN SO

 MUCH AS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMPLE SPACE IN AREAS 2 AND 6 HAD SUCH

        BETTER HELPING TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THE PENS.     IT ANGERED THE FANS AND

 CAUSED SOME RESENTMENT.

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I FELT WHEN WE GOT TO THE GROUND THERE WASN'T ANY POLICE CONTROL AS REGARDS

 FORMING QUEUES AND CROWD CONTROL.

NUMBER OF PEOPLE S k i y C ENTERING PEN THREE.

ONLY MINOR BACK AND RIGHT LEG.

NO

GAS.      DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED,      IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

YES PLEASE SEE ATTACHED STATEMENT

G49.      DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,

OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

®THINK      THAT THE FACT THAT THE POLICE ON THE PITCH WOULD NOT OPEN THE GATE

FROM THE PEN TO THE PITCH,

030.      WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

I DO NOT KNOW,      IT WAS AFTER DALGLESH HAD BEEN ON THE T A N O Y .

NO

G^p,      DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

H A N D L E D , AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

I THINK THAT THE POLICE OFFJP^RS THAT WERE PRESENT DID NOT DO ENOUGH^^^JWef

SEEMED TO BE STANDING ARfltJND NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO.         THERE O H f W T   SEEM TO BE

ANY ONE IN CHARGE OF fHE POLICE.         POLICE OFFICERS EVENTUALLY CAME INTO THE PEN

AS WE WERE REMOVING BODIES AND TRIED TO GET EVERYONE OUT.

054.      IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

I)      WHY WERE THERE NO BARRIERS OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES F U N N E L ING PEOPLE IN?

II)      WHY WERE THERE NO POLICE INSIDE THE GROUND TO STOP PEOPLE GOING UP THE

TUNNEL?      SURELY SOMEONE COULD HAVE RADIOED THROUGH.

                                                                             (SSL 131

 III)     WHY DIDN'T THE POLICE OPEN THE GATE AND LET THE PEOPLE OUT OVER THE TOP

 WHEN IT MUST HAVE SEEMED QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THERE WAS A MAJOR PROBLEM.

 IV)     I ALSO THINK THAT ONE OF THE   FACTORS MAKING PEOPLE ARRIVE LATE IS THAT

 PEOPLE CAN-NOT GET A DRINK    IN THE   GROUND AND CONSEQUENTLY THEY STAY IN THE

 PUBS UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE BEFORE      GOING TO THE GROUND.

 V)     ANOTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTOR   IS THE FENCES DIVIDING PENS IF THERE WAS A

 CRUSH AND PEOPLE COULD MOVE TO THE SIDE A PROBLEM AS BAD AS THIS WOULD NOT­

 ARISE.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK THE POLICE WERE SLOW IN REALISING WHAT WAS HAPPENING INSIDE THE PENS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK THE ORGANISATION BOTH OUTSIDE AND INSIDE THE GROUND WAS VERY POOR.

 THE DECISION TO GIVE LIVERPOOL THE SMALLER STAND AND ALLOCATION OF TICKETS WAS

 A BAD DECISION,         THERE WERE NO MEDICAL FACILITIES TO DEAL WITH THE SIZE OF THE

 PROBLEM,,       I SAW ONE ST JOHNS AMBULANCE MAN USING A BROOKE *S AIRWAY INCORRECTLY,

 "ft WAS ALSO A ST J O H N ’S AMBULANCE MAN WITH AN OXYGEN CYLINDER WITH JUST A

 TUBE WITH NO M A S K .

 THE EQUIPMENT THERE WAS P O O R . THE PEOPLE I ATTEMPTED TO RESUSCITATE NEEDED

 SUCTION TO REMOVE THE VOMIT.         I SAW NONE OF THIS EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE.

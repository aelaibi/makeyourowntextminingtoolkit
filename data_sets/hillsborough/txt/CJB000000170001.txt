    Dear Sir

    As Secretary of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, I would
    like to advise you that our Committee have met with
    representatives of Liverpool Football Club and are arranging
    for a permanent Memorial to be erected beside the Shankly Gate
    at Anfield.

    There are also plans for a full Memorial Service to be held
    within the grounds of Liverpool Football Club on 15 April, at
    approximately 3 pm. Full and final details will be forwarded
    to you at a later date.

    The Chief Executive of Liverpool, Mr Peter Robinson, has asked
    that I make contact with you about this.

    I would be grateful for your comments on    thismatter.

    Yours faithfully




    Barry W Devonside

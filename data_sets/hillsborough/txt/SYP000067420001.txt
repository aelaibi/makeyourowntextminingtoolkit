              or other         sporting        event        then we make a r r a n g e m e n t s      for a special            train

              subject         to a v a i l a b i l i t y    of    rolling      stock and     police      resources.

              tickets         sold    can then be used on normal                       service    trains      then a joint

             d e c ision     is taken to         cancel    the    proposed special        train.     The    train       if

              it is then       c ancelled        the tickets       sold are     h on oured for the        normal

             service        trains.

             The a r r a n g em e nt s    for such special          trains are      that of New Str eet        the

             through special             entrances.        This    is only     in New Street       station.        I

             cannot     speak      for the       rest of the       country.

             If there are          no special       trains       running    for sporting      events a nd     it       can

             be seen that          there are       large    numbers       of suppo rt er s   on normal      service

             trains     then B r i t i s h T r an sp or t Police will           travel    on the train       if they

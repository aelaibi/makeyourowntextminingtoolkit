                 By about       2.30 p.m.          the crowd had s t ar te d             to buiId up outsid e                the

we r e ge n e r a l l y s ho ut in g and singing.              At this point          I be gan       to smell

alcohol       in the air,            and saw em pty cans and beer bo t t l es be ing kicked

under     the tu rn s t i l e s as fans came             through.

At about       this time         I saw a couple          of fans      jump over one turnstile,

ob vi ou sl y wi th o u t paying,             and    they wer e bo th      lost    in the crowd            in

seconds.       Severa l       fans st art ed c l im bi ng          onto   the roof       of the

t urn sti les and ma k e             their    way al on g the top of          'B ’ gate.           Several      of

us sh out ed at the m to get                  down,    but they said they we r e             g e tt in g

crush ed outside,               At    this time       I thought      it was     the normal          pushin g

and shovin g g oi ng on o u t s i d e .               The fans on the roof we r e g e s tu ri ng                  to

others on the g r o u n d outsid e                  to climb up and         join t h e m , and several

did.      Several       jumped dow n on the             inside and were           lost    in the c r o w d .

There were a lot of fans                     still    stood about         inside and we        tried to

move     them o n , but         they    just st op pe d a few yards a w a y , as               if they

we re n' t    i nt er es te d      in the g a m e , w h i c h was due to start at any time.

The number of fans on the                     turns til e roof i n c r e a s e d , and       we were

askin g      them if they had a t i c k e t , and              if so,      they could        jump down          and

be a d m i t t e d .    Out     of about half a d o z e n I shoute d t o , not                     one had a

ticket.        The     fans on the roof were b e c o m i n g a g i t a t e d , saying that

fans wer e be in g cr us he d               outside    the g a t e s , but ag ai n       I thought         t h a t :-

(a) They we re          tryi ng to be ad m i t t e d wi th ou t           t i c k e t s , us ing    the crush

       as an e x c u s e .

(b) The       'crush'     was        just    the normal     one as so ci at ed wi t h any F .A.

       Cup S e m i - F i n a l .

An Inspector           them cl imbed onto the              roof of the turnstiles,                  and    in

do ing    so broke off a pi ece of g u t t e r i n g .                He made all        those on the

roof climb dow n and as they d i d , they w< re asked to pr o d u c e                                their

as the m a j o r i t y on the roof d i d n ’t have                     their own.        Several      argu me nt s

then ensued b e t w e e n Po l ic e O f f i ce rs and pe op l e                   trying    to pass tickets

Police C o n s t a b l e       2634 R i c h a r d s o n ask ed hi m        if he had a ticket,             to

escort h i m o u t .

For    some r e as on we s ta rt ed              to go arou nd         from near gate           ’B ’ to gate

’C ’ . al t h o u g h I r e al is e n o w that this was                   the w r on g direction.            As we

we sa w a large c ro wd surge towards us from gate                                 ’C ’ and r e alised          that

it had been o p e n e d .                The re was a loud c h ee r/ ro ar           from this crowd and

by the speed           they we r e e n t e r i n g and           the n u m b e r s , it w a s    obvious     that

who had op e n e d           it,       only a mass of sh ou ti ng          fans.     B e c a u s e of t h i s , we

let the fan g o , Police C o n s t a b l e R i c h a r d s o n               r e m a r k i n g , "Have this one

The area behi nd                the turns ti le s was very c ro wd ed wi t h                fans going       to

the s t a n d s , and           for a few m i n u t e s         I stood    just    inside       the turnstiles,

still w a t c h i n g pe o p l e com in g           in.      For some reason I then wa lk e d

towards       the rear of the Le ppings                    Lane stands,         towards     the central

tunnel       and saw p e o p l e com in g back out,                  away from the         terraces,       some

As    I approached            the rear of the central                  tunnel,     fans c o m i n g out said

that     there was a           lot of pu s h i n g        on the terraces,          and I had better get

in and sort           it o u t .         I then e n t e r e d    the t u n n e l , w h i c h wa s   reasona bly

empty and went               to the en tr an ce of           the terrace,         but c ou ld only see

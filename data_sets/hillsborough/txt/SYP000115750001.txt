              At    about         ten      past       eleven       (1110)       we    went       to    stand        on    the    turnstiles

              ready       to      search         the    fans.           I was    stood         with     PC     43 K i r k b y        on    the    third

              turnstile             along        and    waited       for       people       coming       that        were       going       into       the

              west     stand.              At    first       there      was     a very         steady        stream        of    people          coming

              to    the      ground.             It    was    mainly          families       at       this     time       with       quite       a fe w

              turnstiles             we     checked          the    tickets.          A    lot    of    people           were    unsure          of

              where       they       were        going       and    I gave       them       the       directions           as    to       where       they

              needed         to     go,,        I started          searching          the      fans     wh o    seemed          to    be    in a

We were        given a large               plastic: dustbin               to    put any       property        in which we

confiscated.              I took a sc r e w d r i v e r            off     of ojne young            lad who       said he

was an e l e c t rician.                  I also       took a       large       banner      from another young

lad.        We also       confiscated             quite       a lot of, cans            but    it was m a i n l y        pop,

not    beer.        Ne    con t i n u e d    searching             in this manner             until       about    half

past    two       (1430)     when         it began to get more                   crowded.

As    the    crowd       inc r e a s e d    it began more                d i fficult     to search          people

although          I did try.              I saw a couple             of    people       (lads       of about       twenty)

             with o u t     tickets         by one        person handing              his     ticket       in at the

         tile and         someone          else       bobbing       down behind him and                   they    both went

  irough at         the     same      time when the                turnstile        opened.          At    this    time       it

was    too     cramped        to a c t u a l l y get          to them to do anyth i n g                   about    it.

f ro i t : about    tw e n t y      to three          ( -1440)     the    crowd o t peopie             seemea      co

increase          even more          until     it was         just a solid mass                of    people.         I got

pushed away from the                      turnstile a n d became                 sort    of w e d g e d against              the

wall.        People       began       to    panic, and one w o m a n               became      hysterical,

scr e a m i n g    because          she    c o u l d n ’t move.           Sirnail children were               getting

lifted above             people's          heads        because they were               getting trampled on                   so

intent       on getting             into    the ground.              After       a while       I lost sight             of

most     of the       other F:

wall,       the    pressure         against        me was          tremendous,          so much        that      I could

feel    my s t o m a c h      bending and              it was a struggle                to breath.            I could

b reath      in but       not       out and just           could not move at all.                         People were

beginning          to get a n g r y about               the      crush and were             swearing at me              saying

and

looking          after          yourself.              People          were very             frightened               in the        crush and

were     panicked               into     pushing           even        more       to    try and         get       out.        S o m e h o w one

of    the       other       PC's       g r a b b e d me          and    pushed          me    through           the     turnstile,to

get    out       of       the    crush,,          I looked             at    my watch when                 I got        to    the    other

side     and         it w a s     about       3    or 4 m i n u t e s             past       t h r e e .(1503/1504).                 1 d i d n ’t

know wh ether               the       teams       Nad      kicked           off    or    not.         I spoke           to an

inspector             on    the       other       side       of       the    turnstiles              and    told        him what          it

was     like         on    the    outside.              He       realised          the       situation            but    there       was

nothing          he       could       really       do a b o u t         it.        People        coming           through          the

turnstiles                were    still       shouting                about       the    crysh and              children           were

still       being          passed       over.

We    stood          on    this       side    of       the       turnstiles             for    about        five        or    six

minutes.              People          were    corning            up    to    us    a/king       where           to    go.      They       h ad

come     through            the       West    stand turnstile                      pith       red     tickets           which       1 think

were     for         the    Leppings          Lane         en d       standi/ig         part.

" S h e ’s dead,               h e ’s d e a d "        etc.       and       just       picking           them    out.            I c a n ’t

remember             anything            else      about          looking             into      the      pen.        There         were       some

officers             pulling           people          over       the       fences          and    trying            to rip        them      down.

At    first          I helped            a few         people          that/had             walked        out        to sit        on the

pitch         because           they        were       really          daeed          and    confused.               1 then          s a w PC

him.          We     went       to     the       carjyff of            the       pitch..           He     w a s n ’t b r e a t h i n g          so

about         twelve,           very        s m a ll       ana    slim with                blonde        wavy        hair.         He was

wearing             jeans       and      a Liverpool                  top,,       The       only      thing          he h a d      on hi m         was

a ticket             for       th e    match        in his            b ac k     po c k e t .      I. put       him      in      the     recovery

position             and       stayed          with        him    in     case         he    stopped           breathing            again.             He

was        deeply         unconscious              and          didn* t         respond         to m y        talking         to     him      or

punching             his       ears      to      bring          him    round,,             A Liverpool           fan      came         up     to        me

and        said      " H e r e ’s his            programme"              but      1 told          hi m    I d i d n ’t t h i n k             h e ’d

really           want      it     now.

Some        of      the    fans        began       ripping             down       the       wooden        adverts         from around

the         p i t c h to       us e    as      stretchers              and       eventually              they     came          up   to me w i t h

The         board was           very        wobbly and                I felt          as    if my        legs    were           g o i n g to       give

dead.         He     dragged          a few more              people           to: h e l p      him     but      it    wasn't           any        use.

a    coat     over      his      face       and        I thought           what       an     undignified               way        it wa s          to

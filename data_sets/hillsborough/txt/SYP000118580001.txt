                  I was     in charge       of Serial        number 28 of the Semi Final detail                             at

                 I held the only            radio for our serial                     an d   liaised w ith other memb e r s

                 In charge of my sector was                    Inspector S e l w o o d of E Division.
                                                                          1 '



                 After     initial      b r i e f i n g at tf|te ground we were d e p l o y e d to our

                 positions.          Ta k i n g   up p o i n ts;about           11.45am.
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            R 2 19

By this time the first s u pporters were                          beginning          to arrive       in small

numbers.         By    12.30pm       large numbers of            persons were m a k i n g           their way

along L e p pings Lane             towards the ground.                 M any of them we re drinking

from cans an d bott l e s and               carafes of wine,              and I saw one y outh

drinking       direc t l y from a 7 pint               ’party can*.            M any suppo r t e r s were

as k i n g   for the nearest            pub a n d o f f - l i c e n c e and whether              they were open

to s u p p o r t e r s .

B y about 2p m there were                hundreds         of s u pporters        in L e p p i n g s Lane

standing an d sitting                on walls        etc.,    drinking,        many were w a l k i n g up

a n d down asking            for      spare tickets          fro m others but           there were

a p p a r e n t l y very few          spare tickets          for sale.

1 spoke to m a n y Liv e r p o o l          s u pporters and some Notts.                   Forest

s u pport ers who had tickets for                     the L i verpool         end.      Most were         f r i endly

and    in good humour a l t h o u g h some we re d r u n k .                    I a d v i s e d some      groups

initially that             they      w o u l d not   be    p e rmitted to enter the ground either

w i t h alcohol        or drunk       but    as      larger    numbers a p p e a r e d          it became a

wa s t e d exercise.

To the best           of my k n o w l e d g e there were          no      incidents       of disorder          in

the v i c inity of my serials                 points.         The m a i n     problem was          one    of

litter w i t h        li t e r a l l y hundreds       of beer a n d       pop cans and bottles and

chip papers           etc.    st r e w n about.

This was       com m e n t e d upon to me by an elde r l y                  lady     resident       of

Bi ckerton R o a d who             said she was 84 years and had lived there most of

her    life a n d had never            seen such a mess              of   cans etc.        at any        previous

game or event at Hills b o r o u g h .

By about 2 . 3 0 p m the            bulk of the s u p p o r t e r s who had been m i l l i n g about

in L e p pings Lane           d r i f t e d toward and        into     the ground.              There was then

a   lull of about            ten minu t e s w hen         it a p p e a r e d that there were              very few

supporters        left outside           the ground.

At about 2 . 4 0 p m there was a s u d d e n surge                     of s u p p o r t e r s    coming along

Leppings Lane             to w a r d the ground,          m a n y of w h o m were       running.           Some

were    still     carrying          cans and bottles               of beer and       I saw some           pouring

it onto the         road as they were moving.                        At this time        I was still           on

the barrier at B i c k e r t o n Road.                 A short       time    later     I became aware,              via

radio messages,              of    problems at the L e p p i n g s Lane entrance.                         X step p e d

out    into L e p p i n g s Lane and             could see the entranee and that                      it was a

mass of bodies             from the t u r n s t i l e s         right    back to the       road an d that

m ore and more were adding                     to   it.        There were      still    large groups

m a k i n g their wa y to the ground a n d                      I a t t e m p t e d to slow down several

groups who were              running       by pointing            out that there was          nowhere         for

t hem to go.           The      crowd and crush at the turnstiles was                         clearly

v isible     but they           c o ntinued      regardless         to   rush and add to            it.     The

m a j o r i t y of these          persons were male               in late t e e n s , early twe nties age

groups.        The re was          very     1 i ttle shout i ng or          chant ing and all             seemed

intent on g e t t i n g           to the ground.

I then heard,             via     radio,     of m o u n t i n g    problems     inside     the ground.              1

h eard a call          for      officers       to the      perimeter        track but thought              that     it

was    fighting/pitch              invasion.          The re were        no trans m i s s i o n s    to the

contrary.         A fter a short             time there was a             radio mess a g e      for       further

a s s i s t a n c e at the ground.               I then made my way to the L e p p i n g s                  Lane

entrance where             I joined a number               of other       officers.        There w ere still

some    s u pporters mill i n g about                 outside       the gates and a few were                  still

arriving.         As      I a r r i v e d some      people were starting to                leave the ground.

Some were o b v i o u s l y sho eked and upset an d were                          crying.      Others were

a b u s i v e and began shouting at the officers                            outside.       Comments         such as

“Black     bastards",             "You've done         it this time",             "You're to blame for

this",     "You s h o u l d all           be a s h a m e d "      "You sh o u l d all    be   locked up",

"Why a r e n ’t y o u        in there doing something,                    you only want        the money"

“Y o u ’re only g o o d for kick i n g m i n e r s " ,i n t e r spersed w i t h the usual

e x p l e t i v e s and    profanities.             The officers          outside      the gate       including

myself were held outside                     to moni t o r      the    crowd leaving.            I believe           the

instruction was               given v e r bally by C h i e f           Inspector Purdy,            who was          the

only senior            officer        I saw at that           time.     After    the    call     for

assistance           there was         very little           of an intelligible           nature       passed by

radio.         Persons were            tran s m i t t i n g over      each other       i n t e r s p e r s e d by

silences whe n no               instructions           or d i r e c t i o n were given.          The officers

outside        the gr o u n d      including myself             had no    idea w h a t s o e v e r     what was

ha p p e n i n g    inside.        Initially persons who were                   shouting and swearing

at us were s p o k e n to firmly and t h r e a t e n e d wit h arrest,                           however,           as

more      reasonable          persons      began to emerge and explain to us some of

what had h a p p e n e d         inside we        began to a p p r e c i a t e    the     reason for the

anger       d i r e c t e d at us.

into the N o r t h stand about 5pm.                          Only    then did I begin to             realise the

scale of the             problem       inside    the gr o u n d and       I saw the         profo u n d effect

which      it had on some of m y colleagues.                           We were    left to ponder               for

sometime           before      we were    given a short de-brief and                    a d j o u r n e d to

Cl a y w h e e l s Lane        to re-muster our serials and await                       transport         to

return to Doncaster.

The m o o d of o f f icers was              very quiet,             some were    obviously moved               by the

events and were               close to tears.

We    returned to D o n c a s t e r and               retired from duty at 7.45pm.

            an d     injuries arnd deaths      on this    scale   cannot     be catered for         in day to

myself were          held outside          to m o n i t o r    the   crowd leaving.              I believe

the    instru c t i o n was        given verba l l y by Chief I n spector Purdy,                         who

was    the    only    senior       officer     I saw at that               time.     After     the   call      for

assistance          there     was very little           of an intelligible                nature     passed

by radio.           Persons      were     transmitting          over       each other        interspersed

by silences          when no i n s t r uctions          or d i rection were             given.       The

officers       outside        the ground,         i n cluding myself,              had no idea

whats o e v e r     what was       h a ppening     inside.           Initially       persons      who were

shouting and          swearing at us were               spoken to firmly               and    threatened

with arrest,          however,          as more    reaso n a b l e     persons       began to emerge

and explain          to us       some    of what     had happened            inside     we began       to

a p preciate        the reason          for the    anger       directed at us.

When    the rescue          o p eration was        complete          all    officers      were    then

called       into    the N orth Stand about               5.00       pm.     Only     then did I begin

to realise          the    scale    of the prob l e m          inside       the ground and I saw the

p r o found    effect       which       it had on some          of my colleagues.                We were

left    to ponder          for    sometime      before        we were       given a short         de-brief

and adj o u r n e d       to Clayw h e e l s    Lane    to j?e-muster our              serials       and await

transport         to return        to Doncaster.

The mood       of officers          was very       quiet,       some       were    obv i o u s l y m ov ed by

the events          and were       close    to tears.

We r e t u r n e d to Don c a s t e r      and r e t i r e d    from duty at 7*^5              pm.

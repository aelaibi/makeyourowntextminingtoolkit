   Dear Sir

   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

   I refer to your letter of 20 August 1990requesting copies       of West Midlands
   Police composite Album 1 and 2.

   Although these photographs and other documents and statements were available
   for the Public Inquiry of Lord Justice Taylor the situation changed at the
   commencement of the criminal investigation.

   That investigation, supervised by Captain E N Taylor of the Police Complaints
   Authority is still on going and all relevant material is subject to that
   investigation.

   I am not therefore in a position to release these photographs atthis                time.
   However, if the situation changes I will   of course contact you.

  Yours faithfully




  M J FOSTER

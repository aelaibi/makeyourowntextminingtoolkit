             In early April of this year                     I asked ________ to obtain tickets for my

             wife and I to attend the semi                        cup final match at Hillsborough between
                                                                      PAGE        2

Liverpool and Notts Forest,   and to arrange the trav'e 1 to and from the

match on that d a y , being the 15th April   1       50489) .



At about 9.30 am (0930)   on Satu^Qay 15th April     1989 (150489), my

father in law gave            nd I a lift to the church in Nuneaton

where we were to meet the supporters    club coach at around 9.45am

(0945).



There were about   12 other supporters waiting to board the      coach at

this stop.



Once on board the coach which was on time we sat at the front offside

which is our regular spot as we know a few of the other supporters who

sit nearby by name.    The other supporters on the coach we know them as

regulars but not by name.



The   coach then stopped at Hinkley where about 6 to 8 persons got on

and then it stopped in Leicester where about another six got on.            The

coach then carried on to Sheffield.



We arrived in Sheffield around 1.45pm <1345)     to 2pm (1400) and were

directed by Police a couple more stops on the motorway to join us with

the Liverpool   supporters corning into Sheffield.



The   coach eventually parked up at about 2pm    <1400) at the spot where

all the other coaches were parked which was about a mile from the

qround.


Once we had stopped           stood up and spoke to us all to, meet bacn

at the coach after the match and not to hang about,        its his usual
                                                                                                                                            PAGE

                                                    je r




        We then got off the coa^fi and walked towards the ground, we walked
                                         fO\i \o,
        with three others                                                      and      We had tickets for the

        North stand seaVing and so arrived at the turnstiles                                      in Leppings Ln at

        about 2 . 3 0 pm   A 1430).      I saw that there we re a lot of people around

        the turnstile with people who appeared not to have tickets as they

u | c   were asking passers by if they had ''spares” .



        Once at the turnstile there was no problem we got straight                                                             into the

        ground and found our seats without/any problem.



        It was about 2.45pm (1445) wharf*? we sat down and I remember mentioning

        to my wife when I looked at/Leppings Ln terrace that the middle two

        pens were full and that            tjnere          was room in the two outer pe ns .
                                                                              £-

        After kick off I ikua^me aware that there was a problem in the Leppings

        Ln terrace but I was unable to tell at that time what was wrong.



        It was not until the game had been stopped and the players were

        walking off the pitch that I saw a lad in his early twenties walking

        along the track from the Leppings Ln st^afid with a St. Johns

        Ambulanceman and passed u s , he had/what was a serious arm injury,                                                                    I

        could see then that people wejoe climbing out of the stands onto the

        pitch and up into         Ifte   seat.             above tHe terraces then as time went on

        I realised it j^as seri^Os as arnbula/ces came in and                                     1    saw people being

        carried on str tcha/s who we re                                  ®iously d e a d ,

                            *W(
        We were advised over the tann^y to say where we were as they did not

        want the emergency s e r v i c e y h a m p e r e d and that the game was abandoned.

         We eventually left the ground at about 4 . 3 0 pin <1630) and made our way

         back to the coach arriving there at about 5.00pm        <1700).   At the coach

         most of the others were back and we had to wait for others to return.



         It was then that we realised that two of our lads off the coach were

         missing,      I d o n ’t know the lads personally only by sight and that they

         had been      at the back of the coach on route to the game.



         The    coach wai ted until about 6.00 pm <1S00) when we we re advised by

         Police to carry on without them.

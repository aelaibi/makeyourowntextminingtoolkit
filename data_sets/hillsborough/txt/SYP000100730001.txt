other       of     the        Sergeant.s              My       first          concern            of    the    day       was        that       within

my    area       there         were       some            public           houses           a peri.         The     pubs       were        quickly

filling          up    with         supporters.                 One        of     these          pubs,       The     Royal          on

Penistone             Road      quickly          filled             up     inside           and       supporters              started          to

gather       on       the      footpath          outside              to      consume            tneir       drinks.

Initially             this      presented             no       problem            and       the       supporters              predominantly

■from N o t t i n g h a m ,          were       good       natured,               I    saw       no    real       reason           at    this       t im e

to    stop       the     drinking           outside             and        decided            j>..st to       monitor              the

situation.               By     about        1300         hrs       there        were         at      least       100     persons             outside

this     pu b,        nearly         all    of       which          were        consuming              alcohol.               It    was       near

this    time          that      S g t . Thornpson               and        myself           warned          the    landlord              of    the

Royal       for       selling         cartons             of    beer          and      lager          to    fans     from          the     boot       of

his    vehicle           which        he    had       parked             on     the      -footpath           directly              outside          his

premises.              He      was    stopped             from        doing           this       and       instructed              to    move       his

vehicle          which         he    did.        PS       Tnorripsort           remained              with    some        officers             to

monitor          these         premises.

At    this       time         Penistone          Roaa          was       very         busy       with       fans.         I    noted          some

Liverpool             fans      on    foot       ana       in       vehicles             were         approaching              the       ground

from    my       area         but    t h e re    was       no       trouble            at     this         stage.        However,              many

fans    were          making         their       way       to       the       ground          carrying            bottles           and       cans     of

Deer,       iager        etc.,        arm       my    men       were          adv ise ci         to    instruct          as        many       fans     as

possible          to     either           drink       or       dispose           of      altonol            before        reaching             the

Around       1400        hrs        I heard          PS    ihompson              on      my      ratio,       calling              for

Supporters              only.          The       premises           were     cleared        of       all       customers,              and        the

landlord            strongly           advised           to    close        fo r    the    afternoon.                 This        he    did

and     no     complaints              arose        from       this     incident           to m y         knowledge.

By     this     t i me       Penistone            Road        was     crowded        with       supporters                and,      generally

speaking,            most        were       in    good        humour        and     well    behaved.                 There        were        a

few     Liverpool             supporters                still       approaching            the       ground          with      the

Forest         f an s     bu t    I saw no             trouble         as    a result           of    th is.          It     is     true          to

say     many        f an s    had      been       drinking,            but,        apart    from          the      Royal       incident,                I

saw n o t h i n g         further           that       was     solely        drink        related.

Sometime            prior        to    1500       hrs     at     a guess           I would       say       ten       to     three

(1450),         I heard           some       conversation               on    my     radio       when          officers           were

requesting              the      start       of     the       match     to     be    delayed.              It      seemed         this

request         wa s      made        as    there       was     a large            build    up       of    fans       at     Leppings

Lane,         many      of w h o m         would       not     get     into        the    ground          in    time        for     the

match         start.          I heard            concern        expressed            over       this,          and    some        mention

of     ’p u s h i n g     and     shoving*.               Just        before        1500    hrs       I heard             excited

voices          of      police        officers            on    my     radio       r e q u e s t i n g g a t e s to          be     opened

at     th e     Leppings            Lane         end.     I heard           one     voice       say       w o r d s to        the      effect

if     the     gates         were      not       opened,         the    police           would       lose       it    and      a serious

incident            was      probable.              The       radio     was        distorted,             with       transmissions

drowned         by      background               noises        an d    screams,           but    I did          hear        a request

for     all      officers,             including               those    going        for    meal,          to      g et     into       the

ground         as    quickly           as    possible.                Although           radio       reception              was     poor,          it

w as    quite         apparent             to me        from     the    tone        of    voices          t ha t     could        be    heard

t hat     something              serious          was h appening.                   With    some          of m y s e r i a l s ,          I

cannot          remember            who      or    how many,           I quickly           made       my       w a y to       the      ground,

arriving            about        1510 h o u r s .

police        officers             on    the       pitch.              The        noise inside                  the    g r o u n d was

t rer n e n d o u s , almost,            deafening.11 was                     not         possible           to       tell            what had

happened          but        I assumed             there         had    been          a    "pitch          invasion".                It    was       not

until       an    excited           police          officer            ran       towards             me    snouting           words        to       the

effect        " t h e r e *s       lots       d ea d     o ve r t here"               ( indi ea ti n g           the     area        at

Leppings          L a n e ) that             I realised            a    really             serious          incident            had       taken

place       in    the        West       Stand       at      Leppings             Lane,          and,       it    was     more        than       a

public        order          incident.

With      some        other        officers            1 made          my    way          over       to    the    West        Stand        and.      saw

horrific          scenes           of    injured            persons          l y ing , o n           the    pitch        and       persons

inside       the        stand       being          crushed         against                the       wire    perimeter              fencing.

Many     officers             were       doing         -what       they           c o u l d to        get       people        o u t by

also     many         officers           milling            around          in    a       complete          state        of    shock        and

bewiIderment, particularly                                  some       younger             officers             that     1 saw.            Many

fans     were         running           around         in    a    near       state             of    hysteria.            Some        of    them

wre    screaming              out       that       the      Police          ewre          at    fault       or    that        we     were       not

doing      enough            or    just       generally            wanting                to    "have       a    go"    at     us     for

whatever          reason.               1 myself            found       the       whole             scene       difficult            to    take          in

quickly          and     for       several          moments            took       time          to    take       it    all      in.

The     crowd         itself        seemed          angry.             The       Liverpool                supporters            in    the       Norin

Stand       in    particular                 were      jeering          at       the       police,          especially               those

officers          who        were       facing         towards          them          from          the    perimeter            track.              In

turn,      tne        Nottingham              supporters               were       jeering             at    the       Liverpool            crowd,

obviously             unaware           of    what       had      happened                and,       perhaps,          blaming

Liverpool             supporters              for      stopping             the       game.           I found          the     atmosphere

prevent          it     as    it    was       my    opinion            the       Liverpool                fans    were        not     happy

with     officers             facing          them       from      the       track             and    any       pitch        invasion           would

supporters                had       been      drinking            but        those          I encountered                were       more

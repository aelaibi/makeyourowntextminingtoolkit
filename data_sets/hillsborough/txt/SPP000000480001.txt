                                                              Date:      O S     November 1997




                     O r

I am writing to you about the timetable for my scrutiny of evidence relating to the Hillsborough
football stadium disaster.

When the Home Secretary appointed me to carry out this task I said that I expected to be able
to let him have my report by the end of this year. My work on the scrutiny is now well
advanced. I have looked in great detail at all the points which have been put to me by the
Family Support Group and others. Unless important new evidence is presented to me I
believe that I shall be able to keep to the timetable which I outlined when I began and I would
like if at all possible to do so. I think this would be in the best interests of all concerned.

I thought I should let you know that I have now written to Mr Dorries, to the Family Support
Group, to the Chief Officer of the South Yorkshire police, and to others whom I have
approached in the course of my scrutiny saying that it would be a great help to me if any
further evidence which parties would like to submit could be at this office by close on Friday
5 December.

My Secretary has of course written to you (two separate letters) asking for your observations
on various points following our discussion here the other week. I shall of course endeavour
to take account of what you say if it arrives later than 5 December. But it would help if you
could if at all possible let me have your comments by then.

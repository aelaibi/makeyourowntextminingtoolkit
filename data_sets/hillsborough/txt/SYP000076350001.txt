vari ous     parts of the         pens and behi ncl rne the re were two whi te rna].es i n

years old and the other was                  late 3 0 9s.

barrier and being bent over                  it.

The one,      who was off my left shoulder,                    wai/just screaming and

shouting,       "Please,       please",      and the o b r      who was right behind me       was

saying,      "Come on,       help us mate,          pyfsh us    back".   All this was being

push him backwards and aJT the same time                        1 leaned backwards       into him.

He, at the same t i m e r i e d              to push himself backwards by using my

back,,     He couldn't jfise the barrier because he was. bent over                        it too

kick his feet free,             and he was          wearing a dark blue sweatshirt.

I tried at one stage to get my hands down for others by my side to get

their feet on so that               I could help them get up and over the crowd,

                Qn S a t u rday 15th April             1989      (150489)      t o gether with

                           and                             I went     to the Semi           Final       between Liverpool

               and N o t t i n g h a m Fo re st      at    the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football           Ground,        Sheffield.

               We went         to the L e p pi n gs       Lane    entrance       to the      ground a rr iv i ng at about

                ten     past    two.      (1410)

               We split         up then an d         1 went with                              into the ground under the

               West S tand t hr o ug h the tunnel                 and    into Pen 4.             We made our way down

                the     terrace      close    to the       perimeter       fence         between      pen 3 and Pen 4.               We

               at first         stood up agai ns t a barrier,                  but as       it got more            packed,      we

               m o v e d to     in front      of the       barrier,      to make          it easier          to move around.

               The      crowd s te ad i ly        built    up and     it got more           packed to a point were we

                could not move at all.                    I was    in d iscomfort           at the time            but not      in any

                real     pain.
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            52061A

I heard the            roar as the teams          came      out       but   I could not      see the        pitch,

because       of the      pressure       from the       crowd.

The    people        on the     barrier       behind me s t ar te d screaming              for help so          1'

tried to help them                by pushing back,              but    could not do a n y th i ng          because

the    pressure was            too much.

As this was all               going    on we star te d to shout               to the P o l i c e m e n on the

pitch side of the               p erimeter      fence      to    let us out and open the                  gates,

but    I r e a lised that            they were    not      going       to open them,

I then thought            I have       got to get out            because      I thought      X w o ul d get

k illed      if 1 d i d n ’t,        1 saw                        going over       the heads         of    people

like swimming            over     them towards       the        perimeter      gate,    w h ic h    I now know

is Gate 4.

I shouted to                    to try and get me out,                  but he    c o u l d n ’t because       he

was    still         lying across       peoples     heads.

After a short            time     I realised this was                 the only way out         so    I did the

same as                 and went       over    the heads         of the      people    packed       in the

crowd.       I tried to get            to Gate 4 w hi ch          I could see was          now open.           I got

there      fairly       quic k l y and grab be d hold of the                  top of the frame around

the gate        opening.

I tried to force my w ay t hro ug h and a P o l i c e m a n grab be d me and tried

to force me            back    into    the    crowd saying            "You fucking      twat."        I was

d et e r m i n e d    to get    out    of the Pen,         said nothing          to the officer            in reply

and just        pushed my wa y          past him onto            the    pitch are a to save myself

because        I was     not    going    back    into the         pen.

I stayed on the               pitch    looking    for my mate and then helped                       carry dead

and    injured         people     on the hoardings              to the other       end of the         pitch.

I w o u l d d e s cribe        the P o l i c e m a n who    tried to        push me back           into the

crowd and swore at me as about 30 years,                                tall wit h no hair at all               on

his head,            like Kojak,       I saw this because               he had not got a helmet                on

and    I am     pretty        sure    he was w ea ri ng         glasses.       He was    d e f in a te l y a

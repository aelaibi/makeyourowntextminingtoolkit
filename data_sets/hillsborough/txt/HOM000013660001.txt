   HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

   I refer to the telephone conversation between Mr Waghorn of this
   department and Mr Walker on 7 September in which Mr Walker informed
   us that Mr Boys Smith's letter of 31 August will be discussed at
   the forthcoming meeting of your finance and general purposes
   committee on 15th September.

   I understand that there could be some concern over paragraphs 3 and
   4 of Mr Boys Smith's letter, which cover the costs of the criminal
   investigation announced recently, it may be helpful if I clarify
   our position slightly prior to Friday's meeting.    It was not our
   intention to give the impression that we would not agree to the
   special payment on these costs, although we did consider that some
   of the work already undertaken by the West Midlands Police could be
   used in connection with the criminal investigation at no extra
   cost.

   As Mr Boys Smith said, the criminal investigation costs were not
   included in the original offer of special payment.  What we need
   therefore is further information on the likely scale of the new
   criminal investigation including an estimate of the number of
   officers involved, the possible length of time required and the
   additional cost.   Mr Walker did mention that it could be in the
   region of 50 men, over a period of up to 6 months at a cost of
   about half a million pounds.
E.R.

   Provided that the proposed costs are reasonable, then the special
   pa y m e n t would extend to  them   as  part   of  the   necessary
   investigations by West Midlands arising from Hillsborough.

   In the meantime we very much hope that your authority can commence
   payments to the West Midlands in respect of the costs of Lord
   Justice Taylor's Inquiry itself which the West Midlands Police
   authority have already invoiced for.   It seems unfair to leave the
   West Midlands waiting for reimbursement of these items.  On receipt
   of further information concerning the criminal investigation costs
   we will let you have a substantive reply on this point as soon as
   possible.

     HILLSBOROUGH: COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE




     I refer   to   the    telephone   conversation between Mr    Waghorn of this

     department and Mr Walker on 7 September in which Mr Walker informed

     us that Mr Boys Smith's letter of 31 August will be discussed at the

     forthcoming meeting of your finance and general purposes committee

     on 15 September.


                                                                            3
     I understand that there could be some concern over paragraphs J& and

     4 of Mr Boys Smith's letter which cover the costs of the Criminal
                                       Lt               i/f 3
     investigation announced recently^ and I wioh 'to clarify our position

     slightly prior to Fridays meeting.         It was not our intention to give

     the impression that we would not agree to the special payment on

     these costs, although we did consider that some of the work already
undertaken by the West Midlands Police could be used in connection

with the Criminal investigation at no extra cost.



As                                    jation    costs       were      not        included     in    the

original    offer    of     special    payment,       &6— sfeatod -by M e — p^iii ffTnittr— we-

ttian'm app-rgrHa-t-ft further information on the likely scale of the new

criminal     investigation          including        an    estimate         of    the    number       of

officers    involved,        the    possible       length    of    time      required         and   the

additional    cost.         Mr    Walker    did mention        that     it       could be      in the

region of 50 men, over a period of up to 6 months at a cost of about




Provided    that     the    proposed       costs     are   reasonable/ then             the   special

payment would extend to them as part of the necessary investigations

by West Midlands arising from Hillsborough.

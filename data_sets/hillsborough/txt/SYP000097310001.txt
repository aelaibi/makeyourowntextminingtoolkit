                                HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

          My Staff Officer Superintendent Hewitt has drawn to the
          attention of ACC Mervyn Jones the articles that appeared in
          today's Guardian newspaper which quote at some length from
          the ACPO Guide to Policing Football.

          I am most concerned that this document should now finds its
          way into the hands of the press, containing as it does such
          sensitive information about intelligence gathering and
          resource   deployment.    This   disclosure  has   not  been
          authorised by me as Chairman or any member of the ACPO
          Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events, to the best
          of my knowledge.

          Moreover,  its style and context       seem to me to be
          deliberately calculated to prejudice the work of your
          Inquiry team as well as that of Lord Justice Taylor.

         The document was circulated to all Chief Constables in
         England and Wales, and the Commissioner of the Metropolitan
         Police, on the 21st October, 1987 as an update to the
         Football Section of the 1982 General Guidance on Public
         Order for Senior Police Officers.     Copies have also been
         given to each Force's Football Liaison Officer who attended
         the annual meeting of 1st and 2nd Division representatives
         at the end of the last football season.




                                                            Continued/2
For your information I enclose copies of the Guardian
newspaper, the ACPO Guide to Policing Football and the
letter signed by the Secretary of the ACPO Sub-Committee
which accompanied its circulation.  I should be obliged if
you would bring this matter to the attention of His Honour
Lord Justice Taylor.

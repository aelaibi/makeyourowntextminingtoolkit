                                                         17th April, 1989


Mr. R. Shepherd M.P.,
The House of Commons,
London.




     I sun writing this letter, both as a Liverpool supporter who was standing in
the Leppings Lane End of the ground where the tragedy occurred on Saturday the
15th April, and as a Doctor who tried in vain to resucitate fans on the pitch.
This is my view of the causes of the disaster and the inadequacies of the relief
operation,

     I arrived outside the ground at approximately 2.15 p.m. There were many
thousands of fans milling around and in the area of the turnstiles I had to enter
through (B. Section), there was no orderly queueing. There appeared to be a total
lack of policeooordination in organizing the fans. In fact I witnessed two police
officers on horse "back appearing to argue with each other. They retreated and
appeared to leave us to it. By this stage supporters were being squashed against
the turnstile walls, fans were desperately appealing to the police to create some
sense of order. Then I witnessed the police opening an exit to the side of the
turn stiles and we flooded in with the pressure of the supporters behind us, without
having to present our tickets* At the time I felt that the police had no option
but to open the gate as a dangerous situation was developing outside the ground,
where serious injuries were inevitable. The situation should never have got to this
stage, there should have been adequate crowd control with sufficient police numbers
outside the ground to ensure that the supporters entered the turnstiles in an
orderly fashion.

     Once inside the ground there was a lack of stewarding supporters to different
areas of the Terrace. I myself was initially channelled towards the central area,
as this appeared to be the only entrance onto the terracing, but I was lucky and
remembered the advice of friends and turned away from the central area to make my
way to the side of the Terrace which was not over crowded*

     When I reached the terracing it was obvious to myself and to many supporters
around me that the central area was seriously over crowded as fans tried to climb
over the barrier or climb up to the seating area above them.

SURELY, REALIZING THIS, THE OFFICIALS COULD HAVE POSTPONED THE START OF THE MATCH
TO ALLOW SOME SENSE OF ORDER TO OCCUR.

     What happened next, I am sure you are only too well aware of. The supporters
were crushed and killed because the only exit was a small gate in the perimeter
fencing. Surely a method could be devized where the fencing could be rolled aside
or collapsed to avoid such tragedy.




                                                                 /Realizing
Realizing the disaster, I made my way onto the pitch to offer some help. There
was chaos, with a total lack of facilities. The first ambulance did not appear
to arrive for at least 15 minutes. There was no defibrillator, no suction
equipment to clear the casualities airways, and there was an inadequate supply
of oxygen equipment and stretchers. Above all there appeared to be no one in
charge of organizing the disaster, I heard later that this was mainly done by
another doctor who was also there as a supporter. There was also no announcement
over the P.A. system for at least 45 minutes, during which time the Nottingham
Forrest supporters were obviously oblivious to the fact that a tragedy had
occurred and was simply accusing the Liverpool fans of rioting onto the pitch.
Many Police Officers appeared confused as to what they should do but I have
nothing but praise for individual officers and supporters who offered their help
in attempting to resucitate the injured and dead.

     In summarizing the causes of the disaster may I list —

     1)    Lack of police co-ordination outside the ground,

     2)    Lack of stewarding inside the ground,

     3) Poor design for entry onto the terracing,

     4) Inadequate exits through the perimeter fencing onto the pitch,

     I also feel that where such football matches are played again, serious
thought needs to be given to the resuoitation equipment available at the ground
and that a clearly laid down plan of dealing with such a disaster is known, and
a Senior Police Officer allocated to over look the situation.


                                                 Yours sincerely,




                                                 Dr. Colin K. Flenley

Dear S i r / M a d a m ,

                   Re: HILLSBOROUGH T R a GEDY.             15th April 1 9 8 9 .


Unlike m a n y of those who have been p o ntificating on the above disaster,!                           write
as one who was there - in a position very close to the action.I am a N o t t i ng h a m
Forest supporter,but I am writing as o b je c t i v e l y as p o s s i b l e.Seated on the ,front
row on the side of the ground adjacent to the trouble area,i                                witnessed scenes
such as I've never seen before,nor ever hope to see again.This included seeing
        »K.
people "’dying just               a few yards          away,and one would like to express the utmost
sympat h y with the               families of          the dead and injured.
M y i m m e d i a t e i m p ressions were that I was sc a r e d , sickened and saddened.
SCARED be c a u s e at first I thought that this was just another case of
h o o l i g a n i s m . M a n y supporters were on the p i tch,and one thought of it becoming
another           "Heysel”.
SICKEN E D as I watched L i v erpool supporters running across the pitch - surrounded
by the de a d , d y in g          and i n jured        - still trying to stir up trouble.I           can never
u n d e r s t a n d that.I        came to the          comclusion that they must be either           mad or drunk!
P eople h a v e said there was no hooliganism.                        xhere was!      I have never seen such
h a t r ed o n p e o p l e ’s faces.Only a strong police cordon across                     the pitch,plus a
l a ck ' 0 f ’r e sp o n s e from the Nottin gh a m supporters, p r e ve n t e d this trouble
spreading. All of those officers in the cordon could othe r w i s e have been helping
the sick and dying.
H e r e I m u s t point out that the behaviour 0 f the. :\ottingham supporters was
i m p e c c a b l e , a n d should be commended.So             too was that of the great majority of
the L i v e r p o o l    fans - but - the Liverpool               Club must aecept that they do have
a real h o o l i g a n problem which must be curbed.
S A D P l N a D as I saw a young teenager - probably about 1 4 years old - die about
h yards -away.-i watched as the police gave him mouth                              to mouth resuscitation.
H e was sick and seemed to be reviving - only to flop back deadi lOthers were
dying just a little                 further away.Being a ccompanied by my daughter and a
12 years old boy i was constantly worried both                           for their safety and the effects
on them o f what they were seeing.
CQNCbUsiUN:             .Last        year,!     attended            the   corresponding       match, when          there       was   no

t r o u b l e . (,i   have      in     fact    been      a    football      supporter       for   over    L\.<j   years    j


Over     the     past       few      days     i have         been    trying    to   think   of    the    differences            between

the     two    matches.it              seems    to      me    they    are:-

1;.    PULiiCil'iG:             Last year the police o p eration was brilliant - i wrote to them
afterwards to commend them.This year,for some unknown reason,it was just the
opposite.
2;.    A L O O M U L . as I walked to the ground,! did so by the same route as most of the
Liverpool supporters.!                        saw hundreds of them drinking inside and outside public
houses.There were prominent notices near the ground advertising, MFood and drink
within 5 minutes of the g r o u n d 11 1 did not arrive at the ground until 2.3Upm ~
those i have mentioned were still in the pubs!                                        This accounts               for the great
pressure at the last moment - caused by people who                                           could have been drinking
until 2 . /+5pm and after,and thus more likely to be violent.!t was not them but
the inno c en t ones who got there early who were crushed by the l a t e - c o m e r s .This
seems to me a significant change                                from last year, when. pubs had to close earlier -
n o w they can be open all hours.This                                 trouble is one of the spin-offs we never
envisaged when that legislation went                                      through.Une   feels that many publicans made
a quick,large profit that day - but at what cost?                                            incalculable!!!

SUGGESTIONS            jO   K   t   H ji; PUl'URii;:-

lj.      That to help prevent incidents like the Hillsborough Tragedy,all sales of
alcohol be banned 'Adthin a radius o f 5 miles of football grounds and for 2 hours
before the start of any                        ' a l l -t i c k e t 1 match and that it be fully understood that
it is illegal to carry alcohol on coaches and trains                                              to such matches.
2 ).     That we reconsider the removal of fences.This                                       could increase the amount
of h o o l i g a n i s m . K a t h e r ,these should be replaced by the ij'rench-style gates,or
grounds restricted to a GO t 6 d spectators.
3;.    I have never been convinced about the value of I.D.                                           Cards,but if these will
really help remove                     the hooligan element,then by all means let's try them.

 Dear Sir,

 I am writing this letter as I feel I owe it to all those fans
 who died or who were injured in such tragic circumstances at
 Sheffield Wednesday's ground on April 15th.

 Firstly I would like to relate to you my experiences at the same
 ground last year in the semi-final between Liverpool and
 Nottingham Forest.   My 11 year old son, his friend and his
 father and myself obtained tickets for the Leppings Lane part of
 the ground.  To get into this part of the ground, after passing
 through the turnstiles, we had to pass through a narrow tunnel
 beneath the West Gate stand.   There were many, many fans heading
 for this tunnel and it became very congested many yards before
 entering the tunnel.   There were no police officers or stewards
 to control and marshal the fans through this tunnel and once in
 the tunnel the congestion obviously greatly increased.

 Now although the tunnel is relatively short it took some time to
 actually get through it.   Inside the tunnel there was jostling
 and pushing and many peoplie were stumbling.  My son during this
 time was being severely crushed and had difficulty in
 breathing.  I'm 6ft 2" and weigh 16 stone and had extreme
 difficulty in pushing people away from him but fortunately I
 managed to hold on to him.

 Eventually we moved out of the tunnel but if anything the
 situation became worse and the pressure of the crowd behind
 became worse, causing many fans to stumble and fall down the
 steps only to disappear under the crowd.  Even once through
 the tunnel it was impossible to move sideways as the
 momentum of the crowd continued to push us forward.  We were
 forced to duck under metal barriers or suffer even more
 crushing.  Finally we were forced right up against the
 barriers which prevent the fans from getting on to the
 pitch.  During the match we had to constantly bear the
 crushing force of the crowd swaying forward from behind.   It
 would not have been so bad if we had been able to move
 sideways, away from this central part, but it was so packed,
 and the constant pushing, jostling and surging of the fans
 made this prospect appear even more dangerous.
                                - 2 -

(

    During the game some fans actually collapsed or fainted and
    were passed over peoples heads towards the front of this
    section of the ground.  We were by the gate in the barrier
    fence just behind the goal and witnessed the following:-


       Some fans tried to open this gate but it had been
       padlocked. Some fans attracted the attention of a
       policeman or steward, I can't remember which, but he
       appeared to be totally unaware of the situation.  As a
       result these fans became extremely agitated and tried to
       force the gate open but eventually an official obtained a
       key, the padlock was opened together with the gate, and
       the distressed fans passed to safety.

       During the whole of this game we were very concerned for
       the safety of our youngsters but the police were only
       allowing injured fans through the gate.  After the match
       finished we all vowed never to enter the Leppings Lane
       end ever again.

    As far as I am concerned, when there is a large crowd
    entering this part of the ground, it will always be a death
    trap.  It must be on very rare occasions when Sheffield
    Wednesday have enough visiting supporters to this part of
    the ground sufficiently to fill it completely and I believe
    they are not aware of how dangerous it can be.  The whole
    layout for entry into the Leppings Lane end of the ground
    and the layout inside the ground is a major hazard when
    there are lots of fans entering the ground.

    Under the circumstances I have described to you and the
    additional events which occured at this semi-final - large
    crowds, gates being opened to allow more fans in, lack of
    police and stewards to act as marshals who would guide and
    control the passage of fans into the ground, apparent lack
    of police communications, then it is not surprising that
    today, innocent people were injured and even more
    tragically, lost their lives.

    At this semi-final we had tickets for the West Gate stand
    which is built up over the Leppings Lane part of the ground
    and it was from here that we were to witness the harrowing
    and heartbreaking chain of tragic events.
                            - 3 -




The match had been started for about 5 minutes when we saw a
slowly growing number of fans trying to ascend the barrier
which is supposed to keep them off the pitch.  At first we
thought that this was due to hooliganism and violence going
on unseen beneath us or even just a pitch invasion but as
the events unfolded, we soon realized that many fans had
been seriously injured.

Even so the police took a long time to open the gates in the
fence - were they reluctant to do so or were the gates
padlocked once again.  Even when the gates had eventually
been opened the police were pushing fans, who had climbed
over, back through this gate into the ground where people
were still being crushed to death.  The police on the pitch
seemed to be the last people in the ground to realise a
major tragedy had happened and confusion amongst them
increased.  Some police were helping fans to climb over the
fence while just a few yards away other officers were
preventing fans getting over the fence by pushing them back.

Now everyone in the ground were dismayed and unable to
believe what was going on before their very eyes.  People
lay all over the pitch, some appeared to be in agony, some
had collapsed once they got onto the pitch, still yet others
were carried, apparently unconscious to us, and laid down on
the pitch.  St. John's Ambulance men, nurses and even fans,
were giving heart massage, mouth to mouth resuscitation and
all sorts of other first aid.  Some policemen were also
trying to help but the vast majority were either spread
along the half way line or huddled in groups, apparently
bewildered and lacking any directives, as to what to do,
from their superiors.

During this time we did see one police officer spat at by a
Liverpool supporter close to the gate behind the goal but I
can imagine him being incensed because the police were
pushing fans back into the gate.

I also saw two scuffles between fans on the pitch itself but
it was against police officers who were just standing round,
seeming unwilling to help.  I can understand the frustration
of these fans towards these particular policemen.

We saw angry Liverpool fans run up towards the Nottingham
Forest fans, the latter had been jeering and booing, the
former had been trying to save lives.  We saw angry
Liverpool fans scuffle with a cameraman, he had been taking
pictures of the injured and dying, while they had been doing
their best to save them.
                            - 4 -




Even more astonishing events were to take place.  It
appeared that when the ambulances eventually arrived they
had difficulty in getting to the dying and injured.  Then
the majority of fans who were on the pitch, who had not been
seriously injured, but obviously suffering from shock, began
to rip down hoardings and use them as stretchers to ferry
the injured, and unknown to us, many dead.  The fans carried
them from one end of the pitch to the other in a seemingly
endless relay.  Again stewards and other people helped but
again so few policemen got involved as they still stood in
groups or in a line across the pitch.

Later, having learned that a gate had been opened,by the
police, to let fans in, it became obvious that this must
have been a major contribution to the tragic disaster that
occured.  These fans headed for the same tunnel I described
earlier and what was to happen is to me inevitable.   I feel
great sympathy for the policeman who gave the directive for
the gate to be opened, in his opinion, lives were at risk
outside the ground and he took the action he considered the
best under the circumstances known to him.

The factors which have contributed to what   happened as far
as I am concerned are


1)   Police stopping coaches well before the ground so that
     fans had a 20 minute to 30 minute walk to the ground.
     This could be a likely cause of the late arrival of
     fans and the consequent build up outside the ground
     just before kick off.

     We consider ourselves extremely lucky as our coach
     driver dropped us off as near to the ground as possible
     even though police wanted him to turn round and drop us
     off a lot further away from the ground, despite the
     fact this would have resulted in us arriving even later
     at the ground.  We had a 10 minute walk to the ground
     and arrived at Hillsborough at 2.35 p.m.  If we had
     been dropped off where the police wanted them we would
     have been arriving in the ground at the same time as
     those unfortunate supporters who were to be involved in
     those tragic circumstances.


2)   Police not taking immediate control of the fans and
     getting them to line up in an orderly manner.   There
     appeared to be more police on duty miles away from the
     ground than there were directly outside it.   This
     shortage of policeman immediately outside the ground
     must surely have resulted in total lack of crowd
     control.

    3)   The entrance to the Leppings Lane end and this part of
         the ground itself is a death trap when large numbers of
         fans are trying to gain entrance.


    4)   The ultimate responsibility of what happened must lie
         with F.A. Authorities.  For the second year running
         they gave Liverpool fans the smaller part of the
         ground, even though they must have an average of 15,000
         to 20,000 more fans attending their home games.  This
         was despite the fact that Liverpool F.C. appealed to
         the F.A. to either give Liverpool fans the other end of
         the ground and so more tickets or choose an alternative
         ground which would be able to accommodate their fans.
         The F.A. officials with characteristic lack of interest
         in the problems of the fans, coldly dismissed
         Liverpools claims.

         The people who deserve commending are the Liverpool
         supporters who so bravely helped their injured
         colleagues who lay dying and injured on the Pitch.   The
         ambulance men, nurses, stewards and firemen who also
         put in tremendous effort.  The Nottingham Forest fans
         for their behaviour after they became aware of the
         extent of the tragedy unfolding before them.   And last
         but not least those few policemen who did try their
         best and the people of Sheffield for showing such
         generosity and help to those fans in need of it.

         My condolences and heartfelt sympathy goes out to those
         families who have lost their loved ones in such tragic
         circumstances caused by the negligence, incompetence
         and ignorance of the F.A. and other officials.

         From a very sad but very angry Liverpool supporter, who
         stood there and watched, helpless to do anything. I'm
         not a fanatical or completely biased supporter, what I
         witnessed on both occasions is the truth.


         Yours sincerely,
                                          /

16 April 1989


Dear Mr Moynihan,


I attended and witnessed the awful and tragic scenes a t Hillsborough yesterday.
I hope what I have to say may be o f some value to you in your capacity as
Sports Minister. I would lik e to divide th is l e t t e r into three short se ctio n s;
f i r s t , a description of what I witnessed; secondly,questions which should
be raised and l a s t l y , my suggestions as a l i f e - l o n g follower o f f o o tb a ll.


The police on duty were, in my opinion, woefully inadequate in both number
and th e ir effec tiv e n ess at crowd c o n tr o l.I have spent ten years serving in the
Royal Military Policetwo o f which were served in Northern Ireland whre I
gained a great deal o f experience in              crowd control.
The p o lice I spoke to could not even t e l l me where a certain club o f f i c i a l
car park was, consequently I was driving around the ground j u s t adding to the
already alarmingly large crowd. On a r r iv a l, by fo o t, at the Leppings Lane
end o f the ground I was shocked to find only eight t u r n s t ile s open to service
the whole o f the North Stand as well as the West Stand. The time was now
I4.35hrs and the crowd was s o lid from the tu r n stile s entrance backing into
the road, a distance o f about ten y a r d s .I t took me ten minutes to eventually
gain access to a t u r n s t il e .
Once tbe other side of the t u r n s t ile s I walked to the l e f t for the North
Stand seating areas. As I looked back I could see the situ a tio n was becoming
more desperate with hundreds o f people arriving by the minute. S t i l l only three
mounted policemen were attempting to             control the crowd           outside. I then    tookmy
se a t in the stand. After k ick -o ff i t       became clear that           far too many people were
confined in too small a space in the West Stand.
The questions which have arisen from th is incident are:
- why should Liverpool FC, with a fa r greater following than Nottingham Forest,
  be allocated le s s t ic k e t s ?
- why was the l e a s t supported club allo ca ted the larger standing area?
- l a s t year's semi-final was controlled by s t r i c t marshalling a t l e a s t f i f t y
yards from the t u r n s t il e s . What happened th is y e a r ?
- why was there no       early announcemnt made, to keep both Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest fans informed?
-why were the f i r s t aid se r v ic e s a t the ground under-manned and under-equipped
fo r a major sporting event such as t h i s ?



F in a lly , I would lik e to comment t h a t , in my opinion, a match o f th is
sig n ific a n c e and importance should be played a t a larger stadium. Could the
se m i-fin a ls not be staged a t Wembley on altern ate Saturdays?
I further fe e l that i f the perimeter fences are not to be taken down a t grounds
around the country, small gates should be b u ilt into the structures every three
f e e t or so , with a steward assigned to each gate throuhout the match.



In conclusion, I think a f t e r an incident lik e th is i t i s very easy to point
the fin g e r and apportion blame. This is not my aim - I have j u s t tried to
t e l l you what I saw and r a is e a few p rctical suggestions.

Dear Sir,

I enclose my letter to the Football Association

considering whether this tragedy would have happened
if drinking were allowed inside the ground before
kick off.

This coupled with the abolition of standing with 100%
seating would certainly tempt me to let my grand­
children go to a match again.

Dear Sirs,

I was a spectator at Hillsborough yesterday and I
want to express my views on one aspect of the
tragedy.

We arrived by car about 1pm and were able to park
almost opposite the ground.  We had a picnic lunch
by the car and all around us were fans doing the
same thing but also,I regret were 'tanking up' on
beer.  I asked them why and they explained that as
they could not drink in the ground,they had to
fill up beforehand.

My friend and I finished lunch around 1.45 and
decided to take walk before taking our seats. We
went northwards and within a few hundred yards
of the ground was an Off Licence which was doing
the trade of the century.  There must have been
several hundred around the shop.  I thought no
more of it at the time.

When later,I heard and read of the crush outside
the gates at ten to three,I realised that many
of these fans had probably been drinking up to
just before the game outside the ground instead .
of going in an orderly fashion much earlier as
they certainly could have done.

I do not know the statistics on ground drunken­
ness, since the prohibition,but it may be worth

    Mr. R. Shepherd M.P.,
    The House of Commons,
    London.


    Dear JIar. Sjjetfherd,

         I am writing this letter, "both as a Liverpool supporter who was standing in
    the Leppings Lane End of the ground where the tragedy occurred on Saturday the
    15th April, and as a Doctor who tried in vain to resucitate fans on the pitch.
    This is my view of the causes of the disaster and the inadequacies of the relief
    operation.

         I arrived outside the ground at approximately 2.15 P.m. There were many
    thousands of fans milling around and in the area of the turnstiles I had to enter
    through (B. Section), there was no orderly queueing. There appeared to be a total
    lack of policeoo-ordination in organizing the fans. In fact I witnessed two police
    officers on horse back appearing to argue with each other. They retreated and
    appeared to leave us to it. By this stage supporters were being squashed against
    the turnstile walls, fans were desperately appealing to the police to create some
    sense of order. Then I witnessed the police opening an exit to the side of the
    turn stiles and we flooded in with the pressure of the supporters behind us, without
    having to present our tickets. At the time I felt that the police had no option
    but to open the gate as a dangerous situation was developing outside the ground,
    where serious injuries were inevitable. The situation should never have got to this
    stage, there should have been adequate crowd control with sufficient police numbers
    outside the ground to ensure that the supporters entered the turnstiles in an
    orderly fashion.

         Once inside the ground there was a lack of stewarding supporters to different
    areas of the Terrace. I myself was initially channelled towards the central area,

•   as this appeared to be the only entrance onto the terracing, but I was lucky and
    remembered the advice of friends and turned away from the central area to make my
    way to the side of the Terrace which was not over crowded.

         When I reached the terracing it was obvious to myself and to many supporters
    around me that the central area was seriously over crowded as fans tried to climb
    over the barrier or climb up to the seating area above them.

    SURELY, REALIZING THIS, THE OFFICIALS COULD HAVE POSTPONED THE START OF THE MATCH
    TO ALLOW SOME SENSE OF ORDER TO OCCUR.

         What happened next, I am sure you are only too well aware of. The supporters
    were crushed and killed because the only exit was a small gate in the perimeter
    fencing. Surely a method could be devized where the fencing could be rolled aside
    or collapsed to avoid such tragedy.




                                                                     /Realizing
Realizing the disaster, I made my way onto the pitch to offer some help. There
was chaos, with a total lack of facilities. The first ambulance did not appear
to arrive for at least 15 minutes. There was no defibrillator, no suction
equipment to clear the casualities airways, and there was an inadequate supply
of oxygen equipment and stretchers. Above all there appeared to be no one in
charge of organizing the disaster. I heard later that this was mainly done by
another doctor who was also there as a supporter. There was also no announcement
over the P.A. system for at least 45 minutes, during which time the Nottingham
Forrest supporters were obviously oblivious to the fact that a tragedy had
occurred and was simply accusing the Liverpool fans of rioting onto the pitch.
Many Police Officers appeared confused as to what they should do but I have
nothing but praise for individual officers and supporters who offered their help
in attempting to resucitate the injured and dead.

     In summarizing the causes of the disaster may I list -

     1)    Lack of police co-ordination outside the ground,

     2)    Lack of stewarding inside the ground.

     3)    Poor design for entry onto the terracing.

     4)    Inadequate exits through the perimeter fencing onto the pitch.

     I also feel that where such football matches are played again, serious
thought needs to be given to the resucitation equipment available at the ground
and that a clearly laid down plan of dealing with such a disaster is known, and
a Senior Police Officer allocated to over look the situation.


                                              Yours sincerely,




                                              Dr, Colin K. Flenley

 Dear S i r s ,

 F.A.    Cup      Semi-Final

I would l i k e to bring to your a t t e n t i o n the f a c t s below which may help
with the enquiry int o the tragedy which took place a t the above l a s t
Saturday.


Admittedly, my son and I did not have t i c k e t s but went on the offchance
of purchasing thes e o ut si d e the ground - t h i s i s not uncommon f o r people
to do t h i s on major sporting occasions.


We purchased t i c k e t s o ut sid e th e Lepping Road end a t 2.45 p.m.


I must complain about the harassment experienced with poli ce on horseback
who were forcing fans towards the t u r n s t i l e s . As we d i d n ' t have t i c k e t s
we spent a lot of time avoiding t h es e "wild horsemen" t r y in g t o get fans
stood in an ord erly s t i l l p osi ti on t o go to the ground, I'm sure some
of th ese so c a l l e d policemen would be more a t home at S h ef fie ld c a t t l e
market!


When we t r i e d to en ter the ground a t 2.50 p.m. t h e r e was chaos at the
t u r n s t i l e s - the po lice had no o r d er ly queues.


We stood on the bridge over the stream; and we agree t h a t the police
had no option but t o open the gates to avoid tragedy o ut sid e the
turnstiles.


However, when we did en t er in a reasonably o rd er ly manner th e policemen
who l e t us in only looked at th e t i c k e t and did not take th e coun ter foil
(see copy of t i c k e t attached)


                                                                   /continued           2
Once in th e ground t h e r e were no d i r e c t i o n s by stewards or p o l i c e ----- and
thank God my son and I did not decide t o go up the ' f a t a l t u n n e l ' .


There was obviously no communication between the pol ice and o f f i c i a l s , since
the k ic k- o ff was on time and no co n si der ati on given to fans who had paid
good money but c o u l d n ' t get in the ground due to disorganized police arrange­
ments - unlike th e Arsenal v Liverpool at Highbury in October which was
delayed because of crowds t r y in g to e n t e r the ground.


Also, looking back on the s i t u a t i o n , i t was amazing t h a t the two se ts of
policemen led by so c a l l e d leaders could 'walk' along the touch li ne to the
scene when people were lying injured and dying               surely communication
equipment reached beyond 70 yards!


I have j u s t heard on TV to n ig h t (Tuesday) p o li ce accusations about drunken
fans - t h e r e i s a big d i f f e r e n c e between cheerful fans (who were th e main
nucleus of what I per so na ll y saw on the day) and drunken fans.


I have attached           my business card i f you wish to contact me f o r any f u r t h e r
comments            I     do fe el very stron gly about th e po lice on horseback, p a r t i ­
c u l a r l y the one     with gold-rimmed g l a s s e s , who, in my opinion, acted worse
than any c a t t l e      drover!!


Lastly, I have enclosed a diagram giving my viewpoint of th e s i t u a t i o n at
the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

   Dear



     Enclosed with this letter is a photostat of my ticket for
last Saturday's semi-final at Hillsborough.   You will notice that
it is for the Leppings Lane End terrace.   You will also notice
that like thousands of other tickets it is untorn.     I am one of
the luckier ones: I'm sitting here writing this instead of being
dead: I didn't lose anybody: I didn't stand in the middle section
of the terraces. Having said that, maybe I'm not so lucky because
every two minutes or so my head gets filled with images that
nobody should have to live-with in peacetime.
     I consider the photocopy to be evidence enough of my
credentials for writing this.   My other credentials are 22 years
of watching football; 19 years of watching Liverpool.   Saturday’s
game was my ninth FA Cup semi-final and my third at Hillsborough.
Initially I just didn't feel like talking about what happened at
all, but as the buck-passing process seems to be accelerating my
anger and disgust has hit the level where I'm not going to keep
quiet about it.
     I went to     Hillsborough on Saturday with my father and a
friend.  The much publicised reason for the FA and     the police
choosing Hillsborough to stage the match was that the Liverpool
fans would arrive from the west and the Nottingham Forest fans
would arrive from the south and thus could easily be kept apart.
This was based on the assumption that every Liverpool fan would
use the A628 to travel to the ground.      In fact we,  along with
several thousand others decided to use the A57 , a less congested
route. This meant that we parked in the same area as all the Not­
tingham fans. When I walked about a mile to the ground at 2.00 pm
TO BE GIVEN UP
                 THIS PORTION TO BE RETAINED
 I would quess that there would have been roughly two Forest fans
to every one Liverpool fan in the streets on the south side of
the ground.
     There was no sign of any aggressive atmosphere,      no hint of
violence,   simply good natured singing and banter.      Anyone who
knows anything about the game could tell you that there is no an­
tipathy between the two clubs, and that the chance of trouble was
minimal.  Despite this there was a massive police presence in the
streets;   clusters of officers on every corner,   threatening mil-
tary looking vans,   none of them smiling or making any attempt to
be helpful as they watched and waited for trouble.
     When we arrived at the Leppings Lane End having literally
been sent round the houses by police seperating us from the
Forest fans who we'd just walked the   best part of a mile with, it
was imediately clear that there were difficulties.
     This was at approximately 2.25.   There was a mob swaying and
surging to try and get to the eight turnstiles.    There has been a
lot of talk about sixteen turnstiles    which simply isn't true:
there were eight gates for the seats and eight for the terraces.
The chaos came as absolutely no surprise because it was exactly
the same last year when it took me 50 minutes to get through the
turnstiles and to my seat in the stand above the terracing.
Everybody was talking about this,    nobody could believe that the
police had done nothing to improve the situation.      Despite the
hundreds of very visible police all over Sheffield, the only ones
in evidence outside the turnstiles were three mouftted policemen.
The situation had obviously been going on for some time, and many
fans who had purposely turned up early were getting understand­
ably livid.    We were quickly sucked into the centre of the crowd
and there was no doubt that it was no normal      crush.   I simply
decided to get out.     Having been in many a similar situation it
was clear from the pitch of the screams and shouts from those at
the front that the situation was deteriorating fast. I managed to
get out of the main crush to the side by some railings,          and
shouted for my friend to do the same.    We decided to wait there
whilst the situation eased.      At this point one of the mounted
policemen completely lost his cool and barged his way out to the
back of the crowd.   I don't know if the fans in his way were able
to get their feet out of the way, but I doubt it. I don't know if
he did anything constructive when he got out of the crush, but I
 doubt it.  Everyone was yelling at him.      and I accept that
everyone is human,   but his shouted response of " You can all go
crush youselves for all I care!" is something that he will have
to learn to live with.
      At this point many fans began to climb the gates in order
to get out of the crush.  Almost all of them were showing tickets
to police waiting on the other side.      The crush wasn't getting
markedly worse as kick off time approached, for the simple reason
that the area around the turnstiles was as crowded as conceivably
possible.  I find the stories of last minute arrivals of wild,
drunken thugs so far fetched that they are quite contemptible.At
this point a small gate was opened in a side wall and before I
knew anything I had been pushed through with about fifty or sixty
others after which they managed to close it.    Straight ahead was
a tunnel leading into the ground.   My friend suggested that we
went in and stood behind the goals.         The area    within the
perimeter of the ground was oddly quiet and there was hardly
anyone going in through the tunnel.
     I told him that I had once stood there before in a semi­
final against Arsenal years previously and remembered that it was
a bit packed and the view wasn't great.   And so it was that I was
one of the ones who made their way to the edge.       Five minutes
later even our part of the ground had filled up very fast and the
incoming fans told of how a big gate had been opened or kicked
down. And the rest is history.

I would like to make the following points v.ery clear.

1. There WAS a very major problem outside the Leppings Lane End
last year any anyone who claims otherwise is simply not telling
the truth.
2. Everyone who    saw the numbers of policemen who came onto the
pitch,  and for the most part stood aimlessly about as the dis­
aster unfolded could simply not believe why so few had been allo­
cated to steer 10,000 fans through 8 turnstiles which were fenced
in on three sides by an area little bigger than an infant school
playground.  ( Having said that,   everybody also noted the few
policemen who unhesitatingly jumped into the middle of the crush
and showed extraordinary courage.)
3. The stories that are now being brought out about massive num­
bers of riotous,    drunken fans causing the crush are gross exag­
gerations, which seem to be desparate attemmt to shift the blame.
4. Standard policy at other similar occassions is always to break
down the crowd slowly,to mass the majority in a wide open space
like a street,    check their tickets and split them into a smaller
bunch,    then form them into queues which move quickly through the
turnstiles.    Above all the most important thing is to have the
policemen doing the job showing patience,      smiling and TELLING
people what is happening.       Had there been one articulate voice
talking through one efficient    loudhailer outside the Leppings
Lane End on Saturday there may well have been 94 more people
alive today than there are.
        This in my opinion is where the root causes of the problems
that led to the horror of the weekend are to be found. I am 28, a
graduate and a company director,    and like most people in England
    I'm    generally treated with politeness and courtesy.   That is
until I go to a soccer match.    Once I an identified as football
fan      I am immediately considered to be little more than an
animal.    If I have a scarf out of my car window on route to an
away match the police will stop me and search me.      When I get to
the game I get herded around by absurdly aggressive policemen,
pushed and shoved with never a word of apology until I, along
with the rest of the animals,    are safely    locked away in our
cage,    under the scrutiny of both video cameras and hundreds of
policemen. Of course there are troublemakers at football matches,
lots of them.    Anyone who claims otherwise is an idiot.    But to
treat     two million football fans as if they were all a danger to
society is absurd.    And now we are being branded as outcasts to
the extent we're going to be forced to carry an ID card when we
go to see a game.    Even convicted murderers out on parole aren't
required to do this.
      If you distrust people to this extent,, and insist on pushing
them round like cattle is it really any surprise that they don't
behave like perfect Edwardian Gentlemen? A standing joke amongst
Liverpool fans when they are pushed into a particularly tight
space is for them to start mooing at the top of their voices.
      I am convinced       that it was this ludicrous attitude that
more than anything else led to the tragedy of        Leppings Lane.
Whoever was running the show obviously felt that 98% of his
 resources needed to be deployed to stop fighting in the streets.
A crush at the turnstiles? Their problem.   That was why nobody
told us what was happening as if they assumed that we were so
thick that we wouldn't understand. That is why we are all haunted
by the sight of policemen beating desperate fans off the fences
when everyone but them knew that there was a very serious
problem.
     I work in the animal feed industry,  and I sometimes go to
cattle auctions.   The cows are transferred from wagon to pen to
ring with the minimum of harshness.  Were they treated or herded
around in remotely the same way that we fans are shoved around by
the police on a Saturday afternoon the RSPGA would have a great
deal to say about it.  Which puts me in mind of the words of a
young poet called Wilfred Owen who 60 years ago wrote a poem
called " Anthem for doomed youth." Its first line suddenly after
all these years seems horribly topical,

     "What passing bells for those who die like cattle."

I am a Chartered Accountant and work       as   Financial   Controller
for Empire Stores in Bradford.


I have followed Liverpool F.C. for over 20 years, seeing on
average 20 games a season - including the Charlton, Luton,
Coventry, Derby and Sheffield games in recent weeks.

                      STATEMENT OF EVENTS


                    SATURDAY 15TH APRIL 1989

My ticket is Leppings Lane Standing Entrance B.      I have not
been into the Hillsborough Stadium     before.   I was   meeting
friends at 1.15 p.m. to 1.30 p.m. in the Fat Gat, Alma Street,
near the centre of Sheffield to go to Hillsborough together.   I
drove south down the Ml to Junction 34 (Tinsley) arriving
before 1.00 p.m. - but then spent over 45 minutes travelling 4
miles to reach the city centre, late because of    the   traffic
congestion/roadworks.


We then travelled half the journey by car parking near Hillfoot
Bridge, Neepsend Lane where Forest fans had congregated.     We
walked up Penistone Road, then up Parkside Road turning right
into Leppings Lane arriving at 2.35 p.m.     Penistone Road was
heavy wit-h Forest fans.


In my opinion this time was comfortable bearing in mind that
the game was all ticket.     There was chaos in the narrow area
between Leppings Lane and the turnstiles.          There were 2
Policemen on horses outside the outer gate and     2 Policemen on
foot.  No other     Police were     in sight. There appeared to be no
plan to the Police action when at the outer gate I noticed that
the ground gates to the right of the Entrance B were opened to
allow fans in directly.   I was separated from my friends in the
crush by the panicking horses.    In the mass of fans in the area
between the outer gates and the turnstiles, I headed for the
right of the turnstiles hoping to get to further turnstiles or
that the gates would be opened again.


The gates were opened for  a second   time and   I entered the
ground at 2.50 p.m. without ticket inspection.    I still have
the full ticket.   In my opinion there was not a sufficient
crush to cause the gates to be opened.   There was no evidence
of any drunken behaviour - just many anxious people trying to
enter the ground.


Once inside the gates I was opposite the tunnel under the West
Stand and could see the pitch down the tunnel.   From my ticket
map I assumed Entrance A and D led to the two corner areas
therefore  I should go down the tunnel.        No Police were
before/in or at the end of the .tunnel.
                                                          - 4 -


When through the tunnel I took to the right hand side to be
behind the goals.   It was still not kick off time.     I felt
uncomfortable as more and more fans kept coming down the
tunnel.  I kept moving to the right heading away from the m a m
crush.


Soon after kick off I was getting squashed but still tried to
get to the right hoping that it would thin out towards the
corner of the ground.     There were no Police at the centre
behind the goal so when the first fans escaped to the edge 01
the pitch the only immediate reaction was from the Press who
merely took photos of the crush.      It was nearly 5 minutes
between the crush becoming unbearable and any Police action.


As the game stopped I came upon a crash barrier and took the
risk of going underneath, but struggled to stand up.   I managed
to move further to the right.     It was then I realised there
were fences between the perimeter fence and the West Stand.    I
was shoulder to shoulder with one fan who was next to the
fence.   He pursuaded supporters in the adjacent area to help
him climb and get over the fence.      I followed him over the
fence.   I then lay down and gradually recovered over the next
half hour.   I saw no looting or any theft.   I saw no Policemen
being attacked. • The events between 3.10 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. are
well logged by T.V. so I have not covered them in any detail,
suffice it to say that there appeared to be insufficient
medical staff (i.e. St John's Ambulance volunteers/firemen) or
equipment (e.g. stretchers).

                  HILLSBOROUGH QUESTIONS



Ticket allocations were clearly wrong.  I would suggest
they should be in proportion to the average home gate.   The
parking could have been as on match day, but Forest fans
use Parkside Road to reach Leppings Lane end.


Why was Junction 34 off the Ml used for Nottingham Forest
fans when there are diversions/roadworks which caused
considerable traffic delays.


The landlord of   the pub by Hillfoot bridge, Neepsend Lane
was interviewed   on ITV on 18 April.  He was describing the
vast amounts of   alcohol consumed by fans ~ but did not
state that they   were Nottingham Forest supporters, instead
he implied they   were Liverpool supporters.


Many thousands of Forest fans must have arrived at the
Spion Kop turnstiles well after 2.35 p.m.  Can the
electronic turnstile records show how many fans entered
the Spion Kop in the last 25 minutes compared to the
Leppings Lane end as the Liverpool fans accused of being
late; in my opinion more Forest fans were outside the
ground at 2.35 p.m.


The Police presence outside the Leppings Lane end was
minimal and inadequate.  More officers should have been
there to do an initial ticket check to keep fans without
tickets well away from the turnstiles.


Why did the Police outside Leppings Lane not get the fans
to form queues.  This is surely standard practice.


When the gates were opened the Police could still have
collected the ticket stubs as fans entered.


A better solution to cater for crowd safety outside the
ground would have been to delay the start by 15 minutes
to allow everyone to enter.
                                                                 -    6   -



9.   The gates shown on BBC T.V. on 17 April and in the
     Financial Times on 18 April as the gates that were opened
     were not those that I entered the ground.  The gates on
     T.V. were concertina metal gates to the left of turnstile
     B, I entered by wooden gates to the right of turnstile B.


10. The P.A. System should have been used to tell fans at the
    rear of the West Stand/outside that the central area was
    full.  The video T . V . ’s must have shown the concentration.
    The P.A. System could have given instructions how to get to
    the crowed - free areas.      If the P.A. System was
    inadequate; then the Police/Ground Stewards could have done
    it.


11. The ticket ground plan needs clarifying.  My ticket is
    Leppings Lane Standing Entrance B which the plan would lead
    you to the tunnel only.  One would assume A and D have
    access to the corner terraces.


12. The tunnel was unlit and sloping downwards.         It would be
    far safer to be both properly lit and flat.


13. Why w e r e n ’t the Police at either end/in the tunnel.


14. Why d i d n ’t the video T.V. show the crush and so action
    prior to kick off.


15. Why d i d n ’t the Press raise the alarm or help.


16. The Police action immediately after the game was stopped
    was very slow.  Only a handful of Policemen were in the
    trouble spot.


17. Why were the fences across the uncovered standing area not
    taken down as the end was entirely Liverpool fans.  The
    gates at the back of those fences should have been open.


18. Why d i d n ’t the Police have ladders or rope to pull fans
    out onto the ground fence.

19. Why was the immediate Police priority to create a Cordon
    across the pitch (approximately 100 Officers were out in
    the middle) when only a small number were assisting the
    crushed. Where were all the other Police.


20. Why w a s n ’t the P.A. System used properly.  Instead of
    telling fans to get off the pitch it should have told the
    Forest fans what was happening and also asked for medical
    people in the ground; many doctors must have been in the
    ground unaware of the crisis.      The P.A. could also have
    told fans to go back up the tunnel.


21. Why did there appear to be such a shortage of medical
    staff.  Why was there such a lack of any medical equipment.


22. I was annoyed by the immediate T.V./Radio comments,
    particularly from Mr Kelly. Why say the gates were forced
    by fans without tickets if you are unsure.  The Police
    waited until 7.00 p.m. before admitting that they had
    opened the gates. Why the four hour delay!

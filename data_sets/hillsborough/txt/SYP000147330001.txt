              Yes, ___________________________________________________________

              a.bout, two years.   The only difference    I would say, would

              be that the turnstiles at                           are older than

              the Hillsborough ones.

            non-ticket holders that caused the problem.

       TO THAT POSSIBLE FUTURE ALLEGATION?



                 We d i d n ’t let anyone        in,   i t ’s not worth your job to take

                 money to let them in, and the ones who jumped the

                 turnstile          t h e r e ’s just no way of stopping them,   because

           Dear Sirs,

           Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990,


           If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
           of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
           on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
           due course.

           I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
           evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
           coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
           inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

           Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
           under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
^         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
I /       this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

           Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
           to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
           appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
           consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

           May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
           attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

           I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
           names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
           to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

           I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
           heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
           submit.

Bear Sirs,

     Kevin Tyrrell

I have been informed that you are acting for members of the
bereaved family of the above named deceased person.

It is of course a matter entirely for your clients as to whether
or not they have instructed you to represent them in connection
with the Inquest proceedings.

As I am however anxious to sort out the legal representation
in order that I may know who to communicate with, I would
be grateful if you could please let me know as soon as possible,
whether or not you ace instructed in connection with the Inquest.

If you are so instructed, I would be grateful if you could please

     1.     Confirm your instruction.

     2.     State who you represent.

     3.     Let me have your reference.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Please quote OUR reference.

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,

                          \
I am a little bit surprised at the fourth paragraph of your
letter as we harre a statement from Mr. Gerard Tyrrell
positively identifying Kevin. 1 do not know whether you
are aware of this fact.

We will sort the point out at the Inquest. Fortunately
it is not a matter of major concern as Kevin was in fact
also identified by Mr. Francis Tyrrell, as you very
correctly state.

Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir

Re: Hillsborough Inquest - Kevin Tyrrell (Deceased)

We thank you for your letter of 27 March enclosing a copy of the summary in
respect of the above named.

We have now had the opportunity of discussing the contents of the summary with
Mr Francis Tyrrell, father of the deceased.

Millst a identification evidence on the front page of the summary is stated
to have been obtained from Mr Francis Tyrrell at 0500 hours on Sunday 16 April
1939, item 6 in the summary of circumstances states that Mr Gerard Tyrrell
identified the body of his nephew at 0035 hours.

It has already been established and Mr Francis Tyrrell has confirmed that Mr
Gerard Tyrrell did not at any time identify the body of Kevin Tyrrell and the
only identification of the body was made by Mr Francis Tyrrell although, he
is not certain of the time of identification.

Accordingly, item 6 in the summary of circumstances needs to be reviewed and
amended and we will be grateful if you could please put the appropriate arrangements
.in hand.

A photocopy of this letter has today been sent to Detective Superintendent
Beechey at Nechells Green Police Station.

tear        Sirs,

He:         BOTH SBBSIi (deceased) B0 .3 S.
As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough.
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

Dear Dr Molyneux

                         Re: Kevin Tyrrell (died 15 4 89)
                     Hillsborough Football Stadium, Sheffield

       Thank you for your letter of 28th November 1989, in connection with the
death of this youth at the Hillsborough disaster in April of this year.

       Although, as Dr Burns quite rightly pointed out, inhaled stomach contents
are commonly found at post-mortem and do not necessarily mean a great deal, the
inhalation in Kevin's case was quite significant and was, I believe, the main
cause of his d e a t h s inhalation clearly occurred while he was still alive, as
seen by the presence of haemorrhage in the lungs, and was not just a post-mortem
phenomenon,

       Although still alive when he inhaled vomit, it is nevertheless quite
likely that Kevin was, in fact, unconscious - due to crushing of his chest and
the development of at least some degree of crush asphyxia.     If the inhalation
had not occurred, presumably he would have died from straightforward asphyxia.

       I am sorry if these comments go slightly against the sequence of events
as you had worked out.    They shouldn’t, however, really alter your advice to
Kevin4s parents that he was in no prolonged distress from the choking given that
he was unconscious when it occurred.

      Yours sincerely,




      John C. Clark,

       Dear Dr. Clark,

       Re; Kevin Tyrrell, (date of death 15.4.89), Hillsborough Football Ground

       I believe you carried out the post mortem on this 15 year old boy who died
       in the Hillsborough disaster. The parents recently received a summary of
       the post mortem findings and the social worker who is working with the family
       asked if I would go through this report with them.   (This is something we
       offer to do with many of our bereaved parents and they seem to find it
       helpful.)

       I was told by the social worker that Kevin1s mother had been distressed at
       the thought of him dying from choking on inhaled vomitus.  The post mortem
       findings showed 'inhalation of stomach contents1 and ’crush asphyxia.'
       I was unable to discuss this with you as I only received a copy of the
       report the day before I was due to see the parents but I took the liberty
       of discussing it with Dr. Jim Burns our University Home Pathologist, with
       mum's anxieties specifically in mind.   He told me that inhaled stomach
       contents are fairly commonly found at post mortem and that I could confidently
       tell the parents that Kevin was dead when this happened, and certainly in
       no distress from choking.

        The parents found this very helpful but asked if I would contact you about
        this too. This is why I am writing to you. I hope you will be able to
        agree with this sequence and timing of events at Kevin's death.

       With many thanks for your kind help.

       Yours sincerely,




       E. MOLYNEUX,
       Consultant - A.E.D.

                               We    arrived           at    the       hospital                at    about          1.35       pm    (1335)          and       left       at    about

                                1.50       pm    (1350)          after          collecting                a    babysitter                from       the       hospital.             We

                                commenced             our    journey             along          Worrall             Rd    and       at    this       time       traffic             was

                                normal          and    I    did    not          see       any       foo'W^all            supporters             walking             towards          the

                               was     a    greater          number             of       football             supporters             there\han                 at    the

                                supporters.                 The    car          park       of       this       pubH^           house          was    full       of    supporters

                                to   such        an    extent          that          they       had       spilled             across          the    footpath             into       the

                                roadway.              Traffic          travelling                   in    the       opposite             direction             to    me    was

                                experiencing                some       difficulty                   in    travelling                along       the       road       due       to    those

                                supporters             being       in       the          road,       In       fact       I almost             collided          withone

                               vehicle           that       came       across             my    slsde         of    the       road       and    was       taking          evasive

                               action.            The       vast       majority                of    tho^e          supporters                were    drinking             alcohol

                               and     they       appeared             to       be       quite       boisterous,                noisey          and       I    think       they          were

                               singing.           I    took       note          of       one    particular                group          of    supporters             who       arrived

                               at    the        public       house          in       a    vehicle             and    as       they       approached             there          was       a

                               big     roar       from       the       supporters                   on    the       public          house       premises.

                               We    continued              our    journey                into       Wadsley             Ln    passing          anumber              of

supporters                     were          drinking        from       beer        glasses        as    were          the       supporters

sitting               in       the       road.         I    felt     very          intimidated           at     this            location             by     the

attitude                  of    the          supporters           and     I    felt        they     were.looking                   for         trouble

wear            for       drink          and       again     very       boisterous.                 Traffic         at          this       location

was         not       particularly                   heavy        but     I was          experiencing              difficulty                   passing

supporters                     in    the       roadway.

        We        had          great          difficulty           travelling               along       this       road          due       to    the

large            crowds             of       supporters           and     I would           estimate          that          from       this

location                  it    would          have        been    between           five        and    ten     minutes               to       reach        the

and         I may          not       have          seen     them.       I also           noted      that      there             were       a    number

of     supporters                    walking           in    the     opposite              direction          to       the       majority             along

supporters              I       can       say    they             were        coping             and       were       in    control          of        the

situation.                  Again          the       supporters                    were             still       boisterous,                and     although                     I

still        felt       intimidated                   they           appeared                   fairly          well       behaved.              We

travelled           into          Parkside                Rd       and        by       this          time       the       supporters             had      thinned

out        somewhat             although             there          were           some          about.          After       travelling

along        Parkside             Rd       we    reached                 Pennistone                   Rd       and    there       turned            left.              At

this        point       we       were       again             confronted                    with          large       groups          of

supporters              but       this          time          they        were          Nottingham                   Forest       supporters.

Although           the          volume          of    supporters                       was          similar          to    that       of    Liverpool

supporters              I       immediately                   noticed              a    difference                   in    behaviour             and       I was

no    longer        intimidated                      by       the        crowds.                I    looked          on    them       as    an      orderly

group        of    people             going          to       a     football                match.              There       appeared              to    be         a

difference              of       the       age       group              and    there                was    a    more       family          atmosphere                  and

whilst           walking          along          the          road        1 did             not       see       any       persons          drinking

alcohol           from          cans.       As       we       travelled                 along             Pennistone             Rd    the       Nottingham

fans        remained             very       orderly                 and       basically                   kept       on    the    footpaths.                   I was

able        to    travel          along          this             road        with          1 i t t Is® d i f f i c u l t y /X.                  _ __ jc r ^   c ^ O   \

West hen          travelled                into                           Rd       and          I    1ookeek t o w a r d s            the F i v e          Arches

public           house.          Bv       this       time           it    would             be       about       2.15       pm    (1415)            and        I       saw

      ^t    there       were          a    ajnall         number              of       supporters                drinking             on    the

car        park.    Again             I    can       say          they        were          behaving             normally             and    none          were

wandering           in          the       road.           I       then        continued                   my    journey          and       there        were               no

further           instances                which          attracted                    my       attention.

In    conclusion                 I was          suprised                 to    see          so       many       public       houses          open          near             to

the        ground       and       I       feel       that           this       was          a       contributory             factor          in        the

events           that       followed.                I again              would             like          to    reiterate             the    marked

difference              in       the       attitudes                    and    behaviour                       patterns          of    the        two      sets             of

supporters.                 I    have       some          professional                          ability          to       form    these           opinions

from        the    nature             of    my       work           and       training.

It    is    true     to     say    that      the     planning           for    policing          League       games          has

formed        the    basis        for    the      pl ans     made       in    respect          of all       three       Semi

The      planning         for       S e mi    Finals          is m o r e     complex         by     the    very      nature         of

the      fact    the re        is     no h o m e        support        and     therefore            the    importance            of

segregation              becomes          even more             significant            and      problematic.

Itemised         below are             the     areas          taken     into        consideration when                   planning

•such Semi           Finals         but      before        covering          that      area       the     strategy and

reasons         for      the       methods         of    segregation               employed         requires         explanation.

Th e     fact     that     supporters               of      the       other        team would also                   be     utilising

situation.            The       geography              of    this          area     presents             a dual        carriageway

(four       lanes)        of    one        of    the     city's            main arterial                 roads.            It    is a l s o     a

l arge      area    which would                  need       to    be       sealed        using          great       numbers        of

portable          barriers            and       uniform          personnel,                  Even       if t h a t     could       be

achieved,          the     length           of    r o ad     opposite              to    the        turnstiles             comprises

problems          in t e r m s        of    sterility.                 Additionally,                    coaches        carrying

supporters          of     both        teams        in      itself          presents              a formula          for        potential

public       disorder           on a        la rge       scale.

The      above     considerations                   ar e     made          and     conclusions                drawn with           the

accent       being        placed           on    segregation                in     line       with       recommendations

A   further        option would                  have       been       to     use       the N o r t h S t a n d ,           West     Stand

geographical              features              previously             described              this       would       have        meant

overlapped          and        crossed would again                          present           a     potential         public

disorder          problem        not        only within                the       county           but    further           afield.

A fina l       option            would       h av e    been      to    draw       an    imaginary           line       across        the

giving       each         set       of    supporters           a half        of    the S t a d i u m .           The     physical

would       be a       constant            one a n d      be     ever     present            both        before,       during        and

Superintendent               (Operations                and Traffic)              undertook          to    organise

Hand    made       traffic:        signs an d               parking        signs      were     used       in       1988

due    to    financial            reasons.              In    1989     the     club agr e e d         to       pay

Th e   use    of       search      squads          at    Oughtibridge                and Tankersiey                 had

the    counter          p r o d u c t i ve    effect          of    causing          undue     delays          in

coaches       and       transit         vans a r r i v i n g          at    the S t a d i u m .       For          1989:,

it w a s     decided         that       one      team        only would           be at       each    location

for    selective            checks        and      that       all     personnel           outside         the

Stadium would              be     charged with                selective           checking.           Adhesive

stickers          were     used      to      identify             vehicles        checked        to a s s i s t

officers          at    subsequent            locations.

CCTV was          u s e d at W a d s ley B r i d g e               Railway Station,                the

monitor       for       same      being       sited          in the P o l i c e         Control       Room.

This    took       up v a l u a b l e        space          and    it wa s     agreed         that    this          would

not    be    implemented             in      1989.           Having        said      that,     portable

video       cameras         had    been       purchased             for     use      fay the F o r c e         vi a

the F o o t b a l l       Trust     and       it was          decided        to      utilise       these           in

1969.

It wa s      found        that     as P h a s e         H     of    the     game a p p r o a c h e d ,         a

number       of    peripheral             serials            were     under       employed and

therefore          Serial          Instructions             were    amended           to      utilise          this

manpower          in the L e p p i n g s          Lane      and Penistone                Road North

areas       of    the       ground      throughout           this       phase       u n t il       the    'final

At    the    end       of    the      1988 S e m i      Final      ther e      wa s      a    pitch

invasion         by L i v e r p o o l        supporters          from     the N o r t h S t a n d .

Serial       Instructions               were      therefore         amended           for      1 98 9     to

ensure       and       increase         in m a n n i n g     levels       a round            the    perimeter

track       to    cate r       for     this      eventuality.

A general          complaint            was      made     regarding           the     quality            of m e a l s

catering         to     p r o v i d e a hot        meal      to all       personnel                whilst       the

game     was      in    progress.

As L e p p i n g s      Lane       traffic        island        was a     potential                flashpoint

at P h a s e      III       and a      poi nt     where      both       sets    of       supporters             would

be    c l os e   to     each       other,        the    1989 O r d e r        should          direct        extra

manpower         to     that       l o c a t i o n at     the    end     of    the       game.

If    possible,,            the S Y T     buses        in P e n i s t o n e    Road North                should

queue       closer          to C a t c h b a r    Lane     and     so    help       to       keep Nottingham

supporters             further         away      from Leppings Lane                   traffic            island.

As    an ab u n d a n c e        of    call      signs      could       lead    to       confusion,,

This      officer           has       an additional                  role        in    respect         of    policing           of

visits          each     licensee            of      public          houses           in the      surrounding              area       to

The main         thrust         behind          t h e se    reductions              was    the       fact       that       in   1988

Superintendent               Greenwood           informed          the       officers           of       the      fact     that      the

could      he    u s e d as a m m u n i t i o n .           We    found         that      there          were       stones       in that

area     but     neither          of    us w e r e     unduly          concerned.

1 then      left       Superintendent                 Greenwood            and walked               o v er     to    the S o u t h S t a n d

where      Inspector             Dar li ng was         in the          presence           of    briefing             stewards         for

t ha t   area.         One       s t e w a r d was     walking         away whilst                  the      briefing          was    in

progress         and       1 therefore           spoke       to    him.          He    t o l d me         that       he    had      heard

it all      before          but     I reminded           him      that       it wa s       important                he    paid

a t t e n t i o n as       "sods       law'     dictated          t ha t     if he        did       not      something           would

go w r o n g     in his          particular           area.

I then      proceeded             to    pa t r o l    the    perimeter            track,            South S t a n d , South

Stand      car    park,          sterile        area,       Penistone            Road North and                     returned

eventually            to    the S p i o n Kop.              During         my    t ou r    X spoke             w i t h all

officers         on    their        respective           duties         to      ensure         that       all       officers         were

performing            their       allocated           duties and           that       none          of    them       had an y

problems.             I repeated           t h is     procedure            at r e g u l a r         intervals.

At   12 n o o n as          spectators           began       to e n t e r       the S t a d i u m ,          Liverpool

supporters            were       identified           on the S p i o n          Kop    and          the      segregation             plan

at    the N o r t h        Wing      was     implemented            using         officers          from    the S p i o n K o p

Terrace        Serial.

I recall         seeing          Police         Constable          Green apprehend a youth                         in the S p i o n

Kop whilst            I was        stood        near     to   the    s e g r e g a t e d a r ea .          The     y o u t h was

wearing        a green           rugby       jersey       and was         struggling.                    X went     to    his

assistance            and       ascertained            that    the y o u t h s          had made          rude     gestures

(mas t u r bat i n g ) to            the N o t t i n g h a m       Forest         supporters.              1 helped Police

Constable          Green         t a ke     the    youth      to    the      Police          R o o m at    the     rear    of the

North       Stand      where         X left        them.       X returned               to    the S p i o n       Kop    for    a

short       while      to m o n i t o r         the m o o d    of    the      crowd and             it a p p e a r e d    good

humoured.

1 continued            to       tour      the     Serials      under         my    s u p e r v i s i o n at       regular

intervals          but      no     problems         were      being       experienced.

As    the     crowds        increased             on the S p i o n K o p a n d               the    numbers        of L i v e r p o o l

supporters            in the         segregated           area      on the K o p             increased,           then    X found

it    necessary            to    increase          the    number       of     officers             in that        area.        The

number        of L i v e r p o o l        supporters          on    the K o p          eventually          reac h e d well           in

excess        of 5 0 0 a n d         Inspector           Calvert       and        an    entire       Serial        were

eventually            utilised.

Throughout            my    t o ur     of    duties       I maintained                 personal          contact        with

Superintendent                  Greenwood and             g av e    t h at    officer           regular       updates

At    one     particular             stage        I believe         around 2.15               pm    I be came a w a r e         that

my    radio      was       transmitting             intermittently.                     By    that       I mean      I c o ul d      only

on the       self        s a me    subject.               I    then went             to    the       gymnasium and               exchanged

my    r a di o    battery          but       a t es t         transmission                revealed           no    improvement.                    I

therefore            walked        o nt o        the    perimeter            track         via       the a c c e s s       route

approximately                2.»30      pm.         I noticed             t ha t     the S p i o n K o p wa s

approximately                two       thirds          full     whilst          the N o r t h T a n d w a s               only       half

full.        Th e      West       S t a n d was         filling           nicely          but    plenty           of    empty        s e ats

were     visible            and whilst              the       two    centre          pens       were       filling         up    there was

plenty       of      room at           both North and                    South       ends       of    the     terraces.               I

remarked          on t hi s        to P o l i c e         Constable             Lamb who             was     the       first     officer               I

met    on    the       track.

I was       then       joined          by    the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s          Officer           who       stated        he

understood             t ha t     radio          problems           were     being         experienced.                   I informed

him    of    the       trouble          1 had          experienced and                    elected          to w a l k      him around

the    perimeter             track          to    the P o l i c e         Control          Ro om.          This        I did,        the     ti m e

being       approximately                   2.40       pm.      I left          the C o m m u n i c a t i o n s           Officer          at

walked       around          the       external           perimeter             of    the       Stadium;           all     was       in

the     segregated              area      that      I wished            to    speak       with     h i m at        the      rear       of

2,50     pm.

1 then         spoke       with       five      Liverpool           supporters             wh o    were       on    the S p i o n K o p

I could        see     t ha t     the       number       of       supporters               on     the p e r i m e t e r        t r a c k was

I rec al l       Liverpool             supporters             running          ov er      to    the S p i o n K o p            end,

them.

Th e    crowd     behind          the       goal       quickly       swelled             onto     the      pitch and             into     the

and     removed        to a l l o w         f re e     access     onto         the       pitch.           It was        then      driven

to     the L e p p i n g s       Lane       end.

Police       Officers            and       supporterswere             together             car ryi ng           persons          on

Spion Kop         corner          of       the    pitch and          were       administering                   mouth       to m o u t h

resuscitation               to    some.           It wa s     apparent              at    that       stage         t ha t   there       h ad

On     realising           the    potential             enormity          of    the       problem          1 ran to            the

the    dead man            to    the      gymnasium              I remember           urine          flowing          from       the      area

of    the N o r t h S t a n d U p p e r             Level         concourse           onto          us a n d     officers               were

that     a number           of       people       (exact          number        not       kn o w n )    were        laid       on       the

floor,      apparently               dead.          A number            of    relatives              and    friends            as       well     as

police      officers             were       in the         area,        many were              distressed,               some       were

angry and         directing               insults          at     the P o l i c e .            Detective            Sergeant             Smith

approached            me a n d       stated         t h at       officers          were        not     realising            the

importance            of    remaining             with       bodies          and     I a s s i g n e d h i m the d u t y of

ensuring         at    lea st         one    officer             remained          with        each     body        to    ensure

continuity..

A    number      of    officers             were      persuading              non     police           personnel            to      leave

the    gymnasium            and       I returned             to     the      pitch        to    rejoin         officers             there.

On my     return           I noticed             t ha t    the      number         of P o l i c e       Officers            on      the

perimeter         track          had      been      increased             and      I spoke           with      s om e     of     them,

reminding         them          of    the    n e ed       for     vigilance           in       respect         of     the N o t t i n g h a m

Forest      supporters               on     the S p i o n Kop.                T heir       m o od was          s ti l l     angry and

abusive       and      I formed             the     opinion            that     the m a j o r i t y         of      them       did       not

realise       the      enormity             of w h a t       ha d      occurred.

I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t           C h a p m a n at        this      end     of       the     ground         and      I spoke

with     him.         He    t o l d me       to m o n i t o r          the No 11 i n g h a m           supporters              in the

South Stand            to       ensure       a    pitch          invasion          di d     not      take      place.            Extra men

had al re ady          been          deployed         in this           area .

A    cordon      of    police          officers            had      been      formed across                 the       halfway            line

to    contain         the       Liverpool           supporters.                 On    satisfying               myself          t ha t     all

Slowly       the     mood        of       the     crowd        calmed         down and Chief                Superintendent

Superintendent              Chapman.                 That       officer         organised a                cordon across                the

    Thank you for your letter of 8 August to the Home Secretary about
    the evidence given by the football authorities to the Hillsborough
    inquiry.

    The Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc) Act 1985 has worked
    well to reduce the level of drunkeness on the way to and at
    football matches and owes much to the responsible operation of
    football special buses and coaches. There are no plans at present
    to amend the legislation although we will be examining carefully
    any recommendations that Lord Justice Taylor makes in his final
    report. We will of course discuss with you any proposed changes
    which might affect your members.

                                                             - S > '^ 0 0 / C V ^ /

                 On Saturday 15 April              1989 (150489)       I was on duty with the Vandal Squad

                  in Grange Lane, Stairfoot,               in company with the following officers

                 At 3.05pm         (1505)    this date a message was received to the effect that

                 Operation Support had been implemented at Hillsborough Football

                  stadium, we immediately began travelling towards that 1o cat ion.



             j       3.25pm        (1525) we were approaching the roundabout Leppings Lane/

      //)        Halifax Road,           traffic was so congested at this location that it was

                  decided to de-bus           leaving only the driver, PC 19S6 BOWER, with the

                 Police Freight Rover, we made our way on foot to the Penistone Road
                                                                                      PAGE        2

              entrance of the ground.     On arrival with Inspector COOPER      I attended

              at the Police room, but no officers were present.          We then made our

              way to the gymnasium area at this point I could see numerous persons

              being carried into the gymnasium on makeshift stretchers as they

              passed under the stand area I clearly saw two people throw liquid

              from plastic cup onto both P olice Officers and civilian personnel who

              were carrying the stretchers.     Before   I could act on this they

UJ       o //iiLA^disappearedback into the crowds which were in that location.        I then

           ioJ*j pined Inspector COOPER in the Gymnasium where he was liaising with
                      A/§?OG                      //2<b©€>

              Inspector COOPER informed me that we would be required to set up a

^   A & /"'//• ' temporary mortuary within the gymnasium.       In the gymnasium at the

              time were numerous bodies who in the main were accompanied by a Police

              Officer.



              There were also some casualties that were being administered first

              aid at the far end of the gym by both Police and civilian personnel.



              I could see that it was of little use the doctors certifying death

              unless we could segregate persons who had been already certified.               I

              therefore attempted to have moved persons who had already been

              certified into rows running from the bottom end of the gymnasium near

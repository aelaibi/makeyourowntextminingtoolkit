            Hillsborough
            SHEFFIELD 6


             Dear

             I refer to my telephone conversation with        in your
             absence, concerning the fixtures for the forthcoming
             season, and in particular the fixtures between Derby on
             28 December 1987 and Everton on 1 January 1988.

              As indicated, I would ask that these matches be scheduled
              to be played at 12 noon on those dates instead of 3.00pm.
              The reason for my request is based upon the need to
              maintain public safety and to avoid licensing hours,
              bearing in mind the Bank Holidays on these two dates.

              I trust you will be able to comply with my request.^

            • Yours

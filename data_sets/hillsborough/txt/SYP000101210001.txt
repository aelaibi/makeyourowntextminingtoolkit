pushing       and       jostling.               Now       not       only       were       the    tickets          waved

by    them,       red;       they       were        brown       and       blue       as    well.

Queues       by    t he      minute        are       thickening.                 A    bottle       neck          was

being    created             as    still        more        fans         arrived          pushing       and

One    could       not       now    communicate                 with       these          people       as    they

continued          to     push,         all     t he      time       hurling          abuse       and

critisising             the       'set     up'       and       crowd       control.              What       was    now

occurring          could          only     be       described             as    absolute          chaos.

Between       myself          and       t he    WPC       on    turnstile             10    was    a    flimsy

grey    barrier.              Minute           by    minute          increased             pressure          was

evident       on    this.           People           were       jumping          over       and    helping

people       over       in    order        to       try     and      jump       queues.           Eventually

it    just    collapsed             under           the     strain         and       people       fell       to    th e

floor.        No    one       attempted              to     help         them    up,       I was       10    yds       away

and    could       not       assist.            These          so    called          fans       would       not    even

help    their       own.           The-reason               not      being       inhumanity             the       reason

being    that       they          were     so       drunk,          they       weren't          aware       of    what

was    going       on     around         them.

Mounted       Police          presence              could       not       make       their       way    through

the    swarm.           Under       normal           circumstances                   order       could       have

been    restored,             since        policing             was       more       than       adequate.

However       on    this          occasion           it     was      hopeless;             the    hooligan

element       amongst             the    supporters                 would       not       co-operate.

clearly       heard          by    myself.             The      fans       were       'asked'          to    stop

    3. 00pm    Fans       had    now     moved          into        the      ground,          it       almost        seemed

               impossible             from      the       numbers            seen       before          my     five       minutes

               previously.               Fans          now     are      scaling          the       wall        and       fences,

               ignoring          pleas        from        a mounted               Merseyside                officer        not        to.

    3 . 05pm   I move       away        from       th e      turnstile             and       rejoin          my     serial          and

               walkway          to    the     turnstiles.                    It    is    now       reletively              quiet           on

               the    turnstiles.                  I    was       stood       immediately                   next     to    my

               sergeant          and     heard          via       his     personal            radio          that        there       is

               disorder          on     the    playing              surface         inside             the     ground,          and

               that       police        and    stewards                are    to    attend             this       area.         We     made

               our    way       towards        the        South         stand       from          the       rear     of    Leppings

               Lane,       past       the     police           ground         control             box       and     entered          t he

               arrived          on    the     surface             to    see       players          leaving           the       field,           I

               had    no    idea        of    the       severity             of    this       incident,              neither           I

               think       had       anyone        in     the       ground.             We    walked           up    to    the       blue

               fence       of    t he    Leppings              Lane       end      and       saw       fans       trying        to     scale

               it    and    get       onto     the        pitch.             At    first          it    was       thought           that

               they       just-wanted              to     cause         disorder             with       rival        supporters,

               what       was    not     evident             at     this      stage          was       the     magnitude             of     the

               disaster          occurring              only        feet      away       from          us    at     the    other           side

               of    the    blue        fence.

               I    ran    with       members           of     my      Serial       back          to    th e      rear     of       t he

               Leppings          Lane        end    of       the       ground.           I    entered             th e    terraces

               and    begged          fans     to       leave          via    the       rear       tunnel           so    as    we     could

               help       the    people        at       t he      front.           They       would          not     cooperate              and

               answered          me     with       comments             like       "FUCK          OFF"       and     "WEVE       PAID           TO

WATCH       A    FUCKING                MATCH".

I mads          my       way    to       the       front          of    the       terrace       and          it    was       only         .

then    did          I    realise             the       severity             of    the    incident.                    Bodies

were     piled            up    in       the       gutter          area       beneath          the       bottom          step

of    the       terrace.                 Myself          and       another          officer          had          to
                                         <

physically                throw          people          out       of    the       way    to    get          to    them.

The    first             one    we       got       to    was       a    woman       in    her       mid       twenties.

She    was       blue          and       had       barely          any       clothes       on.           She       had

obviously                unfastened                clothing             in    the       crush       before

collapsing.                    She       was       dead.           We    carried          her       to       the       rear     of

the    West          Stand          where          a St       J o h n ’s a t t e n d a n t          took          charge.

We    rushed             back       to       the    front          of    the       stand       and       brought             ou t

another          casualty,                   this       time       a    slightly          older          woman          than        the

first.           We       carried             her       to    the       rear       of    the    West          Stand          where

another          St      John's              attendant             took       over.        We       returned             to

carry       out       another                three       or       four       people       not       knowing             whether

they    were          dead          or       alive.           Not       much       attention             was       paid       to

the    removal             of       these          people,             I did       not    have       time          to    observe,

I just          had      to     get          bark       to    relieve             more    people             from       the

horrific          macabre                scenes          on       the    terraces.

It    seemed          strange                that       the       pitch       was       only    a    few          yards       away ^

and    that       why          could          they       not       be    carried          tc    there.                 The

reason       being             that          it    was       difficult             to    get    people             up    and        over

the    fences.                 In       the       meantime             police       officers             and       other

emergency             services                began          to    try       and    rip    down          sections             of

the    fence,            in a n          attempt             to    release          the    trapped                fans.

Once    there            was        a    way       through             onto       the    pitch,          I    climbed          out

onto    the       cinder                perimeter             track          and    continued                to    pull       people

free    from          the       nightmare                they          were    experiencing.

For    some       it      was           far       too    late.           Everything             p al r£ji i n t o

                                I    can    remember             very     little           detail           of    the    remainder             of     the

                               afternoon.                   I    carried         injured           and       deceased          on    advertising

                               boards,          ripped           down     by      'concerned'’ fans                     across       t he

                               playing          surface            and    to     the       gymnasium.               On    each       occasion           I

                               returned          to        the     scene;        never          once        staying       with       a    particular

                               victim,          there        always        seemed           to     be    someone          on     hand       to       assist.

                               The    hours       from           3.05pm         (1505)          passed           extremely          quickly           and
 <§                            when        it   was    apparent            that           the    ground           had    been       emptied,           due

                               to    announcements                  that        the    match          had        been    abandoned,              I

                               just        proceeded             'to s t a n d    and       stare        in       disbelief          thinking           of

                               the    events          which         had    just        occurred             on     what    should           have       been

                               a    great       day    for        British         football.

            6.00pm             Assembled          in       the     North        stand        for       debriefing.

            6.45pm             Claywheels             Lane       - meal         and        transported             back     to      Sub      Division.

            NB    The    most       upsetting          and        indeed         unbelievable                 thing       about          the     events

 #          of    that    afternoon             and    indeed          the       thing          that     churns         over        in m y       head

            time    and       time    again       since           that     fateful              day     was      the     lack    of       co-»
                     y

            operation          and    concern          for        injured         and       deceased,             from     their          own

            fellow       'supporters' .

            Why    should          emergency          services            such        as    ourselves             have     to    struggle

            through       a    crowd       to   assist            injured         and       dying       and       to    carry        victims          back

            through       these       crowds          to    torrents             of    abuse          and     insults.           All       the       time

            actions.

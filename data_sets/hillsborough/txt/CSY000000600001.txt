1.   Note of Previous Meeting.

The note of the previous meeting held on 15th December, 1982 (a copy of which had
been circulated previously) was considered and agreed.

Mr. J. Layden did observe that no reference was contained in the Note of the
possibility of retrospection of the revised charges for police services.  It
was agreed that this was so, but it was explained that this was a matter of
policy yet to be decided.

2.   Charges for Police Services.

At the meeting on 15th December, the      Chief Constable   had   been requestedto prepare
a report on   the present criteria for    levying charges   for   police services, possible
future criteria, the extent of co-operation between the Clubs and the Police, and
 the extent of community related activities already being under-taken by the
 Clubs.

 The Working Group considered a report (a copy of which had been circulated
 previously) incorporating the information requested..

 Whilst the effect of the revised criteria could not be estimated with any
 real certainty (the football clubs being charged retrospectively, based on
 the actual number of spectators present), it was likely that the total annual
 charges to Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire would be reduced by some
 £50,000 per annum. The charges would also be more in line with the charges
 made for the services of police in other areas of the country. The possible
 effect of the financial penalties and loss of grant arising from the recently
 announced rate support grant settlement consequent upon the reduced income
 which would result were outlined.      It was accepted that, looked at on a
 County wide service_basis, t h el o s s of income would not worsen the position


                                                                                           •
 significantly, but it was considered to be a factor of which the Clubs should
 be aware.                                                         ^

The Clubs acknowledged that, in the present economic situation, any assistance
which could be given would be most Welcome, and were pleased that the input which
they were m a k i n g o n community problems by the various schemes which they were
already undertaking or proposed to undertake was now being recognised.        The
problems of the unemployed were of especial concern, and Rotherham United
announced that they intended to introduce on 29th January reduced admission
charges for the unemployed. The Clubs also accepted that it would be necessary
tor the County Treasurer to have a sight of their accounts.

RECOMMENDED - That, subject to any comments of the County Treasurer after having a
sight of the Clubs’ accounts, the revised criteria set out in Paper "B" for the services of the
South Yorkshire Police at Football ^ague matches in South Yorkshire be substituted
for those currently in force (set out in Paper "A") as from a date to be agreed
by the Police Committee after consultation with Policy Advisory Sub-Committee "A".

3.   Meeting with Media Representatives

On 15th December, the Working Groups decided to consider further the problem
of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches, and to
invite media representatives to discuss the effect on the problem of media
reporting.

A dozen representatives of television, radio and the press had accordingly
been invited to be present, and the following persons were present for the
discussion:-

               I    Sheffield Star
                ^ South Yorkshire Times
               [ Sheffield Star
I'  "    '     I Morning Telegraph
i            ^ ^ a r n s l e y Chronicle
1______________ L Radio Hal lam
^_______________ , Doncaster Evening Post.

An apology for absence was received from the Editor of the Sheffield Star,
Whilst the Working Group accepted that generally the South Yorkshire based
media (and the Barnsley Chronicle and the Rotherham Advertiser in particular)
reported football matches in a factual, non-sensational, manner, the same could
not be said of certain elements of the media nationally.                 In the Working Group's
opinion, the inflammatory language and descriptions often used could have the
effect of inciting an admittedly small minority to engage in the type of incidents
which the media were criticizing.              It also had the effect of discouraging the
average supporter, the casual supporter and families from attending matches.
This particularly applied to pre-match publicity in some newspapers.                   Addit­
ionally, it appeared that Considerable space was taken up on reporting
 unruly incidents (which comprised only a very small amount of the total match
time and, in some cases, occurred outside of the grounds or in town centres), rather
than on a description of the match and, £n some cases, even_giving the match
result was omitted.             In comparison, whehre spectators were involved in incidents, the
media f r e q u e n t l y gave little or no publicity to the resultant penalties imposed by
 the Courts. A pilot scheme to overcome this problem was in hand in the Rotherham
area and, to date, was proving to be mutually advantageous.                 Certainly in South
Yorkshire, cases of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches
were being contained and were even showing signs of declining.                  In contrast,
 the media reporting of incidents appeared to be increasing.

They could not speak for their Editors, but the media represent­
atives present felt obliged to point out their duty and responsibility to the
public to report facts, even where these were unpleasant. This was not to say
that this should not be done responsibly and in a balanced manner.  Certainly,
the view could be taken that if the media had not highlighted problems such
as hooliganism/vandalism, responsible people and bodies would not now be
working together in an effort to overcome such problems. If there were
occasions when it was felt that balanced reporting had not taken place, complaints
could be made to be Editor concerned. The media did not live in an "ivory tower"
and weresensitive to public opinion. Action would be taken where it was justified.

It was agreed that the County Council's initiative in arranging meetings such as
this was welcome and a positive step.  It was only by the clubs, local and central
government agencies and the media working together for the good of the community
that the problem of hooliganism/vandalism could be contained and in time, hope­
fully overcome.  The portion of the South Yorkshire Police Report on Charges for
Police Services relating to the involvement of the Football League Clubs in
South Yorkshire with the community was circulated to the media representatives
present.

RECOMMENDED -

1. That a small Sub-Group (consisting of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the
Police Committee and two other Councillors, together with appropriate officers
and one representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire) ,
be appointed to discuss and report on the editorial policy adopted by the media
on incidents of hooliganism/vandalism at and associated with football matches.

2. That the Editors of the twelve television, radio and press organisations in
question be invited to personally meet the Sub-Group to discuss the matter.

3. That the Chairman of the Divisional Liaison Committees be requested to consider
inviting a representative from each of the Football League Clubs in South Yorkshire
to the next appropriate meeting of the Committee covering the area in which the
respective Grounds are situated.

CRITERIA FOR LEVYING CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES

The amount levied for police personnel doing duty in the stadium will
be related to crowd attendance and the incorporation of a constant
basic number.  At all times this basic number will be 1 Inspector, 2
Sergeants and 10 Constables.  The number of Constables will be increased
by 2 for each 1,000 spectators.   The number of Sergeants will be
increased in the ratio of 1 to every 10 Constables and there will be
added 1 Inspector to every 3 Sergeants or multiples thereof.   A charge
will be levied for the services of a Chief Inspector whenever one or
more Inspectors are on duty.   In addition, there will be a charge for a
Superintendent whenever the spectator attendance reaches or exceeds
40,000.  The chart below illustrates this criteria.

For the purpose of calculating the number of Constables for levying
purposes, 500 spectators and below will be disregardc?d and a figure above
500 will be 'rounded-up' to the next whole figure of 1,000, e.g. 5,073
shall be deemed to be 5,000 and 14,782_ shall be deemed to be 15,000.

These charges will be at the Special Services Rate applicable at the time.

Should a match be cancelled at short notice whereby police expenditure is
necessarily incurred, a basic charge will not be levied as is done in some
police forces, but a report will be submitted to the Assistant Chief
Constable (Management Services) for negotiations with the Secretary of the
Club for reasonable reimbursement.
PROPOSED 1982/3 CRITERIA            Police Committee     8th July 1983



CRITERIA FOR LEVYING CHARGES FOR POLICE SERVICES


The amount levied for police personnel doing duty in the stadium will
be related to crowd attendance and the incorporation of a constant basic
number.  At all times this basic number will be one Sergeant and five
Constables. The number of Constables will be increased by three for
each 2,000 spectators. The number of Sergeants will be increased in the
ratio of one to every nine Constables.  A charge will be levied for the
services of an Inspector for a gate over 9^000 and will be increased by
an additional Inspector for every four Sergeants.  In addition, there
will be a charge for a Chief Inspector whenever the spectator attendance
reaches or exceeds 35*000 and for a Superintendent whenever the gate
exceeds 49,000. The chart below illustrates this criteria.

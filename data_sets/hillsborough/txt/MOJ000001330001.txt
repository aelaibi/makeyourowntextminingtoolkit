                               Second Affidavit of Ann Marie Adlington


              I swear this affidavit to give evidence which was not available when I completed my
              affidavit or 26th February 1999. On 1st March 1999 a short hearing took place in the
              Leeds District Magistrates Court. The defendants applied to the magistrate
              unsuccessfully for the committal proceedings o f 19111April 1999 to be vacated. They
              announced that they were both applying for leave to move for judicial review o f the
              decision o f the Crown Prosecution Service o f 18thDecember 1998. I have since been
              shown a copy o f these applications, and each is applying for a stay o f the committal
              proceedings.

      2      I understand that the CPS will object to the grant o f leave, I am objecting to the grant
             o f leave, and also to the application for a stay. The matter will be heard by the judge
             on 11* March.

      3      Mr Manning, who is Mr Murray's solicitor, told the court on 1st March that he had
             applied for legal aid for the criminal proceedings. The magistrate, Mr Cadbury,
             assured Mr Manning that from the court’s point o f view, there was no difficulty at all
             in the processing o f the legal aid application while the judicial review o f the funding
             decision is outstanding. A decision on this legal aid application is imminent. Leading
             counsel for Mr Duckenfield did not say he had applied for legal aid.

          4        Mr Manning also told the court that he had not considered the provisional committal
                   bundle consisting o f 38 statements and served in August 1998 because o f fears that he
                   might not recover his costs on taxation.

           5       I produce as Exhibit AMA 7 correspondence o f the week o f 1" March dealing with my
                    requests for further information about the alleged sixty-year old practice by which
                    police authorities pay for the defence o f police officers charged, as in this case, with
                    criminal offences. Included in the correspondence is a letter from the Home Office
                    dated 8* March which refers to proceedings funded by the Metropolitan Police. It
                    contains no examples o f funding by police authorities.

           6       I am unable, for reasons that appear in that correspondence, to provide examples o f
                    such funding to the court, nor details o f the rules o f the Association o f Police
                    Superintendents as to their practices in this respect, nor particulars o f insurance
                    contracts referred to by Mr Wood atpagel3. Statutory instruments governing the
                   Police Federation provide for the funding o f police officers below the rank o f
                    Superintendent for certain categories o f crime, but I am told and believe that the
                    Association o f Police Superintendents has rules o f its own creation that do not owe
                    their origin to statute. The effect o f the statutory instruments as to the powers and
                    practices o f the Police Federation will be dealt with in the prosecution’s skeleton
                    argument.

   R V SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY AND A D LIN G TO N , EX PARTE
   CHIEF CONSTABLE O F SO U TH YORKSHIRE POLICE

   Thank you for your letter of 4 March and enclosures.

  You asked whether the Home Office can supply any information about police authorities’ practice
  of providing financial assistance to police officers in criminal procedings. This information is not
  collected by the Department. I am enclosing for information a copy of a Written Answer given by
  Mr Boateng, Home Office Minister, on 15 February in response to a Parliamentary Question from
  Christopher Chope MP about this issue. I am also enclosing a copy of Mr Boateng’s reply of 9
  February to a Question from the same MP in relation to the practice of the Metropolitan Police.
  Following that Answer ,Kate Hoey, Home Office Minister, wrote to Mr Chopc to say that the
  Metropolitan Police have provided legal assistance to eight officers facing criminal charges in the
  current financial year and that funding is continuing to three of them.

  With regard to Home Office Circular 1998, the fact that it was issued oil the day before the
  publication of the Stuart -Smith Scrutiny was entirely fortuitous. The Circular had been in
  preparation for 3 years in consultation with the police service. It was prompted not by concerns over
  criminal proceedings but because of a question relating to former officers.

  Turning to paragraph 15 of your letter, all police staff associations and the Association of Police
  Authorities were consulted about the circular. It was printed for publication and sent to all chief
  officers of police, all clerks to police authorities, and the Receiver for the Metropolitan Police
  District, on 17 February 1998.

        R r. South Yorkshire Police Authority and Adlington, ex parte C hief Constable o f the South

         1     I represent the prosecution in the criminal proceedings brought against David
                Duckenfield and Bernard Murray at Leeds District Magistrates Court for manslaughter
                and other offences. You may know that the Police Authority have held, following
                representations from the Hillsborough Family Support Group, of which I am the legal
                adviser, that it has no power to fund the defence o f these men or ancillary applications
                for judicial review. It has held, in effect, that many tens o f thousands o f pounds of
                public money were spent pursuant to its own unlawful decision.

         2     1 write to you because you were the author o f the fax from the Home Office to
                Garretts o f 4lh February 1999 (Annex A) and, on the advice o f leading counsel, 1 seek;

                       (A) factual assistance about the alleged practice o f funding by police authorities
                       o f the defences o f policemen charged with crime; and

                       (B) information about the origins o f a Home Office Circular, HOC 4/1998, to
                       put before the Divisional Court this month.

         3     The Chief Constable is seeking judicial review o f the decision o f his Police Authority.
               The hearing will take place on 22nd 23rd and 24,h March. The Chief Constable seeks to
                rely heavily on the two Home Office circulars, 4/1998 and 77/87. I enclose for your
                guidance a copy o f the grounds and supporting material (Annex B ), which include a
                copy o f the circulars. Paragraphs 22 to 26 and 29 emphasise them. The letter dated

                      to them, and argues that there is a practice o f at least sixty years standing, under which
                      funding o f this kind is given by police authorities. It contends that your letter of 4lh
                      February, by contrast, “"appears to cast some doubt on the matter.”

            4         The letters from the President o f ACPO and the Superintendents Association (Exhibit
                      ID 4) offer support for the existence o f the alleged practice, while citing no examples,
                      and the second o f these seems also to imply that the practice is supported by the 1998
                      Circular.

            5         We received yesterday a copy o f the Police Authority’s affidavit (Annex ( ' is a copy of
                      the affidavit and relevant exhibits). Paragraph 34 appears to suggest that the Authority
                      was misled by the Circular.

            6         It is obviously very rare, and probably unprecedented, to find a Chief Constable
                       seeking judicial review o f a decision o f his Police Authority. We believe that both the
                       Chief Constable as Applicant, and the Police Authority as the First Respondent, will
                       seek in court to attribute the confusion and embarrassment o f the decisions made in
                      this case to the suggested ambiguity o f the advice o f the Home Office.

            7         As the prosecutor, I have been joined as Second Respondent in the judicial review
                      proceedings. The prosecution’s case is that the Circulars did not mislead the
                      Authority, It was the advice o f Mr Daines, Assistant Chief Constable, that misled it in
                      August 1997 and February 1998. In both cases, the terms of the 1987 Circular were
                      misquoted. It is also our case that the practice for which the Applicant and First
                      Respondent contend does not exist, 1 have asked them both for examples of the
                      provision o f such financial assistance in criminal cases, but have been given none.

            Home Office information sought

            8         Can the Home Office supply any information about this practice. Are there any
                      examples? My understanding is that police officers who are prosecuted are defended
                      either through legal aid or at the expense o f the Police Federation or Superintendents
                      Association.


            The August lV Jl 7 report

            9         You will see that part o f the Circular o f 1987 was quoted in a Report written by Mr
                      Daines and Mr Wilkinson among others, in August 1997 (part o f Annex C, page
                      numbers 27-30), Paragraph 3.14 cites only an extract from page 1 o f the 1987
                      Circular. Paragraph 3:15 cites section 111 o f the Local Government Act 1972. The
                      presentation o f that report secured the application of as much as £500,000 if necessary
                      to be set aside for expenses and legal costs for use of the force in connection with the
                      “Scrutiny” o f evidence conducted by Lord Justice Stuart Smith and, if necessary,
                      individual serving and retired officers. In the event only f 11,000 was used before the
                      private prosecutions were started, but the Applicant tells us that very significant sums
                      have been spent since.

                                                                2

           The February 199H Circular

           10      On 17"' February 1998, the Home Office replaced the 1987 Circular with immediate
                   effect, the day before the publication o f the report o f Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
                   “Scrutiny'’ into the history o f the investigations in this case. Like Mr Dames’ report of
                   August 1997, but unlike the 1987 Circular, the new Circular refers to section 111 of
                   the 1972 Act.

           11      I have concluded that the new Circular was published because the Horne Office wanted
                    it to be clear, after some enquiry about potential private prosecutions from the South
                    Yorkshire police or their lawyers, that there was no power in the Police Act for police
                    authorities to provide financial assistance for the defence in criminal trials, and that it
                    was thought that the 1987 Circular made that insufficiently clear. I note that ACPO,
                    the Superintendents Association and other police bodies contributed to this new
                    Circular.

          The tinvision o f 27* February 1998

           12      You will see in paragraph 8 o f Mr Daines’ Grounds for applying for judicial review an
                   extract from the resolution of the 27,t’ February 1998. On that day the Authority
                   purported to apply the 1987 circular which had been replaced by the 1988 Circular
                   with immediate effect nine days before. Mr Daines, the Assistant Chief Constable, was
                   present, as you will see from the public records of the Authority that I have obtained
                   (Annex /)), although he does not say so in the Grounds or the affidavit.

           13      On this occasion, the Authority was palpably misled about the criteria that should have
                   been applied even under the 1987 Circular. On page 2 o f the 1987 Circular it is made
                   absolutely clear that in the case o f private prosecutions, support may be awarded if the
                   officer "'acts in good faith and exercises his judgment reasonably.” You will also see
                   that the Resolution applied only one part of the test. The second part of the test was
                   referred to neither in August 1987 nor in February 1998.

           14      The consequence o f this is that “tens o f thousands of pounds o f defence costs have
                   already been spent” (see Grounds, part of Annex B, paragraph 34.) The report of
                   Lord Taylor in 1989 and the Scrutiny o f 1997-8 concluded that the conduct o f which
                   the defendants are accused had been “a blunder o f the first magnitude" and that
                   Duckenfield had lied about his decision to open the gates. The South Yorkshire police
                   has accepted the reports. The Chief Constable has never disputed that there was
                   negligence. The failure to bring the attention of the Authority’s members to the
                   requirement o f “acting reasonably” was therefore critical to the decision.

           15      I do not understand why the Authority and Mr Daines did not refer to the 1998
                    Circular in February 1998. I should be very grateful to know from your records who
                    participated in the preparation or publication o f the 1998 Circular, made
                    representations, and was informed directly o f its publication on 17"* February. Were
                    the South Yorkshire police force aware of it? I do hope you can provide me with
                    information about this aspect o f the case.

                                                              3

        16      The Grounds, affidavit o f Mr Daines and supporting documents from other senior
                police officers have alleged that this is a matter o f “national importance” and “extreme
                urgency", and the ruling on the matter may be of far-reaching impact. The
                Hillsborough case is o f course deeply controversial. I enclose a copy o f my affidavit
                which sets out our concerns. (Annex E) 1 shall send you a copy o f its substantial
                exhibits on request You will see that we complained to the Authority only after we
                had become concerned at the apparent abuse o f public money.

       The urgency o f this request

        17      The Applicant has secured a very early hearing o f the case, to which we have not
                objected, but you will appreciate that my request is urgent. I undertake on the advice
                of leading counsel that I will disclose the contents o f your reply to all other parties,
                whether it helps our submissions or not. I shall also copy this letter to Maria Eagle
                MP who has asked questions about this in Parliament, referred to in Annex B.

        Finally, you may also wish to know that some o f the Hillsborough mothers expressed their
        concerns in this matter to the Home Secretary at a meeting of the Association of Police
        Authorities in Blackpool on 6th November.

          Dear Mr Metcalf

          R r. South Yorkshire Police Authority, ex parte Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire Police

          We have today received a letter from Mr R.J. Wood, Chair of the Chief Police Officers' Staff
          Association, in which he writes,

                             “It is the uncertainty that surrounds the advice and discretion which lies with
                             the police authority that has necessitated the provision o f legal expenses
                             insurance funded by individual officers through their Staff Association.”

          1 enclose a copy, and shall embody it in supplementary evidence. You will see at once that, in
          spite o f the other assertions in the letter, this calls into question the practice for which the
          Chief Constable contended in his affidavit. It also suggests that there are contracts between
          the staff associations and insurers which must contain some provision about the availability of
          other forms of finance. It is not to be expected that an insurer would pay if there was a settled
          practice under which police authorities paid,

          Similarly one would not expect a police authority in receipt o f public funds to give financial
          assistance to officers if they could obtain such assistance from their staff associations’
          insurance. Is it perhaps the case that the acts alleged against the officers are outside the terms
          of the insurance, given that the Chief Constable has admitted liability for negligence?

          On 5,h February the Chief Constable told a press conference that the funding o f the judicial
          review was being met from his own budget. Presumably no insurance policy covers it either.
          1 invite the Chief Constable to explore and clarify this, in the course o f his evidence in reply, in
          the light of the assertions made in his first affidavit and in press releases about the ‘‘‘■practice”
          of police authorities.

       Dear Mr Wood

       Thank you for your letter dated 25lh February, which I received only today. I wonder if you
       would kindly clarity the second paragraph under the number “2". Does the insurer agree to
       fund costs irrespective of any power in a police authority to give financial assistance, or only
       if, for example, the authority declines? Do insurers agree to give assistance only if there has
       been a denial o f negligence or fault, for example? It is not reasonable to believe that an
       insurer would agree to pay if a police authority was in the habit of paying as a matter of settled
       practice.

       Similarly, it is not clear why police authorities are willing to give financial assistance from
       hard-pressed public funds if insurers are under an obligation to pay.

       1 should again be very grateful for your assistance.

Dear Mr Harlock

R v. South Yorkshire Police Authority, ex parte ( 'hicf ( ‘onstahh o f South Yorkshire Police

We have today received a letter from R.J. Wood, Chair of the Chief Police Officers’ Staff

             Dear Ms A dlington

             As Chair of the C hief Police O fficer's Staff Association/ Mr N ew in g has asked m e to
             respond to the points enum erated in your letter o f 25 February, 1999.

             1,         A dvice and guidance to police authorities on financial assistance to police
                        officers in legal proceedings is contained in H om e O ffice Circular 4/1998. I am
                        sure you w ill have a copy o f the Circular but a copy is enclosed in case you have
                        not seen it.

                          Provision o f financial assistance to officers involved in civil proceedings appears
                          to be beyond doubt by virtue o f Section 88 of the Police A ct 1996.

                        The provision o f legal assistance in criminal proceedings is, however, less
                        certain as explained in the Circular.

             2.         This is a matter o f national concern. A s expressed in the Circular it has always
                        been regarded as an im portant principle that police officers should be able to

                       ca n y out their duties in the confidence that their police authority w ill support
                       them, if they act in good faith and exercise their judgem ent reasonably.

                       It is the uncertainty that surrounds the advice and the discretion w hich lies with
                       the police authority that has necessitated the provision o f legal expenses
                       insurance funded by ind ividu al officers through their Staff A ssociations.

              3.       It is very im portant for the m orale o f officers that this issue is resolved as early
                       as possible, given the basic principle at 2 above.

              4.       ACPO does n ot have the pow er to fund the defence o f the officers.

              5.       The question is answ ered at (2) above.

              On a more general note it has alw ays been the case to m y know ledge that in the
              exercise of discretion as to costs in our courts th at in general, no attention is paid to the
              fact that a plaintiff or defendant is entitled, in right o f his mem bership of a Staff
              Association to legal representation. H is right to an order for costs depends in the
              ordinary case upon the m erits o f his claim thereto. The fact that his Staff Association
              supports him through legal expenses insurance is considered as irrelevant to the fact
              that he m ight have borrow ed the m oney on terms that he w ould not be expected to
              repay.

              I, therefore, consider that the mere fact that an officer has been provided w ith legal
              representation by h is Staff A ssociation is irrelevant to the question whether an
              application for reim bursem ent should be granted either by a court or in this case the
              police authority. It is the first tim e, to m y know ledge, that the legality of the authority
              approving reim bursem ent o f legal costs from public funds has been challenged.

              I hope this inform ation is o f value to you.

              Yours sincerely,


                   ^               -

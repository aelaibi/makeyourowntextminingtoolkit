                  contained          Liverpool                 supporters.                 Several             of    these          vehicles              were     -found

                to     have     small              amounts         of    drink        on    board          but           on    only       2    occasions

                  (1   coach       driver              and     1   min-bus           driver)          were          the       drivers          reported            for

                  summons       as          it     was    apparent            from      the      quantities                   of    alcohol            found       on

presence.                 No    passenger             was       reported          on    my       instructions                     and    a

.disclaimer               was    obtained             from       one       person       on       board         for       the       total- a m o u n t

taken       from          each       vehicle.              I would          conclude             that       the      amount             taken        from

these       vehicles             when          one    considers             the    number            involved             was       minimal.

It    is    also          fair       to    say       that       some       fans    had       learned             their            lesson        from

the    previous                year       and       had    either          drank       alcohol            prior          to       reaching           the

checkpoint                or    as    happened             with       2    vehicles          parked            in    the          village           and

obtained             a    drink       at       the    local       public          house.             Apart           from          the odd

supporter                who    was       ’h a p p y ’ w i t h        drink       the       remainder                a p p e a r e d sober at

the    checkpoint.

All    were          in    good       spirits             and    we       sensed       no    animosity.                    It w a s          also

evident          after          about          2.30pm       <1430)          very       few       coaches            or    mini-buses

passed          our       checkpoint.

At    2 . 45pm           <1445)       we       travelled          to       C l a y w h e e 1s Lane             for       refreshments

arriving             at    approximately                   3.00pm          <1500).           1    cannot            recollect                t he

exact       route          we    took          to    Claywhq^f^Jftut               no       one      in     the      vehicle             made        any

comment           about          fans          etc.       outside         the ground.

Some       of     my       serial          had       just       obtained their               meal       from         the      mobile

canteen           and          I was       in    the       queue       when 1 heard              a     radio         message             to     the

effect          that       there          was       trouble       with        fans      at       the      Leppings                Lane       end.

Although             unable          to    recollect             the       exact       words         spoken          I was          under           t he

distinct             impression                there       was    some        fighting.                My      serial             immediately

got    back          into       the       vehicle          and    travelled             to       the      Leppings                Lane       end,

parked          up       the    vehicle             and    were       instructed             by      some        Inspector               to     form a

cordon          with       other          officers          to    prevent          further             fans          e n t e r i n g the

ground.              This       cordon          stretched             the     full      distance               from       pavement              to

pavement             in    front          of    the       turnstiles.              There          were         still          a    number           of

fans       milling             about       outside          in    the       roadway,             some       of      whom          approached

the    cordon             with       tickets.              These          fans    were       told         by     someone            that        th e
  /
match       had          been    stopped             and    they          would    get       in      before          it       restarted.

                                                                                                                                                             /

On    arrival       at       the       Leppings             Lane       end,       initially,             there          were       no

supporters          at       the       turnstiles,                therefore,                I assumed          they          were       all

within       the    ground.              1 was          still          not    aware          what       had    actually             happened
 \. .
inside       the    ground.

My    serial       stayed          within          this          cordon       for       some       10 m i n u t e s .             During          this

time    there       was       a    verbal          request             for    more          officers          to    go       inside          the

ground,       I believe                onto       the       pitch,       and       this       request          was       fulfilled                by

other       serials          that       were       just          arriving          at       the    Leppings             Lane       end.           It

became       apparent             after       a    further             short       period          of    time       that          our

presence       at       this       location             was       doing       little          to    assist          whatever

situation          had       developed             inside,             therefore,             my    serial          moved          in    through

an    open    gate       to       the    rear          of    the       West       stand,

I would       add       whilst          we    were          in    this       cordon          position          an       ambulance .

arrived       at    the       Leppings             Lane          end    and       was       allowed       access             to    on©       of    the

open    gates„

Once    inside          the       ground          and       tQ .th^, p a r             of    the    W«?st. s t a n d .I w a s

confronted          by       hundreds             of    Liverpool             supporters                milling          about          in    the

area    some       quite          obviously             distressed.                    The    tunnel          which          leads

underneath          the       stand          to    the       terracing             was       cordoned          off       by       officers.

There       were    fans          lying       on       the       ground       to       the    rear       of    the       West       stand          and

in    the    vicinity             of    the       tunnel.              Most       of    these       fans       had       someone

attending          to    them,          police          officers             or    otherwise             and       it    was       at    this

point       that    S u p t . Marshall                  emerged          from          the    tunnel          and       instructed                that

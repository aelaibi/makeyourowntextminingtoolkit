 Our Ref:    ART/AS/1429                         Your Ref:              22nd September 1989


To: All Football League Clubs


Dear Sirs

Following the extensive investigation into crowd control and safety at the Public Inquiry
into the Hillsborough Disaster, The Football Association consider that the Memorandum on
Crowd Management dated 18th November 1985 has been superseded by the Interim Report produced
by Lord Justice Taylor. In addition, the Crowd Safety Memorandum and Certificate printed on
pages 342-345 of the current Association Handbook should be disregarded (our letter of 1st
September 1989 refers).

The Football Association have therefore compiled a new document entitled "Crowd Safety
Information" in which we have extracted the recommendations from the Taylor Report which, we
believe, will be a helpful guide to all Football League clubs. Also contained are extracts
from the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edition) (the Green Guide). The                         -
recommendations take the form of guidelines but represent, in the words of Lord Justice                              1
Taylor himself, "the minimum necessary to ensure that existing football grounds can for the                          '
present be safely used." In addition these are meant to complement the recommendations that
Mr Justice Popplewell set out after his Inquiry at Bradford.

We are aware that many clubs will already have implemented the recommendations.
Nevertheless, there have been suggestions in the press that even some of those asterisked (to
be carried out before the 1989/90 season starts) have not been implemented. These
allegations must be a matter of concern to all those involved in football and it is hoped the
enclosed document will give you a convenient reference point from which to ensure that safety
issues get the priority they deserve. It is issued with the support of The Football League
and recent communications from FIFA endorse many of the recommendations. It may be that
further recommendations are made when the final report is published at the end of the year.

One of the issues Lord Justice Taylor has still to deal with is the problem of ticket touts.
The Football Association have been advocating the undesirability of touts for many years and
see the main problems as:

(i)         bona fide supporters without a ticket can only obtain one at an inflated rate;

(ii)        a build up of non-ticket holders outside the grounds; and

(iii)        rival supporters may end up in the same area thus reducing the effect of segregation.


Whilst appreciating all the difficulties associated with the removal of ticket touts, we urge
clubs to do their utmost to minimise the number outside grounds.



Continued.                       Registered Office: 16 Lancaster Gate, London W2 3LW

    The Football Association will, in all probability, be making a further submission to Lord
    Justice Taylor and would, therefore, be interested to receive, within the next fourteen days,
    any comments on the recommendations with special reference to any difficulties encountered by
    your particular club.
    I also take this opportunity of informing you that Adrian Titcombe of this Office is now
    undertaking the role of Crowd Management Co-ordinator and will be pleased to discuss these
    and related matters.

    Yours faithfully

  115. Where there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these
  should be at least 1.1 metres and not more than 1.4 metres in
  width.

  between barriers conforming to the greater strength requirements
  of crush barriers as described above; column B provides the maximum
  distances between barriers conforming to the lesser strength

  requirements. Interpolation may be made between these figures.

  117. A distinction is made between barrier intervals required in
  "peak” viewing areas. The term "peak" viewing areas describes the
  most popular parts of the terraces where there is a tendency for
  spectators to crowd together and become so emotionally involved in
  the occasion that their reactions can cause additional pressures to
  be set up in those sections of the ground. The peak viewing areas
  are particularly associated with football grounds and are typically
  behind the goal areas, although other parts of the terraces known
  locally may come within this category.

Terraces and viewing slopes
    221. Where crush barriers meet the strength and spacing guidelines
    of Chapter 9 the capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should be
    assessed from the area available for standing by allowing a packing
    density of between 54 and 27 persons per 10 square metres depending
    upon the condition of the terrace or slope. Only those parts of
    the terrace or viewing slope from which the whole of the playing
    area can be seen, excluding gangways, should be included in this
    calculation.

    222. The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:

     (a) 54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or viewing
           slope is in good condition (as set out in Chapter 8); and

     (b) 27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially deviates
           from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a
           possible hazard to individuals closely packed.
                                                                                                      SEPTEMBER 1989

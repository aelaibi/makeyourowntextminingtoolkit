            I am a Detective Chief       Inspector             in the South Yorkshire Police and I

            am in charge of the Force Drugs Squad.

           On Saturday 15th April        1989 I was on duty and attending a seminar at

            the Royal Hallamshire Hospital at Sheffield from 10am that day.

            Inspector EDDLESTON and Sergeant TURNER of the Force Scenes of Crime

            Department were also present at this meeting.

           About 3. 25pm     (1525)   that date the meeting was                       interrupted by the

           announcement that the hospital had been placed on a ’ ’Disaster alert'

           following a serious incident at the Hillsborough Football Ground.With

           my two colleagues      I immediately left the meeting and we contacted

           Police Headquarters Force Control.

           We were directed to the Casualty Department at the hospital                                       to set up

           a preliminary casualty bureau.
                                                                             PAGE    Z
                                                                             S1825

However on arrival     there we found that     Inspector Michael YOUNG was

present with othej uniformed officers and the Casualty reception/

bureau proper w j/s   in operation. We then left the hospital and being

aware that    '^Operation S u p p o r t ' ' had been activated to Hammerton Road

Police Sfya/i o n , I went there.

About 4.33pm that date I spoke to Detective Chief             Inspector ADDISON at

that station,    he briefed me as to the nature of the incident

indicating that there were fatalities,         I then reported to Chief

Inspector McROBBIE in the canteen area of the station. He was booking

officers   in and allocating jobs.

I was not given one and went to the stations          control   room to record my

presence and to contact Detective Chief Superintendent ADDIS who

was at the Hillsborough ground.

Due to radio and telephone traffic,         also his involvement     in obvious

urgent matters    contact was not made.

Detective Superintendent McKAY arrived at the station from the ground

and briefed those C.I.D.      officers    present to update the

pos it io n ., We were told to standby whilst n e e d e d .

I had by then joined up with Chief         Inspector BETTISON,    numerous

detectives,    some special   c o n s t ab l es . (I recall a female officer who

was   later fully involved with us) and some unifornmed personnel.

I was aware of the attendance at the station of numerous Social

Workers who remained in the canteen area.

A short time later     it was announced that relatives and friends of

missing supporters were being       'bussed'   up to the station.     It was

assumed that this     course of action was to enable details of missing

persons to be recorded     in a more     comfortable setting and to provide an

opportunity to enable care and counselling         to be given to those        in

need.

I became   involved with other senior police officers,          particularly Mr
                                                                             PAGE     3
                                                                             S 1825

BETTI SON, Supt's SLEATH and licKAY in talks with the local vicar who

was also in      the station.    He agreed to open up the nearbye Church Hall

so that it could be a reception area for these           people. Arrangements

were made for the nearbye        "Boys C l u b ’ to be opened for the same

pur po s e.

The Social Workers went to these        locations to provide a counselling

and aid service.

With Chief     Inspector BETTISON I set about directing officers to

transform the     •new’ C1D office so that      it could be used as a Missing

Persons Bureau.     Officers were given instructions to carefully obtain

descriptions/details        of all missing   persons and to complete a Form CID

47 in respect of each.         (South Yorkshire Police Missing Persons Report

Form).    The office was set out with rows of desks with officers             in

attendance at each desk. Throughout the evening a hundred and forty

one   (141)   people were    reported missing at the match.     I collated all

the CID 47 forms which were completed and made an ongoing            log to

enable quick     reference to be made.

Where    possible officers made on the spot enquiries by phone with the

Casualty Bureau or by assisting the          concerned   people to make telephone

calls to their homes or the homes of other          interested parties.

Occasionally the person         reported missing was     located at hospital and

some had even arrived home.

It was evident that some        people had become detached from their groups

and had travelled back home by alternative means.            I was also aware

that a Holmes Computer System had been set up in the station.

I passed the completed CID 4 7 * s through to the room of this operation

where    I believe they were photocopied and the copy taken to the

Hillsborough ground to be used in the identifications of the dead or

for other enquiries to be made. The methodology was that groups of

people who had lost friends/relatives were brought from the two
                                                                                           PAGE    4
                                                                                           S1SS5

              reception areas to our office so that the necessary information could

              be recorded.   They were then taken back to the          care of the Social

              Wo rke r s .Many times the Social Workers     came to our office to make

              enquiries on behalf of people they were helping.

              During this long period a regular supply of food and drinks was

              supplied by local      people.    The atmosphere of the station was one of

              care and compassion for these obviously distressed people.

              About   1 am (0100)    the next morning    it became    clear that no other

              people were    coming to report missing      persons.   Chief Supt. MOLE was

              informed and instructed Chief         Inspector BETTISON and myself to attend

              at the temporary Mortuary at Hillsborough.         We   remained there until 4am

              working with Detective         Inspector CHARLES who was    involved with body

              identification and property listing.

              We checked the Missing from Home reports against the list of deceased

              in order to seperate the remainder so that they could be used to

              assist the possible      identification of the other bodies.

              I handed the Register and the two bundles         of CID 4 7 ’s to D e t .

              Inspector CHARLES.       1 left the area and took no further       part.

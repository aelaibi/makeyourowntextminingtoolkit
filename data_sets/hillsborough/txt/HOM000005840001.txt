            Dear M r Addison

            HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
            Thank you for yo ur letter of 9 A u gu st the co ntents of which I will r eport to
            the A u t h o r i t y at the ea rl i e s t opportunity. However, I have to advise you
            that tomorrow's m e e t i n g has been can celled as a re sult of the N AL 60 action.

            I would also take this o p p o r t u n i t y to refer again to the question of damages
            w hi ch was raised by the Home O f fi ce at our f irst meeting. At the time, on
            the basis of d i sc us sio ns which had then taken pla ce with our Insurers, I
            stated that I felt that the total i nsu rance cover of £8im would be adequate
            for any eventuality. I can venture no f u rth er at pres ent than to say that
            the Insurers have r a d i c a l l y changed their a dvice in the light of the
            progress of the inq ui ry and the p ub li cat io n of the report. It m a y well be
            that the A u t h o r i t y will have to m a k e pr ov isi on in closing the accounts for
            the current ye ar for damages in excess of the in su ra nce cover.

            Yours si nce re ly




            Clerk and Financial Off ic er

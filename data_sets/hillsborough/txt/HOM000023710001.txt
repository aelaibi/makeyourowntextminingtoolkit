  Dear Mr. Whalley,

  You will remember the correspondence between you and
  Mr. Pickup regarding the Sports Council's submission
  to the Inquiry.

  We have been in correspondence with Mr. P.E. Bolton
  regarding aspects of the Green Guide and of the
  international work going on through the CEN process,                     and
  also the work that we are ourselves putting in.

  Mr. Bolton suggested that some of our technical points
  could be made to Prof. Maunder who is chairing a small
  working group.   If you agree, we will make contact
  either through you or directly.

  I look forward to receiving your advice.


  Yours sincerely




  GERAINT JOHN
  Chief Architect and Head
  Technical Unit for Sport

                 We remained in that a>vea for about an hour and a half = We then made

                  our way to TNqe Midland Railway Stn, where we were engaged in

                 monitoring fans a H i v i n g             on trains and getting them onto buses that

                 we re tak ing them to the g r o u n d .

We continued throughout the morning and the afternoon.                For the most

part it was orderly?    up until the second from last bus left this

would be about 1443 hrs     (1443).    I had cause to speak to four

Liverpool fans because of their disorderly behaviour?               they were put

onto the bus and as a result of a further argument with an officer on

the bus three of those youths were ejected from it.                 I spoke to one of

them to calm him down and although it was clear he had been drinking

he was not drunk.     This youth was about 5 s10 half caste? wearing a

simulated leather jacket with a number of gold              chains he had short

black hair? and blue jeans he was about 24 years old.                He and his

friends decided to get a taxi to the ground.              <35?®®       *^ 5 0     -

We continued our duties until the last bus had left and tb-en at 1450

hrs   (1450) we started mobile transit patrol           in the Pond Street a r e a :

the whole ser'taj^ was there at that stage

At just before   1500~*ttrs (1500) we were "tti^e'cted to Hillsborough

football ground at all speed? although I had a personal                radio    I did

not hear for what specific reason? my radio at that stage I was tuned

to WeslN^ar control    but on the way I retuned to Football             control, to

find out what%was going on but all          I could hear were garbled messages,
              Ns^
We arrived at the ground just after          1500 hrs    (1500).,    The van stopped

on P & ^ s t o n e Road near to the gates    leading to the area between the

Spion Kop and the North Stand.

We all   left the van and went to that area near to the gym and joined a

number of other officers who were already there.              The rumour was that

there was a pitch^invasion but there was no information coming over

the radio.

With PS COLTON and mv s e r i ^ L w e were directed onto the pitch area?                the

match had already stopped but I cSnrt remember if the players were

still out or not.      1 could see a   large number of fans on the pitch at

the Leppings Lane end right across the pitch.
                                                                              PAGE

          We were directed to stand along the North StandNg         acing the crowd,

          We   ,ood there for a number of minutes there were noMsrders being

          given and no one knew what was going on together with other officers I

          decided we were doing no good where we were as the real emergency was

          on the pitch and we went towards the centre of the pitch to stop the

          Liverpool fans getting towards the Nottingham Forest fans             that

          stage   I was unaware of the events at the Leppings Lane end and still

          thought it was a/pitch invasion with the possibility of a fight

          ensuing and we were geared up for that.

          I could then see officers going     into the South Stand and North Stand,

      j   I then wafte^d towards the Liverpool supporters on the pitch and told
 m
          them to go back iMqere were still    no orders or instructions on the

          rad io and no senio roy^ijcers to be s e e n .

          I moved through the supporters and could see a number of people lying

          on the pitch around the goal area.       Maby were half naked and I could

          see that many were c 1eary dead. There were\Poi ice Officers St Johns

          Ambulance staff and civilians     rendering resuscitation to casualties.

          1 saw a group around one young male remove an oxygen mask.

          People were running everywhere and I could see Police helmets being

          thrown in the air   in the Le>m.ngs Lane terracing.

          By now I was about 20 yards fromNJ.he fencing at that end towards the

          centre of the pitch.     I could see de^t a\id injured being put on

          hoardings and carried off towards the gym area,

          Four supporters ran towards me with a lad they were carrying?      they

          cried to me to help him?.one of them said he's my brother,      1 applied

          mouth to mouth and cardiac resuscitation someone I think it was a

          Police Officer shouted "Don'' t let ti^to know people are dead."      Despite

          my attempts I could not revive the lad rve was clearly dead.
Dei       1 put blue anorak that was lying nearby o v \ his face?     the four men

          one being a PC carried over a hoarding,, we pu.t\him on the hoarding and
                                                                             PAGE         4
                                                                             S371S

 he was carried away by^them.

 I would describe this lad aV^being ^about 18 years old with auburn

 coloured hair,   he was naked from 't-He) waist up I think he had blue

 jeans on.   He was clean shaven with short hair.         I have seen his

 picture in the SH^ffield Star but I can't remember          his name

 I then saw another yo'tHsh on the ground       near to me. He was alone with

 nobody with him.     I again attempted resuscitation but to no avail.               He

 was also dead.     I think he was carried away on a hoarding.          He was

 lying about 25 feet from the goals and         slightly to the right on      the

i^North Stand side of the pitch.

 This youth was fully clothed with dark         hair, again not long,   he    was in

 his early 20*s that*s all      1 can remember about him.

 All around me I could see Police Officers struggling with football

 fans.   As 1 looked towards the fencing I saw a St Johns Ambulance

  oman leaning over a half naked man,       I saw 3 Liverpool    fans push her

 ovetNjnto her back.     .

 I then safcjpc David ILLINGSWGRTH he was at the fencing trying with

. other officers to pull a body through,          crowd around him were

 shouting and \ c r e a m i ng at him and the other officers.    I was then

 joined by WPC AI_h4~N, she said,    " I ’m frightened t h e r e ’s nothing we can

 do."

 It was clear she needed \ ^ n s o 11ing so I took away and led her towards

 the Dir ectors area in the SoiT^h Sfcand.

 As the bodies were being taken away across the pitch the Nottingham

 fans were cheering as if a goal had been scored.          Someone   pushed me in

 the back and pulled at^my-^coat with such force that the zip broke open

 I d i d n ’t see who did it.   I waKvery   frightened I still didn't know

 the extent of the incident,      there w*^s no information on the radio and

 I could see no officer taking command,

 we went to the entrance of the players tumsel and into a room at the
                                                                            PAGE
                                                                            S3718

end of it ? in an effort to find out what was going on, there were a

number of people

were crying.
                    in there, all


                                     \
                                         X
                                         i 1ians it was very quiet and some

                                          \
                                                N H 't i& i?
A man came to us he said he was the deputy Chief Constable from

Liverpool    he was in civilian clothes.        He ''a'^keji where he could find

the man in charge ? we told him we d i d n ’t know but WPC ALLEN directed

him up some stairs to where we believed the control            room was.    He

told us to wait h e ?d be back if he co uld n8t find anyone.

We waited for about    10 minutes and when he h a d n ’t return I went back

onto the pitch.

A few Sergeants seemed to have taken control and one who I d o n ’t know

told me to form a line with other officers across the centre of the

pitch a s he feared a clash between the rival fans.

I stood in that line?     bodies were still being taken from the pitch

still with the Nottingham Fans      cheering each one.

A large number of Liverpool fans came towards us some were crying and

others shouting?    some at us but mostly at the Nottingham Fans.

Hysteria had taken over and the atmosphere was electric.

I saw officers from the line quite a number young in service walk into

the Liverpool    fans and try and calm them d o w n .

Although under considerable stress        X saw them act in a professional

manner and saw none over react to        the     situation. The sergeant near to

me kept saying*    " Do n 9t leave the line."

He said,    "Who the fucks   in charge   and     why a r e n ’tthere any messages

over the ground speafcsers. "

1 then saw    the youth w h o \ had spoken to at the Midland Station he was

shaking his fist at us and tfte Notts fans and screaming abuse.

Later I saw Ch Supt NESBITT a n d \ u p t fRATT on the pitc h, NESBITT

was reassuring the f a n s .   The situation slowly calmed down and we

slowly started to clear the pitch with the fans leaving via the
                                                                              PAGE       6
                                                                              S3'?' 18

         ter rac in g .

         I again saw PC ILLINGWORTH and he said he'd lost his helmet.        We

         talked briefly and I then left the pitch area and ws began to hear

         messages on the radio that fights were taking place.        I saw Sgt COLTON

         he told me to somehow get back to the Station.        I joined another

         transit serial and wentXto a number of public order incidents and then
                                  x
         onto Midland Station where \ again saw PS COLTON and eventually went

         back to West Bar and left duty\^t about 1700 hrs C170Q).

         My observations on the day^a>s^ thksJPj/lice constables acted bravely and

         professionally as did the St JohnV^ambulance and Liverpool fans who
                          -                    -----------------------------
         acting on their own initiative undoubtedly saved many more from being

         killed.      Their
                                                      \
                              initiative and ability to iNLse to the situation was in

         marked contrast to the senior officers present at the game.

                                                                             'SIGNED

              Further to my statement dated 12th January 1990 (120190)                     in which I

                refer to a young lad to whom I gave mouth to mouth.                   I described the

                lad as having auburn hair and describe placing a blue anorak over his

               shown from the rear      (the officer without the helmet)     is myself.     Lying

               to the le ft ? on the pitch,,     is a blue anorak?   that is the anorak     I

               refer to previously and. in my original statement.

               The three photographs        I refer to all show me at various stages of

  REGULATION 7 NOTICES

  In today's telephone conversation you asked for my opinion on the need to formally read
  out loud the contents of the notice to the officer when serving Regulation 7 notice.

  I am of the opinion th a t provided the notice has been signed by the Investigating Officer
  and the person serving the notice is of sufficient rank, and in the circum stances we are
  discussing had no involvement with Hillsborough on the day, be able to take a verbal
  sta te m e n t should the officer receiving the Regulation 7 notice e le c t so to do, there is
  no requirem ent th a t the notice be read in full. Indeed the wording of Section 7 of the
  Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 does s ta te "the Investigating Officer shall, as soon
  as is practical (without prejudicing his or any other investigation of the m atter) in
  writing inform the member subject of the investigation of the report, allegation or
  complaint and give him a written notice". The emphasis is mine. No mention is made of
  the need to read the notice out loud.




                                                                                                s)0"f f~ Q (l   O   /t IAA U * (• o-v<

              TWENTIETH   D A Y 'S PROCEEDINGS

                TUESDAY, 13th JUNE, 1989

                    (MORNING   SESSION)


     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I should apologise to everyone
who has been waiting for the start this morning.  We have
had to have a conference to consider the further progress
of this Inquiry and what time may be needed to digest a
great deal of material which has to be considered later
on this week so we have been discussing that and the
future stages of the Inquiry.  Now we will proceed.

        POLICE CONSTABLE HAROLD GUEST Recalled

            Cross-examined by     MR. GLASGOW:

     MR. GLASGOW:    One more matter if I may, sir:

Mr. Guest, one more matter I would like to put to you.
You told us yesterday about the comings and goings from
the club room, if you remember, of other people. - A.
That is correct, sir.

iThere is one matter which I think you may be mistaken
jabout and I would like you to reconsider.  Mr. Holdsworth
^believes that he remained in the room right up until
|3 o'clock and I wonder if you could help with your re-
|collection of that. - A. That may be correct, sir.

It may be correct. - A. Yes.

In that event I do not propose to take more of your time
by dealing with the question of the times at which people
came and went and I am sure you would understand the
position.  I do not want to waste any further time.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Well, Mr. Glasgow, I think I
have already said this at an earlier stage of the Inquiry.
It is a matter which obviously fell for discussion with
Counsel this morning when we were considering the future
conduct of the Inquiry.   It cannot possibly be the duty
of this Inquiry to investigate the precise whereabouts
and role and precisely what was said and done by every
individual who was present on duty at the match on the
15th of April or otherwise this would go on for ever.
I well recognise that there may be people who were involved
that day who get mentioned from time to time in the
evidence and they may feel that in some way some aspersion
is being cast upon them which they would like to clear
but it cannot, I am afraid, be the duty of this Inquiry
or of Counsel at it to go into every minute detail of
                                                H. GUEST

where everybody was at a particular time.  We have got
to consider the broad issues involved and I hope it will
be understood that individuals who are mentioned cannot
expect that the Inquiry will investigate to the last
letter what they said and did.

     MR. GLASGOW:    We are extremely grateful to you for
making that clear.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I say that now in response
to your telling me that you do not propose to go into
everybody who was in the control room and what times
they came and left.  I do not think we can investigate
it to that minute extent.

     MR. GLASGOW:    I am very grateful, sir.

     MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, perhaps in the circumstances I
may also trim what I was to put to the witness.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   May I just   make it clear,
Mr. Woodward, when you say "trim".  We   have got of course
to look at the important issues raised   in this matter
but all I am saying is there must be a   level of minutiae
down to which we do not go.

            Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Guest, may I ask you about Mr. Lock's position?
In the control room he is there with you looking at
the developing situation? - A. He is.

On the screens.  And there are all the club screens giving
an overview of what is happening at each of the turnstiles
- A. There is, sir.

Was Mr. Lock a gentleman who you would have expected to be
having everything as it was developing at his fingertips?
- A. Not all the time but obviously when he is in the
control room, yes.

He would be fully in the know whilst in your control room?
- A. He would, sir.

In an earlier statement which you gave, the one that I
think is - have you got it in front of you - in manu­
script, the one that is dated the 27th of April, 1989?
Mr. Glasgow asked you about it yesterday. - A. Yes, sir.

I think the intention of that interview and the purpose
of that statement was upon security matters? - A. Yes, sir

Because there was concern there about how long you had
been in the room and whether anybody else had been able
                                               H. GUEST

 to get in there to interfere with or get at the equipment?
 - A. Yes, sir.

In that statement on the second page you refer to the
persons who were present, Mr. Holdsworth, yourself,
Mr. Lock and a man called Geoff.  Who wasr Geoff ? Do
you have page 2? - A. Yes.  Geoff, he is the assistant
to Roger Holdsworth.  He is one of their employees.

Yes.  You have not mentioned Geoff so far. - A. I forgot
about him, I did forget about Geoff because I did not see
a great deal of him that day because I do know that he was
going round the ground looking at the situation in respect
of some of the turnstiles.

Yes.  And is it right that from time to time there were
other visitors who included Mr. Darling? - A. That is a
possibility, sir.  Same as I say, between me arriving
there at 10 o'clock and even up to kick-off time there
were people sort of coming in and out all the time.

Do you have a recollection of Mr. Darling coming in at
any time and having a word with Mr. Lock? - A. Yes, sir, yes.

And was that discussion so far as you are aware of its
contents a discussion relating to figures and the attendance
rate as it had then developed? - A. That would possibly
be it, sir, yes.  I cannot remember exactly what the
conversation was about.

Are you able to say what time that was? - A. No, sir.

In your manuscript statement at the end of it you speak
of ....

     MR. WOODWARD:   Would you forgive me a moment, sir:

Do you recall Mr. Lock at any stage saying that the
situation was obviously getting out of hand or words
to that effect? - A. Yes, words to that effect, sir, yes.

Do you remember when that was? - A. I should imagine, sir,
obviously looking at the computer, the screen, at Leppings
Lane it would be somewhere in the region of approximately
about 20-to~3.  Obviously there again exact time I would
not be exact.

Was Mr. Lock's position and his responsibility one that
you would have expected him to endeavour to deal with the
situation getting out of hand? - A. That is correct,sir.

And did Mr. Lock in fact go off from the room saying that
he would see what he could do? — A. That is correct,sir.

Or words to that effect? - A. Yes, sir.
                                                H. GUEST

And this was in relation to the situation that was
developing at the Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes.  It
had been commented on that the crowd that was attending
at that area and were coming through the turnstiles were
very slow and when he said he was going to try and sort
something out I assumed he was going to go to the turn­
stile operator to see what was causing the delay in people
getting through the turnstile.

So he was aware of the situation and so far as you can
recall he went off to endeavour to   do something about it?
- A. That is correct, sir.

You say there came a time when Mr. Holdsworth went off?
- A. That is correct, sir.

Mr. Holdsworth went off.  Was that also to do something
about the situation that was developing?- A. I believe
so, yes, sir.

Do you remember what time it was Mr. Holdsworth went out?
- A. I have no idea exactly the time.   As I say, it would
be when the incident had occurred as regards the spectators
coming through the gate.  It would   be some time after that.
Exact time obviously I would not like to say.

It would be some time after Gate C had opened?- A. Yes, sir

In your evidence yesterday you spoke of difficulties of
communication? - A. I did, sir.

You could not get through on the telephone.    It was engaged
- A. That is correct, sir.

And you could not get through on the radio because there
was too much radio traffic? - A. There was, sir.

That would be a situation that the club would be fully
aware of through Mr. Lock?- A. I presume so, yes.  I can
only presume that would be correct.

But you were able to communicate with Mr. Lock? -A. No,
because Mr. Lock had already left at that stage.

Whilst he was in the room .... - A. Oh, yes, while he was
in the room, yes.

.... you were able to talk to him? - A. Yes.

Would this be the situation? When you were not able to use
the communications to get through to the control room your
line of communication was to and through Mr. Lock? - A. Yes
sir.

When Mr. Marshall was speaking on the radio you could hear
(Mi

                                                    H. GUEST

      him and overhear the difficulties he was confronted with?
      -A. That is correct, sir.




                                 / Q. Would it be
                                             H. GUEST

Would it be after or at the time of      Mr. Marshall speaking
that Mr. Lock decided to go off and      do something about it?
A.  I think it was  probably just a      couple of minutes after
that message had been passed;  just      after that, Mr. Lock
did leave.

That was a message todo what, to open    the gates or what?
A,  The first message   that Mr, Marshall left, as I can
recollect, is that he was asking for Police assistance
in the Leppings Lane end.

Was that before or after he had asked for gates to be
opened?   A.   That would be before, I would think.

Mr. Holdsworth was in    the control room when Mr. Marshall
was asking for gates to be opened?     A. Yes, he was,
I presume.

From what you were able to observe in the control room,
were the Club endeavouring to monitor and observe and
control where spectators were going?   A.  I couldn't say,
sir, because obviously I was just in the control room, so
I can't say what the Club would be doing.  Presumably
they would be trying their best, yes.

Were the Club officers using their radios?   A. I couldn't
vouch for that, sir, because Mr. Lock had gone out with
his radio and obviously I couldn't hear transmission
between him and the security officers.

So when Mr. Lock had gone off with the radio, you were
left without communication with Mr. Holdsworth?  A. I was,
sir.

     Mr. WOODWARD:   Thank you,   sir.

                Re-examined by Mr. COLLINS:

Mr. Guest, I want to see if I have understood your evidence
correctly.  When you were trying to get through without
success to the control room at about 10 to 3, that, as I
understand it, was to inform them of the position at
Leppings Lane.  Am I right?   A. That was to inform them
in respect of the message that had been passed by
Superintendent Marshall.

Exactly.  A. And to let them know the situation in respect
of the crowd.

At Leppings Lane?    A. Yes, sir.

You were not intending to inform control about the numbers
through the turnstiles, is that right?  A. I would probably
have mentioned it, you know, the situation, if they had
asked me when I got on the radio, but usually that
communication is done by the telephone.
                                               H. GUEST

But you were not intending to volunteer the information
about the numbers through the turnstiles - am I right?
A. Y £ s , sir. I was mainly concerned with the message
from Superintendent Marshall, that he was requesting
further assistance, and after that there seemed to be
a delay from a report going back to Mr. Marshall ---

I follow that.   A. --- that assistance was on its way;
so I tried to interrupt to make sure that the message
had been received at the control.

So the answer to my question is that you were not
intending to volunteer the figures through the turnstiles?
A.  No, sir.

Was that because you did not think it a relevant matter
for them to know?   A. Yes, I suppose they did ought to
know, but, having said that, at that stage the crowd had
then come through Gate C which, as I say, made the figures

No, you have told us that you were trying to get through
before the crowd came through Gate C.  Now, you saw a
large number of people outside which you estimated at
between 3,000 and 5,000 - is that right?   A. Yes, sir.

You had figures which indicated that if 3,000 to 5,000
came in, there might be an over capacity?  A. That is
correct, sir.

I am just wondering why you did not think it necessary
in those circumstances to try to volunteer that information
A. Well, I thought with the situation at Leppings Lane
when Mr. Marshall was shouting for assistance, because
they said that further messages came through and they said
there could be serious consequences outside Leppings Lane
turnstiles, I thought at the time that that was the more
serious thing to pass messages by at that stage.

I see.  The only other thing  is this:  Can I ask you to
look at the last sentence of your second statement, the
typed one? You say this:

      "I tried several times to pass messages about the
      situation at Leppings Lane, but each time I tried
      I was blocking transmission, so I kept off the radio."

A.   Yes, sir.

I am just wondering why you did not mention the telephone
in that last sentence, if you really were trying to get
through on the telephone?   A. Well, I was, sir.   It was
transmission both by radio and telephone.

I just wondered why you did not mention the telephone
there.  It was just an oversight, was it? A.   It is an
oversight, yes, sir.
                                                H. GUEST

    Mr. COLLINS:    Thank you, Mr. Guest.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you very m u c h .

    Mr. GOLDSACK:   Inspector Turner, please.

                IAN TURNER Called
            Examined by Mr. GOLDSACK:

Inspector Turner, I do not think you were present at the
semi-final this year?   A. That's correct, sir.

But last year you were an Inspector in charge of serials
out in Leppings Lane?   A. Correct.

I think you had men that year protecting the side roads
off Leppings Lane with barriers?   A. Yes.

Ensuring that non-residents did not go down?      A. Correct.

Did you have any system last year for filtering people as
they came along Leppings Lane?   A. No.

Did you have any system last year for checking whether
people had tickets before they reached the perimeter
gates?   A.  No.

Either a formal system or an informal system?  A. Informal
in so much as perhaps being asked by individual officers,
as fans came down Leppings Lane, "Have you got tickets?",
on an informal, ad hoc basis, but not a formal situation.

Do you recall at any stage last year having the portable
barriers - you know the sort I mean - across Leppings
Lane at any stage?   A. No, never, sir.

To make sure that people went in particular directions?
A.  No, never.

            Cross-examined by Mr. GLASGOW:

Inspector, just one matter, if I may.      Do you know a Mr.
Kenneth Evans?    A. No, sir.

A silly question!  The Kenneth Evans who used to b e , I think,
the Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands who is now
the Liaison Officer to the Football Association?  A. No,
sir.

We are going to hear, I think,    that in this year that you
were responsible for, Mr. Evans   was concerned on behalf
of the Football Association to    look into the arrangements
at Hillsborough to see whether    they were working well
for semi-finals?   A.   Yes.
                                                  I. TURNER

And he may tell us that he went to the ground to look
round in 1988 to see how things were working?  A. Yes.

He has a recollection of a very effective system of
queuing   being organised in this year when you were
responsible in 1988, and of speaking to a number of the
police officers outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
I just wondered if that helped you to remember whether
anybody of that kind might have approached you?    A. No,
he didn't, sir, and I wasn't directly outside the
 turnstiles;   I was further along Leppings Lane where
the side roads come into Leppings L a n e .

Are you able to help the Inquiry as to the system which
was actually being employed at Leppings Lane itself, at
the turnstiles end, for organised queuing?    A. No, sir.
I wasn't involved in the queueing situation at all.   My
brief was to prevent access down the side roads.   Although
I did walk up and down Leppings Lane and in fact round
the block and into Penistone Road, at no time did I go
down to the turnstiles.

I see.   So if Mr. Evans tells us that there was a system
of filtering people and checking tickets before they got
to the turnstiles and that there were six mounted officers
forming specific queues, and that he saw and was impressed
upon by that organisation in 1988, you can neither agree
nor disagree?    A.  Correct.

       Mr. GLASGOW:     I will not push it further,   sir.   Thank
you.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you very much.

     Mr. GOLDSACK:   Sir, the next two witnesses are not
able to be here.   Each has made a short statement which
is to be put in.   The first is Inspector Grace, who again
deals with last year.   He was positioned at the junction
of Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North and merely says
that so far as he was concerned he had not caused any
barriers to be put up at that stage with a view to filtering
supporters coming down Leppings Lane.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes.

        Mr. GOLDSACK:     The second statement is Police Constable
L a n g ---

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Just give me a moment, would
you?

     Mr. GOLDSACK:  Yes, sir.    Police Constable Lang is
the officer who refers to the tunnel being closed at last
year's match, and it would perhaps be useful if I just
read that part of his statement.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      If you would, yes.

                                                  P. C. LANG

                Mr. GOLDSACK:  He was positioned generally at the
           foot of the stairs up to the West Stand, and he says:

               "Some time between 2.45 and 2.50 I received an
               order to close the gates at the top of the tunnel
               leading to the central pen and remain at these
               gates to prevent entry by any further fans into
               the central pen.  I closed the right-hand gate
               and remained at this post directing fans to the
               wing entrances.  As 3 p.m. approached, this caused
               some confusion with fans wishing to enter the pens
               quickly, and some abuse was given at myself.   A
               short time after the kick-off, further officers
               attended at my location and the gates were again
               opened after they took up duty in the tunnel."

                                          MR. MCROBBIE


      Q. But at all events she did open the gate? - A. Absolutely
         yes.

      Q. Very rapidly? - A. Yes.

      Q. And fans started to move into Pen 1? - A. Yes.  By this
         time they were coming out of the area in the central pen
         and moving towards there but then stopping and sitting
         on the edge.

      Q. Did these people look to be in distress? - A. At the time
         it was quite clear that they had come through a difficult
         area where there had been a pressure to get through the
         gate and people were milling through.  This is the perception
         I had.  They were not in a difficult state but they were
         quite clearly agitated.  Now for whatever reason they were
         reluctant to want to go where they were being directed and
         obviously now I can understand that quite clearly.

      Q. Were they coming out of both Pen 3 and Pen 4 or just one
         of them? - A. I can't say sir. All I could see I was
         between Pen 2 and Pen 3.  I never went beyond that so I
         can't see beyond that because of the milling people.

      Q. It was said that you in fact were stood on the touchline
         or just on the pitch ushering the people along towards
         Gate 1. Is that right? - A. Yes, I was on the perimeter
         track but it was very clear that more and more people
         were coming through on to the perimeter track and were
         converging in an area behind the goal and coming on to
         the grass.  People had begun to flow away and in fact
         the Policewoman was directing them into the space which
         was the intention of me leaving the Control Room.
         Because of the sheer volume of numbers of people coming
         out of that central pen I then went behind and positioned
         myself on the goal-line in between the hoardings to prevent
         encroachment on to the playing area basically.

      Q. Was the game still in progress then? - A. Indeed sir, yes.

               MR. PHILLIPS:   Thank you very much.


                       Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

      Q. Mr. McRobbie, I would like you just to answer some questions
         in relation to a little earlier time.

               We know something like 4-5 minutes elapsed between
         Mr. Marshall first of all asking for the gates to be opened
         and the gates being ordered to be opened.

               What I would like to do is see if you can add to our
         store of knowledge as to what was happening in the Control
         Room in that period of 4-5 minutes.
'V   ,

                                                MR. MCROBBIE


                    You have there Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray,
              Mr. Duckenfield in overall charge, Mr. Murray the Commander
              in the ground? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

         Q. What discussion or conversation passed between Mr. Duckenfield
            and Mr. Murray during that period which considered the advisa­
            bility of acceding to Mr. Marshall's request? - A. Forgive
            me sir, your 45 minutes, can you give me a starting time.
            I mean we have just been at 3 o'clock.  Are you saying 2.15?

         Q.   Sorry, 4-5, not 45? - A. I beg your pardon.

         Q.   We know that Mr. Marshall first requested the gates   to be
              opened at 2.47? - A. That is correct.

         Q. He then made a further request and then yet another? - A. Yes.

         Q. Then on the third request everyone agrees with your recollection,
            that Mr. Duckenfield as it were said aloud:  "Wfell if people
            are going to be killed outside we had better open the gates"?
            - A. That is correct.

         Q. What I want to know is in your statement you make the comment:
            "Mr. Duckenfield was deeply considering Mr. Marshall's
            request"? - A. Absolutely.

         Q.    What I want to know is what conversation took place   or what
              discussion took place between Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield
              or anybody else, as to the issues involved, the advisability
              of acceding to or rejecting Mr. Marshall's unusual request?
              - A. Yes, I take the point you are making.    I think in
              fairness to this scenario I must take you back a little
              further than the time you are mentioning there when I think
              you will find 1 no doubt sowed a seed when I was watching
              a monitor which gave a visual display of Gate C, as I
              believe it is, when I could see people climbing over the
              wal 1 and it was .my perception that that gate that was visible
              on the monitor had been forced. 1 in fact said:     "The gate
              has been forced" because prior to that there had been
              requests or we had information rather than requests, that
              there was a tremendous pressure outside Leppings Lane and
              there was a request for the gates to be opened.

                    It was at that stage that I was looking on the monitor
              because you c a n 't see the area direct from where I was
              positioned and I alerted the Control Room staff saying that
              the gates had been forced.     That was my perception because
              I saw this influx of people coming through that gate; then
              I saw a Police horse position itself across the gate which
              allowed the gate to be reclosed and stopped that flow of
              people. That would be round about the time that you are
              asking me to consider and I think it is important that I
              bring that forward, so the gates had in fact been opened
              and fans had come in.     That was simultaneously or as near
              abouts as when Superintendent Marshall was making his

                                                 MR. MCROBBIE


            requests for the gates to be opened.

                  I have seen since, and I am really speaking from ray
            recollection, but I have seen since that there was in fact
            I believe something like a five minute gap between the
            gates being opened again.   In reality by being present
            in that Control Room really I must tell the Inquiry that
            people who weren't in that situation can ever understand
            the enormity of that situation.   There was a request being
            made for something that was totally out of strategy of the
            Police controlling the fans at that game, so it was a
            very grave decision and that is why I said in my impression
            Mr. Duckenfield was very deeply considering dare, or should
            I make this decision*'which is so far outside the bounds of
            the normal policing arrangements for control of the
            supporters.

                  There was a period of time when I think:  "Has that
            influx of supporters through that gate alleviated the
            pressure which was being described by communication into
            the Control Room?" Again ....

                  LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I think the only question was
            whether there was any conversation that you can recall,
            may be you can't, I don't know, but at the moment you
            are telling us what you conceive to have been the thinking.

    q   .         MR. HYTNER:  Mr. McRobbie, I don't want you to feel
            that there is any trap in my question. - A. I am not
            thinking that.

    Q. Can I make it clear what the thrust of the question is
       so that you don't fear a trap.

                  If somebody is asked for a decision, a Commanding
            Officer, and there is silence for five minutes and then
            the answer is given, there are two distinct possibilities.
            One is that the Commanding Officer has been dithering for
            five minutes, the other is that he has been deeply c o n s i d e r i n g
            all the issues.  Do you follow? - A. Yes.

    Q. Now if there is silence people have got to draw a conclusion,
       but if during that five minutes he is considering orderly
       and considering with somebody else and seeking advice and
       there is an exchange of views, we need to kn ow . Was there
       any exchange of views? Was there any discussion other than
       Mr. Murray's question right at the end:  "Mr. Duckenfield,
       are you going to open the gates?"  Was there anything that
       you can recall that was actually said? - A. I felt it
       necessary to sort of paint the picture, forgive me my Lord,
       but you are talking about "dithering". There was a con­
       sidered deep thinking consideration.

                  Now M r . Murray and M r . Duckenfield were speaking,
            but as to the contents of v/hat they were saying I cannot
            say.  There was conversation and the decision was being

              discussed and really what I have said in there that there was
              a further request from Mr. Marshall about:   "If you don't
              open the gates then we are going to have injuries or loss
              of life or death" or something of that nature, and that
              took out all the other considerations from any discussion,
              the previous reasons why the decision had been refused,
              about the segregation, the control, once people started
              talking about the enormity and the seriousness of the
              situation outside and what I was going to say, my Lord,
              was one could not see the actual gate from the camera
              view.  All you got was a host of people.   You could not
              see into the gates because of the wall by the turnstiles,
              so when that information was passed then the enormity
              of the situation became evident and that is when Mr. Murray
              said:  "Well are we going to open the gates?" because there
              had been discussion, I am sorry I can't tell you the content
              of that discussion, and at which stage Mr. Duckenfield said:
              "Well this is the situation, we must open the gates".

            Q. Is it that you cannot remember or that you could not hear what
               was being said between them? - A. There was so much activity,
                it was just not a quiet Control Room where one could over­
                hear a conversation.     There was the Tannoy working; there
               was the cheering of the crowd; there was the Radio Operator
                working and there was Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray talking,
                so within all that there was conversation but I cannot tell
                you the content and it would be wrong of me to try.


                             Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON :

            Q. Mr. McRobbie, I take it before when you went as an observer,
               you had a brief look at the order of the day? - A. That is
               correct sir, yes.

            Q. You probably would not need to know.  One of the fundamental
               matters the Police have to concern themselves with is pre­
               venting people encroaching on the playing pitch? - A. Well
               indeed, yes.

            Q. If I can take you moments forward from the matters you have
               discussed and answered questions about already.

                     You saw the concertina gates open, the middle of page 9
               sir of his statement, and you say this in your statement and
               I remind y o u :

                     "I became aware of a perimeter track gate
                     being opened and people being let onto the
                     track out of the pen behind the goal and
                     ushered and pointed in the direction of the
                     part where there was still plenty of space."

               A. Yes sir.
                                 MR. MCROBBIE



Mr. McRobbie, that is a very very important paragraph.
First of all do you remember making the statement con­
taining in it that paragraph? - A. I do indeed, yes sir.

Was it as you remembered? - A. We are talking about people
being let out of the central area behind the goals, ushered
to a direction in front of the Control Box where there was
space.

Yes, now Mr. McRobbie, that means, does it not, that
everything you knew about policing made it quite obvious
to you in the Control Room that this was not a pitch
invasion, this was a crowd safety manoeuvre undertaken
by Police Officers? - A. Yes, I would agree with that.

Did you communicate your impression to anyone in the
Control Room? Mr. McRobbie, this is not a game, let me
explain the position:  every single Police Officer has
come along here to say that doing their very best they
did not realise that it was not public order it was public
safety, until very many many minutes after it appears now
you did realise the true position? - A. I don't think I
have ever suggested, or I hope I have not suggested, that
it was anything other than that sir.

No, you haven't but everyone else has? - A. Oh I am sorry,
I beg your pardon.  Well obviously I have not heard what
others have said.  My impression that that gate was
opened to relieve the pressure to allow people to come
to an area where there was space.  I think that is what
I have said.

      LORD JUSTICE’TAYLOR;  At what stage did that
impression form itself? - A. When people were coming out,
the game had started and people were coming out on to
the perimeter track.

Yes, but were you still in the Control Room or had you
gone down to the corner or what? - A. No, I was in the
Control Room at this time, sir.

      MR. JACKSON: Mr. McRobbie, did you feel it part
of your duty to communicate your opinion to your colleagues
in the Control Room? - A. I think by the fact that I was
going out to open the gate and as I said it was simultaneous
that we felt the Police lady on the gate did not know what
action was expected of her, that the people around me in
the Control Room formed the same opinion but I did not
communicate that to them.

Did you assume, quite naturally, that those others in the
Control Room who were looking would have formed the same
view that you formed? - A. Yes.

      MR. JACKSON:   Thank you, Mr. McRobbie.

                                            MR. MCROBBIE


                        Cross-Examined by MR. KALLIPETIS;

       Q. Mr. McRobbie, do you have your statement in front of you?
          - A. I have a copy.

       Q. When was the statement made? - A. I don't know when it is
          dated. What it is, it is a transcript of a handwritten
          note which I made following the events, sir, which obviously
          recollects thoughts and feelings and this sort of thing.

       Q. Would you   turn to page 5 please.  At the bottom of page 5
          you refer   to an incident which drew the attention of the
          Assistant   Chief Constable (Operations). Is that Mr. Jackson?
          - A. That   is correct sir, yes.

       Q. You say:

                "Police Constable Bichard operated the camera
                and I watched him to be able to zoom onto
                him which I thought was a super facility for
                spotting troublemakers in the crowd."

          A. That is correct, sir.

       Q. No difficulty with the picture at all? - A. Well when you
          say "no difficulty" it certainly brought this person
          closer to us than I think it would have been possible
          for a Police Officer to select the correct person
          that Control were identifying without any problem.

       Q. That is the whole purpose of it, isn't it? - A .   I would
          think so sir, yes.

       Q. Page 7 of your statement please, Mr. McRobbie.  Four lines
          from the bottom you refer to the first request from
          Superintendent Marshall.  You say:

                "The gates were not authorised to be opened
                by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield at this
                time."

          A. That is correct.

       Q. what did he say? - A. He said basically he could not open
          the gates because they would lose the control of who
          was admitted because it was an all ticket game; that they
          would lose the control which would transfer problems
          inside if people were carrying weapons or things that
          they should not have been carrying basically.




                                   /Q. You recall him saying
                                      MR. MGROBBIE

You recall him saying that, do you? - A. I do,   indeed.

To whom did he say it? - A. When I say it was to whom - it
was a discussion with crowd Commander Mr. Murray.

And having said that did he then respond through the radio
operator to the request from Superintendent Marshall? - A.
I am not sure, sir.  I honestly could not say.

I did not catch that.  I am sorry. - A. I do not know if
that message was transmitted or not, sir.  I am sorry.

Page 8 of your statement, please, Mr. McRobbie,half-way
down, you refer to the next request from Superintendent
Marshall, request the gates to be opened.  You say in
your statement, "This is a general request." Why did
you write that? - A. Because he said the gates, you know,
open the gates.  It was not open Gate whatever.  It was
open the gates.

You describe the discussion between Mr. Duckenfield and
Mr. Murray about whether or not the gates should be opened
after the third request from Superintendent Marshall.   Was
the discussion about gates in general? - A. Indeed.

Or one gate in particular? -A. No, all the gates at the
Leppings Lane end.

You recall those words, do you, Mr. McRobbie? - A. I
suppose the reverse is true, sir.  There x^as never any
discussion about any particular gate.  It was the gates.

Did you take part in that discussion?- A. Not an active
part, no, sir, but I was present when it took place.

What does that mean? - A. Well, I was present when it was
there. I was not consulted.

Did you take part?  Did you offer any advice ? - A. Not
at that stage, sir, no.

Having heard Mr. Duckenfield when the first request was
made refer to the difficulties that would occur if the
gates were open did you think it might be pertinent to
offer some advice as to what might be done to make sure
that the fans inside once the gates were opened were
channelled into some direction? - A. Again you must for­
give me for - with, sort of, having only taken part - you
have heard at the outset that I was a new member to the
Division and really I was surrounded by professional
people who do this day in and day out and it was no part
of mine as a person there as an observer to start telling
these professional people what they should and should not
do, sir.

So you did not say anything? - A. No, sir.

                                                          MR. MGROBBIE


     Q. Did you think it? - A. No.

     Q. You did not. - A. I was watching the action taking place
        rather than consciously thinking well, I should do this,
        I would have done that.

     Q. And did any of the other professional people who do this
        day in and day out surrounding Mr. Duckenfield offer any
        opinion at all as to what might be done as regards the
        inside of the ground if the gate were to be opened? - A.
        Not that I am aware of, sir, no.

               MR. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you.

                      Cross-examined by MR. GLASGOW:

     Q.Chief Inspector, the camera zoom which impressed you was
        that which was showing the scene on, the terraces, was it?
        - A. It was able to pick out someone directly under the
        control box, yes, but I do not know where the camera is
        sited.  I am sorry.

     Q.   You are quite sure that was the camera that was being used,
          the one that shows the scene on the terraces? -A. I cannot
          speak about a camera.  All I can say is on the monitor a
          person was able to be enlarged.

     Q.   You might be able to help us if you can remember by
          chance whether it was black and white or colour. - A .
          It was black and white.

     Q. Black and white.  Thank you very much.  You realised  that
        Police were attempting to relieve pressure in the central
        pens? - A. Yes.

     Q. When you were still in the control box? - A. Yes.  That
        became evident when people came on to the pitch.  That
        was the first indication that I had.  When people came
        on to the pitch that is what I thought they were doing.

     Q. And you left the control box to sort out the position
        generally? - A. No, that is wrong.

     Q. Sorry. - A. I left the control box to have an access gate
        opened or an entrance gate opened to allow people back
        into an area ....

     Q. I can cut you short.  You were solely concerned to draw
        the attention of the Policewoman who you thought had not
        appreciated what was going on?-A. My intention was to go
        down, get that gate open, allow people to through there
        and return to the control box.

     Q. Can you remember how you got there, Chief Inspector? - A.

                                                          MR. MCROBBIE

               Yes.  I went down the steps by the control box and then
               was able to walk down the uncovered seating and climb
               over the wall where that gate is.

          Q. Yes.  So you came down - if we could just, with Mr. Poole's
             help - you came down beside .... - A. Yes.

          Q.    Just outside .... - A. That is correct.

          Q.   And I expect you have seen yourself on the video. - A.
               Indeed.

          Q.   And we see you standing in the corner beside the Police lady
               for some time. ~ A. Trying to get the people to go through,
               that is correct, sir.

          Q. Yes.  Again, I am not being offensive but there was quite a
             forceful confrontation between you and some of the people
             who were sitting on the ground at that stage? - A. They
             were wanting to sit on the ground to watch the game.

          Q. I am not criticising you, Inspector. - A. And all I was
             doing was try and encourage them to go.  When you say
             "forceful" ....

          Q. Well, there was physical pushing and shoving and I think
             the Policewoman thinks a bit of bad language but nothing
             very extreme? - A. I think that is quite understandable.

          Q. Perfectly.  But what I wanted your help with is the time.
             I think I am right in saying that the time on the video -
             and I will be corrected if I am wrong  and we can look
             at it possibly over the short adjournment - is 2.59 when
             you got down there? - A. I am sorry, sir.  As for timings
             I recall the video being around about 3 o'clock time.

          Q. I may be wrong and I am taking it gently and forgive me
             if I am, but can you help by reference to the game,Chief
             Inspector? Are you sure that the game had started as
             you were standing .... - A. No.  I am sorry.  I probably
             should clarify.  The players were on the pitch but
             whether the game had started that was a different
             matter.  I could not tell you anything at all about
             that game.

          Q. But whatever the precise time on the video which we can
             check .... - A. Y e s .

          Q         it is clear, is it not, that you appreciated that
               there was pressure trouble in the centre pens when you
               left the Police box some time before 3 o'clock? - A.
               Whatever time the people began coming on to that pitch
               was the time I realised, yes, some help was needed
               down there to get that gate open.

          Q. And you are saying that,    the very first moment that you

                                 24

                                                            MR. MCROBBIE


       saw people coming out of those pens you appreciated that
       it was a pressure problem? -A. I suppose that would be
       correct. I saw people coming out of the pens and being
       directed into the areas I have described.  It was at
       that stage that I realised, yes, there is help needed
       to get that gate open so what you are saying is in fact
       correct.

    Q. You have told us with great loyalty about the momentous
       decision that was being considered by the senior Officers
       in your presence.  Did it occur to you when you first saw
       that evidence of pressure in the pens that this was,
       indeed, one of the consequences of that momentous decision
       that had been taken? - A. Not at all, sir.   Not at that
       time, I am afraid.

    Q. It did not occur to you that what you had seen in the in­
       flood of fans might have caused the pressure that was now
       having to be relieved? - A. At that time it did not occur
       to me, no.

    Q. So be it. And finally, Chief Inspector, as we see on the
       video, after you had helped to assist people into pen 1
       you walked to the centre pens in order to see how serious
       the situation was for yourself? - A. Well, I would not
       describe it like that.  I walked to the centre pens
       because more and more people were spilling on to the
       perimeter track and were encroaching on to the playing
       area and I went, as I said, to position myself by the
       goal line by some advertising hoardings just to prevent
       people who were of necessity coming out of that gate
       coming encroaching on the playing areas.

    Q. We see you climb over the hoarding right up to the fence.
       Have you not seen yourself?  You walk from the perimeter
       track, you step over the hoarding and you go right up to
       the fence, I think.  Did you not do that?- A. I may well
       have done, sir.  I cannot recall doing that as a conscious
       act.

    Q. Taking it from the last stage backwards then, there came
       a stage at which you realised that something very serious
       was wrong because we see you come back over the hoarding
       and run away from the goal towards the camera? - A. That
       is absolutely correct.  What prompted that was Superintendent
       Greenwood being on top of the fence waving his arms towards
       the control room.

    Q. I was going to ask you.    Was that you seeing Mr.Greenwood ....
       - A. Yes.

    Q ..... obviously in an urgent state   .... - A. Yes.

    Q ..... or you seeing something going on in the pens that
        distressed or concerned you? -A. No, it was - I did not

                                                               MR. MCROBBIE

               see anything in the pens other than it being very full,
               obviously.  It was the actions of Superintendent Greenwood
               waving to the control room that made me act in the way I
               did to try and ....

            Q. In that event I won't press you.   Thank you.

                           Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

            Q. Mr. McRobbie, you had gone to the control box in order to
               learn.  Is that right? - A. That was the intention, sir,
               yes.

            Q.And you took no part in the: business that was being done
               in there that day? -A. That is correct, sir.

            Q. Did the events that occurred and the victims and the deaths
               that you observed, did they have an effect upon you? -A.
    #          Well, in fairness, sir, I did not see any of the injured
               or dead.

            Q. You did not see any injured or any dead.   What time did
               you remain there until? -A. Again, as to time I could not
               say.  It would have been about 3.20 or something when I
               left the ground.  As? I say, most of that time I had not
               been in the position, as has been described.   When I
               left having seen Mr. Greenwood's attempt to, what I thought
               was to get the attention of the control room I then continued
               with that run where I met Superintendent Murray who was on
               his way in the opposite direction to try and stop the game.

            Q. Mr. Murray was coming down from the control box and you
               encountered him .... - A. And I was going up and then we ran
               together down to get the linesman's attention to the
               referee which 1 believe is the practice.  Once the game had
               in fact been stopped I then returned to the control room,
               so I never returned to the perimeter fence, so in that
               case I did not see the things you are describing.

            Q. This is right. You did not observe a single casualty
               yourself that day? -A. There were people laying on the
               pitch but I was not aware of the problem in my mind at
               that time.

            0. You were not aware of the problem.  What do you mean
               by that? - A. Well, you said dead or injured people.
               There were people on the pitch. Now, whether they were
               dead or injured or just laying down getting their breath
               back or just sitting down I cannot say, but I was not
               aware consciously that that person is dead, that person
               is seriously injured.  That is what I am trying to
               communicate to you.

            Q. I ask you about that because some importance may be attached
               to part of your evidence.  So do you mean this.  At the time
                                                    MR. MCROBBIE

     you made your statement you were not really aware of what
     had happened or the extent of it? -A. I was aware of what
     had happened and the extent of it by the time I made the
     statement.  At the time I was on the playing area until
     I got back to the control room or the control box I was
     not aware that people were seriously injured.

Q. Whilst you were in the control box looking down there was
   the point where the camera which zoomed in on someone - the
   individual that that camera zoomed in on was right in the
   area immediately below the control box? - A. That is right,
   sir, sir.

Q. This was in an area where there was not much congestion?
   - A. Absolutely, yes.

Q.   So there was little difficulty in the camera picking him
     out? -A. In fact that person was able to jig around and,
     you know, move around quite freely.

Q. Yes.  And he was fully observed? - A. Well, it meant
   stepping forward and looking out of the window in the
   control box basically, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you just help us a moment?
     Will you look at the model over there.  We have got a
     camera just to the right of the word t'Stand" in "South
     Stand" which can point towards the terracing and I think
     there is one also on the scoreboard which can look along
     the terracing which we are told was not in as good order
     as it might have been.  Are you able to say which camera
     you think it was that picked up and zoomed in on this man
     under the control box? - A. I cannot, sir, no.   It would
     be speculation.  I do not know the position of these.   I
     am sorry.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:  There  is a difference in height, is
     not there, between the west end of the South Stand and the
     area where the man was? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q.    And the South Stand camera I think was in colour but the
     camera you saw was black and white, was it?- A. Yes, it
     was certainly a black and white monitor that I was looking
     at.

Q.And that accordingly seemed to be likely to be the camera
   on the scoreboard? -A. I would have thought so from the
   definition but, as I say, I would not ....

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you say "the definition”
     was it good definition? - A. It was quite reasonable, sir,
     yes.

Q.       MR. WOODWARD: And the individual was not many feet
     away from it? - A. That is right.   He was right under the

                                                         MR. MCROBBIE

       position we were occupying.

    Q. Of course when one zooms the camera in it depends on how
       far away that which is being zoomed in on is and what its
       context is? - A. I would agree.




                                     / Q. From the position
                                          Mr. McROBBIE

From the position that you were in in the control room,
could you see to the centre pens of the West Terraces?
A.  Yes, you could see in there, sir.

As you were up there just looking and learning, up to the
point when you saw people coming out, had you any concern
or anxiety about what you observed?    A.  Again I hadn't,
sir, no, because it is normal that people of choice would
wish, if they are going to stand,   to stand behind the
goal.

The reasoning is probably not important.  A.  It wasn't
a concern.   There were people there and that would be
the natural place that one would expect to fill up first.

And were they moving about in waves, surging and swaying
as you would expect?   A. Indeed, sir, yes.

Jumping up and down?   A. Well, yes, they were.

Did they appear to you to be in any form of distress?
A.  Not that I observed, sir.

There was nothing abnormal which you observed about them?
A.  It was just a normal football crowd, sir.

In the statement that you made - and perhaps you would look
at page 9 of it, officer - you say that on the monitor you
saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.
"The ^ame started when I looked back on to the playing
area.    Do you see that, in the middle of page 9? A. Yes,
I do.

The play was at the Penistone Road end?    A. Yes.

You have a firm recollection of that?     A. Yes,    indeed.

It would seem, accordingly, that when you became aware
of something happening on the perimeter track, the game
had already started?   A.  Yes.

And what you were concerned with and what caused you to go
down was the fact that, rightly or wrongly, you perceived
that the gate to which those people were heading had not
been opened?    A.  That's right.

And you went to give what assistance you could?      A. Yes.

Of course, at that time there would be no reason for you
to know why those individuals had necessarily come from
wherever they had come?   A. No particular reason, no.
I just thought it was to relieve the pressure, you know.
It was quite full and there was space in the pens that I
have described, so it was a question of transference of
spectators.
   *


Did the fact that fans might be transferred or moved from
                                         Mr. McROBBIE

one section to another cause you any surprise?   A. Not
particularly, no, sir.  I have known it happen before -
not at that ground but in other events.

So when you are talking about the   fans moving from one
part to another, that is not because of some observed
concern by you; it is simply an observation that they
were not able to get to their destination?    A. Well,
quite clearly pen 3 was full and pen 2, as Ibelieve it
is, had got space, so it seemed a natural thing that
people could move into that area.

It seemed perfectly natural to you?    A. Yes.

Whilst the play was down at the Penistone Road end, that
was when I think Mr. Beardsley almost scored a goal and
hit the cross-bar?   A. I couldn't tell you, sir.

You are not aware of that?   A. I am not aware.

During the time of the play, had you noticed any surging
and moving in the crowd in the Terraces?   A.  I wasn't
particularly watching that area in that respect.  As I say
I saw that there were people coming on to the track, so I
was looking on the track rather than into the Pens.

So what happened in Pens 3 and 4 was not observed by you,
nor is it related to any movement in the crowd?   A.  No.

You just do not know?   A. That's correct, yes, sir.

If the play was down at the Penistone Road end, it would
seem that the game had been going for a little while.  Are
you able to say how long?   A.  As I say, sir, other than
that brief glimpse, I couldn't tell you anything much
abouy  that game at all, I'm sorry.

May I try and press you a little? Are we talking of
minutes or just after the whistle?    A.  I'm sorry, but
all I can tell you is that apparently the game stopped
at six-minutes-past-three. Actions prior to that had
been to usher people through, to run to Mr. Murray, to
run to the linesmen, to go on to the pitch.

If one looks at the photographs, for example - and would
you have a look at the composite bundle, Bundle 2,at
DB1714 ---   A. I'm sorry, sir.

It is timed at 3 o'clock.   The corrected time is 3 o'clock
There is   already a gate open there?    A. Bear with me,
sir.Could you repeat the number?

DB1714.   A.   I think I've got the wrong one.

Bundle 2, the composite Bundle, the fourth photograph in
the bundle.   Do you have that?   A. Yes, sir.
                                           Mr. McROBBIE

PR17A is, again, 1502 corrected.  Did you see anything
like that from your position up in the control room, or
not?   A.  No, sir.

But your clear recollection as to your timing is that
your concern, your involvement with the fans was at a
time when you believed play to be down at the Penistone
Road end?   A. That's my recollection, sir, yes.

     Mr. WOODWARD:     Thank you.

               Re-examined by Mr. PHILLIPS:

Mr. McRobbie, we have seen the video and compiled a
chronology of the times taken from the video recording.
Can I just tell you what these are in relation to the
particular event that you have talked about?   Sir, this
is the bottom of page 3 of the chronology.   At 2.59,
youths on the track go towards Pen 1?   A. Yes.

At 2.59.31, kick-off;   3 o'clock, the gate is seen to
be open at Pen 1 and the policewoman is showing the
youths in, and by then there was a steady stream of
people on the track.   Now, does that fit in with your
recollection, obviously not to the second --- A. No,
obviously not, sir, but I w o u l d n 't disagree with that.

     Mr. PHILLIPS:     Thank you very much.

                  BY    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

Just one thing:  You have said that as soon as you saw
people coming out on to the track and being ushered down
the track towards the corner, you realised that it was a
question of overcrowding?   A. That was my impression,
sir.

Yes.   In your statement at page 10 - have you got that?
A . Y e s , sir.

A couple of times you talk of a "public order situation".
This is two-thirds of the way down.   Admittedly this is
after Superintendent Greenwood was running towards the
referee.   You put it all in the present tense, this part
of your statement:    "I think it is a public order
situation.    I ran on to the playing area..." and so on?
A.  Yes, sir.

And then at the bottom of the page, "There is nothing I
can usefully do in a public order context, so I decide
to return to the police control point."   Can you just
help about that?   What converted it from people coming
out and overcrowding to being a public order situation?
A.  I think that's police jargon, sir, on my part.  I was
                                         Mr. McROBBIE

putting "public order" there as order that needed to be
restored, rather than rioting or anything like that.  It
was a question of an overspill that was encroaching on to
the pitch that needed uniformed officers to control.

You are not, by saying that, going back on what you said
before about why they had come out in the first place?
A.  Oh, absolutely not, sir, no.

And, in fairness to you, lest anyone else should think
otherwise, you went back to the control room and eventually
went back to Hammerton Road where you put on a uniform and
took part in organising the support?   A. That's correct,
sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, thank you.

    Mr. GOLDSACK:   Police Constable Rook, please.

     Mr . WOODWARD:  I am sorry, I am not quite sure which
list this officer's name appears on for today's hearing.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think he might have been
listed before.

     Mr. GOLDSACK:  I think he was probably on yesterday's
list, if not the day before that.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think that is right.

     Mr. GOLDSACK:  It is a short statement, sir.   He is
the gentleman who was in the Force Operations Room.

     Mr. WOODWARD:  Lest I was losing track, I wanted to
know which list this witness was on so as to try and
anticipate who was next going to be called.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, perhaps you could help
Mr. Woodward, Mr. Goldsack.   I think I have had this
witness's statement for a couple of days.   He was not
reached yesterday and he is being reached today.   Now,
can you just help Mr. Woodward and others by saying what
the running order is going to be after this?

     Mr. GOLDSACK:  That is the end of the police officers
for the time being, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And we then move on to the
Fire Brigade?

     Mr. GOLDSACK:  We then move to the Fire Brigade,
and the order in which we propose to call the Fire
Officers is in the printed order, starting with Fire
Control Officer S.E. Davies, then Mr. Swain, Mr. Fletcher,
Mr. Hornsby and Mr. Housley.
                                         Mr. McROBBIE

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  That will take us to the mid-day
adjournment and you can tell Mr. Woodward about  anything
after that.

      Mr. GOLDSACK:  When it comes to the turnstile operators
and stewards, we may have to interpose some stewards who
have come from Liverpool.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Perhaps you can deal with that
immediately after the mid-day adjournment.

     Mr. GOLDSACK:   Yes, sir.

                 KENNETH ROOK, Called
               Examined by Mr. GOLDSACK:

Mr. Rook, on the 15th April of this year, you were
stationed in the Force Operations Room at Headquarters?
A.  Yes, sir.

Just after 3 o'clock, were you told to make contact with
the Ambulance Service Control Room?   A. I was, sir.

By whom were you told to make that contact?  A. The
request was made by Chief Inspector Edmondson.

Some people are having difficulty hearing you, Mr. Rook.
Can you speak close to the microphone, please?   A. Yes,
sir.

We have a copy of a transcript of the conversations you
had between 1507 and the following few minutes with the
Ambulance Service.  What I want to ask you about is this,
Mr. Rook:  You told the Ambulance Service at about 1507
that there had been a lot of pushing and shoving at
Hillsborough, and within a minute or so you were saying,
"Pushing and shoving.  I understand one of the gates ...
They've collapsed the gates"?   A. Yes, sir.

From where did you get that information?  A. That information
was gleaned from the general public conversation within
the Operations Room.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You are not speaking very
audibly, I'm sorry.   Was gleaned from general conversation
in ...?     A. Within the Operations Room, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Thank you.

     Mr. GOLDSACK:   Can you tell us who was in the Operations
Room at this time?    A. Do you want the full list of the
operators, sir?
                          33


                                              Mr. McROBBIE

Q. Who was within earshot of you?   A.  There would be Chief
   Inspector Edmondson, Inspector Jackson, Sergeant Harrison
   and the other operators in the room.  There would be
   about ten or twelve of them.

Q. Did you personally have any contact with anyone at
   Hillsborough?   A.  No, sir.

Q. So you were only relaying what you had been told by
   somebody else?   A. I was only relaying, sir, what I
   had heard.  At the time I heard that information, I was
   actually speaking to the Ambulance Service.

Q. Do you know from which individual you gleaned that
   information?   A. No, sir.  As I say, I was actually
   talking, I was in conversation with the Ambulance Control
   Room and I just heard it whilst I was within the
   conversation.

Q. Do you know which of your colleagues   in that room was
   in direct contact with Hillsborough?     A. In the room
   where I was, sir, there was actually   no-one in direct
   conversation with Hillsborough.  The   Force Incident Room
   was set up in a room adiacent to the   Force Operations
   Room.

Q. I am not sure I have got that.  The information that you
   received in the room where you were came from another
   room in the same building, did it?   A. If I can explain,
   sir, from where I was in the Force Operations Room, to
   the right-hand side there is a door in between and that
   was where the Incident Room was set up which was
   controlling the match, and officers had come out of the
   Incident Room into the Operations Room, and that must
   have been where I got the information from.

Q. So the room next to you is in contact with Hillsborough?
   A.  That's right, sir.

Q. And an officer came from that room through to you, requesting
   ambulances?   A.  That's right, sir, yes.

Q. I think you have made in your statement, or set out
   accurately, a transcript of the telephone conversation
   that then ensued.  Was it telephone? - A. Yes, it was.

Q. So when you asked for the address the request comes:

           "Cutting equipment for Hillsborough football
           ground straight away."

     A. Yes.

Q. Now you then seem to be asking what road Hillsborough
   Ground was on? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Didn't you know that? - A. Not specifically sir, no.

Q. Was Hillsborough football ground not a sufficiently large
   and outstanding place to be known without its road address?
   - A. The thing is sir, the way that it works in Control is
   that we have to have a specific address and district to
   get the necessary pumps from the computer, to tell us which
   are the nearest pumps to send, so it is not up to me to
   assume which road it is on, I have to be told what road
   it is on so that I can access the computer to get the
   information I need.

Q. So do you mean to say that if you simply put into the
   computer "Hillsborough football ground" the computer won't
   know what you are talking about? - A. No sir, it won't.

Q. You have got to put the name of a road in? - A. That is
   right, and the district sir.

Q. If for example you put in "Hillsborough football ground,
   Penistone Road, 6" would that be sufficient? - A. No sir.

Q. No? - A. No, because I would need a district.

Q. The district is 6? - A. It does not know

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Very demanding these machines,
     aren't they? - A. It doesn't go on numbers, sir, it goes
     on the actual name of the district.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:  So "Penistone Road, Hillsborough"
     would that do? - A. Well actually it was Penistone Road,
     Owlerton.  That would do, yes, that would get me an
     attendance for that particular road, yes.

Q. What if it came in "Leppings Lane, Owlerton"? - A. Provided
   that the computer can validate that address and recognise
   it, that too would give me an attendance for that road.

Q. So even a place as big as Hillsborough needs this kind of
   information? - A* Yes sir.
                                  S.E. DAVIES


It is quite clear, isn't it, that the Police Officer was
speaking to you as a matter of urgency wasn't he? - A. Yes
sir.

Because your question is:   "What road is it on, do you know?"
- A. That is right.

And the reply comes back:  "There has been a major accident,
all the ambulances are up there." - A. Yes sir.

Now you weren't deflected from your request for the name of
the road, were you? - A. No sir.

Because when you ask the Policeman what road it is on, you
said:  "I have no idea, Hillsborough football ground."
That is right, is it? - A. That is right.

Then I think there was a conversation going on in the back­
ground at the Police Station.  "Hillsborough football ground,
what road is it on?"  "Penistone Road"? - A. That is right,
yes.

So you then confirm "Penistone Road"? - A. That is correct,
yes.

That is enough for you, is it? - A. Penistone Road, they
said Hillsborough and it came up as Owlerton which is all
right because it is the same area.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    How do you mean "it came up
as Owlerton"? - A. Well, sir, it is rather difficult to
explain.  You put in a road and you can put in Sheffield
or Barnsley or whatever, the district, but the computer
knows what district that road is in and it will then give
you options of the district and you have to make sure you
have got the right district because some roads go from
one district to another and you must know exactly where
you are going so that it can give you the exact attendance.

Are you working into the computer from this conversation
as you go? - A. Yes sir, I am.

So what, you then get Penistone   Road and   you type that in,
do you? - A. That is right sir,   yes.

And you then get up on the   screen Penistone Road,Hillsboroug
Is that what you got? - A. Y e s .

So then you knew you had actually homed in on this rare spot?
- A. That is right, sir.

      MR. PHILLIPS: Couldn't you rely upon your own know­
ledge or the knowledge of others in the Fire Control Room
as to where Hillsborough football ground was or might have
been? - A. My training sir   is not to assume where the
incident is.  It is up to me to ask questions and ascertain
                            42
                                        S.E. DAVIES


     from the person who is making the call exactly where it
     is.  Through the conversation with the Police the first
     suggestion that it might be Penistone Road did come from
     my Senior, Mrs. Moody, she first suggested it was Penistone
     Road more or less simultaneously with the Police saying
     it was Penistone Road.

Q. Then you asked:    "What's exactly involved?" - A. That is
   right.

Q. And the Policeman tells you:  "It's football, a big match,
   Liverpool v Notts Forest." - A. That is right.

Q. Did you in Fire Control Operations Room know that there was
   a semi-final on that day? - A. No sir, I didn't, personally
   I didn't.

Q. So far as you are aware had the Fire Service been informed
   of this event? - A. We are usually informed if there is
   big matches in Sheffield.  The Officers are informed in
   case there is any problems with congestion or things like
   that.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   "With congestion"? - A. Traffic
     around the areas.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS: Had the information not come through
     to your room? - A. I had no knowledge of that information,
     sir, myse lf .

Q. Then you asked whether it was a road traffic accident.       Is
   that right? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. That must have been just a mishearing on what was said
   before, wasn't it, because they had said to you that it
   was a "major accident"? - A. They had, but up to that point
   they had not said exactly where it was, whether it was in
   or outside the ground.

Q. Then he says:  "No, no, no, major incident inside the
   ground." - A. That is righ

q . isn't that enough for you then? - A .   I have to know, sir,
    exactly what the incident is.

Q. So you ask him:  " ___    do you know exactly what it is?"
   - A. That is right.

Q. He says:  "No I don't, they want all the cutting gear."
   Will that do? - A. No sir, because that is still not telling
   me what exactly has happened.

Q. Well it is a request from an emergency service, namely the
   Police, for the attendance of your vehicles with cutting
   gear at a particular location.  Why won't that do? - A.
   Because the exact nature of the incident determines the
   attendance that we will mobilise from Fire Service Control.

Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  What do you mean, the number
      to attend? - A. That is correct sir, yes.   I need to know
      exactly what it is to know what exactly to send for that
      particular incident.

q .          MR. PHILLIPS:  So you say:  "For what, do you know?"
       That is what they want the cutting gear for.   Is this again
       part of your instruction, your duties? - A. This is part
      of my training, yes sir.

Q. Then the Police come back to you I think, don't they and
   you again say:  "Now you want some cutting gear, what
   exactly is it for?" - A. That is lright.

Q. And this reply is given to you:

             "There has been a major accident at Hillsborough
             football ground where the semi-final is, the
             crowds have forced their way in, they have
             broken fences and gates down, I don't know
             exactly what it is but there are people trapped."

       A. That is right.

Q. That is the best information you can get, isn't it? - A. Yes
   sir.

Q. And then you say:    ".... leave it with us."  Now      thiscon­
   versation had taken some   little time, hadn't it?      It
   finished at 15.14.58? - A. That is correct.

Q. That is to say two seconds short of quarter-past-3? -
   A. Yes.

Q. And it had taken, therefore, a-minute-and-three-quarters?
   - a . Yes.

 Q. In response to this call that you had had from the Police,
    what did you do? - A. I was instructed by my Senior to
    mobilise six water ladders, an emergency tender and the
    Control Unit, which I did.

 Q.    Did you mobilise them from Fire Stations   near to the ground?
       - A. Yes sir.

 q.    Bur I think ^ou also sent them from some distance as well
       didn't you.    What is the nearest Fire Station to the
       ground? - A.   The nearest Fire Station to the ground is
       Central Station.

 Q.    In Wellington Street? - A. No, I would rather not say
       because I am not sure in mileage whether that would be
       actually the nearest station or whether Rivelin would be
       the nearest station.

 Q. But your computer tells you, does it, where to go? - A. It
                                        S.E. DAVIES


     gives me the 15 nearest pumps to that particular address
     and the five nearest special appliances should I need them.
     Rivelin, I understand, was the first pump, so that according
     to the computer would be the nearest pump to send.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Which one? - A. Rivelin Valley.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:  That is the one in which Station
     Officer Swain was, I think? - A. That   is right, yes.

Q.    That was the first to arrive at the ground, was   it not? -
     A. I understand it was, yes.

Q.    That was logged in at 15.22.   Is that   right, at the ground?
     - A. That is correct sir.

Q. Taking them what, seven minutes from the termination at any
   rate of the conversation that you had with the Police? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Some of that time would of course be taken up in your
   getting in contact with the individual Station, wouldn't it?
   - A. No sir, it does not work like that. What happens is
   I put the necessary information on to the computer and
   the relevant Stations are all notified at the same time.
   It goes simultaneously to all the Stations involved.

Q. So it comes up on their computer terminals, does it? - A.
   Well it   comes up on a printer on their Station, yessir.

Q. Without     you having to do any more? - A. Well all we do is
   press a     button and it automatically goes down.

Q. And that way the Fire Officers can be mobilised     practically
   as soon as you have finished getting the details? - A. Oh
   yes sir.

           MR. PHILLIPS: Yes, thank you very much.

           MR. HYTNER:  I have no questions, sir.  All 1 can
     say is that if the same criteria apply in Manchester, I
     am very relieved that Maine Road is on the computer even
     if Old Trafford isn't.


                   Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD;

Q. Miss Davies, what was the information that you put on to
   your computer to enable Rivelin Valley to attend? - A.
   The information I put on was "Wednesday football ground,
   Penistone Road, Owlerton" and then at the bottom the incident
   was:  "Major incident, cutting gear required".

Q. So the information that you sent out to enable the Fire
   Service to attend was the name of the football ground
   and the material and equipment that was required, cutting
   equipment? - A. That is correct, sir.
                             45

                                        S.E. DAVIES


Q. That is precisely what you were being asked for? - A. Yes
   sir.

Q. The ground.  Where did you get Wednesday Football Ground
   from? - A. Well when they came through Hillsborough it is
   known as Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground and they just
   said it was the football ground.

Q. Where had you picked up the word "Wednesday Football Ground"
   from? - A. Well I know Sheffield Wednesday play there, so
   it was Sheffield Wednesday's Football Ground.

Q. Now the cutting gear that was being ask for.  Do all
   appliances carry cutting gear? - A. Yes sir, they do.

Q. So if cutting gear is what was being asked for, why do you
   need to know anything else? - A. Because as I explained,
   sir, I need to know the nature of the incident to determine
   how many appliances and possibly specials to send to that
   incident.

Q. What is a "special"? - A. Well a special is an emergency
   tender or a hydraulic platform or a turntable ladder.
   Those are classed as specials.

Q. You then would be enquiring whether anything additional
   to the request should be sent? — A. Well what happened was,
   when my Senior realised it was a major accident, we have
   a standard attendance for a major accident which is six
   water ladders, one emergency tender and a control unit and
   she immediately told them to despatch that.

q. Does a special have any more cutting equipment than an
   ordinary tender? - A. I could not tell you sir, I could
   not be specific about that.

q.   is this the position, that any Fire Service appliance
     that will be sent by you would carry with it cutting
     equipment? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Do you know whether any cutting equipment was in fact used
   by the Fire Service? - A . I have no idea.

           MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.


                   Cross-Examined by MR. MULL ER:

Q. Miss Davies, I wonder if you can help me a little bit
   more about the way it works.

           In fact the information you were given was "Hillsborough
     Football Ground"?  - A. That is correct sir.

Q. Now there are certain special risk areas, are there not,
   which immediately put in the computer produce a certain
   number of pumps to be sent off? - A. There are sir, yes.
                              46

                                       S.E. DAVIES


Q. Is Sheffield Wednesday one of those? - A. It is sir, yes.
   It is what we call an enhanced attendance.  That means
   a special attendance has been made for that particular ....

Q. If somebody had told you "Sheffield Wednesday" that would
   immediately have produced something on your computer.  Is
   that right? - A. Yes  sir, it would have.

Q. And if somebody had told you "Hillsborough, Penistone Road"
   that would have produced on your computer information
   that Sheffield Wednesday was in that area? - A. Yes sir.

Q. If somebody had passed on to you the information as we know
   was actually sent from the ground, Hillsborough, Leppings
   Lane, again that would have produced the same information
   immediate response on your computer? - A. Yes sir.

Q. But all you were given was "Hillsborough" at that stage,
   in the initial stage at any rate, and as far as you know
   there may be many football grounds in Hillsborough? - A.
   That is correct, yes sir.

Q. And the way it works, therefore, is that you have to have
   precise information as to where it is in order to know
   which is the nearest pump? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Because the computer decides which is the nearest pump
   and produces the list of all the 15 pumps, is that right?
   - A- Which are the closest, yes.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I suppose knowing as you say
     you did that Sheffield Wednesday played at Hillsborough,
     you might have said:  "Hillsborough football, do you
     mean Sheffield Wednesday?"   You might have but you didn't,
     is that it? - A. Ho sir.

Q.         MR. MULLER;  In fact as you say the idea that it
     was Penistone Road did not come from the Police but came
     from your Supervisor who is listening in to everything.
     Is that right? - A. That is right, sir.

           MR. MULLER;   Yes, thank you very much.


                  CHIEF FIRE OFFICER J. SWAIN Called

                       Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

Q. Mr. Swain, you are a Station Officer at Rivelin Valley.
   Is that right? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   On the 15th of April you were incharge    ofRivelin   One
     appliance? - A. Yes sir.

q   . You received the call to attend at Hillsborough   at 16-
      minutes -past- 3? - A. Yes sir.

                                           J. SWAIN


       Q. And made your way to the Leppings Lane end of the ground?
          - A. Yes sir.

       Q. Why did you go to that end? - A. We had seen the scenes
          that were on television at 5-past-3 and the driver said:
          "Shall I go to Leppings Lane end" and I said "Yes".  It
          was immaterial which end because you can get through from
          one side to the other, you see.

       Q. How close to the Leppings Lane entrance were you in fact
          able to get? - A. To the perimeter gate.

       Q. Would you have wished to go further? - A. It would have
          been better to have got further in but it was immaterial
          really.  The equipment we had was portable.

       Q. I think the reason you could not get any further was because
          of other emergency vehicles? - A. There were ambulances
          parked inside the gates, sir.

       Q. When you talk about the equipment do you have any particular
          equipment in mind?   Are you thinking of cutting equipment?
          - A. Yes, cutting equipment.  The request was for cutting
          equipment and that was all organised on the way to the job.
          I had discussed it with the crew going to the job, you see.

       Q. So that was all ready to immediately off-load at the ground?
          - A. They were off-loading it when we got off the machine.

       Q. With whom did you make contact at the Leppings Lane end?
          - A. A Police Inspector, sir, I don't know which one,

       Q. What passed between you and him? - A. As I climbed off the
          machine X walked towards the Inspector who was just inside
          the gate and they were screaming for a resuscitator in the
          back of the ambulance parked just inside and I said to one
          of the lads:  "Get the resuscitator on and give it to them
          in the back of the ambulance". I walked up to the Police
          Inspector and I said to him:  "Where do you want me to go
          and what do you want me to do?"  He said:   "I don't Know .
          He then tried getting on the radio.  He tried his personal
          radio to contact whoever, I don't know.   There was nothing
          at all.  He got no response at all.  Whether they had heard
          him or there were radio problems I don't know, but he got
          nothing at all.

       Q. When you spoke to the Inspector did you make any specific
          reference to the fact that you had the cutting equipment
          that had been requested or was it just a general request
          "What should we do?" - A. I asked him where he wanted me
          to go and what he wanted me to do.

       Q. Once you realised he was having no success contacting
          his superior by radio, what did you do next? — A. I sent
          one of my Fireman, Fireman Brough, down the path by the
                          48

                                    J. SWAIN


  side of the river with the instruction to try and find a
  more senior Police Officer and find out what were the
  tasks he wanted us to carry out.  He came back and said
  there was nobody down there.  The most Senior Officer he
  could see down there was a Sergeant.  All the time this
  Police Inspector I was talking to was still trying to get
  through to his Control.

Q. Well once you realised there was no Senior Officer down
   the side either, what happened then? - A. I said to the
   crew with Leading Fireman:  "Go down on to the pitch
   and see what is happening" and I anticipated him going
   down there and coming back and reporting back to me what
   the incident actually involved but he never came back.

Q. What was the view of the Police Inspector at this stage
   as to your requirements? - A. Well just after the Leading
   Fireman had gone down with the crew he was still having
   no success getting through and he actually said to me
   at one stage:  "To be honest, kid, I don't really think
   we need you ".




                    /Q. Well now did
                                                     J. SWAIN

Q.   Well now, did another Police Officer in fact come    from
     the ground in an obvious state of shock? -A. Yes,    sir.

Q.   With a request for further   resuscitators? -A. Yes, sir.

Q.   What did that  cause you to do? -A. Well, there were
     casualties in the back of the ambulance and this Police
     Officer came running towards us in some distress and
     his words to me were, "We need all the resuscitation
     equipment we can get.   There is hundreds of dead and
     dying people on the pitch," with which I went back to the
     machine and requested further appliances to attend,
     resuscitation equipment.

Q. Now, was it at about that stage     that Mr.Robjohns
   attended? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.What is his position? - A. Mr. Robjohns is senior Officer
   to me, next senior rank to me, sir.

Q.    And so did he effectively take charge of the situation at
     your end? -A.   Yes, sir.  I requested ten pumps to attend
     the incident.    As I walked back round the appliance I
     met Mr. Robjohns and I says to him, "I've made pumps 10
     for resuscitation equipment.    I'm just going on to the
     pitch now to have a look for myself." He says, "You stay
     here and I'll go on the pitch."

Q. Now, did you have any contact at that stage with any
   other ambulances apart from the one you have described
   was already there? - A. Later on as the job progressed
   equipment was being sent for on the pitch and to the gym.
   Mr. Robjohns was making several requests over theradio
   for ambulances in the gym.  Leppings Lane was absolutely
   full of ambulances.  They were nose to tail on Leppings
   Lane, so I went across to the first ambulance and I said
   to the ambulance driver, "Do you know where the gymnasium
   is?" and he says "No."  So I says to this Police Officer,
   "Do you know where the gymnasium is?" and he says, "Yes."  I
   said, "Will you take these ambulances round to the gymnasium
   Our senior Officer is screaming for ambulances in the
   gymnasium." And that ambulance set off with the Police
   Officer and I then told three or four further ambulances
   just follow that ambulance round to the gym.

Q. Where you have a situation such as that where Police, fire
   and ambulance are all involved who would normally be
   directing the ambulances and the fire engines as to where
   they are required? -A. It depends on the incident.   An
   incident of that nature it is the Police who are the co­
   ordinating body.  If it is a fire then it works the other
   way round.  The fire authority or the fire service have
   overall command of the incident but in this incident it
   is the Police who co-ordinate the movements or co-ordinate
   all three emergency services.
                                                 J. SWAIN

Now, at some stage I think you did go into the ground?
- A . Yes, sir.

Approximately how long after your arrival was that?
Are we talking about five minutes, ten minutes? - A.
Oh, no.  More than an hour.  There were no casualties
on the pitch when I went into the ground. The incident
had been virtually wound down then.

Apart from the Inspector    to whom you had first spoken
did you see any evidence    of any other senior Police Officer
who came out and assumed    control at that end of the
ground? - A. Not where I    was, sir, no.

     MR. GOLDSACK:   Yes.     Thank you.

             Cross-examined by MR. HYTNER:

Mr. Swain, could I just ask you very briefly about Fire
Brigade procedure?  The first thing is that when you are
called out to a major fire, for example, at a factory or
somewhere of that sort you would normally expect, would
not you, to be met by somebody who could brief you as
to the material matters that you have to take into con­
sideration in fighting the fire? - A. No, sir.

Security officer? - A. No.

Nobody at all? - A. No.

Do you look round for somebody who can give you information,
for example? - A. You always look to glean as much
information as you can.

You need information obviously to know what to do in the
fire? - A. You need information but if the information ois
not there then it is based on your own judgment.

Yes.  If you go to an incident of this sort you would look
round for somebody who can brief you, somebody in control?
- A. In the circumstances to meet a Police Inspector at
the gate with all those Police Officers about and all the
crowd was like - I have described it as winning the pools.
It is about as lucky as winning the pools.

I see.  Did you get very much information from them?-A.
None, sir.

     MR. JACKSON:    I have no questions.

           Cross-examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

Just one question, please, Mr.Swain.  Is it anywhere
recorded what time Mr. Robjohns arrived at Leppings Lane?

                                                       J. SWAIN

     - A. Yes, sir, but I have not got it here.

Q.   Do not worry. Perhaps you could let your Counsel know        in
     due course and I shall be told. - A. Yes, sir.

          MR. KALLIPETIS:      Thank you.

          MR. GLASGOW:      No questions, sir.

                 Cross-examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q.   Officer,do the Fire Brigade encounter problems with large
     establishments such as a football ground? - A. We do a
     1 1 D visit, sir, annually.

Q. So you were fully familiar with the layout, were you?
   - A. I have been to Hillsborough Football Ground on a
   1 1 D inspection approximately three years ago, sir.

Q. What is a 1 1 D inspection? What is the object of that?
   - A. It is to check access for appliances, the layout of
   the building, water supplies, fire alarm systems, etc., etc.

Q. And is that an action that is taken by the fire station
   closest to the place or by the fire service generally?
   -A. No, it is done by the fire station in whose area the
   building falls.

Q.So that would be your fire station. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Rivelin Valley.  Does it follow from that that the sort of
   things you would acquaint yourself with would be where the
   control centres were at such a place? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Like the clubs control room? —A. No, I did not know where
   the clubs control room was, sir.

Q. Like the Police control room? -A. Well, when I was talking
   to the Inspector who I assumed had got contact with his
   control room he was in a position to give me all the
   informational would need, what he wanted me to do.   When
   I first arrived I thought he was there specifically   to
   meet me.

Q*        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think Counsel is asking
     about when you do your 1 1 D inspection. - A. Yes, sir.

Q.    You sort out where the control rooms are? - A;    Yes, sir.

Q.        MR.  WOODWARD:   For purposes of familiarisation amongst
     other things? -A. With its location, not its contents, sir.

Q.    With its location? - A.With its location, not its contents.

Q.    Well, do you mean that it is between Leppings Lane and

          Penistone Road? -A. No, the actual location of the control
          room.  I am not bothered about what is in it.

     Q. I am sorry. Forgive me.  I thought you meant the location
        of the ground. -A. No, no.  Just the location of the
        control room.

     Q. So the fire service would know and you would expect it to
        know in relation to such an establishment so large as
        Hillsborough ground where the Police control room was?
        - A. Yes, sir.  Mr. Lockwood, senior Officer, on his
        arrival went straight to that Police control room.
        Divisional Officer Lockwood on his arrival went straight
        there.

     Q.   Forgive me. I   am not trying to trap you. - A. No, sir.

     Q.    1 am trying to ascertain what you do on your D D I visit,
          what information you need to get to be best prepared.
          Do you follow? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q.   That is part of the purpose of your visit, the D D 1
          inspection - I beg your pardon - is to be best prepared
          should you have to attend? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. And that would involve familiarising yourself with the
        layout? -A. Of the ground.

     Q. Is that right? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. And identifying x-;here the nerve centres were,    the control
        points would be found? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. And that information would then be made available for any
        of your fire service appliances that might be called to it?
        -A. Yes, sir.

     0. So Xi?hether it is kept in the form of a log, a map, that
        information, namely, x^here the control room was would be
        something that the fire service would know before it
        actually attended an incident? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. It was plain, was not it, that the Police were having
        difficulties in communication? -A. Yes, sir.

     Q. Did you think of sending anybody to the Police control
        room? -A. No, sir.




                                      /Q. Would that not

Q. Would that not be an obvious thing to do?   A.  I sent the
   crew to try and ascertain what the incident was down on
   the ground, in the ground.

Q. Yes, but you sent them down on to the pitch?        A. Into the
   ground, yes, sir.

Q. Where did you send them to?   A. I sent them down to the
   ground behind the Leppings Lane Stand, in that area.

Q. It is not suggested that is something that should not have
   been done.  You sent them off to explore, in effect, did
   you?   A.  Yes, sir.

Q. Why not send someone to a specific destination, or "Go
   to Control;  it's obvious we ean't find out from anybody
   round here"?   A. Well, I anticipated, I expected that
   the Police Inspector would be able to contact his Control.

Q. But it was plain that he could not, was it not?  A. Well,
   I was hoping it was just going to be a local difficulty.
   He didn't explain that he had been having problems with
   his radio.  When I arrived, he immediately got on to his
   radio as though  it was going to work.

Q. There were other fire appliances that attended?         A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. You and your men never used any of their cutting equipment,
   did they?   A. No, sir.

Q. Did you ever find out who was or should have been in
   control of what was happening at the ground that day?
   A.  Not till very much later, sir.  I was only i n c h a r g e
   of the incident for probably the first seven or eight
   minutes.

Q.    I see.  Then who took over from you?   A. Mr. Robjohns
     took over from me, who was subsequently taken over by a
     Divisional Officer.

         Mr. WOODWARD:    Thank you.

                Cross-examined by Mr. M U L L E R :

Q. You were the first to arrive?       A. Yes, sir.

Q. At 22 minutes past?        A. Yes, sir.

Q. When you arrived, did you regard yourself as the contact
   point until a control unit arrived?    A. Yes, sir.

Q.    Actually, a control unit did arrive, I think, from
     Mexborough?   Is that right?   A. Yes, sir.

                                                  J. SWAIN

Q. Do you know when that arrived?      A. No, sir, not without
   looking at the Log.

Q. Never mind.   The point is that you would indicate that
   you were the contact point, and would that be by leaving
   your blue light on?    A.  I would indicate to Control
   over the radio that Rivelin 1 was the contact point for
   the incident, but I had already directed Darnall Road
   applicances to go to the Penistone Road end of the ground
   prior to this because we were having difficulty gaining
   access at that end, at the Leppings Lane end.

Q. Would other fire engines know that you were the contact
   point by you having your blue light still flashing?
   A.  Yes, sir.

Q. Just help us about this:   How many men are there on your
   crew?   A.  That day there were five of us, sir.

Q.   Is that the number there would be on a normal appliance
     of your kind?   A. Five or six, sir.

Q.    Five or six. When you got there, you had really discovered
     where to go, or where you thought you had to go, because
     of what you had heard on the television?   A. What we had
     seen on the television, yes.

Q. You had not been given any further information by the
   Police by that time as to which particular part of the
   ground you were supposed to be going to?   A.   No, sir.

          Mr. MULLER:   Thank you very much.

                   By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

Q. Can you just help me a moment?  You had been told, when
   you departed, that you were required to bring cutting
   equipment?   A. Yes, sir.

Q. When you sent your crew on to the pitch, did you send any
   cutting equipment with them?   A. No, sir.

Q.   Why not?    A. Well, when I first arrived and saw the
     people in the ambulance, I thought that was the nature
     of the incident, sir.

Q.   Do you mean it was over?   A. Yes, sir.  What I saw outside -
     I mean the pictures thatwe had seen were at 5-past-3   ---

Q. Yes, I see.    A.  It was quarter of an hour after that
   and I thought that was the incident that the ambulance had
   dealt with, and then when the Police Inspector said to me
   "To be honest, I don't really think we need you", at that
   stage I assumed that that was the job.

Q. What does the Control Unit do?   Does it co-ordinate ---
   A.  The Control Unit comes and co-ordinates the whole of
                                               J. SWAIN


the Fire Service activity ---

At the scene?   A.   At the scene.

What, it has radio, does it, or what?    A. Yes, sir.

Do you carry radio with you?    A. Yes, sir.

But you could not contact anybody in the ground yourself?
What channel do you work on?   A.I don't know what Channel
number it is, sir.  What normally happens is that the
radio is switched on to Channel No. 1, which is for every­
day use, where everybody talks to everybody and everybody
listens to the conversation.  When we get a major incident
like this, the Control Unit instructs us all to transfer
on to Channel 2, which means that they direct the whole
of the radio traffic;  I can't hear what anybody else is
saying, and I can only speak to the Control Unit other
than by request.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Thank you very much.  We will
break off.   I think counsel will find it useful, for
preparation purposes, if we had a little longer adjournment,
so I think we will rise until 10-past-2.

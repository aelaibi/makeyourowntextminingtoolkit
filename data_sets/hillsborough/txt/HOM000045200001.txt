Date:     15 September 1997

To:     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith




x am enclosing

                 the letter and preliminary submission from Professor Scraton which you
                 looked at on Friday (you took his book, ‘No Last Rights’ away with you); and

                 the police operational order for the semi-final (you have a copy o f this already,
                 but parts are illegible - we asked the police for this better one, just
                 received).

I also attach an expenses claim form - please sign and date this at X on the third page and
return it to me. You should then get a payable order through the post. I can alternatively
arrange for the money to go straight into your bank if you give me account details.

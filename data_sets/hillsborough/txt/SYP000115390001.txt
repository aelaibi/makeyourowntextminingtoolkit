s u p e rv is in g    at the end of the game.    We continued onto
Leppings Lane and onto.Halifax Road to: the railway station
where we were further briefed as to the grouping and
movement of the train passengers to the ground.


       "~At 12.10 hours we split into half section <twos) to
patrol Halifax Road until the arrival of the special trail
between 13.45 and 14.15 hours.

         With Constable 7081 Radford I made my way along
 Halifax Road away from the ground.              I saw that there wa.
 steady flow of coaches and pedestrians making their way t
 the ground.            However there were several groups moving awa
  from the ground visiting the •GATEWAY- shopping c.ntre_«
  off licences on Halifax Road.             There were queues outside
  the off licences and I noted that more of the supporters
  heading towards the ground were carrying can. and bottles
  of beer.           They were in good humour.            ,

           I made along Halifax Road to the Junction with Wile.
  Avenue.            There I spoke to a South Yorkshire foot S e r g w n
  he told me that a pub nearby wa. full of .upport.r. Wl*>
   had been arriving from the direction of the ground «■ =
   public transport and taxis.             This location was           ^
   miles from the ground.
                                                                            ri-r
            From Wilcox Avenue Constable Radford and I returned
   along Halifax Road towards the ground.              § saw that -**• I
    the ’White Horse* appeared to be shut howsvar tha t|
    chairs and walls around the pub car park were full a
    shoulder to shoulder with supporters drinking beer
    bottles and cans.           The off licence opposite .till
    queue outside as I observed on my way up Halifax Ro*
    Closer to the ground the grassed areas around the
     •Gateway* shopping centre was being used like a
     site with groups of supporters eating, and drinking
     alcoholic beverages from cans and bottles.

       At 13.4 5 I returned to the railway station to await
the arrival of the special train.    On arrival the mounted
section along'with the foot officers grouped the
passengers together on 'bloc' escorted the supporters to
the Leppings Lane entrances.

       After arrival at the ground Constable Radford and I
moved back along Leppings Lane to the chip shop, from
 there we moved slowly along covering the football and
 roadway encouraging supporters to move on towards the
 ground.    Having swept large numbers of supporters to the
 entrances in this manner.    I took position about 50 yaros
 away from the entrances towards Halifax Road encouraging
 supporters to move off the roadway onto the footpath to
 allow the passage of vehicular traffic.      Constable Radforc
 was about 25 yards beyond me engaged in similar duties.


        There was now a steady flow of supporters towards U-,

  entrances.                                   „   . ...
       A short time after taking this position constable
  Radford and I were called by radio to return to the          . r
  turnstile entrances as the situation was becoming
  difficult to manage.

         On arrival I saw large numbers of supporters Inside
  the wrought iron perimeter gates, there was some crushing
  but I could see Constable 1300 Orunnill and 16»«
  Stanbridge in the area close to the turnstiles
   endeavouring to control the supporters entrance to         H
   turnstiles.   The situation was being frustrated by
   supporters flooding into the area.     X positioned «y«|
   across the left hand perimeter gateway of the terrace
   turnstile entrance to stop the flow.     A large c r o w d ^
   quickly gathered against the horse by those further «<
   All were demanding entry to the turnstiles and some “
   making determined efforts to pass me. I constantly
   appealed for the supporters to WAIT and BACK OFF.               ^
   THOSE INSIDE A CHANCE TO CLEAR THEN YOU MAY GO.                 ^
                                                              form 104A

These appeals went largly unheeded and supporters
continued to push against the horse and indeed some
to beat him out of the way.

          A gap of 8 to 10 feet opened up between myself and
 the back of the crowd close to the turnstiles.              I c.     ed
 to them also to BACK OFF, repeated calls
 and even though no pressure was directly on them those
 the back continued to push towards the turnstiles.                           .


          Similar efforts were made by other mounted officers
  at the other gateways some of the wrought iron gates were
  shut a short time but continued pressure caused them to

  reopen•

           Eventually the pressure from outside the perimeter
  was too great, my horse was forced sideways by the
   pressure into the turnstile area.        I was forced to turn
   and ride out of the gates.         I again endeavoured to s ow
   down the flow of supporters. • With other mounted o f H | ^
   I moved across the perimeter gates leading to « » ■ £ * -
   and West Stand turnstiles.  Simi l a r conditions existed i
   this are. but wa. 1........            than     In the west stand
    terracing entrance.     I continued to appeal to the                  ^
    supporters to 'back o f f but there was a clear
    determination to enter the ground.

            A nose to tall cordon of horses      was   formed » c r ^ | t
    entire leppings Lane entrance area.          I was at one OT
    closest to the shop adjacent to
    A crowd quickly built up on the road               »f V*
    and we were very soon under pressure from the s u m ­

On my return I saw a foot cordon had been made.           Close tc
the line I saw Constable Narey remonstrating with a man i
front of the foot cordon.        The man threw his hands up
disturbing the horse.      The horses reared slightly catchir.
the man on his leg kicking hin to the ground.           A passerby
assisted    the man to his feet, he limped over to the bridg
parapet and punched the stonework.           He made no complaint
or comment to me.      I took a static position outside the
foot cordon.

         Inspector Hands-Davies and Inspector Wilkinson took
 several mounted officers including myself around onto
 Penistone Road to stand by in the event of disorder on tr
 pitch.

         At the announced abandonment of the game I went w i ^
 Inspector Wilkinson back to Leppings Lane to oversee the
 departure of Liverpool Supporters.          When the bulk of
 supporters had cleared the ground we commenced to'patrol
  the area.    There were radio calls of disorder but I did
 not see any.     I continued to patrol until 1830 hours whei
  the mounted contingent were stood down.

          line, my love, i t ’s come

          the problem.

26m 10s                                         Well the problem is that I went
                                                to Ireland last year, and the
26m 20s                                         person that was with me in the
                                                car has reported to the police
                                                that I was driving and
26m 30s                                         drinking.  This was a lie.


          This was last year.

                                                Mm.

          Did you say it was last year.

                                                Yes.

          Yes go on.

                                                ?

26m 40s   And what are you telling me for me
          ducks.

                                                Well I want to know, I think I

          No idea.

33m 10s                                     There’s been apparently, could

35m 10s   Operations Room, PC

                                                Hello there, i t ’s
                                                       of ITN in London, can
                                                you just briefly tell us w h a t ’s
                                                happening at Hillboro.

35m 20s   I ’m afraid I can ’t
          that’s an unwillingness on
          my part, i t ’s just that at the
          moment, w e ’re formulating the
          police action in relation to a
35m 30s   disturbance at Hillsboro, and
          there’s nobody here w h o ’s
          witnessed w h a t ’s happening
          at first hand, or can really
          update you at all, I mean i t ’s
35m 40s   only a few minutes old.

                                                What w e ’re trying to establish
                                                is, is it, you know, too many
                                                people (inaudible) or is it
                                                actual violence.

35m 50s   I ’m afraid I d o n ’t know, again
          that’s not being deliberately
          unhelpful, i t ’s just that w e ’re
          co-ordinating the emergency
          services attending the scene
36        and we d o n ’t know the full
          extent of w h a t ’s
          happened or the cause at the
          moment.

                                                Are you operating (inaudible)
                                                at this stage in terms of
                                                getting ambulances (inaudible).

36m 10s   All, all the emergency services
          have been alerted, they are
          responding as they feel
          they’re required.

                                                Right and w h a t ’s the best means
36m 20s                                         of trying to get more info
                                                later on.

          Well you can try this one again
          later on, but I would suggest
          in bout an hours time at the
          earliest.

                                                Okay, and what about the ground
                                                itself, is there any point, if
36m 30s                                         I ring them at this stage.

                                               I ’ll leave it, h$ve, have you
36m 40s                                        got a number for the ground.

          Yes i t ’s not.

          they were only about ten
          minutes and he caught
          them off guard, they’ve
          gone to make a phone call
          somewhere.

                                          Right okay, it must have been
                                          really hard because that’s

          you the location before.

28m 30s                                   Aha.

          It was passed roughly you see
          from our radio operators
          and they just said in that
          vicinity so I ’ve got the
          exact location.
SA/29

                                              Okay.

17m 40s   What it is, the Fire Brigade
          and ourselves are in attendance
          at a fire on Balby Road at
          Doncaster.

                                              Aha.

17m 50s   It would appear to be quite
          a serious incident.

                                              A h a , anyone h u rt .

          And consequently
          I ’m not sure yet but
          certainly the fire is, I mean
          i t ’s only in i t ’s early
18m       stages at this moment.      Balby
          Road has been closed into
          Doncaster, that’s the main
18m 10s   road from the A1(M)
          into Doncaster town centre
          and they’ve had to close it and
18m 20s   they have set up a bit of a
          diversion but traffic’s now
          backed up to the A1(M) and if you
          could advise people to find an
18m 30s   alternative route for the next
          couple of hours, that may be
          quite advantageous to them.

18m 40s                                       Yes, and you d o n’t know how long
                                              i t ’s going to be closed ________
                                              (inaudible).

          I ’ve no idea at this stage,
          No.

                                              No, okay.

          W e ’ll keep you updated with
          any, any more news that you
18m 50s   could pass out over your
          airwaves.

                                            Wonderful.
How about that.

                                   Fair enough.

Thank you.

Cheers love, bye.                  Bye.

                                   Okay.

Yes what it is, the Fire Brigade
and ourselves are in attendance
at a fire on Balby Road.

                                   How do you spell that.

’B   A   L   B   Y.’

                                   Yes, Balby Road.

At Balby in Doncaster.

                                   Yes.

It is quite a serious think
and consequently the two, Sheff
sorry the two Doncaster
carriageways of Balby Road
has had to be closed and traffic
is now backed up to the
A1(M) and although a
diversion has been put into
effect.  There is some serious
congestion.

                                   So you do n ’t advise.

If you could advise people
if they could find an
SA/28                                8.


          alternative route if
          they’re going into
          Doncaster town centre
          please.

                                          Okay then.

          Okay.

                                          Okay.

          Thank you very much.

22m 40s   Operations Room Sergeant
          \   '    I

                                          Hello there, i t ’s British
                                          Telecom I ’ve just had word down
                                          that all your lines to Doncaster
                                          have gone off.

22m 50s   The internal ones, aye.

                                          I t ’s only internal ones to
                                          Doncaster.

          Yes.

                                          Have any others gone off.

          Not as w e ’re aware of,
          w e ’ve tried all others
23m       out stations on internal
          and we can get through
          to them.

                                          Ah.
          But this all happened
          yesterday and it cleared
          somehow.

                                          It did, you know at Doncaster,
                                          have they got a switchboard
                                          there then.

23m 10s   Yes.

                                          They have.

          Yes.

                                          Is there any chance of giving me
                                          number for it because I think
SA/28                               9.

                                             fault might be out actually at
                                             Doncaster.

23m 20s   Well i t ’s not only Doncaster
          but i t ’s, where, Mexborough
          and Thorne? as well.

23m 30s                                      Mexborough and Thorne, they’re
                                             having trouble.

          Yes i t ’s all Doncaster
          divisional stations, we can’t
          get to.

                                             Oh I see.

23m 40s   Now how that works I d o n’t
          know but.

                                             No I d o n ’t know but to be quite
                                             honest with you.

          I think it may possibly go
          through Doncaster Switchboard
23m 50s   although the codes that we dial
          are all common in first instant.

                                             W h a t ’s w h a t ’s the common code.

24m       70,

                                             70 and then what do you dial for
                                             Mexborough.

          And er, for Mexborough we dial
          7.2.

                                             7.0.7.2.

          Yes.

                                             Yes and w h a t ’s

          For Thorne we dial 7.0.7.3.

24m 10s                                      That’s it, it goes through
                                             Doncaster then.

          And for Doncaster itself we
          just dial 7.0 and number.

                                             That’s it, i t ’s Doncaster then,
                                             so.

          Do you want their number.

                                             Yes please.

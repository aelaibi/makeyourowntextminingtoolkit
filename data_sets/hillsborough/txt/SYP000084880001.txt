               HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER                   15/4/89



               At    9. am    (0900)      on      15 th April    1989,     I r e p orted to E c c l e s f i e l d Police

               S t a t i o n for duty and was             transported        by bus     to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football

                G r o u n d for briefing at 10 am (1000). I was detailed to serial 48 under
               ” 7TWZo
                Sgt MILLER. We were to pa trol the Wads ley and M i d d l e w o o d a r e a s . W h i l e

                 atr o l l i n g we    paid       particular a t t e n t i o n    to   pubs   in the area and

               noticed early on at                 perhaps about       12 o 'c 1ock      (1200)    that    the

               M i d d l e w o o d Ta v e r n was     busy ma i n l y wit h L i verpool        supporters.        Howe v e r

               we became more           concerned with           other     pubs    due to the      numbers       g a thering

               outside.       We saw large            numbers    outside The Horse & J o c k e y on Wads ley

               Lane and another             pub on Worrali          Road.    We    toured the area several              times

               noting     par t i c u l a r l y    that   the   crowd outside          the Horse and J o c k e y      become
                                                                                                             P AGt
                                                                                                             S 2 9 14

par t i c u l a r l y    large w i t h 3 0 0 -400       people      g a t h e r e d on its f o recourt            and

sitting       or    lying      on grass        verges and       private       garden walls          in the area

Although        the      crowd was       noisy and         boisterous,,       they did not appear

o p e n l y aggressive,           3! remember        three     or four      youths who were            lying       in

the    road     in Wads ley Lane,              apparently       oblivious        to their       surroundings

and    to the danger             to themselves          from    passing       cars.

We    continued touring              the area and at            one    point     came accross a senior

officer       to whom Sgt MI L L E R            ex'plained the         sit u a t i o n outside       the Horse

and Jockey,             I cannot     say who        this    officer was with any                cer t a i n t y

b ecause mv view of him from the                        rear    of the      van was o b s c u r e d      by my

c o 1 1 e a g ties, H e did however             t ell   u s t o rno n i t or t h e s i t u a t i o n o u t s .i.d e

the Horse & Joc k e y             but    not    to tackle any u n ruliness among                    such a larg

crowd without assistance.

We    returned          to take    up a       position      in the     van opposite          the Horse &

Jockey,       The       crowd had a p p a r e n t l y      become     noisier and were            sing i n g and

chanting more as               kick off        time a pproached.          It was a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1,45c

(1345),       I recall         that about        this      stage Sgt      MILLER and another PC                   got

out of the van to                r e m o n strate wit h a group of youths                  who were        chant:!.?'

o b s c e n i t i e s whilst      sitting       on a ga r d e n wall        to the      rear and

left    of the          run.

From    speaking          to some       of    the fans who a p p r o a c h e d the         van we      learned

that    the    pub had         run out       of draught        beer and       it was     because       of this

that    fans were           drinking         from cans and        some    from wine        bottles.       Many        of

these     emptied         containers         were    rolling about          on the      road some        coming         t

rest    under       car wheels.          One    fan though was a t t e m p t i n g         to clear       some        of

them up,We          noticed one          particular y o u t h         in a white        shirt     who was

having      diffi c u l t y     standing,        apparently         drunk.     He was      being     supported

by friends who also                s e e m e d u n s t e a d y an their      feet.

As we     looked at the            pub there was a 5*6**                 high stone wall            separating

the    pub forecourt            from a private             garden.     In this      garden behind            the

wall    were     large       bushes,       About 6 ~ -10 youths              started       climbing        on to         thxs

wall    where      they jumped up and down singing and                               chanting-          They

r epeatedly fell             of the wall           into      the    bushes and           re-app e a r e d from the

gr o u n d to    climb the wall              again.       1 also saw bottles and cans fly from

the    crowd     into     the ga r d e n with seeming                  dis r e g a r d for       the    p r o perty or

any o n e who might           have    been       in it.       This     said,       the    bulk of the          people          i

the a rea were          noisy but           still      not    openly aggressive.

Concern       grew amongst           my     colleagues         by 2 . 2 0 pm       ( 1 4 2 0 ) that     few had move

towards       the ground w h i c h was                perhaps       10-15 minutes walk away.                    Other

police       vehicles a r r i v e d at 2 . 2 5 - 2 . 3 0            (1425-1430)           and we were able                to

get    out    of the      van and move            the     crowd on.          I remember          that at       this

stage a chant           of    ’“You may have              took      the miners           but y o u ’ll never             take

the    r e d s ' ' come from one             section of the             crowd.However,             the     vast

m a j o r i t y of the       crowd m oved off towards                   the    ground.

We    reboarded        our   vehicle         and also        headed         towards       the    ground.       At    the

lower    end of W a d s i e y Lane a fan was a r r e s t e d and                          placed       in a    police

van    in front        of us. A n o t h e r       k n o c k e d on the w i n d o w of our               van as k i n g

where    the other was going                    so he     could get          the    ticket       off    the    fan who

had been arrested.

At about 2.50pm              (1450)       our    vehicle was           parked       on the       river     bridge         in

L e p p l n g s Lane    opposite          and o v e r l o o k i n g    the    turnstile area             for    the

Leppings        Lane    end.

There was a crowd of several                          t h o usand     people       outside       the    turns t i l e s

which    s t retched back            onto       the    road.       I saw a steady stream of                    p e o p 1e

being a s s i s t e d     over   the t u r nstile wall                 by police          officers.        I looked            o

from the van trying              to see          colleagues           who    I knew were          detailed          to    be

work i n g    in that area,           but       could not          see any among           the    crowd.I       heard

messages        concerninbg          the     crowd      prob 1 erns on the           vans       radio

including questions as                    to why the kick              off    could not          be d e l a y e d and.

          outside.           The    gate to the        right       of the turn s t i l e s        opened and           the crowd

          went       through.          We then     left     the van and           I was      instructed to turn

          a wa y    non-ticket         holders        from the           perimeter       gates.

           I had been             in this    p o s ition for            only a minute         or so when a sergeant

          called all              police    officers        into        the g r o u n d . I ente r e d the gr o u n d and

          came       out     onto     the      pitch from the N o t t i n g h a m             supporters            stand near the

    J l   Leppings           Lane     end     ter r a c e .

          I had no           idea what       had h a p p e n e d at that            stage,     I saw three            or four

          people           lying    on the     pitch and several                 more w a n d e r i n g about         looking

          dazed,, The             players    were     still        on the       pitch at      that    stage.

          I heard a colleague                  di r e c t i n g    those who        could move        to the side            of the

          pitch.           This    seemed to      be of       little        use as the        number      of    people       on the

          pitch was           growing       rapidly.        I noticed           people    being      lifted from the

          t er r a c i n g    onto    the stands above.                  One man,      strug g l i n g    for       breath said

          to me        "Its        worse    than B e l g i u m      in there*'.          I gathe r e d that           there was

          some      sort      of    crush s i t u a t i o n on the terracing.                  I remember            screams

          coming           from the    crowd,        ma n y who         came    onto   the    pitch had vomit and

          blood on their              clothing.

          I remember              finding    three      people          lying    in close      proximity            to each

          other,           one of whose        bre a t h i n g was        very    laboured,       another man w o u l d do

          no more           than open his eyes whe n                    I spoke     to him and a w oman who was

          groan i n g and           crying     but    could not move.              All    had strong           pulses       but

          there       seemed to be no way at                      that stage        of getting        them      proper medical

          as s i s tance.          I made    them as        comfortable as             possible and a nurse made

          herself           known to me.         I asked          her    to keep an eye

          p a r t i c u l a r l y on the man who was                    s t ruggling     to breathe.           As    I stood      up    1

          saw a PC heading                 towards      me w i t h a y o u t h of about              16 , yrs       in his arms.

          The youths              face was     purple.        I and the          other    constable        star t e d to

doctor      made      himself       k nown and advi s e d us           to finish and find someone w

could be more             use to.     Two    friends       of the y o u t h       broke    down and shortly

hel p e d    to carry him a way             on an a d v e r t i s i n g    hoarding.

I saw at this             point an a m b u l a n c e    had a r r i v e d    behind the         goal    and       that

a first aid station a p p e a r e d                to have      been set up in the              far    corner       of

the     pi.tch„ Fans,         firemen and          police     used b o a r d i n g s to .carry the

injured and dead that way.

There was           then a rush of Liverpool                fans     to the N o t t i n g h a m Forest            end.,

went wit h many other                officers       to the other           end to try and          prevent         any

clashes        of    rival    fans.       It was at      that end that            I heard the         first

d i r e c t order      give n sines         before     the disaster          occurred,        that was        to

form     two    lines and s h e ph e rd the            fans     back„

a g g r e s s i v e way    " T h e r e ’s people       fucking       dying    in there and all             you      ca

you.    W e ’ve been         carrying       them out what           have yo u d o n e ' ' T h e r e were

sporadic        shouts       from the        crowd to start          the    game.     This

brought        aggressive        reactions         from fans        on the    pitch and officers                  took

awa y    those who         had s h o u t e d to     prevent any violence.

As things           calmed a little,           opinions       as    to what       had h a p pened were

e x c h a n g e d among      fans and       police.      Most      b e l i e v e d a barrier      collapse         had

occurred        on the L e p pings          Lane    terrace.

I noti c e d        that my serial          memb e r s were        now a few yards away.               I joined

them and after             the   crowd had started            leaving       the    ground we

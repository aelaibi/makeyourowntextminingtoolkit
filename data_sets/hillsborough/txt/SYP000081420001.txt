                I am a         pensioner          and      I live      at    the     given address,

                I am a Li ve rpo ol               supporter          and     have     been       for m a n y y ea r s .

                On      the    15th of A p r i l           1989,      <1504 8 9)      I went        to      the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m

                situated           in Sheffield, to w a t c h                the C u p Semi           Final        match      between

                Liverpool            Football        Club and Nottingham Forest                             Football        C lub.

                I pur ch as ed my               ticket      from Anfield             previous         to     the     game and        p a id

                with      an    independently               organised             group    of    three,        including

                myself,         and       travelled         by    car.

                I don't         want       to    g iv e    their      details        as    i t ’s a m a t t e r       for     them    to      get    in

                to u ch .

                We      set    out       from Liverp oo l          at a b o u t      0945       ho u rs ,     that    day,     and    we      drove

                directly           to S h e f f i e l d     and     took      no    stops.

On    r o ut e          d id    encounter              traffic         delays       but     nothing          extensive.               Road

works       etc.

On    r o ute     I d i d n ’t n o t i c e           any    other       f a ns    drinking             and most         pubs    on

the    way were             shut.

We    arrived          in S h e f f i e l d         about     1 . 30    pm    (1330)        and        p a r k e d at     the P a r k

Hotel       Car     Park,       almost          in the        town      centre       about         fifteen minutes

walk     to      the    ground.            U)e t o o k a         little       while       to h a v e       our    sandwiches

and    other        refreshment.

Eventually             we    left        our    car a n d m a d e          our   way      to      the     ground.

We    did     not      see     or    receive           any Police            direction            or    escort        whilst       on our

way.        I d i d n ’t see a n y              disorder          or    drunkenness,               everyone           was    quite

happy and           c o n t en t .

We    a r r i v e d at       the     entrance             situated         in L e p p in gs        L n at      about £.30

pm    <1430).           I d i d n ’t see a n y               o r d e r l y q u e u e s , j us t    a mass        of       people

outside          the    main        gates       and       towards       the      turnstiles             area.

I asked          a Police           Officer          before       entering          the m a s s         where     gangway          G wa s

and    the       entrance           to    the       N o r t h St a n d .

He    t o l d me       that     if       I had a ticket                i s s u e d at L i v e r p o o l ,        I w i ll      enter-

through          the    Leppings           Ln       end,    so    I joined          the m a s s         then,     looking          for

the a p p r o p r i a t e       turnstile.

I d i d n ’t see a n y              sign       directing          me    to    the     North Stand              turnstiles.

I shuffled             on    the     left       s i de     towards         turnstile           A a n d at        t h is     time      the

crowding          was       tight        and    uncomfortable.

I wa s      going       to     g iv e     it a f e w         seconds and           if      it d i d n ’t ease, I w a s

going       to w i t h d r a w       for       my    own     safety.

Fortunately,                I did        head       for    the    r i g ht    turnstile            appropriate              to m y

ticket,          where       I met        two       Policemen          who    were      checking           tickets          p r ior    to

me    entering          a turnstile.

I entered           through          the       turnstile          and      did    hand my          ticket        in,      retaining

                                                                                                                                S2563

Upon       entering           I d i d n ’t see         any    gates       open       apart       from       the     turnstiles,

nor       did w it ne ss        any       gate    opened.           I didn't,         see a n y        fans       making

unauthorised                entry.

Having          passed        through       the     turnstile            and    entering             the    y ard,      I did        see a

sign       for     my    particular             section       ’G*     which      I required,                so    I had        no

difficulty              in f i n d i n g    my m a tc h       viewing          point.

I did        not      see     the    tunnel       for    the    Leppings             Ln    standing           terrace.              Having

passed          through        the    turnstile          and     finding         my       seat,       I saw       no    disorder,

fighting           or    unusual          incident       and     I d i d n ’t see              any    fans       consuming

alcohol          within        the    ground.

I think          I. took       up m y      seat    at    about        2.40      pm    <1440),          and       I d i d n ’t

experience              any    crush       or    discomfort.              I sat       with my          friends          and

prepared           to w a t c h      the    game.

I was        unaware          of a n y     unusual       incidents             within          the    ground        and    I

certainly             d i d n ’t see       any    disorder          or    fighting.

I d i d n ’t see a n y              crowd       crush    or    surge       in a n y        part       of    the     gr o u n d .

During          the     course       of    the    d a y ’s e v e n t s ,       I did       not       receive        any    injuries

of a n y        kind.

At    3    pm    <1500),        the       teams     came      out a n d        kicked          off.        I watched           the

game.           Shortly afterwards                  I saw      people          spill       over       out     the      pens

behind          the     Liverpool          goal    onto       the     pitch.          I thought             it w as       due       to

excess          numbers        in the       pens       and    I thought          they would                be a l l o w e d     to       sit

around          the     perimeter          of    the    pitch.           Then    the       numbers          increased           and       the

g am e     was     stopped and             it    became       obvious          then       that       something          serious

was       goi n g. I. d i d n ’t b e c o m e       aware       ho w      serious          it wa s      until        I saw       fa n s

moving          persons        on m a k e s h i f t     stretchers             made       up    of a d v e r t i s i n g

hoardings.Some                 of    the    persons          h a d got     their          heads       c o ve r ed .

I d i d n ’t w i t n e s s          any    deaths       and    I was       unable          to a s s i s t        with any           dead

or    injured and              I d i d n ’t o b s e r v e      any       specific          incident.              I just

observed           the      events        from a distance.                 I didn't             witness          anything           that

                                                                                                                                  S256S

could        be       considered a                criminal          offence     by a n y o n e        in the          ground.

At     about          4    pm      (1600):,       the    same       day*     I left      the     ground with my                  friends

of m y a c c o r d .                  I d id    hear     shortly afterwards                    on the        ra dio     that

t he    match             ha d    been abandoned.

The     only          v i e ws        observations            I can m a k e     is     t ha t    after          the m a t c h was

stopped           a       la rge       number       of P o l i c e m e n     came     from      the       entrance/exit               from

the S p i o n             Kop     end and         lined       up a l o n g    the     length         of    the    pitch         facing

the    North Stand                     seating.          Now whoever           told      them        to    do    this     obviously

did     it    in the              event        of a n t i c i p a t i n g    some     s or t    of    trouble         and       had

judged        the          situation            completely wrongly and                      it h a d       upset       f an s    in the

North Stand                  greatly.

Even     when             bodies        were      moved       from    the     Leppings          Ln    terrace         area       of    the

pitch        it wa s             quite     obvious         th a t    no S e n i o r    Officer            gave    any

instructions                     to    those      lined       up to     render        any assistance.

It a p p e a r e d           they had a             plan      for    dealing        with        disorder           but no p l a n        in

the     event             of a t r a g e d y        s u c h as      this.

I was        a w a r e , however,                 that     there      were     Policemen             giving       aid and

assistance                 but        those     in the        line w e r e     wasted          in m y      view.

I wrote           to       the        Incident       Room      because        I felt        very      strongly           a b o u t the

access        given              to L i v e r p o o l    supporters           who     required            the N o r t h S t a n d .           We

should        not          have        used     the L e p p i n g s     Ln    turnstiles,             we     should       have        been

allowed           to       use        another       entrance.

This     would             h a ve      relieved         the    numbers       and      the      pressure          at    the L e p p i n g s

Ln     stand          site.

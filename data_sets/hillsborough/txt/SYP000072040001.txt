           On Saturday       15 April       1989    <150489),        I went    to H i l l s b o r o u g h football

           I got my ticket           from Anfield,        Liverpool        ground    I paid £6 for        it

                                 The    coach did not stop on route for any refreshment,

               We    had ti^tff^f i c delays       on the M62,        firstly because    there had su ppo sed ly

               been an accident,            therefore we were all           filtered    into one      lane of slow

               mov i n g   traffic,       and    later on due to        road works we tr avelled           in two

               lanes.

               We got on the            coach    in Prior y Road,       Anfield,    there were      police       there

               checking       people for alcohol,            therefore     no alcohol was taken onto                  the

               coach.

               We ar r i v e d    in S h e f f i e ld at 2 pm and the       coach was    parked about 2 miles

               away but       I d o n ’t know the name of the             road.

               We w a l k e d from the          coach to the ground,        every fifty yards         or so there

               were    groups       of police      officers     standing ar o un d wa tching        the

               supporters.             We d i d n ’t receive any Police       escort    or dire ct ion to the

               ground,       because we didn't          need    it.     We just    followed the mass            of

               people walking            down Le ppi ngs Lane.

               I didn't witness any disorder,                  fighting or drunkeness           on the      route

               from the       coach to the ground.

               We ar r i v e d at the entrance              to the ground at 2.30       pm - 2 .40        pm.        At

               that    time there were no queues at the turnstiles.                          There were about 2~

J— A T V l L   3 th ou sa nd     people milli ng around,              pushing and shoving their way

               towards       the entrance.          We stood outside        the ground because we               c o u l d n ’t

                >nter the turnstile area due to the mass                     of    people.     It

               looked as         if people were going to get killed.                  We were getting            pushed

               all    over    the      place and crushed.At about 3 pm, all              of a sudden the gate

               opened,       I didn't      see who opened        it.     Then the two thousand

               su pporters        outside       just made for this gate and           I was swept along with

mass     of surging         people and           rushed through the gate.            No one as ke d me

for my ticket and                 I retained       it as a       whole.

I saw two m o un te d officers                   outside,    but    they didn't    seem to be doing

anything.         One of them kept swirling                      round and    round knocking

supporters        out of the way,                this made       matters worse    because        it pushed

fans     into other         fans.

I don't       know    if all        the    people who       rushed    in with me,      as    I said a

couple of thousands,                 had tickets or not.              I had my ticket        but    I can't

say for the others.                  I have m is lai d my ticket.

Once     inside the ground                I didn't       have a chance to see any signs

di recting       us to our          viewing       point.     I was    just swept along           like a tide

with     the mass      of people.

I just       couldn't       leave     the       crowd,    I wa n t e d to but    there was       no way    I

could       it was   either         go with       the    crowd or get.'lost on the floor.                 There

Iwas alternative,      was crushed                       in the    pack as they     ran down the

  ,uni?'el. The tunnel was dark,

,1    only noticed one officer                   on foot near the tunnel           but no stewards at

all.

The     tunnel was       so       compact with          people    I couldn't move other           than

forwards       towards        the    pens.

It was a surge           into the          pens    I was    forced    into the back of pen 3.                  I

catQd feel       other        fans    behind me pushing            us forwards      nearer and nearer

the     pitch.       I was        pushed forwards          for quite a few feet            I can't say how

many.

I remember        that              and    I were together                   das somewhere        else    in

the standing area,                the others were           in the    seats.

I remember               shouting,          'Get back,       get back."         I mo ve d over     to the

left and              was trying           to    pull a lad up off the floor.                I can't

recall what          this     lad looked          like,    but        was    trying bard to lift him

up because        supporters were                standing and treading on him.

                I don't        remember much else,          other    than    I found myself       on top of a

                barrier.          I could feel my         ribs   crushing and a pain to my             left     leg.       I

                shouted to get me off              this    barrier,    and a lad behind me shouted,                   ’Get

                this man off the b a r r i e r . ”




                                    I was only wearing my trousers and socks,

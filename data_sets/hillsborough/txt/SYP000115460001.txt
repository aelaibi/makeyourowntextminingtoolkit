      f      which      had      gathered           in a n t i c i p a t i o n .      At     i4EOynours          we    repeated              the

             process          upon     the    arrival          of    the      N o t t i ngHcffn F o r e s t      team          coach

             We     were      eventually            able     to m o v e       t he    crowd       as    far     as    the       perimeter

             railings           and    to    close       the    gates         incorporated              in that        fence.           In t h i s

             position           it w a s     possible          to    dictate          th e    flow      of     fans    by       restricting

             t he    numbers          allowed        through         the      perimeter           f en c e .     As    we       continued

             this      process,            I saw     behind         me   t ha t      the     exit      gate     I hacl u s e d          earlier

             was     n ow     open     and    fans       were       once      again        gaining       acoess,               albeit        in

             reduced          numbers.

             Shortly          after        this,     about       1 450     hours                    rnstiles          were          s hut    a n d we

             officially            abandoned,            when       we   instructed            to      pa trol       the       perimeter           of

             the     ground,          by    Inspector          Hand-Davies.                This     I did       in    company with

             Constable           7081       Radford,         until       we     received          instructions                 to    stand        down

             at     1 8 00    hours ,

                     MUTUAL AID SHEFFIELD 15.4.89.
    S u b ject



            With reference to the above, I report that on
   Saturday 15/4/89, I paraded at 06.00 hrs to perform duty
    in accordance with the proposed mutual aid transaction In
    respect of the semi-final round of the F.A. Cup
    competition beween the Liverpool and Nottingham Forest
    football clubs.                This fixture was to be held at the
    Hillsborough football ground, Sheffield,                      the province of
    the South Yorkshire Police.                                                        |


            After standered preparatory procedures, I travelled
    with fellow officers and respective horses by Police
    transport to the Niagra recreation facilittes, Sheffield.


             Our arrival at 1 0 . 0 0 hrs was followed by a
    refreshment period and then a briefing administered by
    Inpsector Hands-Davies of the South Yorkshire Hounted
    Department.            Myself, together with Constable 4 3 6 5 Edge,
    Constable 4 8 8 6 Narey of this force and C o n s t a b U 2 6 1 3
    Lindsay of the South Yorkshire Mounted were detailed to*!
    cover the Directors Car park at the Hillsborough ground.


             I subsequently paraded at 11.30 hrs with mounted,jJ|p
    colleagues and we took up our respective about the
     football stadium.

             At 1 4 . 1 0 hrs myself and the three other mounted                   ^
     officers assisted with the arrival of the Liverpool tea*|
     coach, by organising the crowd which had gathered in
     anticipation.                At 1 4 . 2 0 hrs we repeated the process u]
     the arrival of the Nottingham Forest team coach.

We were eventually able to move the crowd as far as the
perimeter railings and to close the gates incorporated in
that fence.     In this position it wa's possible to dictate
the flow of fans by restricting the numbers allowed
through the perimeter fence. As we continued this
process, I saw behind me that the exit gate I had used
earlier was now open and fans were once again gaining
access, all be it in reduced numbers.


         Shortly after this, about 14.50 hrs the turnstiles
were shut# and we began to disperse the remaining crowd.
Together with a contingent of mounted officers.      I was
directed to stand to at the ramp area of the ground in
 Penistone Road.     We remained static until the game was
 officially abandoned, when we instructed to patrol the
 perimeter of the ground, by Inspector Hand-Davies.       This I
 did in company with Constable 7081 Radford, until we
 received instructions to stand down at 1800 hrs.


         I eventually went off duty at 2300 hrs at GreenhilJ
 Road.

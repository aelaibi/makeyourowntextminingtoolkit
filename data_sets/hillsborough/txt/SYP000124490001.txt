 Q54,’

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 WHEN I WAS UP THE SPION KOP END AT ABOUT A COUPLE OF MINUTES TO THREE

 (1458), THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICE DOG VANS THEY HAD OBVIOUSLY GOT A

 MESSAGE AND THEN THE POLICE AND THEIR DOGS WENT RUSHING INTO THE GROUND.

 THE POLICE WERE OBVIOUSLY GETTING THE WRONG INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WAS

 HAPPENING INSIDE THE GROUND, AS THERE WAS NO NEED FOR DOGS.   THIS ACTION

 CONFIRMS THAT THE POLICE WERE NOT GETTING THE RIGHT INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT

 WAS GOING ON.

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IN MY OPINION THE POLICE ON THE TRACK TOOK FAR TOO LONG TO REALISE THAT THERE

 WAS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IN THE TWO CENTRE PENS, AND ALTHOUGH FANS WERE PLEADING

 TO BE LET OUT NOTHING SEEMED TO HAPPEN FOR SOME TIME.    IT ONLY SEEMED THAT WHEN

 T ^ MATCH WAS STOPPED AND SEVERAL FANS HAD CLIMBED THE FENCE AND FELL ON THE

 PITCH THAT THE SERIOUSNESS WAS REALISED. FROM THEN ON, ALTHOUGH EVERYONE

 SEEMED TO BE BUSY, CHAOS SEEMED TO REIGN.


G19

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ■1) FROM THE TIME I TOOK UP MY PLACE I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCING

 FROM PENS 3 & 4 INTO PENS 2 & 6 WHICH WERE VIRTUALLY EMPTY.     I FEEL F R O l ^ S

 J U l Y AS 2 . 15PM (1415) MORE EFFECT BY POLICE OR STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN MADE

 TO TRANSFER FANS FROM 3 AND 4 INTO THE SIDES AND POSSIBLY TFJOSE PENS SHOULD

 HAVE BEEN CLOSED AS NO MORE COULD ENTER.                    7

 2) I COULD SEE A PC AND AN OFFICER IN A FLAT CAP STANI/fNG AT THE FRONT OF THE

 SEATED AREA LOOKING OVER THE PEN 3 & 4, AND THEY MUjgT HAVE REALISED THAT THERE

 WAS OVERCROWDING, BUT l'T WOULD APPEAR NOTHING WAS/DONE TO STOP IT.

 3) I FEEL THAT LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD A GREATER SHARE OF THE TICKET

 ALLOCATION AND THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE SPION KOP END DUE TO THE

 GREATER FOLLOWING.   (SIGNED)

 4) THE FIRST PUBLIC ADDRESS ANNOUNCEMENTS WAS ASKING FANS TO GO BACK INTO THE
                                                                             PAGE    9
                                                                             GSL2027

 PENS AND AFTER THIS NO ANNOUNCEMENTS WERE HADE FOR A LONG TIME AND NO ONE WAS

 KEPT INFORMED OF THE GRAVITY OF THE SITUATION. THE FOREST FANS STARTED TO JEER

 WHICH INCENSED A LOT OF LIVERPOOL   FANS WHO CHARGED TOWARDS THE SPION KOP END.

 ONCE THE FOREST FANS REALISED THE   SITUATION THEY WENT QUIET.   I WOULD SAY AN

 EARLY ANNOUNCEMENT WOULD HAVE STOPPED THAT SITUATION AND SAVED POLICE OFFICERS

 PUTTING A LINE ACROSS THE PITCH.

 5) FROM TALKING TO FANS WHO CAME INTO THE GROUND, THEY ALL SAID THEY WERE

 TERRIFIED BY THE TREMENDOUS CRUSH OUTSIDE AND THAT WHOEVER OPENED THE GATE

 SAVED LIVES OUTSIDE AND COULD NOT   BE BLAMED FOR OPENING THE GATE, AS AN

 AFTERTHOUGHT I THINK THERE SHOULD   HAVE BEEN CONTROL INSIDE AFTER THE GATES

        OPENED.   (SIGNED)

  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

  VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

  I     ONLY SAW 2 STRETCHERS DURING THE WHOLE INCIDENT. ALL THE REST WAS

  ADVERTISING BOARDS.      I THINK THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN HORE STRETCHERS.             ALSO

  I     THINK THE JOURNALISTS SHOULD HAVE HELPED INSTEAD OF TAKING PHOTOGRAPHS.

  I     ALSO THINK THAT THE 2 POLICE WHO PUSHED THE FANS WHO WERE PULLING THE FENCE

  DOWN WANTED THE CREDIT FOR THEMSELVES.

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I THINK ABOUT 4.30PM (1630) AFTER KENNY DALGLEISH HAD APPEALED TO FANS

 TO FOLLOW DIRECTIONS OF POLICE PRIOR TO OFFICIALLY BEING ABANDONED.

 G5i

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A

 LOUD SPEAKER ANNUNCEMENI OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OWN ACCORD.




 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 POLICE SEEMED MORE CONCERNED ABOUT CROWD/tQNTROL THAN HELPING INJURED FANS,

 MANY SEEMED TO BE STANDING ABOUT APPARENTLY DOING NOTHING.     FANS WERE RESCUING

 F^p   ON STRETCHERS FASTER THAN \oLJCE WHO SEEMED TO LACK, URGENCY,

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU g/EEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I AM CONCERNED THAT THE CENTRAL TUNNEL TO PEN^S 3 & 4 WAS NOT SEALED OFF

 BY POLICE/OFFICIALS AT SOME STAGE ••■■■ PREVENTING FURTHER ACCESS WHEN IT WAS

 APPARENT TO ME THAT PENS 3 AND 4 WERE FULL AS EARLY AS 14.15HRS (1415).

 THE TANNOY SYSTEM IN THE GROUND WAS INEFFECTIVE UNTIL SUCH TIME AS


G19

 DALGLEISH MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.   FANS WERE NOT KEPT INFORMED OF EVENTS,
                                                                           PAGE    9

 A PHOTOGRAPHER WHO WAS TAKING PICTURES OF THE DEAD ifiODIES.

                           C/VT~                  C O H K ^
 DYING, BUT THERE WERE FAR MORE POLICEMEN STANDING DOING NOTHING.   ESPECIALLY

 I WAS APPALLED BY THE NUMBER OF POLICE (APPROX 70) STANDING/ ACROSS THE HALF

 WAY LINE DOING NOTHING.   BASICALLY IT WAS AS THOUGH THE POLICE DIDN'T KNOW

 WHAT TO DO.

 LAST YEAR I CAME TO THE MATCH AND THE POLICE WERE FAR MORE ORG              THE

 POLICE WERE CHECKING PEOPLES TICKETS AND SEARCHING THEM FOR WEAPONS WELL

 AWAY FROM THE TURNSTILES.       BASICALLY THIS YEAR THE ORGANISATION WAS ALMOS1

 NON EXISTENT.     ALSO I THINK IT WOULD HAVE HELPED OR MAYBE EVEN PREVENTED

 THE TRAGEDY IF THE KICK OFF COULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED.

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

ONCE WE HAD GOT AROUND TO THE SIDE TERRACING <PEN 6), AT ABOUT 3.20 PM

<1520 HRS) , I WAS IN A POSITION WHERE I COULD LOOK ONTO THE CENTRE OF THE

TERRACES AND IT WAS APPARENT THAT PEOPLE WERE STILL BEING CRUSHED.        IT DIDN’T

SEEM THAT THE POLICE WERE MAKING ENOUGH EFFORT TO GET PEOPLE OUT ONTO THE

PITCH.     THIS WAS MADE EVEN MORE CLEAR WHEN A LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE WERE
                                                                          PAGE   8

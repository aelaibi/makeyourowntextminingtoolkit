Police Sergeant 2450




I am a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed at the

Force Training School, Ecclesfield.




On Saturday,         15 April   1989 > I was designated to perform duty at the Sheffield

Wednesday       Football    Club    ground       at   Hillsborough.        My    duties       were   to    assist

Inspector Scarfe with vehicle allocation and supervision.                              I commenced duty at

7-30 a.m.       on   that   date   and reported        to Inspector Scarfe            in the Football Club

Gymnasium.




I spent the first few hours on duty in booking in, accounting for and supervising

the parking of Police           vehicles both in and around the ground and at Claywheels

Lane.




I   took   my    refreshments       at    approximately      1.30   p.m.        and    afterwards     at    about

2.00p.m.        I walked on to Penistone Road to the junction with                      Vere Road.         I there

assisted        two PC's in attempting to stop the public using the road as access on to

Leppings     Lane.     Together    with    the    PC's   I advised    Liverpool         supporters        to walk

along Penistone         Road to the junction with Leppings                 Lane       and    then walk to the

North Stand and West Stand entrances.




I had earlier been instructed by Inspector Scarfe,                     to meet the Force coach on

Leppings        Lane and supervise the        serials boarding the coach.                   I made my way along

Vere Road at approximately 2.45              p.m. the same date and afterreceiving complaints


                                                                                ___

KEITH MALCOLM HICKIE                                                                                     QOR 3^6


from residents of Vere Road I attempted to move several Liverpool supporters from

gardens    and   yards      on    Vere      Road    who   were trying      to climb over         the    perimeter

fences.       The    supporters      complained       that      there    were    too     many    people    at    the

Leppings Lane turnstiles and they couldn't get in. Whilst I was engaged with this

I heard,     on my Police radio, a Senior Officer asking for the gates on Leppings

Lane to be opened.           I didn't hear who the officer was but I noted that there was

a sense of urgency in his voice.



A few minutes later, at approximately                     3*00 p.m. I walked             from Vere Road     to the

Leppings Lane turnstiles.                On arriving there I saw a lot of people queuing at the

turnstiles.         I also       saw several       Police   Officers      at that        location      and a Chief

Inspector talking to the crowd through a megaphone.                         I then heard another message

on the Police radio to the                 effect that the crowd had started to invade the pitch

 and that some people werebeing crushed                     in the West         Stand.        I heard the Chief

 Inspector    with    the    megaphone       telling      the   supporters       not     to    try   to enter     the

 ground. The supporters were taking no notice.                          I then walked into the enclosure

 where the turnstiles are and enlisted the help of several PC's and a Sergeant.                                        I

 instructed the officers to move the supporters out of the enclosure and to close

 the gates.      I did this in an effort to prevent even more supporters from entering

 the ground.



 A few minutes later, at about 3>10 p.m. I saw some people emerging from the exit

 gate of the West Stand.             Some men were helping people get out of the gate, these

 people appeared to be in pain and                  were holding their chests and stomachs.                     I went

 to these people and administered                   what first aid I could.I then saw a man                      come
                                                                                                             PAGE 3
KEITH MALCOLM HICKIE                                                                                       QOR 3^6


running out carrying a young boy, the boy was extremely pale.                                By this time there

were a lot of supporters outside the exit gates, most of these were shouting and

swearing at Police Officers and saying that there were quite a few people being

crushed to death.              I â€¢then went with several other officers into the enclosure at

the    rear    of    the     West        Stand.   I there     saw   several     hundred      supporters milling

around the area.              I also saw several people lying on the ground being attended to

by friends or relatives.                   Again I rendered what first aid I could until ambulance

and fire service personnel arrived.                       I then organised Police Officers in trying

to get able bodied supporters out of the enclosure to make way for the emergency

services.           I       then    assisted      the   ambulance      officers    to    place      people    on   to

stretchers and place them into the ambulances which had just started to arrive.

It was obvious from what I saw that several people, including some children, were

already       dead.          Supporters       were   still    carrying    people      out    of   the West     Stand

through       the    tunnel,        these     people were now being treated by ambulance and fire

officers.           I went out on to the access road, which eventually leads again into

Penistone       Road,        and     organised    Police     Officers    to provide         access ways      for   the

fleet of ambulances which had just started to arrive in force.                                    I was approached

by a man carrying a stethoscope who told me he was a doctor and who asked if he

could help.           I took him to the exit gate and handed him over to Inspector Sykes.

At    this time most               of the casualties behind the West Stand had been removed by

ambulance.



I     saw   quite       a   lot     of    casualties    around   the    first   aid     room,     I then     assisted

ambulance personnel with the loading on to stretchers and ambulances of several

 injured persons. The ambulances were parked behind the ground gymnasium and were
                                                                                                      PAGE 4
KEITH MALCOLM HICKIE                                                                               QOR 346


loaded up and despatched from that point.                       When there were no more casualties I

went    to Penistone Road near to gate 0 and directed emergency vehicles into and

out of the stadium as required.




Shortly afterwards, I presume it will have been just after 5*00 p.m. I was in the

area of       the    Police room when I saw             several Police Officers        behind one of the

prison    buses.        These officers were openly crying and were very distressed.                            I

managed to obtain keys for a personnel carrier, I took these officers to the van,

placed them in it and drove them to Claywheels Lane where I left them to obtain

some    refreshments.        I returned to the ground where I again assisted Inspector

Scarfe in the traffic direction needed in the ground and in Penistone Road.




At   approximately 7.30 p.m.             the same date,         I was instructed to go to Claywheels

Lane     in order to account for the Police vehicles                       in use   there    and to organise

transport for serials who were to be stood down.




At     9.10   p.m.     I returned    to    the    ground    with PC    Dicks with     emergency lighting

equipment      which we set up with Inspector Scarfe.                      I was    then engaged with the

setting up and running of material comforts to be provided for the relatives and

friends of the deceased persons who had just arrived.                           I also was in charge of

several       police    officers    on    the    main    gate   who   were keeping     the    Press   out and

admitting authorised personnel only.




At 10.30 p.m. the same date I retired from duty.



                                                                       /

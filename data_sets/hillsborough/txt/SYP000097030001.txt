        THE P R ESE N T P O S I T I O N AT


         S H E F F I E L D WEDNESDAY FC


I N R E L A T IO N TO T H E RECOMMENDATIONS OF


           LORD J U S T I C E TAYLOR
RECOMEM3ATION 1


It is noted by the police that the current Safety Certificate for

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club has been amended to reflect the new

capacities of all standing areas as follows:-

Spion Kop                                           16,800

North West Terrace- Upper Level                      2,300

North West Terrace              -         Lower Level 680

(It is further noted that the Safety Certificate prohibits spectators

from standing on the West Stand, Leppings Lane, terraces.)



RECOMMENDATION 2


The     calculation       for       maximum        capacities,    proposed     by    this

recoirmendation, has been followed in determining the figure for each

terraced area recorded above.



RECt^MSNDATION 3


(a) An electronic counting system is in place at Sheffield Wednesday's

       ground   whereby   the       number    of    spectators    entering    each   self-

       contained area is contemporaneously recorded.



       The club has undertaken (see written agreement) to monitor this

       counter and to limit the number of spectators entering any self-

       contained   area    to       the    maximum     capacity   figure     assessed   in

       accordance with Recommendation 2 above.



 (b)       c]_ub w i n achieve this by closing off the relevant turnstiles

       to prevent further access to such an area when its maximum capacity

       is about to be reached.            The police have agreed to assist the club

       in this regard, if requested so to do.
RECOMMENDATION 4

A written agreement, setting out their respective responsibilities for crowd
safety and control, has been approved and signed by representatives of South
Yorkshire Police and Sheffield Wednesday PC.

A copy of that agreement is attached at document (6).


RECOM M ENDATION 5




At each match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground there are stewards

situated on the perimeter track at the Spion Kop end of the ground

whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible

overcrowding or distress.             The stewards regularly perform the same

duties, as do the police officers authorised under Recommendation 9

below.    The parties        aretherefore familiar         to each other, and the

stewards have ready access to these police officers who each have a

radio giving them contact with the police control room.



RBCCf-M EM DATION 6




Ml   police       officers and        stewards      (not just those authorised under

Recommendations       5    and   9)    are fully    briefed   with   regard   to   the

recognition      of crowd densities and to the recognition of signs of

distress. All officers           and stewards have been issued, as an aide

memoire, with a laminated card which identifies the signs of distress.



Stewards are each         issued with a copy of written instructions, by           the

club, which detail        their duties.The senior stewards are         briefed by a

police   inspector,        before     each match,    on   the responsibilities      of

stewards for crowd safety and control and their duties in case of

emergency evacuation.         The senior stewards are expected to brief the

more junior stewards.



Police officers are briefed by a Senior police officer before each
 match on their complementary responsibilities and duties. The ccnroander

 of each sector of the ground is responsible for further briefing his or

 her officers on their specific duties within that sector.



 The     South      Yorkshire   Police   are   presently preparing   visual   aids,

 designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different crowd

 densities, to recognise signs of distress, and to understand a little

 more about crowd dynamics.              The aids will consist of a) Albums of

 photographs depicting the various sections of Sheffield Wednesday's

 ground with different numbers of spectators therein, and b) A video

 tape film which highlights crowd              densities, distressand dynamics.

 When completed these photographs and film will be shown to the Safety

 of Sports Ground Advisory Group.



The Certifying Authority are asked to ensure that the club undertakes

and continues to undertake its own reponsibilities for staff training

as set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide’

- paras, 26, 177, 195 and Annex B to the Guide.



R B C O M E M 3A T IO N 7




All gateways' in radial or perimeter fences at Sheffield Wednesday FC

are painted white           which is a different colour from the rest of the

fence.      Each is clearly identified by a sign which proclaims 'Emergency
Exit'.
                                               (

RECOMMENDATION 8



All the gates in the perimeter fence at Sheffield Wednesday's ground
 remain open while ever spectators are on the terrace.



 R B C C M ^N D A T IO N 9




 There is, in respect of each gateway in the perimeter fences, at least one

 officer whose sole duty, whenever spectators are on the terraces, is to

decide wheLher or not to allow spectators through that gateway to relieve

overcrowding.           Such police officers are to be identified by means of a lime

green tabard.           The officer is familiar to all stewards in that area (see

Reccsrmendation 5 above), is known by them to be authorised to relieve

overcrowding, and is able to make radio contact with the police control
room.



RECOM M ENDATION 1 0




Two sets of metal cutting equipment have been provided by Sheffield

Wednesday FC and are stored in boxes, adjacent to the fence, at either end

of the ground.           It has been agreed that, in case of need, employees of the

club trained in its use will be readily available to operate the equipment.



     stewards have been trained'^in its use and will respond to instruction

from police control (many of the stewards are in radio contact via the

club's radio system).



RECCM M ENDATIOM S 1 1 a n d   12




It is understood that City Council representatives on the Safety of Sports

Ground Advisory Group have carried out an inspection of all crush barriers.
                     RECCfeMSNDATIONS 13 - 17



                     Safety Certification is obviously a matter for Sheffield City

           j         Council.      In respect of Recommendation 17, the South Yorkshire

           o         Police await notification of the constitution of the Advisory
            A
 JjaP                Qroup.      It is the Police view, however, that this group should

               , / ^ P P ^ e n t , and not replace, the existing Officer Working Group.

                     RECOMMENDATIONS 18 AND 19



                     It is understood that each turnstile has been inspected and its

                     potential rate of flow measured and that the maximum capacities

                     of   each    viewing    area   can   be   admitted      via   the   respective

                     turnstiles in less than one hour.

       W             RBCCMMENDATICN 21



                 Sheffield Wednesday PC currently have five CC TV cameras
 installed around the ground.     A survey of the installation was

 carried out     by a trained police CC TV operator      (no expert

 knowledge     is professed) and his report is attached at document

 (3).



For your further information the General Purposes Committee of

the Association of Oner Polios Cffocers has convened a working group

to consider, nationally, the use of CC TV to promote public

safety at football grounds.     The group anticipate that it may be

possible to provide a 'package' of equipment for use as a test

for a corrmon minimum standard of performance.     They will report

back in due course.



RKX^f-IENDAT'ION 22



Signposting for spectators both inside and outside the ground has

been reviewed by the City Council        Safety of Sports Grounds

Advisory Group.       The police are generally satisfied with the

signposting.     Signposting at the West, Leppings Lane, end of the

ground will require revision in the light of any new turnstiling

arrangements which are proposed by Sheffield Wednesday PC, at

this end of the ground.



RECOfdENDATIONS 23 AND 24



The South Yorkshire Police have had liaison with the club on the

question of ticketed matches.    The police are satisfied with the

arrangements and will ensure that the information on any ticket

corresponds with their plans for admitting spectators to the
ground.
            RECOMMENDATION 25



            There is no regular pre match entertainment at football matches

            at Sheffield Wednesday.      Police have no knowledge of whether the

            club has held discussions with the recognised supporters club on
            this matter.



             RECOMMENDATION 26



           The South Yorkshire Police Chief Constable nominated his Deputy,

                 Peter Hayes, QPM, ELB, MA, to liaise with the management of
    "^      '\\r* ry
          ^ ^ac^ football club and local authority concerned in respect of

*         ‘& &   safety and control of crowds.         Mr Hayes has met with

! 'py      Directors or      Secretaries of all five football league clubs in

           the county, including Mr Mackrell of Sheffield Wednesday PC, on

           24 August 1989.      He met with representatives of the four relevant

           local authorities, including Messrs Ward and Bownes of Sheffield

           City Council on 18 September 1989.     A copy of the minutes of that

           meeting are attached at document (7).



           RFaXMMENDATION '27



           Both the Operational Order and the pre match briefing of all

           officers on duty at each match at ■Sheffield Wednesday FC alert

           officers to the dangers of overcrowding, and if any should be

           defected, of taking immediate and appropriate steps to remedy it.

 Recommendation 6 above) will further emphasise these messages.



 RECCfrS»iENDATION 2 8




The operational planning for each match at Sheffield Wednesday PC

 is intended to enable the police to cope with forseeable patterns

in the arrival at, and departure from, any match by spectators.



The following scenarios are each catered for by way of police

contingency plans at Sheffield Wednesday PC:-



a) All ticket, or otherwise restricted, matches.

b) Early arrival of spectators.

c) Unexpected and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators.

d) Individual section of ground approaching capacity.

e) Whole ground approaching capacity.

f) Late arrival of spectators.

g) Emergency opening of external gates (or forcing of external

   gates), thereby allowing an influx of spectators.

h) Early departure of spectators from ground.

i) Emergency evacuation.



The police retain a reserve of officers at the ground to enable

rapid deployment to any difficulty which may arise inside or

outside the ground.
The certifying authority may, however, wish to satisfy themselves

that    the   club have made          contingency plans    to deal    with a

situation where the available entrances might prove insufficient

to stop unduly large crowds gathering outside the ground.                Such

contingency plans are required by paragraph 46 of the Guide to

Safety at Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide'.



{RECOMMENDATION 29



The police officer in command at Sheffield Wednesday FC is aware

of the option to delay kick-off,               and discusses this matter,

before each game, with the match officials.                   The option was

utilised      on    the   30    August     1989,   when thepolice    chief

superintendent      asked      for   the   kick-off, at the    match between

Sheffield Wednesday and Evertor> to be delayed for 15 minutes to

ensure the safety of the crowd still trying to get into the

ground at 7.15 pm.          The crowd was notified of the delay by the

public address system.



To enable instant contact with the match referee when considering

kick-off delay',      the police       request that the club install a

telephone link between the police control room and the player's

tunnel. (See also Recommendation 32 below).



RECOMMENDATION 30



There   is available        in the police control room at Sheffield

Wednesday     PC,   the   results     of   the closed circuit television
   monitoring conducted by the police both outside and inside the

   ground.            There     are,   however,   fifteen   other   CC    TV   cameras

   belonging to the club which monitor turnstiles and areas behind

   turnstiles throughout the ground.               These are currently monitored

   in the club control room and the results of this filming are not

   available in the police control room. The certifying authority are

  asked to ensure that this recoirmendation is complied with.

   There is a computer terminal in the police control room which

   displays the record of the electronic counting of spectators into

   the ground.



   Police officers who perform duty in the control room are skilled

   in the use and interpretation of the results of CC TV filming.

   Each of these officers is to attend a CC TV operator's course

   which is run by the Greater Manchester Police.




R liC C f-yiE M D M T O N 3 1




There are sufficient operators employed in the police control room

to deal with radio communications.                   New police communications

equipment has recently been installed at Sheffield Wednesday's

ground.          The equipment consists of a two-bay radio set with a

spare station in case of radio failure on the primary station. It

also has battery back-up in case of power failure.                       This system

also gives operators in the control room priority over, and the

capacity to override, others using the same channel.




The police ground ccranander has the option of utilising, when he

feels it necessary, an additional radio channel which provides
exclusive     communication     between        himself   and   other      sector

commanders.     This executive channel would be utilised in an

emergency when the primary channel may become overcrowded.



The police control room at Sheffield Wednesday FC                  is inadequate

in terms of size and facilities.         The club have been made aware of

the police dissatisfaction with the present accoirmodation.                  The

certifying    authority   are    asked        to   oversee   the    design   and

construction of a new control room at the ground.



Rma-MSNDATION 32



A survey of Sheffield Wednesday's ground has identified twenty key

points where the police would wish to see dedicated telephone

points to enable direct ccrrmunication with the police control

room.



Attached, at document (4), is a plan showing the location of those

points, together with an equipment specification prepared by the

South Yorkshire Police Communications Department.              The Certifying

Authority are asked to oversee its installation.



RBCCMMENDATICW 33



There is in existence at Sheffield Wednesday PC              a public address
                                          t


system.      The police survey of the system has identified the

requirements for at least five further loud speakers as follows:-
a) A speaker outside turnstiles 77 to 88.

b) A speaker at the rear of the North Stand near to the police

      rocm.

c) A speaker adjacent to Gate B.

d) A speaker adjacent to Gate C.

e) A speaker on the North West elevatedsection to service the

      Leppings Lane terraces.



The plans at (5) show the existing system and the proposed siting

The Certifying Authority are asked to oversee the installation of

an adequate public address system to ensure that it complies with

effective.    In so doing, the Certifying Authority will wish to pay

regard, also, to paragraph 194 (iii) of the Guide to Safety at

Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide' - which lists the requirements

of an effective public address system.



The police have asked the club to ensure that the use of a loud

signal to precede important messages be advertised in the club's

programmes.




RECOMMENDATION 34



The illuminated advertising board at Sheffield Wednesday's ground

is presently out of coimnission and there are no plans to repair

it.
A    series   of hand     signals   for use by police officers        in an

emergency is presently being formulated, nationally, by a working

group of the Association of Chief Police Officers.              The results

are awaited.



RECOMMENDATION 35



The South Yorkshire Police maintain regular liaison with the South

Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service and the South Yorkshire

Fire Service concerning crowd safety at Sheffield Wednesday's

stadium.

At   a   force   level,    the    Chief   Superintendent   (Operations)   has

regular meetings with senior officers from the other services.            At

a local level the police match commander meets with the ambulance

liaison officer at most if not every match.          The fire service have

also had a liaison officer at at least one natch this season where

he met with the police match commander.



RECOMMENDATION 36



In advance of each match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground,- the

South Yorkshire 'Police forward to the South Yorkshire Fire and

Ambulance Services full details about the forthcoming event.



RECCM^ENDATION 37


                                            t
Contingency plans for the arrival of emergency police, fire and

ambulance     vehicles    at     Sheffield Wednesday's ground have been

reviewed and prepared.           The contingency plan forms part of the
police operational order.



The Certifying Authority will wish to consider whether the club

have taken adequate account of paragraph 29(v) of the Guide to

Safety at Sports Grounds        -   'The Green Guide'      - which tasks

management    with    the   responsibility    for   preparing     emergency

contingency   plans    in   consultation     with   the   three   emergency

services.



RECOMMENDATION 38



The police operational order for any event held at                Sheffield

Wednesday's ground contairs information, for officers deployed to

entrances to the ground, as to the contingency plans for the

arrival of the emergency services.



RECOMMENDATION 39 - 43



These recommendations concern First Aid and Medical facilities

and, as such, are outside any police remit.          Under Recommendation

41, however, the'police control at Sheffield Wednesday's ground is

told the identity and whereabouts of the 'club' doctor before each

match.   He is readily contactable.

                  A C C (Operations)                                            1 February 1990



                SUBJECT:      IMPLEMENTATION TEAM




                As you know immediately following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's
                Interim Report, the Chief Constable appointed me to be the chief officer
                required in the recommendations to liaise with the clubs and the local
                authorities.  Also to have the responsibility of ensuring that those
                recommendations which were required to be in place before the start of the
                1989/90 football season were implemented in time and the other
                recommendations requiring action by ourselves progressed to completion.

                 I organised an implementation team comprising the ground commanders from all
                 five football grounds in the County assisted by Chief Superintendent
                 Broomhead and attaching specialists and others to the group as necessary.

                The urgent (asterisked) recommendations were all in place by the required
                date.  I reported on this in detail to the Police Authority and on the same
                day fronted a major national press conference on the same subject.

                I have met with directors and/or secretaries from all the football clubs and
                agreed with them a bi-annual meeting from this point in time.  Furthermore,
                we have clear written agreements with all of the clubs setting out in detail
                the respective responsibilities of the police and the club in relation to
                the monitoring of standing areas, perimeter gates, etc., as required in the
                Interim Report.  The Final Report makes specific reference to the format of
                the written agreements and also provides opportunity for amendment at our
                discretion in relation to the manning of perimeter gates.

                 I have had a formal meeting with the representatives of all four licensing
                 authorities and the minutes are retained on file.

                The implementation team has made considerable progress in terms of Lord
                Justice Taylor's recommendations and the details are included in the minutes
                which are a matter of record.  The original agreements with the football
                clubs and any alterations are filed amongst the working papers and these
                must be carefully safeguarded as they may become of extreme legal importance
                in the event of a dispute between ourselves and the clubs.

                 There are a number of residual matters to be pursued and attached hereto is
                 a 'Note for File' which is self-explanatory on this subject.  The Final
                 Report of Lord Justice Taylor has amended in part some of the earlier
                 recommendations and added to the recommendation list and these now need to
                 be carefully considered and progressed as appropriate.

                 I would like you please to replace me as the appointed chief officer
                 responsible for liaison with the clubs and the local authorities and to work
                 through the outstanding issues together with the implementation team.

                 The working papers are filed and indexed and you will need to collect these
                 - via Mrs Leah - from my office.


    Gen/2

    I would appreciate It please If you would write to the clubs and the local
    authorities telling them of the change of appointing officer and arrange
    through Chief Superintendent Denton for the Police Authority to be notified
    accordingly.  We are required for the time being to present information to the
    Police Authority at each main meeting concerning the progress of matters
    relative to the Hillsborough tragedy and the change of office can be notified
    in this way.  I would like you to prepare the standing item for the Police
    Authority on Hillsborough - Chief Superintendents Broomhead and Denton will
    assist you with this - and in terms of the on-going civil litigation I will
    provide any information required.

    Attached for information are copies of the last two Hillsborough reports to
    the Police Authority together with a draft report for the next meeting
    prepared by Chief Superintendent Broomhead which needs amendment so as to be a
    complete report in its own right without referring specifically on a
    resolution basis back to 17 November 1989 meeting as is the case now in the
    draft.  The final paper must be prepared in time for it to be seen by
    yourself, myself and the Chief Constable (ie, receive total management
    approval) by 5 February 1990.  It needs to make significant reference to Lord
    Justice Taylor's Final Report and I suggest you arrange for Chief
    Superintendent Broomhead to amend his draft to take account of this.

    I would like you to act as the appointed chief officer from today,
    1 February 1990.  The extent you require any further assistance, information
    or advice from myself simply ask.

NOTE FOR FILE:



IMPLEMENTATION TEAM - RESIDUAL MATTERS



Following a meeting with A/ACC(Operations) re. the above, set out below
under separate headings, are the residual matters for action as necessary



1.   THE CLUBS

a.   Alterations to Written Agreements

There have been a number of these to date and clearly there will be more.

We need to ensure that the master copies (originals) of the written agreements
(filed in the DCC's office) together with an additional copy filed in Registry
are kept current at all times.

Additionally, A/ACC(Operations) will   prepare a chronological list of the
changes which have occurred to date,   a copy of which will be passed to
Mrs Leah to be placed with the DCC's   working papers.

To ensure this occurs over the years to come this will - once the
Implementation Team is stood down - become the responsibility of Chief
Superintendent (Operations & Traffic) and he will maintain the original papers
and the list referred to above.  Whilst the Implementation Team continues the
necessary action will be taken by A/ACC(Operations).         /



b.   Sheffield Wednesday FC - North West Terrace

Evidence has been obtained (via police video footage) which indicates that
when the agreed capacity (local authority figure) was reached at a match
played recently at Hillsborough the above area was clearly overcrowded.

Enquiries reveal that the calculations regarding capacity based on plans
supplied to the local authority by the engineers - Eastwoods & Partners - were
of the wrong scale.

Urgent action is needed to determine if similar mistakes have been made in
relation to other standing areas of the ground and for the capacity of the
North West terrace to be reduced as part of the Ground Safety Certificate
agreement without delay.

A/ACC(Operations) is to attend a meeting this date (27.11.89) with Sheffield
City Council after which he will prepare a 'Note for File' describing
the full extent of the problem and what measures are intended - copy to be
passed to Mrs Leah for filing with the DCC's working papers.



c.   Written Agreements - Plans of Numbers in Standing Areas

If these have not been obtained from all the Clubs by the end of November we
will write and ask for same.  A/ACC(Operations) to action.
d.   Claw Back

Experience has shown that strict application of the Hillsborough
recommendations has created an unnecessarily high police presence at some
grounds and as a result A/ACC(Operations) is reviewing all the grounds with a
view to making reductions as necessary so that the police input is adequate,
sensible and justifiable.

So that these changes can be plotted historically A/ACC(Operations) will
prepare a list in the form of an index of what he has achieved so far
attaching the relevant reports between Division and himself as appendices and
provide a copy of this to Mrs Leah for inclusion in the DCC's working papers.



e.   Stewards - Briefing and Debriefing

This is done differently across the Force but it has been agreed by the
Implementation Team that there is not anywhere we do not achieve a reasonable
minimum standard.  However as this may be referred to in Lord Justice Taylor's
Final Report no changes will be made until that time when the matter will be
re-considered.  Supt Bettison to raise as agenda item at meeting following
publication of Lord Justice T a y l o r ’s Final Report.           Z



f.   Meetings with Directors/Secretaries

For the time being these will be maintained at the rate of two meetings
annually.

A/ACC(Operations) is to consider when the next meeting is to be held and make
arrangements accordingly - DCC will attend on this occasion.



g.   Barnsley - Counting of Spectator Admission to Standing Areas

We have made direct reference to this in a recent letter to Barnsley MBC and
the Club.  The lack of counting and the attitude of officials at Barnsley
is a significant problem.  We must keep pressure on those concerned to
improve arrangements as necessary.

Following our official report to Barnsley re. the above, considerable press
interest was shown.  A/ACC(Operations) to obtain a copy of the press cuttings
and pass these to Mrs Leah for inclusion in the DCC's working papers.



2.   THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES

a.   Reports re. Outstanding Matters

The purpose of submitting reports to the local authorities concerning what
we perceive to be outstanding matters apropos Lord Justice Taylor's
recommendations is so that the relevant committees can hold urgent and
extraordinary meetings to address the problems identified.

The DCC would like to know precisely what the reaction has been and
A/ACC(Operations) is to call for reports on this specific issue.
b.   Sheffield Intransigence

Sheffield City Council are requiring information to a greater extent than the
other local authorities.  A/ACC(Operations) is dealing with this and recently
attended a meeting at the Town Hall to discuss these issues.  He is to prepare
a position statement in the form of a 'Note for File' a copy of which is to be
passed to Mrs Leah for inclusion in the DCC's working papers.

Sergeant Milner (Assistant Staff Officer) is preparing a separate report
regarding this.



3.   GENERAL

a.   Major Incident Plan

Following a review the Plan needs to be carefully considered with regard to
any changes needed.  A/ACC(Operations) to arrange please.



b.   Charges

Following our last submission to the Police Authority on police action post
Hillsborough, it was resolved that the Chief Constable together with the local
authority will review the charging arrangements.

It is appropriate that the Secretariat do this with our assistance.  This
subject has been discussed at recent meetings of the ACPO Sub-Committee on
Hooliganism at Sporting Events and A/ACC(Operations) will prepare relevant
abstracts of the minutes of those meetings to be used as a discussion paper as
appropriate.

The Chairman of that Committee (Mr Anderton - Greater Manchester Police) has
recently spoken to Lord Justice Taylor on this very topic and
A/ACC(Operations) will make efforts to determine the outcome of that
discussion.

As part of ACPO's review of police charges, A/ACC(Operations) has collated the
position regionally and a copy of these findings will be passed to Mrs Leah
for inclusion in the DCC's working papers.

For the time being Supt Hale and Chief Insp Donnelly will continue to consider
a new mechanism for charging based on a standing charge and sliding scale as
has previously been discussed.  A/ACC(Operations) to progress please.


c.   Model Order

Before finalising, the DCC would like to meet with A/ACC(Operations) and Supt
Simpson to talk through in some detail a specimen order for an actual match.
A/ACC(Operations) to arrange please.



d.   Training

The procedures we are developing to assist with the training of police
officers and stewards needs to be reviewed and completed without further
delay.  The Training Department will prepare a position paper regarding
                                       - 4 -


progress to date and outstanding matters for further consideration.
A/ACC(Operations) to action please.



e.   Contracts

There is a problem emerging with the potential fusion of the contract
concerning charging arrangements and our written agreement.  This concerns
insurance cover and is being pursued by Miss Oades.



f.   Standing Instructions

These are being reviewed and up-dated by Superintendent Greenwood on an on­
going basis and he must be prepared to circulate his final draft for
consideration by the Implementation Team as soon as this can be achieved.
Supt Bettison to raise as agenda item at future Implementation Team meeting.



g.   Match Intelligence/Information

The procedures across the Force vary but in the main seem reasonably adequate.
Superintendent Brookfield has completed an historical analysis - a statement
of the position to date in South Yorkshire - and makes recommendations to
create further changes in order to ensure we take full advantage of the
national arrangements recently implemented.  This needs to be progressed and
finalised reasonably quickly.  (Presentation by Supt Brookfield to DCC,
A/ACC(Operations) and Ground Commanders arranged for 30.11.89).

17 NOVEMBER 1989




REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE


ACTIONS OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE FOLLOWING THE
PUBLICATION OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S INTERIM REPORT


1.    Introduction

1.1   In the wake of the disaster which occurred at Hillsborough Stadium,
      Sheffield, on 15 April 1989, a Public Inquiry was commissioned to enquire
      into the events and to make recommendations about the needs of crowd
      control and safety at sports events.     The Inquiry was chaired by Lord
      Justice Taylor and it sat from 15 May until 14 July 1989.

1.2   Lord Justice Taylor published his Interim Report on 4 August 1989, in
      which he made 43 interim recommendations.  He emphasised that these were
      designed to prevent overcrowding and crushing on terraced areas in the
      short term, and that long term recommendations fell to be considered in
      his Final Report. A copy of the recommendations is appended.


2.    Implementation of Recommendations

2.1   The recommendations contained in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report
      included many which were already identified as necessary in the light of
      the events at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.   The South Yorkshire Police
      were therefore well prepared to ensure that they were swiftly implemented
      at the five football league grounds in the County.

2.2   The Chief Constable nominated Mr P Hayes QPM LLB MA, Deputy Chief
      Constable, to liaise personally with the management of each football club
      and with each local authority concerned in respect of future crowd
      safety.   Mr Hayes met with directors and secretaries of all five South
      Yorkshire   football   league   clubs on 24 August      1989   and   with
      representatives of the four local authorities on 18 September 1989.

2.3   To progress the recommendations of the Taylor Report^the Deputy Chief
      Constable appointed an 'Implementation Team' which included the local
      ground commanders who have a responsibility for policing each of the five
      football league clubs in the County,      and officers with specialist
      knowledge in such areas as communications, CCTV and training.    The team
      has met under the Deputy Chief Constable's chairmanship on seven
      occasions since 4 August 1989 and each of the recommendations which
      places a responsibility with the police has been implemented at all
      football league grounds.   Those recommendations which were asterisked by
      Lord Justice Taylor,     signifying their immediate need,      were each
      implemented by 18 August - just two weeks after the publication of the
      Taylor Report and before the start of the current league programme.
      Furthermore,  it is pleasing to be able to report that, with the positive
      co-operation   of   the football clubs,     signed   written   agreements
                                          - 2 -

          between   the clubs and the police,       setting out    their   respective
#         responsibilities for crowd safety, have been drawn up.

    2.4   The   South   Yorkshire  Police have also addressed      the remaining
          recommendations for which they are not directly responsible. A report
          concerning these matters has been forwarded to each of the local
          authorities who have a responsibility for safety certification at
          football grounds.

    2.5   A copy of each written agreement together with a summary of the action
          taken on all relevant recommendations in relation to that football ground
          is appended.


    3.    The Responsibilities of the Local Authorities for Safety at
          Sports Grounds

    3.1   Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports stadium
          designated under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975 (as amended) is
          responsible for the issue of a Safety Certificate in respect of that
          stadium.   Each of the local authorities of Rotherham, Barnsley and
          Doncaster have a responsibility for one football league ground, Sheffield
          has a responsibility for two.

    3.2   The certifying authorities are called upon by the Taylor Report to
          immediately review each Safety Certificate,    ensure that the operative
          conditions of the Certificate are complied with,  then add or substitute
          any condition shown to be necessary by the findings and recommendations
          of the Taylor Report.

    3.3   The centrally directed police 'Implementation Team' has achieved as much
          as it can by independent action.        The local authorities in South
          Yorkshire, which each have a responsibility under the Safety of Sports
          Grounds A c t , have been provided with a comprehensive report of what the
          police have so far achieved.      Where it has not been possible for the
          South   Yorkshire    Police   to fully    implement   any   recommendation
          unilaterally,    proposals are offered to the responsible certifying
          authority of how the recommendation might be progressed.


    4.    Increased Costs for Policing Football Matches

    4.1   Several of the recommendations in the Interim Report of Lord Justice
          Taylor impose additional duties upon the police at football matches.  For
           example,  (i) the deployment of police officers, tOjeach gate in a
           perimeter fence, authorised to decide whether or not to allow spectators
           through a gate to relieve overcrowding;      (ii) the deployment of a
           reserve of police officers to each match who are not committed to any
           specific duty and are therefore able to deal with any unforeseen
          difficulties which arise inside or outside the ground;    and, (iii) the
           deployment of a sufficient number of skilled operators in the police
           control room to enable all radio transmissions to be received, evaluated
           and answered and to enable all the results of CCTV recording outside and
           inside the ground to be monitored and interpreted.

    4.2   It is obvious from the implementation of these three recommendations
           alone that the cost of policing football matches will be greater than
           ever before.
                                     - 3 -

4.3   Members will be aware that a proportion of policing costs is met by the
      football clubs themselves.     At present the financial contribution is
      determined by reference to a sliding scale of charges agreed annually
      between the Police Authority,  the Chief Constable and each of the clubs,
      based upon a prior estimate of crowd size for a particular game.   In the
      two seasons 1987/88 and 1988/89 the total cost of policing the five
      football clubs in South Yorkshire,  both inside and outside the grounds,
      amounted to some £1.83 million and, of this figure, the clubs contributed
      £398,000 which amounts to 22% of the overall cost.

4.4   In the light of Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations many Police
      Authorities are now reassessing the charges levied on football clubs for
      special police services.

4.5   The facility to charge for police officers in these circumstances is
      provided by Section 15 of the Police Act 1964, which enables the Chief
      Constable, at his discretion,   to provide, on request,  special police
      services at any premises or in any locality in the police area.     The
      section further empowers the Police Authority to charge for these
      services.

4.6   There is no precise definition of the term 'special police services' but
      the case of Harris -v- Sheffield United Football Club 1986 held that the
      Chief Constable is not, as part of his normal policing responsibility,
      obliged to provide officers to react to potential breaches of the peace
      where the owner of private property creates such a risk on his property.

4.7   It would seem,  therefore, that officers provided to meet such a risk, as
      in the case of a football match, are within the meaning of special police
      services and can be charged for.     Indeed, Police Authorities have a
      fiduciary duty to the ratepayers of their area to make such charges.

4.8   The Harris case, however, does not fully resolve which officers can be
      regarded as performing special police services.    It held that the fact
      that officers were deployed on private property was significant in
      tending to show their provision amounted to special police services, but
      did not deal with the question of officers deployed to perform duties
      outside the ground - duties that arise directly from the event which is
      occurring inside the ground.   Legal opinion has, therefore, been sought
      for clarification as to which duties performed by police officers at
      football matches can properly be regarded as 'special police services'.

4.9   Notwithstanding the question of payment for police deployment outside
      football grounds it is submitted that the level of contribution from the
      clubs presently falls significantly short of the actua^. cost of officers
      inside the ground, and that the shortfall is set to widen in the light of
      the Taylor recommendations which necessitate an increase in the number of
      police officers deployed at football matches.


5.    Criminal Investigation of South Yorkshire Police Officers

5.1   During   the    course of the Hillsborough Inquiry     the question  of
      manslaughter   by the criminal negligence of SouthYorkshire Police
      officers was    raised by counsel for the bereaved, Mr Benet Hytner QC.

5.2   Because this matter was not dealt with in the Report of the Hillsborough
      Inquiry the Chief Constable,  on the morning of the Report's publication,
      referred it     to the Director of Public Prosecutions, asking for his
                                           - 4 -

            decision on the question of criminal liability of any member of the South
            Yorkshire Police.    It was considered appropriate,   at that time,    to
            suspend from duty the police commander of the Hillsborough event, Chief
            Superintendent David Duckenfield,  pending the outcome of the Director's
            deliberations.   Mr Duckenfield remains suspended.

    5.3     On 15 August 1989, the Director wrote to the Chief Constable setting out
            his view that the matter should be subject of a full            criminal
            investigation.   The West Midlands Police had already done considerable
            work in gathering evidence for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.  It seemed
            sensible, therefore,   to invite Mr Geoffrey Dear QPM DL LLB, Chief
            Constable of the West Midlands Police Force,         to undertake   this
            investigation.   His report,    in due course, will be submitted to the
            Director of Public Prosecutions.


    6   .   Matters of Complaint and Discipline

    6.1     Additionally, the Chief Constable has asked that if, during the course of
            their investigation,   the West Midlands Police officers discover any
            matters which might suggest that offences were committed against the
            Police (Discipline) Regulations, of a non-criminal nature, those offences
            should be brought to his attention and, where appropriate, be enquired
            into by the West Midlands Police on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police.
            This is agreed.

    6.2     There are currently seven matters of public complaint about the actions
            of South Yorkshire Police officers,     arising from the Hillsborough
            incident.

    6.3     Three of these matters have been raised by a single complainant.      Two
            relate to the actions of the senior officers in command of the policing
            operation at Hillsborough on the day and these are being supervised by
            Captain E Noel Taylor of the Police Complaints          Authority.    The
            investigation of these complaints is being conducted by Mr Geoffrey Dear,
            Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police, along with the criminal
            matters. The third complaint is of incivility and is being investigated,
            unsupervised by the Police Complaints Authority, by Superintendent Ashton
            of the South Yorkshire Police.

0   6.4     A fourth complaint is that an officer at the perimeter fence contributed
            to the death of the complainant's son by his failure to open the fence
            gate in good time.

    6.5     A fifth complaint is that the failure by South Yorkshire Police officers
            to open perimeter fence gates caused the complainant to sustain injury.

    6.6     A sixth complaint is made by a man who alleges that he was assaulted by a
            police officer whilst attending the football match.

    6.7     These latter three cases are again to be investigated by Mr Dear's team
            and are likewise being supervised by Captain E Noel Taylor of the Police
            Complaints Authority.

    6. 8    There is a seventh complaint of corruption, namely of police officers
            offering to allow fans into the ground on payment.   This complaint is
            being investigated by Superintendent Carlisle of the Greater Manchester
            Police.
Coroner's Inquest Regarding the 95 Deaths Which Arose

The   gathering of evidence on behalf of HM Coroner,          Dr   Stefan
Popper LLB BMedSci BM BS MRCGP,     in relation to the 95 deaths that
occurred at Hillsborough, is continuing by the West Midlands Police.

The Coroner opened the inquests on 19/20 April 1989, and adjourned them
to a date to be fixed.      He had set aside three months to hear the
inquests beginning in January 1990.    I understand, however,  that the
Director of Public Prosecutions has recently written to Dr Popper
requesting that the inquests be deferred until after the results of the
on-going criminal investigation are concluded.


Civil Actions

To date eight writs have been served upon the South          Yorkshire Police
alleging negligence by its officers on 15 April 1989,        leading to loss,
injury, damage and, in two cases, death.

The writs are to be defended by the Police Authority's insurers,
Municipal Mutual Insurance Company.  It is understood that three of these
actions will be representative actions.

The presiding Northern Circuit Judge, Mr Justice Rose, has taken personal
charge of the interlocutory proceedings.      At a Directions Hearing on
26 October 1989 at the High Court in Manchester Mr Justice Rose set the
date for commencement of the civil actions for 11 June 1990.     At that
hearing Mr Justice Rose expressed his satisfaction regarding the work
done by all parties to the claims to achieve a state of readiness for
trial.


The Effects of the Hillsborough Disaster on the Health
and Welfare of the Force

Twenty-three officers reported injuries sustained in the rescue of people
from the Leppings Lane terraces. These injuries were, in the main, minor
strains and bruising to backs and limbs.

A total of 58 officers subsequently took sick leave which was directly
attributable to the disaster in the weeks which followed the event,
mainly due to the effects of shock and stress. As a result, 356 working
days were lost.
                                                         I
Two officers remain on sick leave, suffering from stress, one of whom may
well retire from the Force on the grounds of ill-health in the near
future.

During week ending 23 April 1989 - the week immediately following the
disaster - only 92 officers had taken sick leave, compared with 101 in
the corresponding week in 1988.     The figure rose to a maximum of 143
officers taking sick leave during week ending 30 April 1989, compared
with 107 in 1988.    By week ending 21 May 1989, however, the number of
officers taking sick leave had fallen to 105 which corresponded,
identically, with the same period in 1988.

Any effects that the Hillsborough disaster had upon the health and
welfare of the Force appear, largely, to have been short lived. It is
                                        - 6 -

       thought that this is,  to a significant e x t e n t , due to the efforts of the
       Force  Welfare Officer and our Consultant Counsellor who         started  their
       work at the ground within hours of the tragedy occurring.          The memories
       of  the disaster,  and the emotions evoked by i t , will remain with many
       officers for a long time.   The Force as a w h o l e , however, has adjusted
       well.

P Wright
Chief Constable
£    SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE AUTHORITY


     5 JANUARY 1990


     REPORT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE



     HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - IMPLEMENTATION OF
     THE TAYLOR INQUIRY REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS


     Matter for Consideration

    To report on the action taken in relation to the Police Authority resolutions
    numbered four,   five a. to d. and six (minute118 of the Police Authority
    meeting held on 17 November 1989 refers).


    Background Information

    The Chief Constable submitted a report at the Police Authority meeting held on
    17 November 1989 detailing the action taken by the South Yorkshire Police both
    prior to and subsequent to the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim
    Report,    including  consultations with local authorities,        the criminal
    investigation, matters of complaint and discipline, the Coroner's Inquest, the
    civil actions and,   the effects of the disaster   on the health and welfare of
    the Force.

    Following this report the Authority resolved that a further report              be
    prepared, inter alia, on a number of aspects of the resolution as follows


    Resolution 4

           the Chief Constable be requested to consider and report on the suggestion
    t^iat— all relevant information on the policing of football matches should be
    PI.?.vid,ed— to both the relevant local authorities and the football clubs in the
    M ^ rest— of increasing the effectiveness of liaison with other than .just the
    other emergency services.           ~                  ---------------------------

    The suggestion,   that all relevant information on the policing of football
    matches should be provided to both the local authorities anfj the football
    clubs in the interest of increasing the effectiveness of 'liaison with other
    than just the emergency services has been considered. The Chief Constable has
    directed that a full police operational order for every football match shall
    be available to each local authority and each football club.


    Resolution 5a.

    The comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry with regard to the     policing
    of the South Yorkshire Force on the day of the disaster.

    The Chief Constable has noted with regret and concern the nature and the tenor
    of the comments and criticisms about the actions of certain South Yorkshire
    Police officers on the day of the disaster contained in Lord Justice Taylor's
    report.
 As stated in his report of 17 November 1989, the Chief Constable has asked the
 Director of Public Prosecutions to advise upon the criminal consequences of
 such actions.    The Director,   in turn, has called for a full criminal
 investigation which is on-going and is being conducted,   independently, by the
  est Midlands Police, who will also pursue any complaints or discipline
 matters that arise. Until that report is available and the Director of Public
 Prosecutions,  the Police Authority and the Chief Constable have made their
 decisions regarding future action on the criminal and complaints aspect,
 comment on the actions of individual officers would at this time be improper.

 All comment or criticisms contained in the Report were,      where appropriate
 transposed as recommendations and all affecting the          police have   been
 implemented as previously reported to the Committee.




 Resolution 5b.

Tjie .comments ,
               ?nd criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry with regard to the evidence
      — to the Inquiry by police officers of the South Yorkshire Force and the
manner in which such evidence was given.                    ~~ '      — — ----

Of the 172 witnesses, who gave oral evidence to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry
59 of them (over 33%) were South Yorkshire Police officers. The Force adopted
a policy of complete openness and helpfulness towards the Inquiry.    Following
the disaster,  the Chief Constable's concerns were those of the Inquiry itself
  to discover exactly what happened and to make sure that nothing like it
could happen again in South Yorkshire or elsewhere.   To this end,   the Chief
Constable set up a liaison team which furnished the Inquiry with over 900
statements and whatever additional information it required.        Whilst the
Inquiry was sitting,   the Treasury Solicitors made constant requests to this
team, all of which were met. Unsolicited, the South Yorkshire Police produced
numerous photographs and plans for use by the Inquiry.    Each of the police
witnesses that were called gave their testimony fully and voluntarily.

Despite the policy of openness adopted by the South Yorkshire Police, some
individual   officers   may have felt under severe attack from the        10
representative Counsel who had the opportunity with the benefit of hindsight
to question them about their actions and decisions.

As Lord Justice Taylor complimented certain officers for the way they gave
their evidence but has not indicated which officers he has criticised,      the
Chief Constable is of the view that it would serve no purpose to speculate.


Resolution 5c.

H M i — steps he has taken to review and change the planning, procedures and
j>Peration  of the Force since the Hillsborough disaster in light of the
comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry, particularly those contained in
Chapter 18.                                                -------------- ------

The planning procedures involved in the policing of football events have been
reviewed and supplemented as follows:-
    (i) The South Yorkshire Police have entered into a written agreement with
         each of the football league clubs in the County.          The written
         agreement covers such matters as club/police liaison before any event;
         the preparation of contingency plans; demarcation of responsibilities
         in the filling and monitoring of the terraces;  provision and use   of
         cutting equipment; plans for relieving overcrowding, etc.

  (ii)    The operational planning for each football match in South Yorkshire is
          intended to enable the police to cope with foreseeable patterns in the
          arrival at, and departure from,      the event by spectators.      The
          following scenarios are each catered for by way of contingency plans:-

         a)   all ticket, or otherwise restricted, matches
         b)   early arrival of spectators
         c)   unexpected and joint arrival of large numbers of spectators
         d)   individual section of ground approaching capacity
         e)   whole ground approaching capacity
         f)   late arrival of spectators
         g)   emergency opening of external gates, (or forcing of external
                gates), thereby allowing an influx of spectators
         h)   early departure of spectators from ground
         i)   emergency evacuation

         A reserve of officers is maintained at each ground to enable their
         rapid deployment to any difficulty which may arise inside or outside
         the ground.

 (iii)   The South Yorkshire Police now liaise with the fire      and   ambulance
         services at the time of planning for a football event.

  (iv)   A model' South Yorkshire Police operational order for football events
          is nearing completion.     Operational orders have been obtained from
         most Forces in England and Wales - best practise has been adopted and
          the lessons learned from the Hillsborough disaster (highlighted at
          paragraphs 273 and 274 of the Taylor Report) have been incorporated.

   (v)   The South Yorkshire Police have prepared a video tape film which
         highlights the problems of crowd density,   crowd distress and crowd
         dynamics. The film will be used as a training aid for both police and
         stewards who monitor football crowds.

  (vi)   Furthermore,   the   police   Implementation • Team l^as  produced  a
         comprehensive package detailing the measures which have already been
         taken or are recommended for the future at each football ground in
         South Yorkshire to ensure crowd safety.     These packages have been
         provided to the local authorities who each have a responsibility for
         the safety certification at football grounds.     Extracts from these
         packages were appended to the Chief Constable’s last report to the
         Police Authority on 17 November 1989.

These steps are together intended to enhance the planning and operational
procedures involved in the policing of football events in South Yorkshire.
                                     -   A   -




Resolution 5d.

The steps he has taken to review the change of management training appraisal
and quality of officers of the Force since the Hillsborough disaster in light
of the comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry,      particularly those
contained in Chapter 18.

Chapter 18 of Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report states that "...over many
years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the public.
They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large
number of football games including major matches,   during strikes in the coal
industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts...".

The management training,   appraisal and selection processes that exist within
the Force are all targetted to achieve a continuation of that "excellent
service to the public" of South Yorkshire.    Such matters are under constant
review and any changes considered appropriate will be introduced.

The policing of football matches has traditionally been regarded by the police
service as a whole as a particular public order problem.         Training has
reflected this view - policing of football has been subsumed in general public
order training.    In the light of the Hillsborough disaster there are clearly
policing matters specific to football events that warrant a training input,
eg, Safety Certification matters,    football crowd dynamics,  communications,
intelligence gathering,  contingency planning, CCTV utilisation, membership
schemes,   etc.    The Association of Chief Police Officers has already
recommended that these matters be subject of a carousel course at the Police
Staff College,   Bramshill.   When this course is arranged the Chief Constable
will ensure that South Yorkshire officers attend.

Within Force,   the superintendents who have a responsibility for policing
arrangements at the five football league grounds in South Yorkshire have been
co-opted onto the Implementation Team which has been tasked with implementing
the recommendations contained in the Taylor Interim Report.




Resolution 6

That,   as previously requested by minute 81.2 of 29 September 1989, progress
reports be submitted to each scheduled meeting of the Authority until further
notice.

There is little by the way of further progress to report in addition to   that
already reported to the Authority on 17 November 1989.

As outlined at paragraph 3.3 of that report the PoliceImplementation     Team
provided each local authority with a comprehensive report of what the police
have so far achieved. The Authorities were each asked to convene a meeting to
discuss the report relative to their area and what still remains to be done
through the Local Authority Licensing Committees.

Item four dealt with the increased costs for policing football matches.  The
Chief Constable can now report that the Association of Chief Police Officers
Sub-Committee on Hooliganism at Sporting Events has undertaken to review
nationally and consider further the position of police costs       arising     from
football. They will report in due course.

The officer referred to at paragraph 9.3 has now been retired from the Force,
on the grounds of ill-health.

On 30 November 1989 it was announced that the Chief Constable and the South
Yorkshire Police Authority were offering an out-of-court settlement   to the
bereaved and injured at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.   The purpose of this
was to ensure that those entitled to compensation receive it without  further
delay.

The below press statement was released at 2.30 pm:-

"It has been decided by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and the South
Yorkshire Police Authority,   in conjunction with their insurers, Municipal
Mutual Insurance,   that those bereaved and injured in the tragic events at
Hillsborough stadium on 15 April should not have to await the outcome of a
further lengthy hearing in 1990 before receiving compensation.

In the circumstances,  the Chief Constable,  in conjunction with his insurers,
intends to open negotiations with the aim of resolving all bona fide claims
against him for compensation arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.

The other parties presently named as Defendants in the civil proceedings
arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy,  namely, Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club, Eastwood & Partners,   and Sheffield City Council, have been offered the
opportunity of joining in the course of action now taken on behalf of the
South Yorkshire Police, but have refused to do so. It is the intention of the
Chief Constable and his insurers to pursue legal action against those parties
to recover moneys paid out to the claimants pursuant to today's offer."

The Police Authority note the current position as     previously   requested    by
minute 81.2 of 29 September 1989.

 THE TAYLOR INQUIRY REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS


                  onsideration

 To report on the action taken in relation to the Police Authority resolu­
 tions numbered four, five a. to d. and six (minute 118 of the Police Autho­
 rity meeting held on 17 November 1989 refers).


 BgcteyrgrnTct Information              /'«■
fyotC4~-~S

 The Chief Constable *submit te-d—a report at the Police Authority mecting-iiel'
                                                                               d
 on 17 November 1989 detailing the action taken by the South Yorkshire Police
 both prior to and subsequent to the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's
 Interim Report, including consultations with local authorities, the criminal
 investigation, matters of complaint and discipline, the Coroner's Inquest,
 the civil actions and, the effects of the disaster on the health and welfare
 of the Force.

 Following this report the Authority resolved that a further report be pre­
 pared, inter alia, on a number of aspects of the resolution as follows:-




 That the Chief Constable be requested to consider and report on the sugges­
 tion that all relevant information on the policing of football matches
 should be provided to both the relevant local authorities and the football
 clubs in the interest of increasing the effectiveness of liaison with other
 than just the other emergency services.

 As reported previously, the Chief Constable has directed that a full police
 operational order for every football match shall be available to each local
 authority and each football club. Where relevant information comes to
 notice after the operational order has been supplied, then that information
 will also be made available, and forwarded on a separate, updated informa­
 tion sheet.




                                                                Continued
Resolution 5a.

The comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry with pegard to the polic­
ing of the South Yorkshire Force on the day of the disaster.

There is nothing further to report.


Resolution 5b.

The comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry with regard to the evi­
dence given to the Inquiry by police officers of the South Yorkshire Force
and the manner in which such evidence was given.

There is nothing further to report.


Resolution 5c

What steps he has taken to review and change the planning, procedures and
operation of the Force since the Hillsborough disaster in light of the com­
ments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry, particularly those contained in
Chapter 18.

 (i)   The video tape film "Faces in a Crowd", prepared by the South York­
       shire Police to highlight the problems of crowd density, crowd dis­
       tress and crowd dynamics, which is being used as a training aid for
       police officers and those stewards who monitor football crowds in
       South Yorkshire, has been recognised by other Police Forces in this
       country as a most valuable training medium. To date, thirty-six other
       Forces have requested, and been supplied with, copies of the video.

(ii)   Those comprehensive packages detailing the measures which have already
       been taken, or are recommended for the future at each football ground
       in South Yorkshire, prepared by the police Implementation Team in an
       effort to ensure crowd safety, have each been received by the respect­
       ive local authorities, and been given detailed attention by the Advis­
       ory Groups set up by those authorities. Work is now being done to
       finalise those recommendations contained in the packages referred to.


Resolution 5d.

The steps he has taken to review the change of management training appraisal
and quality of officers of the Force since the Hillsborough disaster in
light of the comments and criticisms of the Taylor Inquiry, particularly
those contained in Chapter 18.

There is nothing further to report.

    reports be submitted to each scheduled meeting of the Authority until fur­
    ther notice.

    At the time of writing, the final report and recommendations of Lord Justice

            SUBJECT:      ADVISORY LIAISON



            You will be aware that as the final report of Lord Justice
            Taylor's Inquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster has now been published, I
            am the Officer nominated by the Chief Constable to liaise with the Clubs,
            in accordance with the report's recommendations. I have written to each
            Club informing them of this fact and I attach for your information a copy
            of my letter.

            Divisional Commanders will continue to deal with all matters in relation
            to the grounds on their Division and will bring matters having
            implications for the Force to my attention.

            Divisional Commanders or their Deputies will attend Local Authority
            meetings in relation to the Safe*ty of Sports Grounds Act 1975, and I will
\           be represented at such meetings by a member of Operations Division.

            While Clubs and Local Authorities will be writing directly to Divisional
            Commanders, all original correspondence should be returned for filing in
            Central Registry via Chief Superintendent (Operations & Traffic).

3.3.1 Recommendation 6 - Steward Training.

3.3.2 Recommenation 10 - Provision of Cutting Equipment where there are
                         perimeter fences at sports grounds.

3.3.3 Recommendation 22 - Uround Signposting.

3-3.4 Recommendation 25 - Prennatch Entertainment.

3.3.5 Recommendation 28 - Operational Planning.

3-3-6 Recommendations 35-38 - Co-ordination of Emergency Services.

4.0   RECOMMENDATION 6 - STEWARD TRAINING

4.1   This Recommendation deals with the training and briefing of both the
      Police and stewards to recognise in particular crowd densities and the
      signs of distress of spectators and crowd dynamics.

4.2   Interim action has been taken by the Police to train and brief both
      the Police officers and stewards on duty at the grounds. The action
      of the Police was noted by the Advisory Group at its meeting on 6th
      December, 1989.

4.3   The question of steward training is currently being reviewed by my
      Chief Licensing Officer and on receipt of the final report of Lord
      Justice Taylor, which I feel will make recommendations in this area, I
      will submit a further report on the subject to the Panel.

5.0   RECOMMENDATION 10 - PERIMETER FENCE   - PROVISION OF CUTTINGEQUIPMENT

5.1   Cutting equipment has been provided at both clubs and safety    stewards
       have been trained in its use.

5.2   A test of the response of the stewards to use the equipment has been
       carried out by the Police.  The response at both grounds was deemed
       satisfactory by the Police.

5.3   As part of the general enforcement and inspection procedure I intend
       to establish regular checks of the stewards that are designated to use
       this equipment.

5.4   As part of the annual inspection all cutting equipment will be checked
       to ensure that it has been properly maintained.

6.0   RECOMMENDATION 22 - SIGNPOSTING

6.1   Signposting at the grounds has been reviewed and will be raised as an
       item at the first forum meeting scheduled for late February. The
       views of the Supporters' Club representatives will be sought at that
       time.

6.2   After each development at a sports ground    signposting will be again
       reviewed and appropriate changes made.

6.3   I also feel that there is some benefit in conducting a review of the
       signposting at the grounds annually and I intend to incorporate this
       review into the annual inspection programme.
                                         3.




  7 *° RECOMMENDATION 25 - PRE-MATCH     ENTERTAINMENT

  7.1    The question of the provision of and type of pre-match entertainment
          will be raised initially at the first Forum meeting; and later at the
          Advisory Group meeting.

  7.2     A report on the subject will be placed before members in the close
          season with a view to steps being taken for the forthcoming 1990/91
          season.

  8 -°    RECOMMENDATION 28 - OPERATIONAL PLANNING

  8.1     The management of sports grounds are under a general duty to provide
          contingency plans for (e.g., emergencies, the earlydeparture of
          spectators should a match be abandoned, etc.)

  8.2     Contingency plans made by the club should marry closely with those of
          the Police and other emergency services. The contingency planning of
          football clubs in general will I believe be addressed by Lord Justice
          Taylor in his final report. I intend to review the planning
          arrangements after publication of the final report and then on an
          annual basis as part of the annual inspection procedure.

  9 *°    RECOMMENDATIONS 35-38 - CO-ORDINATION OF EMERGENCY SERVICES

 9.1     The South Yorkshire Police maintain regular liaison with the Fire
         Service and Ambulance Service and prior to each match full details of
         the match are circulated by the Police to the Fire Service and
         Ambulance Service.

 9.2      This liaison is augmented by regular Advisory Group meetings attended
          by representatives of the emergency services.

 9.3     Contingency plans have been formulated for the arrival of emergency
         Police, the Fire Service and the Ambulance Service at the grounds.
         These plans were tested prior to the start of the 1989/90 football
         season and I understand worked well.

 9.4     It is my intention, through the Advisory Group structure, to review
         the contingency plan arrangements to ensure that there is no conflict
         between the arrangements of the club and the emergency services. The
         review will be undertaken as an annual exercise and a test of the plan
         wiii be carried out during the closed season.

 10.0    ADVISORY GROUP

 10.1    The full comments of the Advisory Group on the two Police documents
          are contained in the minutes of the 6th December, 1989 Advisory Group
         meeting (a copy of which is attached).

11.0     DOCUMENTS ATTACHED

11.1     A copy of the Interim Recommendations of Lord Justice Taylor.

11.2     A copy of Section 2 of the Police documents.

        Closed Circuit Television at the clubs.

 11.4   A copy of the minutes of the 2nd January, 1990 General Purposes Panel
        meeting.

 11.5   A copy of the Advisory Group Minutes relating to the Police documents.

 12.0   CONCLUSION

RBOOWEHDBSnDCliB ARESIM5 FROM TEE BfTERIM REPORT OP IORD   JUSTICE TKSUJR
Ihe interim report on the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster, prepared by Lord
Justice Taylor, was published on 4 August 1989.      The report contained 43
reccnmendations which were thought necessary to ensure safety at existing
football grounds.    The South Yorkshire Police have addressed each of the
reccnmendations in relation to the five football league ’grounds in the
county.    This correspondence refers specifically to the assessment and
implementation of the reocnmendations in respect of g w v i w n m n w FOOTBALL
CLOB.

Oi 18 September 1989, a meeting took place between representatives of the
South Yorkshire Police and the four local authorities concerned.        It was
agreed, as a result of that meeting, that the police would conclude their
review of the reccromendations and inform the relevant local authority of
thei*- prcprosals in respect of each dub. Hie local authority advisory group
will wish to consider the achievements of the police *Implementation Tteam'
and superintend the future inplementation of the Tiaylor reccrnmendations. It
is suggested that the enclosed documents provide a framework for such
consideration.

You might agree that it vrould be appropriate to convene, in the near future,
a meeting of the Sheffield City Council Safety of Sports Ground Advisory
Group, in order to progress these natters.

Please find enclosed the following documents

1. Copy of Chapter 24 of the Taylor Report - The Reccnmendations.

2. Summary of the activities undertaken by the South Yorkshire Police at
   Sheffield Wednesday PC in respect of each of these recommendations.

       THE PRESENT POSITION AT

         SHEFFIELD UNITED PC

IN RELATION TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF

        I£RD JUSTICE TAYLOR
  RBOOMBPftTICN 1



  It is noted by the police that the current Safety Certificate for

  Sheffield United Football Club has been amended to reflect the new

  capacities of all standing areas as follows:**



 Spian Kop                            1 4 , 550

 Rramall Zjane end                     5,660

 John Street Terraces west            ‘1,340

 John Street Terraces East             2.050



 However, following an Inspection Meeting, at the ground, involving

 the    south Yorkshire Fire     Brigade,         it is reccarended that the

 rapacity for the Spion Kop      terrace be reviseddownwardsfran             14,550

 to 11,040.     If this reccmnendation            isagreed     by the lio—

authority then the Safety Certificate requires further arendnent.



RBocMMaoftncw 2



        calculation   for   maximum      capacities,         proposed   by    this

reconnendation, has been followed in determining the figure for each
terraced area recorded above.



RBQCMMENDflTICN 3



a) An    electronic   counting   mechanism        is   in place    at   Sheffield

  United-s ground whereby the number of spectators entering each self-

  contained area is conterrporaneously recorded. •
       TSie club has undertaken (see written agreement) to monitor this

       counter and to limit the number of spectators entering any self-

       contained   area    to   the    maximum capacity      figure    assessed   in

       accordance with Reccnmendation 2 above.



 b) The d u b will achieve this by closing off the relevant turnstiles

       to prevent further access to such an area when its maxiaun

    capacity is about to be reached.                  The police have agreed to

    assist the club in this regard, if requested so to do.



 RBOGMMBPftTION 4



   A witten agreement, setting cut their respective responsibilities

    for crowd safety and control, has been approved and signed by

   representatives of South Yorkshire Police and Sheffield United

   Football Club.     A copy of that agreement is attached as document (6)



KBOQMMBPBTICM 5



At each match at Sheffield United’s ground there are six stewards

(two    to   the   Spion    Kop,      John   Street    and   Bramall   Lane   ends

respectively) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in those

areas for possible overcrowding or distress.             The stewards regularly

perform the same duties, as do the police officers authorised under

Recaimendation 9 below.         The parties are therefore familiar to each

other, and the stewards have. ready access to these police officers

who each have a radio giving them contact with the police control
  KBCCWBPftnCN 6




  All police officers and stewards (not just those authorised under

  Recommendations 5 and 9) are fully briefed with regard to the

  recognition of crowd densities and to the recognition of signs of

  distress.        All officers and stewards have been issued, as an aicfe

  nenoire,    with a       laminated card which identifies the signs of
  distress.



 Stewards are each issued with a copy of written instructions, by the

 dub,     which detail their duties.         n * stewards are briefed by a

 police inspector, before each natch, on their responsibilities for

 crcvd safety and control and their duties in case of emergency
 evacuation.



 Similarly, police officers are briefed by a Senior police officer

 before     each   match   on   their   complementary   responsibilities   and
duties.



*I*ie South Yorkshire Police are presently preparing visual aids,

designed to enable stevards and officers to recognise different

c r o d densities, to recognise signs of distress, and to understand a

little more about crowd dynamics.            The aids will consist of a)

albums of photographs depicting the various sections of Sheffield

United's ground with different numbers of spectators therein, and b)

a video tape film which highlights crowd dersities, distress and

dynamics,     when completed these photographs and film will be shown

to the Safety of Sports Ground Advisory Group.
  The    certifying   authority   are asked   to   ensure   that      the   club

  undertakes and continues to undertake its own responsibilities for

  staff training as set out in the Guide to Safety      at Sports Grounds -

  •the Green Guide* - paras       26, 177, 195 - 199 and Annex B to the
  Guide.

 All gateways in radial or perimeter fences at Sheffield United are

 painted in the international safety colour -white            - which is a

 different colour frcm the        restof the fence.         Each is clearly

 identified by a sign vfcich proclaim ’Emergency Exit'.            Furthermore,

 a notice is displayed on the electronic scoreboard, beforeeach game

 ccnmences, asking all spectators to identify their nearest emergency
 exit.




 KBOCMMENDftlTON 8



All the gates in perimeter fences have been removed at Sheffield
Dnited's ground.



RHXM4ENDftTI0N 9



There 1 5 m     respect of each gateway in the perimeter fences, at

least one police officer whose sole duty whenever spectators are on

the terraces,    is to decide whether or not to allow spectators

through that gateway to relieve overcrowding.       Such police officers

are to be identified by means of a lime green tabard. The officer
   is familiar to all stewards in that area (see Reccronendation 5

   above),    is known by than to      be authorised to relieve ever-

   eroding,    and is able to make radio contact with the police
   control roan.



  RHX*MBCM3ai 10



  Pair sets of     metal   cutting   equipment    have   been provided    fey

  Sheffield United fbotball cl*.       It has been agreed that, in case

  of need, aiplc*ees cf the club trained in its use will be readily

  available to Cfente the eguijrent.       l*> operatives are deployed

  to either end of fee ground and are in radio ocntact, via the

 dub's radio systan, with both the club safety officer and the
 police control roc*.



 A test of the ability of the operatives to muster and make the

 equipment ready for       use was   performed by the police ground

 °amBnder “                      Mted     vs     Hull City match on      23

          The police officer in caimana at Sheffield United PC is aware of the

*         option tc delay kick-off              and discusses this matter, before each

          game, with the match officials.               The cption was utilised an 12

          August 1989, when the police superintendent asked for the kick-cff

UK       at th® match between Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday to be

         delayed for fifteen minutes to ensure the safety of the crowd still

         trying to get into the ground at 2.45 pm.             The crowd was notified of



i        the delay by the public address system.

         kick-off delay, the police request that the club install a telephone

         link between the police control roar and the referee's roan.               (See

There are sufficient operators errploved in the police control roar,

to deal with radio catmunicaticns.         New police ccrmunications

equipment has been ccrrmissioned, and is about to be installed at

Sheffield United's ground.



The equipment consists of a two-bay radio set with a spare station

in case of radio failure on the primary station.          It also has

battery back-up in case of power failure.      This system also gives

operators in the control room priority over, and the capacity to

override, others using the same channel.


The police ground cctmander has the option of utilising, when he

feels it necessary, an additional radio channel which provides

exclusive     carrnunication   between   himself   and   other   sector

ccmnanders.     This executive channel would be utilised in an

emergency when the primary channel may become overcrowded.


The police control roan is to be replaced by Sheffield United PC

in the near future   The club is aware of the requirements of sound­

proofing etc.    The certifying authority are asked to oversee the

construction of this new control roan.


RECa^ENDftTICW 32


A survey of Sheffield Unitea’s ground has identified twenty eight

key points where the police would wish to see dedicated telephone

points to enable direct communication with the police control rocm.



Attached, at document (4), is a.plan showing the location of those

points, together with an equipment specification prepared by the

South Yorkshire Police Ccrrmunications Department.
   Sheffield United FC have subsequently agreed tc fund, using a

   authority are asked to oversee its installation.

  »e r e   is in existence at Sheffield united EC a public address

  syste*.     Heaver, at a meeting between the police and the club on

  5 August 1989, it was agreed that there was a need for a more

  efficient system to enable effective cannunication with individual
 areas both inside and outside the ground.



 Sheffield United rc have camissioned a new public address system

 and w r k    is progressing.    The plan at document ,5> shows the

 existing system and site of new loudspeakers.         The certifyina

 authority are asked to oversee the instaUati* of this public

 address system to ensure that it ccnplies with this r e a c t i o n

 and that it is effective,      in so doing, the certifying authority

will wish to pay regard, also, to paragraph 194 (iii) of the Guide

to Safety at Sports Grounds - The -Green Guide- - which lists the
requirements of an effective public address system.



    police have asked the club to ensure that the use of a loud

signal to precede umortant. messages be advertised in the club's
progranmes.

 ®>e     calajlaticn       for      raudiun      capacities, proposed      by      this

 reccranendaticn, has been followed in deteimmng the figure for each
terraced area recorded above.

(a) An electronic counting system is in place at
                                                               Sheffield Wednesday's
       ground whereby      the number        of spectators     entering each self-
       contained area is contemporaneously recorded.



    The club has undertaken (see written agreement) to monitor this

    counter and to limit the number of spectators entering any self-

    contained       area   to     the      maximum    capacity figure   assessed   in
    accordance with Recommendation 2 above.



(b) 1,16 Club Wil1 achieve this by closing off the relevant turnstiles
    to prevent further access to such an area vrfien its maximum capacity

    is about to be reached.          The police have agreed to assist the club
   in this regard, if requested so to do.
RBOCWPOftnCN 4

A written agreement, setting out their respective responsibilities far crowd

At each match at Sheffield Wednesday's ground there are stewards

 situated on the perimeter track at the %aon Kop end of the ground

whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible

overcrowding or distress.           Bie stewards regularly perform the same

duties, as do the police officers authorised under Recommendation 9

belew.      Hie parties are therefore familiar to each other, and the

stewards have ready access to these police officers who each have a

radio giving them contact with the police control roan.



RBOOMffim g i m €



AH   police officers and stevrards          (not just those authorised under

Reccranendations    5 and    9)    are   fully    briefed with    regard   to   the

recognition of crc*d densities and to the recognition of signs of

distress.     All officers and stewards have been issued, as an aide

memoire, with a laminated card which identifies the signs of distress.



Stewards are each issued with a copy of written instructions, by the

club, v^iich detail their duties.        The senior stewards are     briefed by a

police   inspector,   before      each   match,   on   the   responsibilities   of

stewards lor crcwd safety and control and their duties in case of

emergency evacuation.       The senior stewards are expected to brief the

more junior stewards.



Police officers are briefed by a Senior police officer before each
 match on their complementary responsibilities and duties. The cemmander

 of each sector "of the ground is responsible for further briefing his or

 *ler officers on their specific duties within that sector.



 The          Yorkshire   Police   are   presently preparing   visual   aids,

 designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different crowd

 densities, to recognise signs of distress; and to understand a little

 more about crowd dynamics.        The aids will consist of a) Albums of

 photographs depicting the various sections of Sheffield Wednesday's

 ground with different nunbers of spectators therein, "and b) A video

 tape film which highlights crc*d densities, distress and dynamics.

 When completed these photographs and film will be shown to the Safety

 of Sports Ground Advisory-XJroep.



 The Certifying Authority are asked to ensure.that the d u b undertakes

and continues to undertake its own responsibilities for staff training

as set out in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 'The Green Guide'

- paras, 26, 177, 195 and Annex B to the R»rw*».

All gateways in radial or .perimeter fences at Sheffield Wednesday PC

are painted   white   which is a different colour fran the rest of the

fence.   Each is clearly identified by a sign which proclaims 'Emergency

All the gates in the perimeter fence at Sheffield Wednesday's ground
 remain open while ever spectators are on the terrace.



 RBoatecftncN 9



 There is, in respect of each gatevay in the perimeter fences, at least cne

 officer whose sole duty, whenever spectators ace on tte terraces, is to

 decide whether or not to allow spectators through that gateway to relieve

 overcrowding.   Sue* police officers are to be identified by means of a

 green tabard.   The officer is familiar to all stewards in that area (see

 Recommendation 5 above}, is known by them to be authorised to relieve

 overcrowding, and is able to make radio contact with the police control
room.

Two sets of metal cutting equipment have been .provided by Sheffield

Wednesday FC and are stored in boxes, adjacent to the fence* at either end

of the ground.   It has been agreed that, in case of need, enployees of the

club trained in its use will be readily available to qperate the equipment.



All stewards have been trained in its use and will respond to instruction

from police control (many of the stewards are in radio contact via the

club's radio system).

equipment    has recently been installed at Sheffield Wednesday's

station in case of radio failure on the primary station.       It also

has battery back-up in case of powar failure.        This system also

gives operators in the control roan priority over, and the capacity

to override, others using the same channel.



The police ground comvander has the option of utilising, when

he feels its necessary, an additional radio channel which provides

       Dear Sir/Madam

       HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 11/1990
       FINAL REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

       Introduction

       The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the Home Secretary
       following the disaster at the Hillsborough football ground was
       published on 29 January.  A copy of the Report is attached.

       2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
       of the Report's recommendations and the Government's response to
       them? and second to give guidance to local authorities with
       safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
       recommendations.

       The Report

       3.   The Report contains 76 recommendations, 43 of which are
       repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6 below) from the
       Interim Report circulated with HOC 68/1989. Attached at Annex A
       is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to the House
       of Commons on 29 January responding to the final Report.     At
       Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
       setting out the Government's initial response to the individual
       recommendations in the report.

       4.   Local authorities may wish to note, in particular, the
       response to recommendations 1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
       recommendation 6 (National Review Body). The intention is to
       bring into force the relevant sections of Part I of the Football
       Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.                Safety
certificates should not be amended for this purpose.

Scope

5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
the recommendations "essentially" to sports grounds designated
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the flexibility of
approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply.    Paragraph 14 of
the Report makes clear that its emphasis is on football, with its
special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
states that "crowd problems are directly related to the nature
of the event and the numbers attending it".    It would therefore
be consistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
to take proper account of these factors when applying the
recommendations to individual grounds:     for example a careful
appraisal of the value of such matters as the installation of
sophisticated communications systems and CCTV may be necessary
where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than
thousands and where the police presence at the ground is minimal.

Interim Report Recommendations Adjusted

6.   The   attention  of   local   authorities   is  drawn   to
recommendations 8, 11, 12(b), 19, 20, 31, 33, 58, 66 and 67 all
of which were contained in the Interim Report but have been
modified as follows:

        recommendation 8 -       revised maximum figure

        recommendation 11 - "agreement" between club and police is
                            replaced by "statement of intent"

        recommendation 12 - qualification introduced by 12(b)

        recommendation 19 - discretion as regards opening of pitch
                            perimeter gates

        recommendation 20 - manning by police or steward

        recommendation 31 - revised      composition   of   the   Advisory
                            Group

        recommendation 33 - reference to 1975 Act provision

        recominendation 58 - hand-signals not recommended

        recominendation 66   —   recommended threshold figure of 2000

        recommendation 67 - ambulance may be     approved         by   the
                            ambulance authorities.
New Safety Recommendations

7.   New   recommendations are summarised below and               local
authorities are urged to take the action indicated                where
appropriate.

     Turnstiles (recommendation 10) - to note the revised
     maximum flow-rate to be used in place of the figure of
     750 quoted in the Green Guide which will be amended as
     soon as possible;

        Gangways (recommendation 13) - to include appropriate
        conditions in safety certificates;

        Perimeter Fences (recommendations 14, 15, 17) - to
        secure   action  by  clubs  to   comply  with  these
        recommendations and to amend safety certificates, as
        necessary;

        Safety Certificates (recommendations 24, 25, 26) - to
        consider   any    necessary    adjustment   to   safety
        certificates   and note    Home Office    intention  to
        implement recommendation 24;

        Duties of Clubs (recommendations 39, 40, 42, 43) - to
        consider appropriate amendment to safety certificates,
        as necessary;

        Police Planning (recommendations 47, 48, 50, 52, 53),
        Communications (55) and Co-ordination (61) - to note
        the recommendations and the Government's response;

        First Aid (recommendation 69) and Offences/Penalties
        (recommendations  70-73)  -   to  note  Government's
        response;

        Green Guide (recommendations 74-76 and Appendix 3) -
        to note the Government response and to adopt the
        revised criteria/requirements which will be included
        in a revised guide as soon as possible.

Resource Implications

8.   Action to consider, revise and enforce the provisions of
safety certificates in the light of the Report may have short
term resource implications but is not expected to give rise to
significant long-term resource implications above existing
commitments.

Other

9.    Copies of this circular, annexes and enclosures are sent
to Fire and Civil Defence Authorities, Police Authorities,
Regional Managers Health Authorities, Chief Officers of Police,
Chief    Fire  Officers   and  Chief   Ambulance  Officers   for
information.   Copies have also been sent to all football league

                                                               Lord Justice Taylor pointing out that incitement from the
                                                               pitch or bad behaviour by players, which is not confined to

                                                               improve standards, but Lord Justice Taylor's clear
                                                              conclusion was that the majority had not and that the
                                                              game has a future only if the directors and the players can

                                                              provides the machinery for that. The change will improve
                                                              safety and behaviour, and we intend to bring it about.
                                                                  Lord Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk of the
                                                              finances for ground improvements will have to be raised by
                                                              the clubs themselves. He says there are ways of raising the
                                                              money if the clubs' management is enterprising and
                                                              resourceful, and he points to the opportunities presented
                                                              by sponsorship. He also points to the revenue that flows to
                                                              the football authorities from television rights and says that
                                                              the football authorities should ensure that this valuable
                                                             source of revenue is directed towards improving stadia. He
                                                             canvasses the possibility of a levy on transfer fees which he
                                                             says have reached a level which many regard as grotesque.
                                                                  There is a whole series of detailed recommendations set
                                                             out in chapters 3. 4 and 5 on matters relating to spectator
                                                             safety such as gates and gangways. Indeed, of the 76

                                                             which can be implemented immediately: some will need
                                                             further work. For convenience, I have placed in the Vote

impact of closed circuit television on the hooligan
probiem. It also mentions other measures taken by the
Government, such as the restriction on the sale ol" alcohol
and the power given to the courts to make orders
excluding convicted hooligans from grounds.
      Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
 value of the police national football intelligence unit in
 dealing with football-related crime and with hooligans
 travelling to matches abroad.
      As ! have said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
 better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
 better behaviour. Beyond that, the report recommends the
 creation of three new specific offences to apply at
 designated sports grounds— throwing a missile: chanting
 obscene or racialist abuse; and going on to the pitch
 without reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
 to be given to extending the courts' powers to impose
 attendance centre orders and for the use of electronic
 tagging in the case of offenders' convicted of football-
 related offences. The specific new offences suggested seem,
  to some extent, to duplicate offences which are already
 available in the Public Order Act 1986. but I shall look
 carefully and quickly at all these suggestions.
       I now come to the proposed football membership
  scheme. Lord Justice Taylor examined the invitation to
  tender for a scheme which was issued by the consultants
  employed by the football authorities. He came to the
  conclusion that he could not support a scheme of that kind
  because he could not believe that the technology would
  work well enough to avoid the danger of congestion and
  disorder. He was also concerned about the call on police
   resources. Instead, he proposes the measures to which 1
   have referred.
        In the light of this advice, the Government have decided
   not to proceed with the establishment of a football
   membership authority, but part 1 of the Act will remain on
   the statute book. Work will continue to see how the
   shortcomings identified by Lord Justice Taylor could be
   overcome in case we have to return to the matter again,
   should the problem of hooliganism not be defeated by the
    alternative strategy proposed in the report.
         Let no one imagine that this means that there will be
    any let-up in the fight against hooliganism. Those who.
    unlike the Government, have for so long shrugged off their
    responsibilities will now have to face up to them.
         The Government intend to proceed as quickly as
    possible to the establishment of a football licensing
    authority and, subject to consultation, section 11 of the
    Football Spectators Act will be used to direct the Football
     Licensing Authority to require aii-seater stadiums— with
    standing being reduced by stages and entirely eliminated in
    first and second division grounds by August 1994 and in all
     Football League grounds by 1999.
        The necessary steps will be taken to ensure improved
     arrangements for crowd control and better training for
     police and stewards. There will be urgent consideration of
     the case for new offences and for new powers to deal with
     those excluded from grounds by the courts. The clubs will
     be compelled to get rid of the terraces. But Lord Justice
     Taylor indicates how much more they can do to create a

    INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM INQUIRY


    Initial response by the Government to the recommendations in the
    final  report of Lord Justice      Taylor's   Inquiry  into the
    Hillsborough stadium diaster.


    In his statement on 29 January# the Home Secretary indicated that
    he would place in the Library a schedule setting out the
    Government's initial response to the recommendations of Lord
    Justice Taylor's final report.   The schedule is annexed.




    29 January 1990
Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report.


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.   General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
     designated under the Safety of sports Grounds Act 1975.

2.   To apply to all UEFA "high risk" matches from Autumn 1993.

3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
          Football league, Divisions 1 and 2
          Scottish football league, Premier Division
          National stadia.

4.   To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
     other matches played at designated grounds.

The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.


The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and which it may not
be practicable to deal with in this way.



ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)

The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation
that the football    league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.




NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)

     (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
           review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

     (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
           sports and other sports venues.

The   Government   supports  the   recommendation   that   safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues after consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority's responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)

7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators
      in pens or areas (interim recommendation 1).

8.    Calculations of crowd density:      revised figures    (interim
      recommendation 2, revised).

9.    Arrangements to prevent   further   access   to pens   (interim
      recommendation 3).

10.   Turnstile flow rates.

The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates   to reflect    reductions  in   terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities'
attention.   The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.

FILLING AND MONITORING OF TERRACES (Recommendations 11-12)

11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation 4, revised.

12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).

The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.

GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13)

Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.

FENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)

14.   Removal of spikes.

15.   Reduction in height.

16.   Training of stewards (interim recommendation 6).
17.   Emergency gates in perimeter fences.

18.   Harking of emergency gates    (interim recommendation 7).

19.   Gates normally to be kept open          during   matches   (interim
      recommendation 8, revised).

20.   Hanning    of    emergency      gates       (replaces      interim
      recommendation 9).

21.   Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).

The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17   and  to  note   recommendation   19  which   varies  interim
recommendation 8.   The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.

CRUSH BARRIERS     (Recommendations 22, 23)

22.   Inspection    (interim recommendation 11).

23.   Review of layout (interim recommendation 12).

These are repeated from the Interim Report.            They have already
been commended to local authorities.

SAFETY CERTIFICATES     (Recommendations 24-31)

24.   Handatory conditions in safety certificates.

25.   Variation from terms of safety certificates.

26.   Terms of safety certificates.

27.   Review of safety certificates    (interim recommendation 13).

28.Issue of certificates       to   grounds    without    them   (interim
recommendation 14).

29.   Annual   review  of   certificates;  annual           renewal    of
      certificates (interim recommendation 15).

30.   Review of arrangements     for issuing certificates        (interim
      recommendation 16).

31.   Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17,
      revised).

The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
reminded of the need to have an effective review system, the
desirability of a properly      constituted  team approach to
certification and the desirability of consulting club and
supporters association representatives.

Annual review of safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
wit h safety certificates is already required by law.      The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

DUTIES OF FOOTBALL CLUBS   (Recommendations 32-43)

32.   Measurement of turnstile flow (interim recommendation 18).

33.   Correlation of turnstile       flow   and   capacity    (interim
      recommendation 19).

35.   Closed circuit   television     (interim    recommendation      21,
      extended).

37.   Information on tickets    (interim recommendation 23).

38.   Co-ordination with the police (interim recommendation 24) .

39.   Computer records of ticket sales.

40.   Restriction of all ticket matches to capacity attendances.

41.   Pre match entertainment    (interim recommendation 25).

42.   Recruitment of stewards.

43.   Police control rooms.

These recommendations are aimed primarily at football clubs and
are supported by the Government.       Where appropriate, local
authorities will be asked to amend safety certificates to enforce
these recommendations.

POLICE PLANNING (Recommendations 44-53)

44.   Nomination of a Chief       Officer   for    liaison (interim
      recommendation 26).

45.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 27).

46.   Operational orders (interim recommendation 28).

50.   Early kick-offs and Sunday fixtures.

51.   Control room facilities.

52.   Training of senior officers.

53.   Charges for police services.

These recommendations, some of which are repeated from the
Interim Report are directed primarily to Chief Police Officers
and police authorities. The Government supports the proposal for
senior   officer   training  and   the   objective    to  improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches.     The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police
authorities after consultation with relevant representative
associations, to ensure consistency of practice.

COMMUNICATIONS   (Recommendations 54-58)

54.   Radio communications (interim recommendation 31, amended).

55.   Provision of a command channel.

56.   Land lines (interim recommendation 32).

57.   Public address   (interim recommendation 33).

58.   Illuminated advertising (interim recommendation 34:   advice
      on hand signals withdrawn).

These are largely repeated from the Interim Report which the
Government has already urged clubs, local authorities and police
to implement.  Chief Officers will also be encouraged to use an
additional, discrete channel of communications for police match
commanders.

CO-ORDINATION OP EMERGENCY SERVICES (Recommendations 59-63)

59.   Co-ordination (interim recommendation 35).

60.   Pre match briefing (interim recommendation 36).

61.   Communication with emergency services.

62.    Arrival of emergency vehicles (interim recommendation 37).

63.    Briefing of police officers (interim recommendation 38).

These recommendations are intended to ensure full co-ordination
and co-operation of the emergency services and are substantially
those covered in the Interim Report which the Government has
already endorsed.  The Government will urge all those concerned
to comply with the further recommendation        devised     to    ensure
immediate summons of emergency services.

FIRST AID, MEDICAL FACILITIES AND AMBULANCES
(Recommendations   64-69)

concerned.

OFFENCES AND PENALTIES (Recommendations 70-73)

70.   Selling tickets.

71.   Other specific offences.

72.   Attendance centres.

The Government will      look carefully   and quickly   at   all   these
suggestions.

74.   Revision of the Green Guide.

75.   Crush barrier tests.

76.   Inspections for corrosion.

The Government accepts these recommendations and will act on them
with urgency.

                             PART V - FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

AU-Seated Accommodation
  1. The Secretary of State should ensure that spectators are admitted only to seated accommodation at
matches played at sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in accordance wi h
the timing set out in Recommendations 2 to 4 below.

  2. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the 1993/4 season at high-risk matches as
defined under the UEFA Regulations set out in paragraph 82 above.

  3. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 above should apply with effect from the start of
the 1994/5 season to all matches at grounds in the first and second divisions of the Football League, the
Premier Division of the Scottish Football League, and at national stadia, subject to a reasonable extension of
time in the case of a club promoted to the second division of the Football League or the Premier Division of the
Scottish Football League. Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 20/o ol the
present standing capacity (such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8
below), the first 20% deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1994.

  4. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the
1999/2000 season to all matches at all other grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 10% of the present standing capacity
(such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8 below), the first 10%
deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1999.

Advisory Design Council
  5. The Football Association and the Football League should establish an Advisory Design Council whose
functions should be:

     (a) to conduct and marshal research into the improvement and design of football stadia;

     (b) to disseminate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in this field to members of the
         Football League and, on request, to other football and sports clubs in England, Wales and Scotland.

 N ational Inspectorate and Review Body
   6. (a) If Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
 giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and powers therein specified (power to review the
 discharge of functions by local authorities). If Part I of the Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
 other arrangements should be made for the discharge of the functions and powers in section 13 of the Act by the
 appointment of a body to exercise them.

       (b)       In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
 should also be entrusted with similar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local authorities of their
 certifying and licensing functions in relation to other sports grounds and sports entertainments pursuant tot e
 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
 1987.

 M aximum Capacities for Terraces
   7. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
 should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

 A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
 another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

   8. Each figure for mavimnm capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide
 (“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

      (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide (when the terrace
          or viewing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;
    (b) the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope materially
        deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
        packed) should be 0 not 27;

    (c) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density including those specified in paragraphs 220 to 224
        inclusive of the Green Guide.

  9. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.

  10. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 750 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide. The maximum rate for any particular
turnstile must take full account of all circumstances including those given as examples in paragraph 47.

Filling and M onitoring Terraces
  11. There should be a written statement of intent, agreed between the club and the police, setting out their
respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling of each self-contained pen or
other standing area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the document in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

  12. (a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
other steward or police presence. He should have ready access to a police officer who can authorise access
through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.

      (b)       This Recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where the
spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not exceed one third of the area’s
maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.


Gangways
  13. Gangways should be kept clear, in accordance with paragraphs 97 to 99 of the Green Guide. Gangways
should be painted in a conspicuous colour whether they are sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require
that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be painted.


Fences and Gates
   14. All spikes or similar constructions on perimeter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.

  15. Perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres, measured from the top of the fence to the lowest
point at which spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations forming part of the perimeter
boundary.

   16. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those with
duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd densities.

  17. There must be provided in any perimeter fence of a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates of a
minimum width of 1.1 metres to enable that pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for
an emergency evacuation of that pen or area.
   18. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.

  19. Where there is a perimeter fence in front of a pen or enclosure, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully
open during the period when spectators are in the pen or enclosure, wherever those in command feel that this
can safely be done. Whether they be fully open, partially open or closed, they should be kept unlocked
throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is occupied.

   20. Each gate in a perimeter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or enclosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer when the pen or enclosure is occupied. Whether such manning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be decided by the Police Commander. In either event, the Police
Commander should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to the
pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

  21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there are
perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
   22. All crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately (if this has not
already been done following the Interim Report) to ensure that it complies with the criteria contained in
Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen or
terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 8 above, should reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
   24. The Secretary of State should exercise his powers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) of the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 so as to make mandatory in Safety Certificates those conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act. So far as the original section 2(2Xb) is concerned “shall” should be
substituted for “may”.

  25. In assessing these mandatory requirements in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. Once that is done, the resultant figures and terms for that ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be permitted other than by
formal revision.

  26. Where a local authority incorporates any provision of the Green Guide into the Safety Certificate, other
than one within the scope of Recommendation 25 above, it should make clear whether that provision is to be
complied with absolutely or with discretionary flexibility.

   27. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if this has not already been done
following the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority, which should consult the club in respect of
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.
Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its object should be to ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a
matter of urgency following the findings and Recommendations in this Report.

 28. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

  29- Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
Certificate should require to be renewed annually.

  30.   Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
amending and renewing Safety Certificates (if this has not already been done following the Interim
Report). Such review should require that there exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by senior officers and
elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local authority's rules.

   31. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) consisting of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire
and ambulance services and of the building authority. The Advisory Group should consult representatives of the
club and of a recognised supporters' organisation on a regular basis. The Advisory Group's terms of reference
should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.


Duties of Each Football Club
  32. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured (if this has not already been
done following the Interim Report). Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile
remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate anticipated.

  33. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such as
to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the turnstiles
within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly. Since
this Recommendation includes terms and conditions within the scope of the original section 2(2XcX>) of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 it should be given effect in the Safety Certificate (see Recommendation 24
above).

  34. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be reached
and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile operators for this
purpose.

  35. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before, throughout and at the end of a
match.

  36. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report). It should, in relation to the arrangements for each
match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of
spectators to their appropriate viewing areas. Any redundant signs should be removed.

   37. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with the
information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs should
contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

  38. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report) by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure
that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.

  39. Clubs should consider maintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of the match, for
season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches for seated areas, containing the names and addresses of those
purchasing tickets.

  40. All-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected.
When a match has been designated all-ticket, clubs should not sell tickets at the match and should take steps to
advise the spectators of both clubs accordingly.

  41. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters' club as to the provision of pre-match
entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

   42. Clubs should recruit and retain sufficient competent stewards. They should be fit, active and robust, and
preferably between the ages of 18 and 55. Clubs should ensure that stewards are fully trained, aware of their
duties under Annex B of the Green Guide and under the statement of intent (see Recommendation 11) and able
to perform them.
  43. The club should provide a police control room which is:—

    (a) well placed, so as to command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator area surrounding it;

    (b) of sufficient size for the commander, his deputy and enough officers to operate the radios, telephones
        and CCTV screens. There should be space for others who may need from time to time to visit the room
        eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services;

    (c) well equipped with CCTV, radio and telephone facilities and, where necessary, sound-proofed against
        excessive crowd noise.

  It should be the duty of the club to provide a room and equipment to the satisfaction of the chief officer
nominated under Recommendation 44 below.


Police Planning
  44. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated sports ground or more
should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

  45. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground, and the pre-match briefing of all
officers on duty there, should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is
detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

  46. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground should enable the police to cope
with any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

  47. Police planning should provide that ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter a designated sports
ground except in an emergency.

  48. Arrest procedures inside and outside designated sports grounds should be reviewed so as to keep to the
minimum the period during which an arresting officer is away from his post.

  49. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

  50. Consideration in consultation with the club should be given, especially for high-risk matches, to the
possibility of an early kick-off or a Sunday fixture.

  51. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television monitoring
outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles
or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the
interpretation and use of these data.

   52. Consideration should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
strategy of policing football matches.

  53. Police authorities should review the charges they make to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home Office should take steps to ensure consistency of
practice, subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.


Communications
  54.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be used,
where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.
  55. There should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate
with his senior officers round the ground.

   56. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

  57. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important announcements should
be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This
arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.

  58. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   59. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
liaison concerning crowd safety at each designated sports ground.

  60. Before each match at a designated sports ground the police should ensure that the fire service and
ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of spectators
expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the
control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control rooms of each of the
emergency services.

  61. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control room to the local
headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency calls can be made
instantly.

  62. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated sports ground of emergency vehicles from all three
services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility within
the ground itself.

  63. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for the
arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why they are
required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
  64. There should be at each sports ground at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
The club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.
  65. There should be at each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms
and the equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.

   66. (a) At every match where the number of spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground. He should be
trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
and should remain until half an hour after the end of the match. His whereabouts should be known to those in
the police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

       (b)        At any match where the number of spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
arrangements to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. The arrangements made should be
known to those in the police control room.

  67. At least one fully equipped ambulance from or approved by the appropriate ambulance authority should
be in attendance at all matches with an expected crowd o f5,000 or more.

   68. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a requirement
of the Safety Certificate.
  69.     A “major incident equipment vehicle”, designed and equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties, should be
deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in excess o f25,000 is expected.


Offences and Penalties
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence of selling tickets for and on the day of a football
match without authority from the home club to do so.

  71. Each of the following activities at a designated sports ground should be made a specific offence:-

    i.   throwing a missile;

    ii. chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.

  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courts' powers to make attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football matches. The provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum of 72 hours in the case of an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentencing of offenders
convicted of football related offences.


Green Guide
  74. As a matter of urgency, the Home Office should set up a body to revise the Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report of the Technical Working Party (Appendix 3).

  75. In any revision of the Green Guide, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various materials should be
specified.

  76. When the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.

    Dear Mr Webster




    IMPLEMENTATION OP THE FINAL REPORT INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH
    STADIUM DISASTER


    Thank you for your letter of 22 February about the Final
    Report of the Hillsborough Inquiry. I am sorry I have not
    replied sooner.

    The recommendations in the Final Report on all seated
    accommodation are not confined to football grounds (paragraphs
    86-89 of the Final Report refer). The provisions of the
    Football Spectators Act 1989 (the 1989 Act) to require the
    introduction of all seated accommodation cannot/ however, be
    extended to grounds used for sports other than association
    football. Further primary legislation would be necessary to
    achieve this and we shall first discuss this issue with the
    relevant representative sporting organisations.

    We have noted the position of Owlerton Stadium. Paragraphs 86
    and 237 of the Final report in relation to the use of
    greyhound stadia would appear relevant here.

    The intention is to bring in the commencement of the relevant
    sections of Part I of the 1989 Act and set up the Football
    Licensing Authority as quickly as possible.   In the meantime
    we take the view that football clubs should, in anticipation
    of statutory direction, make plans for and, wherever possible,
    introduce all seated accommodation at grounds.

    The Report's recommendations on the provision of exits in
    perimeter fencing stems from paragraph 22 of Appendix 3 of the
    Report. All pitch perimeter fences should contain exit gates
    to the pitch. Where their installation poses difficulty of
    the sort your describe the solution is a matter for local

YORKSHIRE TELEVISION - FIRST TUESDAY PROGRAMME 6 . 2 . 9 0

DISASTER AT HILLSBOROUGH

The question posed at the outset of this programme was, "How large a
catastrophe must there be before THEY make football safe." 'THEY' was never
defined but it was never suggested as a statement that it should be the
police.

However it went on to deal with the central issue of this whole affair -
"what claimed the lives?"

It was a programme of parts, the West Midlands Enquiry, Lord Justice Taylor
(only briefly mentioned), the build-up to the game, the disaster itself and
reflections. The linking theme between all of these parts was police action
on the day and the conclusion was drawn that the police were generally
responsible.

The two most pertinent statements made :-

                i)     Failure to close the tunnel was a mistake of
                       the first magnitude.
and
                ii)    Referring to Gate 'C1 - once open disaster was
                       inevitable.


This brings into focus three areas of importance for South Yorkshire Police
at the Coroners Inquest.

                i)    The planning for the event.

                ii)   The planning for a major emergency at the event.

                 iii) The action of individual officers prior to and during.


All these areas will have to be addressed but it is an issue of pre-match
planning that is central to our position and one on which the legal
responsibility is likely to fall. Were we negligent in carrying out this
duty?, or did we behave in a way which was reasonable and can be seen to be
as such by a reasonable man. These are basically civil requirements but
will have relevance in the Coroners Court and any criminal proceedings
should they follow. Our efforts should be to ensure the Coroner has
significant supporting evidence on behalf of the South Yorkshire Police to
avoid bringing in an open verdict.
It was the behaviour outside the ground that caused the gates to be opened;
the crushing and deaths were the     horrific consequences. The following
points which arise directly from criticisms in the film are some areas
worthy of examination


               1.   From our previous experience did we have reason
                     to anticipate the number of ticketless fans and the
                     scale of bad behaviour exhibited?

               2.   Was Leppings Lane an excessively vunerable
                    entrance?

               3-   What account did the plan take of these basic issues?

               4.   What in 1989 had changed from the previous year?

               5-   Did we do more than the previous year?

              6.    The co-related nature of preventing disorder and
                    ensuring public safety.

              7.    The limitation on our ability to be excessive in our
                    direction of people in these circumstances.

           Dear Mr Davies
           RE: FOOTBALL CLUBS - WRITTEN AGREEMENTS
           I refer to earlier correspondence concerning the "contractual" nature of
           the agreements entered into between South Yorkshire Police and the South
           Yorkshire Football Clubs in accordance with Recommendation 4 of
           Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report.
           In his Final Report at paragraph 214 Lord Justice Taylor sought to
           dispel any suggestion that the written agreements setting out the
           respective functions of the Police and Football Clubs were binding
           contracts and indicated that he was happy for the documents to be referred
           to as "statements of intent". In the circumstances may I suggest that to
           avoid any doubt as to the status of the documents entered into with the
           South Yorkshire Football Clubs the original agreements be either cancelled
           or amended so as to make it clear that they are no more than statements of
           intent. I will be happy to write the Clubs in this respect if you so
           wish.
           Yours sincerely

The Minutes of the meeting held on Tuesday 13 February 1990 which
had previously been circulated were accepted as a true and accurate
record.

18/90            MATTERS ARISING FROM THE MINUTES

18.1.            The Model Operational O rder

                 Superintendent Simpson informed members that the form
                 headed 'NOTIFICATION OF SPORTING EVENT AT A DESIGNATED
                 S T A D I U M 1 had    been      duly     amended         to cater       for  all
                 eventualities.           H o w e v e r , Chief Superintendent McNally
                 stated that           he had taken          the form to both the Fire
                 Brigade and          the Ambulance           S e r v i c e .The latter were
                 completely satisfied with it in its present format,
                 but the Fire Brigade asked for changes to be                                 made
                 in Draft Form 2, at points 8 and 10.                              After a brief
                 discussion on the matter, the Chairman indicated that
                 whilst         we  were      grateful        for       their       interest   and
                 pertinent enquiry, we were satisfied with the structure
                 and content          of the form and Draft                     Form 2 would be
                 taken into use at the start of next season.                              At this
                 point       the Chairman reminded members that this form
                 should be forwarded to the Headquarters (Operations
                 Room)        who   would       be       responsible           for    appropriate
                 circulation to the Fire and Ambulance Services.

                 Item discharged.
The Role of the Football Incident Room

In relation to previous Paragraph 13.4. which                  dealt
with match day incident logs, it was decided to                alter
Sub-Paragraph  (a) of Paragraph 3.15*3 in the                  Model
Operational Order to read 'monitor an incident                 log'.
The minutes were amended accordingly.

The  amended paragraph was accepted by all                   present
for insertion in the Model Operational Order.

Item discharged.

Football    Intelligence    - Post-Match Summaries        - Charges
to Clubs

As this was an agenda item it was             decided   to   discuss
this Issue l a t e r •in the meeting.

Item deferred.

The Final Taylor Report

Chief   Superintendent Broomhead referred to Paragraph
14.1.   of the previous minutes in which the   Chairman
had stipulated that Divisional Commanders in Sheffield
would   attend  all Advisory Group Meetings.    In the
light   of the    Chairman's recent experience at such
a meeting and the non-specific nature of much of the
agenda, would he, Chief Superintendent Broomhead asked,
be prepared to review that policy?

In  reply   the    Chairman   stated   that   once  the  full
Implications    of   the   Final Taylor     Report  had  been
carried    out    to   the    satisfaction    of   Divisional
Commanders he would be happy for Match and/or Sub-
Divisional     Commanders     to   attend    Advisory   Group
Meetings.

Item discharged.

The Final Recommendations

Recommendation            28   referred to other sports stadia,
as    opposed          to    football    grounds,   which  would   be
designated            under      the    Act.       Forcewide   Chief
Superintendent McNally reported that there are sine
such     stadia.           The    Chairman   thanked   him for   this
inf o r m a t i o n .
             Superintendent   Marsh   highlighted   Recommendation  52
             which considered the provision of a specific training
             course   for  senior   officers   acting   as  match  day
             Commanders.    He informed members that Superintendent
             Oughton was currently on such a course at the Greater
             Manchester Police Training School,        On his return,
             Superintendent   Marsh  stated   it may   be  prudent  to
             organise a Seminar on this subject, but in response
             the meeting gave no firm indication in this direction.

             Item discharged.

19/90       COMMUNICATIONS - PERSONNEL AT MATCHES

Chief Superintendent McNally introduced this item after having
previously circulated to members a paper on the subject.        The
issue in question was whether we should have on duty at each ground
a radio te chnician, capable of dealing with technical problems
arising on match d a y s .

After a prolonged discussion the Chairman summarised the position
by stating there was clearly a need f or technical expertise to
be available for consultation on match d a y s . Consequently someone
should be able to provide      that service. 16; asked       Superintendent
Marsh    to    liaise with    Superintendent Parker         (Communications
Depar tme nt ) in an effort to indicate            how this could best be
achieved,       report to the next m e e t i n g .

In relation to specific radio communications training for match
con trollers, and additional CCTV training for appropriate officers,
it was felt that there       was suf f icient knowledge and expertise
in f orce to organise our own training programme.        The Chairman
asked € M e f Superintendent McNally to evaluate this subject.

Item deferred.

20/90       CHARGES - MANPOWER COSTS

Superintendent Hale summarised the present position by reminding
members of the work undertaken by Chief Inspector Donnelly and
Inspector Jones relating to a series of formulae designed to cater
f or the recovery of manpower costs f rom all our Force F ootball
League Clubs.        In doing so he referred to a letter dated 1 February
1990 from the Deputy Chief Cons t a b l e , Mr Haye s , to the Clerk to
the South Yorkshire Police A u t h o r i t y . Briefly the letter reminded
the Authority of their acceptance in principle of the need to
review in        detail and ifnecessary re-negotiate         the basis for
recovering       the    coszs  of   providing   special   police  services.
Ad di ti on all y, the letter offered our information and expertise
gathered      during     the  research.     To  date   Superintendent  Hale
reported, there had been no reply from the A;gtfiority.
Extending the matter,   Superintendent Sleath reported great public
concern expressed at Sub-Divisional Surgeries and Divisional Review
Panels over the cost of policing football matches, whilst Chief
Superintendent Broomhead stated that at his request the Divisional
Review Panel wrote to the Authority to     ask when they were going
to review charges.    He further added that an additional part of
the equation was the impending removal      of perimeter fences and
the attendant manpower implications.

A discussion then ensued concerning the practicalities of removing
fences and standard or sliding scale charges.          Superintendent
Simpson reminded members that our charges, fixed by the Police
Authority, are based entirely on our Standing Instructions.          A
copy  of the   same was    inspected  by  the Chairman and      it was
immediately obvious that the true cost of policing football matches
in South Yorkshire was not being borne by our league c l u b s . Chief
Superintendent   Broomhead   said  that  the  contract   relative   to
manpower costs was due for renewal in August and in view of that
timescale an urgent appraisal was required.

In conclusion the Chairman stated he was due - to meet Mr Wilkinson
of the Joint Secretariat on 8 May 1990 when he would raise the
principles involved in the matter.     He asked members to prepare
a strategy for policing matches without fences.     :H b asked Chief
Sttferintehdents Broomhead and Nesbit     to meet at the earliest
poftsible convenience to formulate such a plan.

Item deferred.

21/90       STANDING INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE POLICING OF FOOTBALL
            MATCHES

Due to the absence of Superintendent       Greenwood,   this   item   was
deferred to the next meeting.

22/90       MODEL OPERATIONAL ORDER

Superintendent Simpson reiterated the amendments he had previously
undertaken in relation to the Model Operational Order. The subject
of debriefing stewards was discussed and Superintendent Simpson
suggested this could be part of a Sergeant's serial sheet rather
than in the main body of the Order, but he asked for guidance
on this m a t t e r .

A discussion took place during which the Chairman stated that
he required a standard approach accepting the various methods
of obtaining such information at each of our five grounds.    In
conclusion it was decided that the Match Commander would debrief
the Safety .Officer/Chief Steward at the climax of the game, and
that such a statement of intent would be written into the Model
Operational Order.    Additionally serial sheets would include a
request for an ongoing liaison with such persons and general
stewards, throughout the game.    This was accepted by all members
present

Finally in respect of the Order,, the Chairman asked if it would
contain anything relating to the attitude of police to away fans.
Replying         to that point, Superintendent Simpson read out an
appropriate paragraph from the Order to the satisfaction of the
C ha i r m a n .

Item discharged.

23/90        FOOTBALL INTELLIGENCE

Superintendent Marsh introduced  this topic  in the absence of
Superintendent Brookfield who is currently at the Police Staff
College, Bramshill.

Referring to Superintendent Brookfield's previous work on this
i t e m , Superintendent Marsh reminded members that h e , Superintendent
Bf&tsk field,., had :a:n^e,r,taken   ,a .review   of  national   and  local
arrangements in the production and collation of;.;:       f ootbail related
intelligence/information.          The   review   had  been   presented  by
Superintendent      Brookfield   to the    Conference   in December 1989,
but final decisions on his recommendations had been deferred until
the publication of a Home Office Circular on the s u b j e c t .        His
report      contained  17  recommendations     which  had been agreed in
principle by the former Chairman,            the Deputy Chief Constable,
Mr H a y e s .

Superintendent Marsh reported that as the Home Office Circular
had now been published it was necessary to integrate both this
and  the  recommendations outlined by Superintendent Brookf ield
in his paper.

Referring to the report, Superintendent Marsh then described each

Chairman and Conference members .

24.1.       Statements of Intent

            Assistant   Chief Constable,   Mr Davies,  informed the
            members that a meeting had taken place on 26 April
            1990 between the Secretaries and Chairman of the 5
            football clubs and the respective Divisional Ground
            Commanders.    He said that the principle of Statements
            of Intent was agreed.        Although letters had been
            forwarded to the clubs regarding the previous Written
            Agreements it was requested by the Clubs that each
            agreement   be looked  at and dealt with separately.
            M:£■ Davies asked that Chief Superintendent (Operations
            and Traffic) enquire into this-requirement.

            The topic within the Research document regarding away
            supporters   being   treated badly at football matches
            was   discussed   by   the  members.      Assistant Chief
            Constable,   Mr Davies said that supporters deserved
            to be dealt with fairly but f i r m l y .

24.3.       Football Spectators    A ct 1989

            This  item  was  introduced by  Chief  Superintendent
            McNally who informed the members that this Act was
            now in force and he briefly outlined the implications
  of   Restriction   Orders  to  South   Yorkshire  Police.
  He said that a court will impose a Restriction Order
  on a person convicted of a specified offence and the
  Clerk to    the Court will notify direct the Division
  where the    offender resides.   Mr McNally said a Draft
  General Order has been produced and will be circulated
  when approved.

  Manpower Requirements

  Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Davies then summarised
  the   implications    of  the manpower     requirements    for
  matches.       He    requested    once     more that   Chief
  Superintendents     Broomhead and    Nesbit     look  at  the
  grounds    for   the   Sheffield   Clubs    and   report  the
  iequirements    for manpower     to establish      a policing
  strategy.    With reference to the        other 3 clubs, Mr
  Davies    requested    that    reports    on    the   manning
  requirements be produced for matches .categorised into
  low,   medium    andhigh    priorities.         The   manning
  requirements can then be determined on a club basis.

                    Following the publication of th e Taylor4 Report into the Hillsborough

            Disaster, South Yorkshire Police has re-exam ined the provision of police

            services for football matches in the County, and the coat of p ro v id in g

            them.    Until now, charges have been made on a sliding s c a le , only in respect

            of police officers deployed to the ground i t s e l f , and, even then, at a

            rate which la far less than the cost to the Police A uth ority of providing,

            the services*        One of the consequences of the Taylor Report is that more

            police officers will have to be used when football matches talc© place.

r                   The p r i n c i p l e o f charging for the a tten d a n ce of police o f f i c e r s

            inside football grounds has been approved by the Court of Appeal in the

            case of Harris - v - Sheffield United Football Club, 198? 3 WLB 305*                        How­

            e v e r , that case was not concerned with the amount of the charge, n or

            did it directly concern the provision o f police officers outside the

            ground, whose attendance was necessary because of the match, since no

            charge was made at that time fo r such officers.                  I do not think that the

            decision in the Sheffield United case can be taken as any authority for

            th e proposition that special police s e r v ic e s are confined to th o se p rovid ed

            in s id e the f o o t b a ll ground,      Although th e judgment o f Borehaa J»» a t first

            in s ta n c e , was u p held , th e decision of the Court of Appeal could not con­

            stitute approval of everything which he said.                  At page 38 o f th e t r a n s c r ip t ,

            Boreham J s a id t

            " It i s accep ted that a t some f ix t u r e s v io le n c e was alm ost c e r ta in i f the

            police were n ot p resen t in s u b s t a n t ia l numbers       *    th a t was well known

            to th e club and to th e police.             It created problems in two a rea s;            fir s t,

            o u ts id e the ground, in th e p u b lic domain, where th e p o lic e gave p r o te c tio n

            a s p art of t h e ir p u b lic d u ty.     That a lo n e must have put a se v e r e strain

            on n oraal p o lic in g ,   The second area was in s id e th e ground, which was a
 private domain."

 These remarks were clearly not part of the.decision in the cist, since

 there never had been any claii for the cost of p r o v id in g police services

outside the ground, to deal with problems created by the football match

itself.       In the..Court of Appeal, N e il l LJ, a t page 31SH enumerated a

number of matters which he considered were relevant to th e q u e stio n

whether the s e r v ic e s provided were s p e c ia l p o lic e services,                   The first

of these was whether police officers were required to attend on p r iv a te

premises op in a public place,                    ft number of o th e r factors were m entioned,

and it is quite clear th a t none o f these factors was regarded a s being

conclusive.         A gain, one of the factors which he took in t o account in

that case was th a t the charges related solely to officers on duty inside

th e ground and n o t to th o se in the s t r e e t or o th e r p u b lic p la ce * o u ts id e *

it follows that the Glasbrrok case does not constitute an authority for
restricting the provision of special police services, for which a charge

may be made, to th e cost of providing policem en in s id e private premises.

Im m ediately o u ts id e the ground as being consequent upon the req u est of

the club, as that expression was interpreted in th e Sheffield United case,

it is more difficult to do this in respect of the provision of officers

some distance away from the ground.



        The Deputy Chief Constable has r a ise d a number of questions in his

letter of 25th September 1989.                in the light of the o b se r v a tio n s above,

1 would put forward th e fo llo w in g as my o p in io n o f th e e x te n t to which

the P o lic e A u th o rity may charge f o r th e p r o v isio n of p o lic e o f f i c e r s on

the o c c a s io n o f f o o t b a ll m atches.



        I t i s established beyond doubt th a t the p r o v is io n of o f f i c e r s in s id e

th e ground comes w ith in th e term " sp e c ia l p o lic e s e r v ic e s " f o r which charges

may be made.        In a d d itio n , o f f i c e r s im m ediately o u ts id e th e ground» m on itorin g

queues a t t u r n s t i l e s fo r exam ple, can reason ab ly be said to be "at th e

p rem ises" , s in c e th ey may be p a r tly on p r iv a te p ro p erty , a s in Leppings

Lane,     and a t tim es on th e p u b lic highway, as in P e n isto n e Road.               It would

be u n reason ab le to determ ine the q u e stio n whether ch a rg es cou ld be made

f o r th e atten d a n ce o f o f f i c e r s m erely by r e fe r e n c e t o th e a c c id e n t whether

th e turnstiles f r o n t d i r e c t l y on to the highway or a re sep a ra ted from it

by a fo r e c o u r t.   Furtherm ore, th e fu n c tio n they a re c a r r y in g o u t is p a r tly

to e n fo r c e th e g e n e r a l law and p a r tly to ensure th a t th e r u le s o f th e club

are m et.      I t i s a ls o a duty which i s in ten d ed to en su re th e s a f e t y of th o se

w a itin g t o g e t i t .   These p o li c e o f f i e r s are both a t th e p rem ises, in the

o rd in ary meaning o f th o se words, and are in th e l o c a l i t y ,           Furthermore,

those o f f i e r s who a re d ep loyed to d ir e c t t r a f f i c and m arshal th e a r r iv in g

fa n s on th e p u b lic road in th e immediate v i c i n i t y o f th e f o o t b a ll ground

co u ld probably come w ith in th e same d e f in it i o n .          However, th e r e must come

a p o in t a t which th e o f f i c e r s can be s a id n e ith e r to be a t th e prem ises
n or in th e l o c a l i t y pursuant to th e req u est of th e c lu b .           Those who a re
ift the streets surrounding the ground to prevent and deal with breaches

of the peace would probably be considered to be carrying out the public

police duty rather* than special police services,                      I realize that an       o ffic e r

whose job It is to marshal the arriving crowds of su p p o rters may from time

to time be c a lle d upon to prevent a breach of the p ea ce.                    However, the

same is true of officers at the turnstiles or in the ground itself.                             If,

however, the officer is d eployed not as ■ m arshal but to p a tr o l the nearby

streets to prevent disorder, even though his presence would not be necessary

if it were not for the football Hatch* he is likely to be held to be carrying
out his public duty.



        the deployment of officers to bus and rail te r m in i c r e a t e s a problem.

In some casta, the bus or rail station can be said to be in the locality

of th e f o o t b a ll ground, so th a t officers who are d ep loyed to e s c o r t supp­

o r t e r s cou ld come w ith in the d e f i n i t i o n .   In th e case o f th e two S h e f f ie ld

football grounds, it is stretching the leaning of the expression " lo c a lit y "

somewhat to refer to the main station and railway station in Sheaf S t r e e t .

However, it would be reasonable to regard Wadaley B ridge s t a t io n as being

in the locality of Hillsborough, and the escorting                      o f f i c e r s to be employed

on s p e c ia l police services.          Furthermore, i t is doubtful whether either

football club could be taken a s having req u ested e s c o r t from the main

ra ilw a y o r bus stations, s in c e th ey are not concerned w ith th e means by

which su p p o rters tr a v e l to th e match,



        I do n o t have any doubt th a t th e deployment o f a d d itio n a l o f f i c e r s

to town c e n tr e s to d ea l w ith th e th r e a t o f d is o r d e r from f o o t b a ll su p p ort­

e r s » e i t h e r b efo re or a f t e r a match i s a p u b lic du ty and cannot come w ith in

th e terms o f s e c t io n 1 5 .
            To summarize the position, th e r e fo r e , 1 take the view that th e d ep lo y-

fflffit of police officers inside the ground and im m ed iately outside it at

 the t u r n s t i l e s or supervising tht queues, even if th ey extend on to the

public highwayf would c o n s t it u t e special police services,                      Those who are

m a rsh a llin g the arriving crowds on the approach reads to the stadiuta could

also be regarded as being th e r e on the saae basis.                       Those Mho are m erely

p a t r o llin g     to prevent breaches of the peace albeit in th e same area as

those m a rsh a llin g the crowds, would probably not be regarded as provided

pursuant to section 15.               The us© of police officers as escorts from railway

and bus s t a t io n s could be argued to be a special p o li c e s e r v i c e i f the

term inus in q u estio n was s u f f i c i e n t l y c lo s e to th e ground to he a b le to

be s a id to be in th e same locality, "ffie u se of p o li c e o f f i c e r s in town

           The q u estio n Is r a is e d whether the P o lic e A u th o r ity co u ld charge

fo r th e overtim e payments made to o f f i c e r s on o r d in a r y d u ty , who a re having

I t must be observed th a t the judgm ents in th e S h e f f ie l d U n ited c a se c le a r ly

contem plated the payment of overtim e m b ein g a f a c t o r which was r e le v a n t,

but th e r e fe r e n c e s to o v ertim e were concerned w ith o f f i c e r s who were ca rry in g

o u t special p o lic e s e r v i c e s .    P r o v isio n may, how ever, in my v ie w , be made

a p p lic a b le to a l l o c c a s io n s upon which s p e c ia l p o l i c e s e r v i c e s a re req u ested .

15 to c a lc u la t e the ch a rg es on a match by match b a s i s , e x c e p t by r e fe r e n c e

whether a football match, a pop concert or any other event a t which

special police             services are provided.          The          seals itselfand the amount

charged at any             one point in the scale are m a tters which are to be determ ined

by the Police Authority,                The Police Authority's decision could be questioned

in judicial review proceedings, only if the scale or the charges were so

unreasonable as to be such th a t no reason ab le p o lic e a u th o r ity could have

made them,           This is th e so c a lle d "Wednesbury" p r in c ip le , which a p p lie s

g e n e r a lly in public law,          I ta k e the view th a t i t would n o t be unreasonable

     Dear
    RE: GROUND SAFETY CERTIFICATES - SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
     I called for a copy of the Safety Certificate issued in respect of the Oakwell
     Ground, Barnsley, in connection with our deliberations last week and I am
     surprised to find that the condition relating to the policing of matches
     contained therein, Condition 28, provides for the number of officers attending
     matches to be agreed between the Chief Constable and the Club.
     This condition is contrary to the provisions of Section 2 (2A) of the 1975 Act
     introduced by Section 21 of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sports Act
     1987 which require that a condition in a safety certificate for the provision of
     the services of members of a police force at a specified activity reserves the
     extent of the provision of the services for the determination of the chief
     officer of police alone. The provisions of Section 2 (2A) were drawn to the
     attention of the local authorities when it was introduced in 1987 and I have a
     letter on file from Barnsley M.B.C. advising that the appropriate amendments
     were to be made to the Oakwell certificate. I now propose to write them with a
     view to having the error corrected and would suggest that the other ground
     safety certificates be checked to confirm that they do not contain similar
     errors.

     Yours sincerely,

                                                                      0     Ir jX U /

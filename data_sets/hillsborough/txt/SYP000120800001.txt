           public disorder          or damage to property.      I remained at this    location

           until 3pm (1500).            Whilst there    I saw numerous fans drinking and

           carrying cans of beer,several            numbers sat on. the wall    of the

           Travellers public house to finish off their drinks before                 reaching

           a radio message was            received that assistance was required at the

           Leppings Lane entrance.             We made our way there and arrival we were

           told to form a cordon across the entrance to prevent any more fans

           entering the ground.             We had been stood there a short time when fans

           started coming out of the ground.               I heard one say "YOU'D BETTER GET

           IN THERE T H E R E ’S PEOPLE INJURED” .

         Dear Sirs,

         Re; RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


          If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
          on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
          due course.

          I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal investigation which, you will recollect is not adversarial but
          inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

          Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
          to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
          appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
          consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
          attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
          names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
          to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

          I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
          Qiihm i'K

          You^s ffithfully

                 RE:     Gary_Philip_Jones_Deceased_No_1_86


                 We refer to your Inquest into the above named who is one of the victims
                 of the Hillsborough Disaster.

                 Gary's parents have asked us to write to you to enquire whether in the
                 report from the Pathologist there is any reference to tests being taken
                 as to any traces of alcohol in the bloodstream and if such tests were
                 taken what was the outcome of such tests.

                 We look forward to hearing from you.

                 Yours faithfully                      l\

                  Dear Sir,

                  Re:__Gary Philip Jones (Deceased)

                      Thank you for your letter of 18th October.

                  We ourselves do not have a statement from Mr Hunter, our Clients were merely
                  provided with information by the County Fire Service of Mr Hunter's involve­
                  ment. We do not therefore know whether he has already made a statement to
                  the Police with regard to the matter, but if not, no doubt you will make
                  arrangements for a statement to be obtained.

                  Yours faithfully,
                         ___________ V                              \\___________________

                      Dear Sirs,

                      Re; Gary Philip Jones (deceased)_____ No. 86

                      We refer to the Inquest in the death of the above named at the Hillsborough
                      tragedy. Our clients have recently received information from the South
                      Yorkshire County Fire Service that one of their officers, a Mr.
                      attended to their son on the ground. Our clients very much appreciated
                      receiving further information as to what exactly happened to their son and if
                      you have not already been provided with details of the Officer's involvement
                      you may wish to obtain a Statement from him in connection with the Inquest
                      into Gary's death.

                      Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs,

Res         CAST PHILIP JKSBC (d e c e a s e d ) H o.6 6 .

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not- to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M.Coroner.

Bear Mr* Dawson,

B M GARY PHILIP JOKBS.

Ihank you for your letter of the 25th of May. I am very sorry
indeed to read the third paragraph of your letter.

We are still w r y actively trying to sort out the details as
to what happened to many of the deoeased at Hillsborough and
unfortunately I am not yet in a position to give you any detailed
information regarding Gary.

The present cause of death on the post mortem report is given ass-

              la.   Crush Asphyxia.

              2.    Inhalation of stomach contents.

You will appreciate that you must treat this causd of death
as provisional until formal evidence of the cause of death
has been given at the Inquest.

I hope this will help your clients a little.

Tours sincerely,

                      Dear Dr. Popper,



                      Re:- Gary Philip Jones


                      We are acting on behalf of the parents of the Family of Gary Philip                                                           Jones
                      who was one of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster on the
                      15th April, 1989.

                      An Interim Certificate was issued on the 20th April, 1989.

                      The Family are particularly concerned to know so far as is possible how
                      and when Gary died . Gary was seen on television getting over the
                      barrier, taking a few steps on the pitch and then collapsing. His
                      Cousin Paul Brennan who was with him at the time observed him being
                      taken into an ambulance, but, the family have no information as to whether
                      he was alive at that time.

                      The Family would therefore be most grateful to learn whether any further
                      information can be provided with regard to Gary and in particular whether
                      it may now be possible to indicate the medical cause of death.


                      Yours sincerely,

                                     We refer to previous correspondence that we have had with your office
                                     with regard to the inquest in the above named, and in particular to
                                     our letter to you of 16th May 1990 when we asked to be supplied with
                                     copies of two photographs and which reference had been made at the
                                     inquest. You indicated that these could not be made available until
                                     the conclusion of the inquest.

                                     In view of the fact that that stage has now been reached could we
                                     please now ask for copies of these photographs to be provided to us.

Dear Sirs,

Re* GARY PHILIP JONES (deceased) HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


Thank you for your letter of 2nd August 1990.

the West Midlands Police.  We are not prepared to release

Yours faithfully.

                       Dear Sir

                       R E: Gary Philip Jones (Deceased) - Hillsborough Disaster

                       We refer to our letter of 16 May 1990 in which we requested
                       a set of depositions which have now been provided.

                       We did also ask for copies of the 2 photographs to which
                       reference was made at the inquest, and which were numbered
                       PR3/29A and MJN/55.

                       Could we please ask whether copies can now be made available
                       to us .

                       Yours faithfully                         ^

Dear Mervyn,

Re: GARY PHILIP JOKES (deceased’) Mo.86.

You will recollect that we had a letter from Morecroft Dawson
& Garnett regarding the above in which they suggested that a Mr.
          nf the Yorkshire Fire Service had been involved
with the above deceased. You have already supplied me
with a copy of Mr. Hunter’s statement Ho.83001.

lofttowing that, I wrote to Morecroft & Dawson and asked
them to let us have any evidence which they had from Mr.
        and they replied in fact on the 23rd of October
(I am sorry this was not forwarded to you sooner) in
terms that they had merely received this information, and
that if we did not have a statement po doubt we would be
obtaining it.
I cannot quite understand what is going on, because Mr.
         1tatmi|>aT>'fc aakes no reference whatever to his
involvement with any individual. I wonder whether it
might be worth checking out what if anything he did say
to Gary's family.

Xn order to assist, X enclose photocopies of the letter of
the 26th of September 1989, 18th of October 1989 and 23rd of
October 1989.

Yours sincerely,


 S.L.Popper,

    Dear Sir

    RE GARY PHILIP JONES

    With reference to your letter dated 8.5.89 concerning the above named I can
    confirm that the originally described sighting cf this man climbing the f^nce
    in the ground was not a correct identificar.iun.

    The family have since been shown further visual evidence and have nov actually
    identified Gary Philip Jones on the terracing alive.

    We have confirmsd that death was certified by Dr Docre at the Northern General
    Hospital between 1545 and 1600 hours on 15 April 1989,

    Yours faithfully

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sjfcth concerning the release of the deceased persons from
t^^Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Prbfessor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

FILE NOTE - TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. DAWSON 8.6.89.
HE M LETTER OF THE TL.5.89 and HIS OH THE 25TH.




I asked him whether he had passed the information aito the
family yet.   He said he had.   I explained to him that I
had been thinking about it further and that it mightwell
be that the pathologist would want tomake a change, in
the light of the additional information.
Ur. Dawson said that he had heard, or      the family had      heardvia
a Social Worker that Gary had gone tohospital, and that he
had died at 4*20, but that they understood that the final
versinns of everything and the fine tuning would have to be
done at the Inquests.

 WILL SAY as follows;-


 I am over the age of 21 years.


 Until some time in 1988 Philip and Maureenjones lived near to us,
 and their son Cary was friendly with my twin sons, David and
 Matthew, and Gary came to our house quite frequently, even after
 the family had moved to Maghull.


 On Saturday,   15th April 19B9, I went to the Hillsborough Stadium
 m   Sheffield with my son Matthew to see the Liverpool -v-
 Nottingham Forrest match.  I drove over in my oar.                   We both had
 seats in the stands at the Leppings lane end.


 At about 2.05 prn we were 200 yards from the ground.                 I saw Gary
 Jones walking towards the ground.                 There was a group of people
 walking to the ground but I do not know whether Gary was part of
 the group.


oary stopped to talk with us briefly, and said that he was making
nis way to the ground, and asked which part of the ground we were
m.    He then carried on his way, walking towards the ground.                  We
Knew that hew as in the standing section and I believe that he
was going to the ground at that time so as to be able to get a
good position.

then purchased the ticket.   He did this several days before the

I, PHILIP JAMES JONES, of
say as follows:-


I am the father of Gary Philip Jones.   Gary was a season ticket
holder for Liverpool Football Club for the seasons 1987/88 and
1988/89.   To obtain a ticket for the F A Cup Semi-Final he had to
produce a voucher at the ground of Liverpool Football Club and he
then purchased the ticket.   He did this several days before the
date of the match and he displayed the ticket on top of the
television set in our lounge until the Saturday morning of the
game.   I saw him pick up the ticket on the Saturday morning
immediately before he left for the game.
                                    P Jones        11 April 1990

SIGNED by the above-named Philip James Jones
in the presence of R H Dawson, Solicitor, Liverpool.

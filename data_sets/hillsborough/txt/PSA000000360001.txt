           INCIDENT COVENTRY CITY v LEEDS UNITED, HIGHFIELD
SUBJECT                                                        DATE       27 September 1994
           ROAD STADIUM, SATURDAY 17 SEPTEMBER 1994




           We are writing to advise you of an incident which occurred during the half time
           interval at the football match between, Coventry City and Leeds United at the
           Highfield Road stadium on Saturday 17 September 1994.

           On this occasion Chief Superintendent Peter Clay was the match commander, and
           Superintendent Bromwich was responsible for the policing arrangements inside
           the ground.

           The incident occurred in the visitors’ section of the North stand at the
           Highfield Road stadium which on the day in question was occupied by 3,535 Leeds
           United supporters. The Leeds supporters were divided between the upper and
           lower tiers, and it is estimated that on this occasion the upper tier was
           almost full to capacity.

           When the half time whistle blew, several hundred away supporters left their
           seats in the top tier of the stand to use the toilet facilities. Very quickly
           a queue formed, blocking both the entrance and exit, which in turn caused a
           crush both inside the toilet area and outside on the concourse between the
           upper and lower tiers.

           This overcrowding situation was quickly noticed by Chief Supt Clay, and the
           ground safety officer[            from their positions in the new control
           room. This early notification of the incident resulted in emergency exit gates
           in the vicinity being opened at the joint direction of Chief Supt Clay and
                      and announcements broadcast over the loudspeaker system advising
           spectators in that part of the ground to return to or remain in their seats.
           These actions, combined with intervention by police officers and stewards,
           quickly resulted in the problem being brought under control.

           During the incident, injuries were caused to four police officers, including
                           who received bruising to the back of his legs as a result of
           being kicked by the Leeds supporters. Also injured was Police Constable
                       ]of the West Midlands Police, who received bruising to the soft
           tissue surrounding both knees and the back of his left leg, again as a result
           o f being kicked by the Leeds United supporters. The other two police officers
           injured were Police Constables                and                   of the West
           Yorkshire Police who travelled with the Leeds supporters in tneir role as



                                                              Cont ..... 12

intelligence spotters. Both of these officers, in assisting to deal with the
problem of overcrowding, received injuries as a result of crush. P C |
received a torn ligament in his right arm, slight crush injuries to his chest
area which resulted in his blood pressure fluctuating. PC              received
heavy bruising/soft tissue injury to the base of his spine and lower back.

On making enquiries with West Yorkshire Police as to the condition of their
officers, I was advised that both had consulted with their Federation with a
view to possible civil action against Coventry City FC. In view of this, you
may consider it prudent that the incident and the involvement of Chief
Superintendent Clay and Superintendent Bromwich in the policing of the match in
question are brought to the attention of the Association’s insurers.

It is considered highly unlikely that either Chief Supt Clay or Supt Bromwich
would become involved in anv civil action bought by the West Yorkshire
officers, but it is nevertheless a sensible precaution to notify our insurers
of the remote possibility.

Attached for information is a copy of the telex message sent immediately after
the incident which summarises the situation, together -with a copy of the
football order for the match that day.

Included with the football order is a statement of intent signed by both Chief
Supt Peter Clay and a representative of the Football Club in which it is
clearly identified that responsibility for safety in the ground rests with the
Club.

Should you or the Association or the insurers require any further information
we will be pleased to supply it.

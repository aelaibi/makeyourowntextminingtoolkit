            Further to my previous statement, and in order                     clarify some of the

            detail        I wish to point out the following.

            At no time did I go to the Northern General Hospital.    My first
                                              1*3-0  /
            contact with the deceased David Brady (#ody No 8 4 ) was when he was

            brought to the gymnasium by the Mortuary a t t e n d a n t , from the hospital
                      *+ & %          /
                                    ^/lt was he that told me that a doctor had certified death

            at the hospital.                   I then stayed with the body until    it was removed to

            the Medico Legal Centre.                   I accompanied
                                                                 L<~ fl the body to the Medico Legal

            Centre and identified it to DC W e y g o 1d of the South Yorkshire Police,

            When I refer to Dr Poore as^/examining Brady and certifying death,                       I

            believe that this was done at the Sheffield football                     club gymnasium.

            I only got this information second hand, as I was not present when

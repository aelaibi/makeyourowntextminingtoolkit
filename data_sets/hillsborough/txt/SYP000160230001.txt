POLICE COMPLAINT 16/89

This was an allegation made by a Liverpool Supporter who saw an unknown youth climb and
become stuck at the top of the fence dividing Pen 7 on Leppings Lane terraces and the
North Stand seating area. The complaint contained two elements:

   •   That the officer used unnecessary force on the youth on the fence by yanking him off
       the fence causing him to fall to the ground and possibly lose consciousness
   •   The officer failed to assist the youth who may have been injured.

West Midlands Police secured a statement from the complainant. He did not wish his son to
provide evidence.

During the investigation by West Midlands Police the police constable involved in the
incident was identified, the youth involved was not. Two further witnesses and three police
officers were identified through searching documents collated as a result of the events of
that day. Their statements were examined.

The Investigating officer established that the Football Club regulations reserved the right for
its servants and agents to remove from the ground any person who does not comply with
Ground Regulations.

The police constable involved was criminally interviewed and denied the alleged assault
stating that the youth was actually falling from the fence when he got hold of him.

The officer stated that he went to seek medical assistance for the youth but then returned to
find another officer dealing with him.

OUTCOME

The youth himself did not come forward and no complaint of assault was received.

The complaint file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for a decision. It
was decided by the DPP that the evidence did not justify criminal proceedings.

The matter was then referred to the Police Complaints Authority who decided that the
complaint was unsubstantiated.

The complainant was informed in writing of this decision.

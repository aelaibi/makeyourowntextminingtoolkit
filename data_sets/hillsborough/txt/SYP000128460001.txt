Division would be required to mount a similar operation to the one

mounted in 1988 (000088) when                                                       (excluding traffic         points        in D Division)

2 0 u ine n were use d .



I discussed the matter with A/Superintendent KING who told me to begin

planning our operation based on the 1988 (0G0088)                                                               operation.         After

that meeting                            1 consulted the sub divisional                                  duty cooks and realises

that it would be difficult to raise the manpower wnolly from D

Division officers due to annual                                                          leave and courses.



On 22 March 1989 (220389) myself,                                                            PS ___________   and PC 916 BRADLEY

Yorkshire Transport and other organisations.                                    Chief Superintendent

MOLt. chaired the meeting.                    Basically          the outcome of that meeting was

that the D Division commitment would                             be the same as in 1988                 (000088)

At the meeting           I arranged further meetings with South Yorkshire

Transport,        British Transport Police, British Rail and Road Traffic,



On 23 March         1989 (230389) myself and PC 916 BRADLEY attended the first

of several meetings we were to have with Road Traffic to discuss the

traffic      policing        in D Division.             It was agreed that               Inspector SCHOLEY

would draw up the traffic operations order and that affected divisions

would "second” officers to traffic on 15                                 April 1989 (130489).               It       was

estimated that traffic would require 30+ D Division                                     Constables on                13

April     1989 (150489).



i discussed the developments with A/Superintendent KING and informed

him of the         requirement to supply 30+ Constables to traffic addition to

the 200 we would probably need in D Division for our operation.                                                  1

also    informed him that              raising the total              in house was proving

 i f t i cu 1 C anu iri'31 ca n ce x xa*>xon of w L ;lii r i               be     i-eoux teu«          It was

decided at that point -- 28 March 1989 (2S0389)                                   ~ to ask D Division to

supply volunteers              to work on WL as an alternative to cancellation.

The request was circulated and produced more officers.



I had several meetings with Inspector MA3B0TT of the British Transport

Police and also with staff from British Rail.                                    The meetings took place
in the offices and platforms at Midland Station.                                 The outcome was that

deal with the influx of fans at the station except that                                      Inspector

MA880TT initially declined to have his men segregating Liverpool                                                 fans

the fans on the platforms.                  This     contradicted our order but the new

information was given at D Division briefing on 13 April                                      19895

(150489).



               ________________ |of South Yorkshire Transport who told me
I also met fir |

that last year a fleet of 33 buses transported fans to and

from Midland citation.              On the outward trip 41 full                       loads of Nottingham

supporters were           carried and 11 full            loads of Liverpool                 fans were

loads.      The outward figures showed that approximately 4160 fans had

been taken to the ground and that 3600 had returned.,                                      (It is not

that 10 had managed a return trip on the return leg.



South Yorkshire Transport                regularly transport fans to SWFC from the

Midland Station.            Police escorts are always                 requested and it is

usual    to deploy two officers to a full bus.                          This was discussed with

Sheffield Midland for a '!return load1'.                        it was noped that               this wouxd

                                                                                           PA HP


officers would be required for PSV es co rt s.



On 29 March      1989 (290389)        I received a request from PC SOS ROSEVEAR

(HO Ops)     for D rnanpowe r to work at SWF C on 15 April                 1989 (lb 04 89) «

After speaking with A/Superitendent KING I informed PC ROSEVEAR that

it would not be possible for D Division to supply any staff as ws were

having difficulty raising manpower for our                    in house needs on the day.



On the 4 April        1989 (040489) Road Traffic             requested 35 Constables and

4 Traffic wardens from D Division.                  They were to report at Brightside

Lane fay 0800      (04500) on the 15 April          1989 ( 15G‘’tejV) »    1 subsequently

war \\ci 33 ui 1'i ce r s who were all I)cf. Co ns ^a d 1e s



Also by 4 April        1989 (04048V.)      I informed A/Su pe r int encle tvc KING tnat

cancellation of WL was then needed as we were still                        some 40 officers

short.      He consulted with Chief Superintendent 8R00MHEAD and WL on 15

April    (150489) was cancelled for D Division officers on that day.



A 11 D u i v is io n s ta f f • w x t h t ew e c e p I-1 o n s — w e r e n ow in c iu a e d in t n &

planning.      Court staff,       Charge Office staff,           CID Aides and some

administrative officers had been included.                     Cancellation of WL raised

most of the shortfall           but we were obliged to go to PC 808 ROSEVEAR for

17 officers.        Most of these were Detectives who worked in uniform for

the clay.     Given "Cinat they were         "strangers" none were eventually

deployed other than on PSV escort duties.



On 5 April      198 v (O50489)      I had a meeting with A/Supe rinCendenu m ir-nG.

I told him that        I had raised enough manpower for the operation

envisaged whicn would take             in public order        patrols on 14 and 15 April

(140489)     (150489),     patrols     in Pond Street and PSV escorts on 15

April    1989 (150489).               One problem was that we had a surfeit of

Sergeants and it- was decided that two per PSV serial wou 1ci foe

allocated as the important factor was that each PSV have two officers.

At that point allocation of responsibility for the                                     *D’ Division

On or around the r> April                 1989    (03U4oV)        1 contacted ins pec tor St WELL at

FI and confirmed the unloading points for the P S V s .                                  I also      informed

him that the escort serials would                           amount to 110+ and that                 they were

available as a reserve during the                           match itself. He told                  me to have

them report to the Gymnasium at SWFC and that they would be given a

hot meal after half time.                    I noted the information for inclusion in

the draft D Division order.                      PC 916 BRADLEY sent a Gen 2 containing

By this     time serial           make    up and deployment             had been decided.               We had

also made       requests      for the a ttendance               of moun t e d    officers,          dog section

staff and a r r a n g e d     for a Brimac           vehicle       to be on standby.                It was

apparent      that we would need, extra vehicles and                          requests        for    these were

made    through H(3 iraff ic fianagement«                     Also    requests         for   radios ana

              My day began in Headquarters at 08 CO hours,,          From there we transported

              some radio equipment to Hi 11sb o ro u gh , this being spare equipment to be

              left in the Police Control Room.            On completion of taking this

              equipment   into the control   room,    I    attended the briefing.    On

              completion of the briefing     1 remained in the area of the gy m nas ium ,

              where the issue of the radios was being           conducted.    My responsibility

              on the day was to make myself available           in case of communication

              problems.      I was in possession of a radio with an ear receiver for the

              whole duration of the day.

              At around   1400 hours I began to hear the radio breaking up.               At first

a ground to ground radio facility,                                       so one radio can communicate to

another              radio.        Therefore             I switched the spare              ’ B a se      S t a t i o n ’ to          "talk

The spare              "Base Station*               was situate on the floor underneath the

bench.               The box containing the spare                             ’Base S t a t i o n ’ has a physical

size of 2 7 “x 1 1 !1x                1 1 ”    high by 11 inches deep,                   the mains             lead and

and aerial              lead are only of sufficient                             length to connect to

the spare              "Base S t a t i o n 1
                                           ’ in situ and therefore                         I was unable to place

it on top of the Control Room bench.                                          This in turn meant that the

first mi c/ hand                   p h o n e   , which is connected by a curly                           le a d ,      o n ly       just

cams about the level of the bench and the operator was obliged to bend

down to use it.                     The loud speaker to the spare                          ‘Base Station*                    is

incorporated into the set and therefore reception was at floor                                                                  level,,

A hand held              M o to r o la         personal        radio was therefore used fay the operator

This enabled him to stand upright to transmit,                                             the reception was via

the loud speaker                     in the hand held radio itself and it gave the

control              room equal opportunity for transmission.

The time was now about                           1448 hours.              After     checking the system was

            William Roy PEMBERTON No 65,    I wish to add further details.

            I remember finding Mr PEMBERTON       lying on the pitch on the left of the

            goal as you look from the pitch towards Leppings Lane.                     There was no

            one with Mr PEMBERTON and 1 was assisted b y unknown fans to place him

            on advertising hoardings.     He appeared to be dead,              I am not sure if I

            tried to resuscitate him.

            Mr PEMBERTON was placed on the hoarding and together with unknown fans

            I helped to carry him across the pitch, and he was                 left outside the

            gym on the hoarding    I was then told to take charge of another body and

            I did not have any further dealings with Mr PEMBERTON.

            Prior to carrying Mr PEMBERTON across the pitch 1 tried to revive two

            casualties?   one of these?   I covered over with my tunic when I
                                                                                 PAGE.


            realised he was dead.     This    person was dealt wi   jy PC Paul GRANT '£33

            who found my tunic on the body.

                ACCOUNT' OF HILLSBOROUGH INC IDENT 15 .4 .89 (150489 )

                On 15 April        1989 (150489),            I was attached to the South Yorkshire

                Police?    D Division Crime and Vandal Squad.                          On this date    1 started my

                tour of duty at 12.00 noon (1200)., at Atter c 1 iffe Police Station,

                wh i two rIh Lans,        She f f ie I d »

                At   12,.30 pm (1230),          in company with other members of the crime and

                vandal    squad,      I attended at the Midland Station,                     Sheffield,    where    I

                helped supervise the arrival,                  and dispersal            to buses,   of football     fan

                who were attending the F A Cup Semi final at Hillsborough,                                between

                No 11 i ngham F orest and i...iver poo 1.

                while engaged in this operation I noticed that many of the fans were

                clearly in drink,              I had occasion to advise one fan to dispose of a

                number of cans of lager he was carrying,                             before he boarded the bus to

At i .45 pm (13455? together with other members of my unit,                                             I engaged

in a transit                      patrol of Sheffield City Centre.

At 1.55 pm,                     (1355), we attended             at Scotland Street, Sheffield,                where

we prevented a large group of Nottingham Forest                                         fans from entering a

public house                      called R and 8 *s .          They were directed towards Penistone

Road.                      we then escorted a large number of f a n s T on foot,                    towards the

Wellington,                     which is situated in Penistone                 Road. A large number of

Nottingham Forest fans were                             required to leave the premises.                   Many were

clearly the worse                         for drink.

A number of empty                         buses were summoned to the area and the                      fans from

the Wellington,                       along with others were conveyed to the ground on them,

under escort.                        I travelled to        the ground on one bus along                 with PC 2582

HEWSON.                      A number     of the fans on the bus were rowdy throughout                        the

journey.                      Many were drunk.

At 2«20 piTi ( 1420) , the bus I was t rav e 1 j . x ng on arrived at                                 ^ne ground,

near to the Spion Hop Stand.                               A short time after my arrival                 I was

outside the Spion Kop was very quiet.

At 3. 1u prn % l!oiu) , .1 was sat in our transit van when 1 heard the

following message over my personal                                 radio from PS 1379 CLEMENT

Moments            later our serial was ordered inside the ground,                  W© were

ordered to form a cordon along with approximately 100-150 other

officers,                in front of the North Stand,

While        I was stood there I saw hundreds of people on the pitch in front

of the Leppings Lane Stand.                    While we were stood in the cordon,             for

approximately five minutes,                   I saw a number of injured fans being

At 3.15 pm (1515),                all the officers      in the cordon were recalled to the

rear of the Spi on Kop.                 Shortly af t e r this i nj ured people started t o

arrive            in numbers.      In company with PC 2336 DICKENS I then went onto

the pitch and assisted in conveying                     injured fans to the rear of the

stand and to the ambulances.

Some time                later we resumed to a foot patrol         in Penistone Road,         We

attended in Hillsborough Park,                    near to the football        ground, where we

dispersed a group of rival fans who were                       involved in a running fight.

At 5.45 pm (174-5), our unit resumed to West Bar Police Station,

       On the fourth day of the proceedings Mr Noel Bume gave orat evidence on a considerable
       number of points concerning the layout and structures at the Leppings Lane end of the
       Hillsborough Stadium. Some of these had been covered in Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report
       to a greater or lesser exten t One point in particular that I do not believe was considered by
       Lord Justice Taylor, nor by the Inquests, was the height of the crush barriers in pens 3 and 4 of
       the Leppings Lane Terraces The recommended height of the top rails of the crush barriers from
       the nose o f the step immediately behind the barrier is 1.02 metres to 1.12 metres (between 3 feet
       4 inches and 3 feet 8 inches). Mr Bume found that the majority of barriers in pens 3 and 4 were
       below this height in pen 3, barriers 124a, 125, 136 and 136a were below the recommended
       height, whilst in pen 4 it was barriers 125, 127, 128 137 and 138. I have illustrated this on plan
        C 275 (a copy of which you have) by appropriately numbering all the barriers and high-lighting
         jiose below height. Mr Bume's ora! evidence does not give an actual height for the various
       K carriers apart from 124a, which varied from .93 to 86 of a metre along its length (approximately
        2 feet 10 inches) and was the lowest barrier on the ten-ace. His report is said to contain a table
        of the heights of all the barriers.

        Mr Burne then went on to describe the consequences of the barriers being below the
        recommended height and this is made d e a r on pages 6 9 and 70 of the transcript of his evidence,
        without my repeating it here. It was immediately following this that the proceedings were halted
        and subsequent agreement reached between the parties

        I am unable to find reference to the height of the barriers in the Taylor Report, nor do I believe it
        to have been an issue at the Inquests, i would therefore wish to bring to the attention of
        Lord Justice Stuart-Smith the existence of Mr Noel Bume’s report and for its contents to be
        considered as part of the Scrutiny being conducted by him. I believe you will be able to obtain a
        copy of the report from Mr Peter Metcalf, solicitor of Hammond Suddards, Leeds.

        I have briefed my Assistant Chief Constable, Ian Daines, on the above and made the
        Chief Constable, Richard Wells, aware. Both are in agreement with my writing to bring this
        matter to attention.

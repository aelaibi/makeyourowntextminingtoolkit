 I,   ___________                               of                                       Huyton,
                                                                                                 *




Liverpool,                     WILL SAY AS FOLLOWS



I was born on the                                       and am aged 18.



On Saturday          15th April I travelled to the Liverpool                         fixture at

Hillsborough with my cousin,                                          |.    We    travelled     by

coach and arrived at the ground at approximately 12.45 p.m.                                     We

had no problem getting to the ground,                         the coach dropped us off

at the road at the side of the ground.                         The coach was a private

tour organised by Amerbline.                    We went out for something                  to eat

and about* 2.15 p.m. went back to the ground.                              We were queueing

for about           10 minutes.        There    was     a terrific crush outside                to

get in.         There were police about               on horseback but             they didn't

seem to be doing            very much.          The main      police attention             seemed

to    be     frisking       people     going     into     the        ground.        They      were

frisking everybody             that went in and this in my opinion is what

caused the backlog.             You do from time to time get shoved about

going into          football matches but             this was    far worse and it was

frightening          even   outside      the     ground.         We     were      frisked     and

finally got into the ground at about 2.20/2.25 p.m.



When I got in I stood and read my programme as there was plenty

of    room    around     me.      We    were     standing       in    the       middle   of   the

terrace      although       there      was     plenty    of    room        in    front   of   us.
Until about             2.55    p.m.    people       were     just coming          in no r m a l l y   and

standing       around.           At    about     2.55        p.m.   there was        a surge      and        I
                                                                                                         i




was    pushed       from where          I was     standing half way back                    up   to     th£

front.       It wasn't like a normal game where you would be pushed

forward        and       then     would        get     back         again     to     your     original

position,          it    was    just     forward       all      the    time    and     I was     pushed

right       through       to    the    front     and     squashed        against       the     railing.

Between me and the railing there was a little girl of about                                              10

years old who was                screaming.           I couldn't do anything as                    I was

being       squashed       from behind           and    I couldn't breathe.                   About      10

policemen          walked       past    and ignored her               screams until one            alert

policeman          came back and              told us        to push back to let her                   out.

It    was    impossible           to    do     that     and     I     don't    know      whether        she
               >

managed to get out or whether she is alive or dead.                                           I saw one
                                                         i




lad jumping             over.-the -fence-and f e l t .that - it-^was every manj£or

himself.           I climbed up on the fence which had large spikes and

caught my nose on a spike.                       I then had to bend the spikes down

with my hands to climb over,                      which I did.              A policeman grabbed

hold of        me    and       said    "Get    into     the other        side".         And    threw me

into     the       side paddock which was                    empty.     The game went            on     for

about another 4 minutes and a policeman came past,                                          I screamed

at her that there were people getting crushed and she turned to

me and said "You're all just hooligans".



I was stood in the paddock for about half an hour and could see

them passing bodies down over heads.                                 It seemed to be from the

back and           I assumed it was             from the        tunnel.        All     I was     worried
   ^out     was ray cousin from whom I was ,eperated when , gQt

  down to the front.                 I didn't know whether he was dead or alive.

  The last        time I had seen him he was crushed against                                  the fence

  with his        arms    in    front      of    him    pushed    into       the    fence.        After

  about half an hour I heard my name called out and saw it was my

  cousin.         He     was    at    the       other    side     of    what       had       become     an

  alleyway between             the crushed paddock and the paddock I was in.

  By this time there was about a thousand people on the pitch but

  the crush was still horrific.                        I shouted at some            lads who had

 just come over and were in the alleyway to pull him over, which

  they did       and we        then both went           onto    the    pitch.        There was          a

 girl     lying    on    the     floor,      shaking      and    screaming.              I    tried    to

 calm her       down and        then a      St Johns         ambulanceman came                and took
 over




 I can    only     assume       that -the crush           occurred       because         the     gates

 were opened.           I still       to   this   day    don't     know h o w you got into

 the side paddocks which were empty as when you went through the

 turnstile all you saw in front of you was                             the one tunnel which
led into the crushed section.



Since the event,          my nose is sore and I think it may be broken.

I am    going     to go        to    the    doctor's      today.         I   have       been     very

nervous    and    last     Saturday         I went      to a     nightclub         in        the City

centre.     Coming out          there was a bit of a crush and it brought

everything      back     and    I    was    upset.       I     have    had    several         dreams
about the event.

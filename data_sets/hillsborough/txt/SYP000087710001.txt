                I am a Liverpool          football      cluo supporter and have been for a number                            of

                the evening       of April      14th 1989       (140489)        we    in fact   travelled to

started       off to the semi          final     in Sheffield.          We    never    really

e n c o u n te re d any traffic        problems        enroute    but vhen we we re not

t ravelli ng      the usual       d ir ec tionslo      the game.        We arri ve d     in the

o utskirt s     of S h e f fi el d at about         1^45 pm      ( 1 3 4 5 ) and a ct ua ll y    parked our

car on a Trading Estate about 5 minutes walk                            from the ground.               We went

a n d found a snack            bar and had a cup of tea and a sandwich.                          From where

we were we        could see the         pylons      of the ground and the              crowd was all

h eading      in that direction.            It was a nice          day and      there was        no trouble

at all.        A lt ho ug h    I did see a number          of    parked      coaches    they were

either       empty or unloading           in an orderly manner and did not                      require a

police       escort.     There was        no drunkeness          to my knowledge and the only

lads    I saw drinking were             four     lads sitting        on a wall        drinking        cans of

beer,    in fact       they     recognised me and w a ve d across.                My wife        had

earlier       been into a sweet           shop and bought some               sweets and     it was

obvious       from the        pieasant attitude         of the staff         that there had been no

trouble       from the fans.

were    no    recognisable        queues.        The    best way of describing            it was

just         seething mass        of humanity.        Tfais was at about    £ .2 0 (142Q)                 —

have    for many years           grown used to the           idea of large         crowds at Anfi el d

any such        control      at H i l l s b o r o u g h by the S o ut h Y or kshire Police               to even

to have any hope of                reachi m 3 the turnstiles           it was       necessary to become

part of the seething mass and                       presume that you would be swept                     in the

into the ground and                it was a very u npleasant               15 minutes.           I handed my

ticket     to the        collector       in the      turnstile     box and headed towards                 the

N o r th s t ^ i d ,    At   no time did I see any gates other than the turnstiles

opened.         I did see 3 young             lads    climb up on top of the gate                    on the

left of the North stand turnstiles,                         but whe n they got to the top for

some    reason they climbed               back down a g ai n to our side.                  Once      through

the    turn stiles        I stop pe d to buy a programme and then went                           directly       to

of the tunnel           entrance.        At    no time did       I witness any disorder                 or

was    ivs^as     quite a pp arent         the isUf f erence       in the     c rowds at e i the r end,

The Forest        end a ll seemed to be               in order and         calm with       little movement:

o b v i o us ly due to the          fac\t that the fans had plenty of room,                          whereas

the Lapp ings Ln end was                cn^otic and very uncomfortable.                         I actually

c o mmente d to my wife about                 the    crowds at    the Liverpool            end but

b e lieved that         it would sort          itself out,       having      been    in man y        crush

of the mat\h«            There was        continual        movement    of t n K crowd           in those      pens

d ir e c t l y behiS^l the Liverpool                goal   and   I noticed     people       being       pulled

up    into the West           stand a bove.          I believed that they were                  being    pulled

up to avoid the              crush.      I never      really noticed any            particular          crowd

surge     in that area behind the Liverpool                      goal.       When the match kicked

  ttack      but after a few m i n ut es when the game                   returned to the Liverpool

 half    it was       obvious     that   the     crtw 4 s it uation had w or se ne d          considerably,

 and    people were          now over    the fe^gc'eA pitch side and that                     po 1 i ceman

 rushed onto          the    pitch and the m a t c \ was          stopped.       At that stage         I

 believed the          crowd sit ua ti on would be resolved and the m a t c h would be

 r e starte d       later on wit hi n a short time,               there were      hundreds      of

 L iverpool         fans on the      pitch      in the   penalty area.           At this      point    I

 n oticed a banner appear                in the Forest       crowd,      a large banner,          it had

 not been there before               stating      ’S h a nk ly 81"     this   banner      is deeply

 offensive          to Liverpool      supporters         because we feel          it makes

 d e r og at or y    references      about      the death of Bill         SHAN KL Y    in that year.

 In the      past     I have only seen           it used by M anchester           United

-supporters          in r et al iation to jokes about              the Munich air disaster.                  At

 the same       time some Forest           supporters       started      chanting      "hooligans           and

 some Liverpool             supporters    att em pt ed to make          their way along         the

   itch to the Forest             end.     O b v i ou sl y the Liverpool          supporters         were

 aware of what          had h ap pened and hearing            the abuse          from the Forest           fans

 their ac tions ware uncT&rstandabl e .                    This    sit ua ti on was totally

 misinterpreted             by th<^ police a u t h o r i t y and t h e y N jiade a crucial            error

 in mis di re ct in g a large nun'iber of policemen.                      They     put a cordon act o-=>s

 this    position for a long time when they should have been ass is ti ng                                       the

 fans at the Leppings Ln end.                     The whole       sit ua ti on    reminded me of

 the Heysal          disaster,      there were       policemen everywhere             , the    problems

' c on gr eg at ed    in the     centre    circle,       becaus\of       the fl^J^ of affective

  leadership.          I can make        this    comparison b e c a u ^       I was    on the ter races

            i nitiative wh\lsi        others were not.           I saw a number             of people    being

            carried on stretcfTers and a number                 of them I a s s um ed were           dead as

            their heads were        covered with jackets 'etc.                   The   stretchers      in most

            cases were       car r ied by\f^ans a nd not by the^            do   1 i ce .   Of the   people who

            thought      were dead on the stretchers             one was wearing a red top.                 At

            this    time    I said to my wife        that    if all    the       police on the       pitch were

            to    put their glo ve V^ on they        could easily have              pulled the fence       down.

            We s tayed      in our s%tand until about 4,40             pm    (1640).         I think    because

 1.    Since responsibility for sports ground safety was transferred to this
D epartm ent from the H om e Office in 1992, I have had a num ber o f discussions
w ith Brigadier T ony B udd w ho is Secretary o f the Civil C ontingencies U n it in
the C abinet Office. H e is responsible for the lead departm ent arrangements under
w hich central G overnm ent response to any em ergency is managed. D espite the
transfer o f policy responsibility, the H om e Office have retained lead departm ent
responsibility for accidents in sports grounds, b u t we are under pressure to agree
that this responsibility should be transferred to us. T he choice o f lead departm ents
is based on a num ber o f factors:

      i.     the nature o f the disaster - there is usually a clear link betw een the
              nature o f the disaster and the norm al business o f the departm ent;

      ii.    access to inform ation: ready access to a flow o f up-to-date and
              accurate inform ation is essential. Clearly, the H om e Office now feels
              seriously o ut o f touch w ith inform ation on sports ground safety issues
              w hich are at o u r fingertips; and

      iii.   the availability o f facilities: w here a disaster is large-scale or
              protracted, it may be necessary to use a dedicated em ergency room
              and comm unications. T h e H om e Office does retain a room w ith
              dedicated telephones, b ut having talked the issue through w ith them ,
              w e doubt w hether this w ould be necessary in the case o f D N H .

2.     Pressure has recently increased because the publication "Dealing w ith
Disaster" w hich is intended to assist those involved in the preparation for and
response to disasters is currendy being revised. T his revision will include the
revision o f an annex - annex F - w hich sets out the pre-nom inated lead
G overnm ent departm ents against various types o f disaster or em ergency including
accidents in sports grounds. A t present the H om e Office (or appropriate territorial
departm ent) is given lead departm ent responsibility "In close consultation w ith the
D epartm ent o f N ational H eritage (M inister o f Sport)".

3.      I think that there is now a strong case for o u r accepting that this
D epartm ent should be nam ed in "Dealing w ith Disaster" and be identified as the
lead departm ent should another m ajor accident occur. W e have taken som e tim e
to consider, in consultation w ith the H om e Office, w hat the resource
consequences for agreeing m ight be. If a disaster were to occur, then clearly the
first actions w ould happen on the ground via the em ergency services and w ould
n ot involve us in any way. W e should how ever be responsible for finding out
w hat was happening o n the ground and briefing M inisters and the Press Office so
that they w ould be in a position to make accurate and authoritative statements as
quickly as possible. It w ould also be to this D epartm ent that N o lO o r other
M inisters w ould turn i f they needed inform ation on w hat was happening. If there
w ere to be further investigations along the lines o f the T aylor R e p o rt into the
H illsborough disaster then again it w ould be for this D epartm ent to take the lead.

4.     All this seems to m e to be em inendy sensible and precisely w hat our
Ministers w ould expect. I doubt w hether they w ould take kindly for example, to
the H om e Secretary being the first port o f call for the press i f there w ere to be
another sports ground disaster and I am quite sure that the press w ould find it
difficult to accept that they w ould be directed away from the Secretary o f State
o r M inister for N ational H eritage and told that, despite the policy transfer, lead
departm ent responsibility rem ained w ith die H om e Office. T here is n o suggestion
o f course that we w ould take over from the H om e Office their direct
responsibility for the em ergency services. It is essentially an administrative function
w hich we w ould be taking o n and w hich w ould be handled w ithin SA R D .

5.     I should be grateful for your views as to w hether, in principle, w e should
accept responsibility for lead departm ent status - and w ith it a seat on the Civil
C ontingency U nit. If you and M r Phillips see no objection in principle, then I
shall notify Brigadier B udd that he may plan o n the basis that the lead
responsibility should be transferred b u t that we shall need to clear lines first w ith
ou r M inisters.

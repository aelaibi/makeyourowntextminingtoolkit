G17

 DO YOU .HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATION ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE GATES AT THE FRONT OF THE PENS SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENED.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOt^WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?               - O ff                       COMM
 I FEEL STRONGLY THAT IT IS THE ORGANISATION OF THE POLICE FORCE THAT CAUSED

 THE 95 FANS TO DIE.   I DON'T BLAME THE DECISION OF THE POLICE OFFICER WHO

 OPENED THE MAIN GATES - HE OBVIOUSLY MADE THE DECISION IN AN EFFORT TO HELP

 THE CRUSHING OUTSIDE THE GROUND.       I ALSO CRITICISE THE DECISION OF THE FA ON

 A f ^ R E N T POLICE ADVICE TO GIVE LIVERPOOL THE SMALLER END OF THE GROUND.

 THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION OF FANS INTO PROPER QUEUES BY POLICE OUTSIDE THE

 TURNSTILES AND THERE WAS A TOTAL LACK OF POLICE PRESENCE FOR UP TO HALF A MILE

 FROM THE GROUND.

 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 ON OWN ACCORD.


Q18

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

NO.

Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?
                                                                              PAGE    8
                                                                              QSLH656

 IT WAS JUST CHAOS, NO ONE KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING.     THE POLICE DID NOT KNOW

 WHAT WAS HAPPENING, THEY TREATED IT WAS A CROWD HOOLIGAN PROBLEM AND NOT AS A

 CROWD SAFETY PROBLEM.     THE ACCESS FOR THE EMERGENCY SERVICES ONTO THE PITCH

 WAS VERY POOR,   I ONLY SAW ONE AMBULANCE IN THE GROUND.

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU W f S H T O ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?                    X.        C a T~

 I THINK THAT THE PROBLEM BEGAN WITH THESLACK OF CROWD CONTROL OUTSIDE THE

GROUND.   WHEN THE GATES WERE OPENED, ALL xlSJ^EEDED WAS FOR SOME STEWARDS OR

 POLICE TO DIRECT FANS AWAY FROM THE TUNNEL.

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAtsYOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS OR THE INJURIES T o \ w Y REBSON?^,       .,

 YES - THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SHUT OFF PRIOR TO THE GATES BEING

 OPENED AND THE GATE THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OPENED WAS THE ONE BETWEEN THE

 TERRACES AND WEST STAMD TURNSTILES.    ALSO THE KICK-OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 DELAYED AND THIS ANNOUNCED TO THE SUPPORTERS TRYING TO GET IN.    IT SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN GETTING THEM OUT. THE POLICE SEEMED MORE INTERESTED Il'M’OSSFBLE CFTOWD

 CONTROL PROBLEMS THAN TRYING TO ASSIST THE INJURED. THE FANS WERE LEFT TO HELP

 l^piSELVES.

 AS I CAME OUT, BY THE TURNSTILES,       I SAW A LOT OF POLICE LINED UP DOING NOTHING

 WHEN DEAD AND INJURED WERE STILL IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE.

 G53A

 DID YOU ATTEND THE 1988 <000088) MATCH?

 YES.

 THERE WERE POLICEMEN JUST STANDING AROUND WITH THEIR ARMS FOLDED NOT HELPING

 THE FANS.

 4) THERE WERE ABOUT 100 POLICEMEN INITIALLY IN FRONT OF THE TERRACES, BUT ONLY

 30-40 OF THEM GOT STUCK IN AND TRIED TO ASSIST THE DEAD AND INJURED.

 5) THERE APPEARED A STRONG LACK OF LEADERSHIP WITHIN THE POLICE AND GENERAL

 DISORGANISATION.

 6) THERE SHOULD BE FENCING BUT THE EMERGENCY EXITS OR MEANS TO OPEN THE FENCES

 IN AN EMERGENCY AS HAPPENED WERE INADEQUATE. THERE SHOULD BE A MEANS TO EITHER

 COLLAPSE OR OPEN THE FENCES.

 -/-P e r i m e t e r f e n c i n g   is   n e c e s s a r y , but   there   should   not   be   pens.

 Q50

WHAT t i m e d i d y o u l e a v e t h e f o o t b a l l g r o u n d ?

 4PM (1600).

Q51

DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER,

A STEWARD, A LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

AFTER LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT ASKING FANS TO LEAVE GROUND, BUT NOT ALL AT

ONCE BECAUSE OF AMBULANCES. SO WE MADE OUR WAY OUT SLOWLY. I HAD MET MY
                                                                               PAGE    9

 FRIENDS OIM THE PITCH AT ABOUT 3.30PM (1550).

 052

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.


019

 053

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1) TOTAL CHAOS, NO ONE SEEMED TO TAKE THE INITIATIVE ON THE PART OF THE

 AUTHORITIES.

           CAL FA C ILITIES MORE OP LESS NONE EXISTENT.

 3) ST JOHNS AMBULANCE DID THEIR BEST, B U T E N O U G H .          1
                                                                         COM
 4) POLICE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE MEDICALLY TRAINED IN FIRST AID, BUT THERE WERE

 GROUPS OF TWO'S AND THREE *S STANDING
                                  p ? m AROUND DOING NOTHING.

 054

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) AT HILLSBOROUGH THERE ARE FAR TOO FEW TURNSTILES. MORE TURNSTILES WOULD

 MEAN LESS CROWDING OUTSIDE.

 2^ E T T E R   ORGANISATION OUTSIDE OF QUEUES BY POLICE,   IRRESPECTIVE OF WHAT TIME

 FANS ARRIVE.

 3) ATTITUDE OF POLICE TO FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS IN GENERAL SHOULD BE CHANGED.

 FANS SHOULD BE TREATED WITH A BIT OF RESPECT AND DIGNITY. ALL FANS ARE TREATED

 AS POTENTIAL TROUBLEMAKERS. THERE IS A MINORITVtfF TROUBLEMAKERS, BUT NOT

 EVERYONE SHOULD BE TARRED WITH THE SAME BRl

 4) AT THE 1988 (000088) SEMI-FINAL THERE WERE STEWARDS AND POLICE DIVERTING

 FANS TO THE SIDES AND AWAY FROM T^E/OENTRE TUNNEL. THIS YEAR THERE WAS NO ONE.

 BETWEEN 6-10 POLICE OR STEWARDS COULD HAVE AVOIDED THE DISASTER IF THEY HAD

 DIRECTED THE FANS TO THE SIDES OF THE TERRACES.

Q-15

                                                                                     p
 l W _ A C K OF POLICE CONTROL O/SIDE/THE GROUND TO SAY THAT FANS WERE DRUNK &

EXCITED SHOULD BE EXPECTED. THfi&E WAS NO EFFORT TO ORGANISE & FORM ORDERLY

QUEUES OUTSIDE THE GROUND. T tiE WPC MENTIONED IN G18 RECEIVED NO BACK-UP IN HER

WORK TO DISLODGE THE PACKEDrCROWD.

2) THE FOOT OFFICERS STOOD BY THE SHOP WALL, AS MENTIONED IN G18, WERE JUST

STANDING AROUND NOT DOING ANYTHING. THEY APPEARED TO LAUGH AT PEOPLE WHO WERE

ASKING THEM TO DO SOMETHING WHICH APPEARED INAPPROPRIATE AT THAT TIME.

3) NO WAY FOR POLICE OFFICERS TO COMMUNICATE TO THE CROWD^ ?SIDE THE GROUND,

 IE PA SYSTEMS,

4) THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE OFFICERS WL*R RADIOS TO CO-ORDINATE WHAT
                                                                              PAGE       8

 WAS GOING.

 3) A FURTHER FACTOR IS THE ENTRANCE TO LEPPINGS LANE IS POOR AND IS SOMETHING

 THE F .A . SHOULD HAVE LOOKED.   TOO FEW TURNSTILES.

 6) THERE WER EN ’T ANY QUEUES TO START WITH OR IF THERE HAD THEY HAD BEEN

 ALLOWED TO DEGENERATE.

 7) THE FACT THAT AT 2.55PM (1455) PEOPLE WERE STILL ENTERING PENS 3 & 4 WHICH

 INDICATES LACK OF DIRECTION AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE TUNNEL DIVERTING FANS TO

 THE EMPTY PENS 1 & 2 AND 6 & 7 .


Q18

 Q53

 otftoU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS

 HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 1) DID SEE POLICE OFFICERS PUSHING FANS BACK INTO THE PENS, WHO THEN HELPED

 THEM BACK OVER.

 2) AT 3.10PM <1510) THE                                                         MTIL

 3.35PM (1535) FOR THE SECOND AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE.      I HAD LOOKED AT THE

 ELECTRONIC SCOREBOARD TO SEE THIS, UNABLE TO SEE WHY IT TOOK SO LONG FOR THIS

AND OTHER AMBULANCE TO ARRIVE.

3) A LINE OF POLICE OFFICERS LINED UP IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND AT APPROX

3^ppPM (ISIS). THESE WERE THERE TO PREVENT AND FANS FROM GETTING ONTO THE

PITCH, ALTHOUGH THERE HAD BEEN NO ATTEMPT MADE BY ANY FANS TO GET ONTO THE

PITCH AT THAT STAGE. THIS MADE THE FANS HOSTILE TO THESE OFFICERS, BECAUSE YOU

COULD SEE THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER USED ELSEWHERE.

4) THE LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT MADE AT APPROX 3.20PM (1520) WAS MADE FIRSTLY

 IN THE WRONG TONE. HE TOLD FANS TO GET OFF THE PITCH. HE SHOULD HAVE

 INTRODUCED HIMSELF THAT AMBULANCES WERE ON THEIR WAY AND THAT THERE WERE

SERIOUS INJURIES.   IT 0I                          ROWD BECAUSE AT THIS STAGE THE

FANS CHARGED THE KOP E                             ED BY FOREST FANS CHANTING AT

THE ROAR TO THE LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT. THE POLICE STOPPED THE CHARGE, THIS

WAS THE ONLY THING THEY DID RIGHT ON THAT DAY.
                                                                           PAGE      9
                                                                           Q S L2668
      «

 5) POLICE OFFICERS WERE ADMINISTERING FIRST AID, BUT THERE WERE THOSE WHO WERE

 MILLING ABOUT DOING NOTHING OR APPEARING NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO. MORE SHOULD

 HAVE HELPED. BELIEVE THE VERY LEAST THEY COULD HAVE DONE WAS TO HAVE PLACED

 PEOPLE WHO WERE LYING ON THEIR BACKS,    INTO THE RECOVERY POSITION. THE FACT

 THAT THIS WASN'T DONE COULD HAVE CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS DEATHS.

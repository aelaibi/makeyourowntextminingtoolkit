                            PATHOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF THE DISASTER

                                                                  jt

 My medical qualifications are MB, BS, FRC Path, DMJ (Clin et Path).                            I have bee

 In active practice in Forensic Pathology for almost thirty years and have been

 Consultant Pathologist to the Home Office for South Yorkshire and the East

 Midlands for twenty-five of those years.               During that time I have performed mor,

 than twenty-six thousand post mortem examinations for Her Majesty's coroners an,

 have taken part In some seven hundred and sixty murder Investigations.



 I have been          by Hr Mervyn JOKES, Assistant Chief Constable of the West

 Midlands Police in charge of the Hillsborough Enquiry lean, to provide a genera)

overview of the pathological aspects of the Hillsborough disaster in which some

ninety-five persons were killed on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 April,.1989,
during a cup semi-final match.




I took part in the investigation of the deaths myself, being present at the

lequest of Her Majesty's coroner at Hillsborough Stadium on the evening of 15

        989, and at the Medico-Legal Centre on Sunday, 16 April and Monday, 17

«prU.   I personally carried out nineteen of the ninety-five post mortems.                               The

other examinations were carried out by teams of pathologists working five or six

at a time in the mortuary of the Sheffield Medico-!.                   Centre at Watery Street

         ■ns the transfer of the bodies from the :.                    , mortuary in the

I can only speak in a detailed way of the nineteen examinations which I

personally carried out.     However, having read all ninety-five post mortem

reportsj'jand seen certain statements made by witnesses,^ I believe I can speak in

a general way about the pathological conditions which proved fatal in the total

of ninety-five cases which were examined.       The details of individual cases will

need to be obtained from the pathologists who examined .them, which is why their

names and professional addresses, together with the body numbers, have been

provided above.

   in my view, merel:       l   :,;,s the nature of the occasion.



  AGE

  Of the ninety-five who HioH
                                     the           was a .10 year old boy and the eldest ,
  67 year old man.

    Thirty-eight persons (approximately 40%) were unde? 20 years of age

    Thirty-nine persons (41%) „ere between 20 and 2 ? years of age

    Twelve persons (13*) were between 30 and 39 years of age

    Three persons (3%) were between 40 and 49 years of age

   One person (1%) was between 50 and 59 years

   Two persons (2*) were between 60 and 69 years old.
           *
   Seventy-seven of the ninety-five (81%) dead were below 30 years of age. •

 Again, I imagine these fibres probably reflect the composition of the average
 soccer crowd.




 CAUSE OF DEATH


 In virtually every case, the cause of death was basically compression of the

chest wall - against the bodies of the persons M e d i a t e l y around the deceased

or against fixed structures such as the walls of the stadium and the crash

barriers,   in the vast majority of the cases, this pressure caused the condition

Of traumatic or crush asphyxia - the two terms are synonymous.



Asphyxia pathologically means some mechanical obstruction to normal breathing.

That obstruction may be caused in a variety of ways - by a hand across the nose
and mouth (suffocation 1      ~ i > ..
                        t   y a ligature tightened around the neck

   respiration, the result is similar.            The oxygen in the air cannot be drawn intc

   the lungs and passed into the blood to be transported to the body tissues which

   require it for their normal function.              The deoxygenated blood in the tissues

   turns a dark colour, giving the victim’s complexion a bluish or cyanotic hue.

  The heart begins to fail and the vails of the smallest vessels (capillaries)

  Which are under pressure and themselves starved of oxygen, give way and allow

  spurts of red cells to pass into the surrounding tissues where they show as tin

  Pin-point haemorrhages (petechiael in the loose skin around the eyes, on the

  forehead and behind the ears as well as on many of the ioternal organs.                                     Thus,

  somewhat bloatd cyanotic appearance withexternal and internal petechiae arises '

  perhaps less if the victim is struggling and thus using up oxygen at a higher                                        <

  rate - then the brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes and

  ultimately the vital centres in the hind brain are damaged and die and then l i e
  is no longer possible.                                                                                           ^




 Appearances such as these were seen in almost.every person who died at

 Hillsborough, and in all but nine cases death was attributed solely to t r a g i c

 (or crush] asphyxia.    In one case U o 761 the force compressing the chest was

(perhaps momentarily, so great that the rear surface of the breast bone almost

touched the anterior surface of the spine, nipping and splitting the aorta

between them so that the man bled to death internally before he could be
asphyxiated.    In Gnly eight Qther ^             ^        3> ^     ^        ^           ^       ^   ^    ^   ^


were factors other than traumatic asphyxia thought to have even contributed to

the death, and in six of these eight, the contributory factor arose out of

trauma to the chest, neck or head.      In the remaining two cases (3 and 691 only,


                                                               76   i i 't f 5

truly natural disease was believed to be a significant contributory ,            in

the death.



INHALATION OF VOMIT

In any form of asphyxia vomiting may occur before death and because of

unconsciousness and the lack of the protective reflex mechanism, vomitus may be
                                                 t
aspirated into the lungs, greatly increasing the likelihood of death. Most

pathologists regard this vomiting as merely a facet of death from asphyxia and

though recording it in their post mortem reports, do not dignify it with a

separate heading in the cause of death.     This is my view and the one I have

adopted in compiling the simple statistics for this report.     It has, however, to

be said that for purely mechanical and obvious reasons, vomiting is more likely

to occur if the stomach is distended with food and/or drink and is subjected to

hard external mechanical compression.     Vomiting is also more likely to occur in

those persons intoxicates witn alcohol.



OTHER INJURIES

In eighteen cases bones were broken - mostly ribs (thirteen cases), but in

addition the bones and/or cartilages of the larynx (voice box) were fractured in

three cases (47, 51 and 81) - perhaps suggesting that the throat of these

persons had been trodden on accidentally ie that they were on the ground when

they sustained that injury.



In only two cases were long bones fractured.    In one of these cases (18), both

bones in a woman's forearm were broken and in one (1 1 ) a young boy’s fer.ur was

broken.   Both injuries could have occurred as the result of accidental

trampling.
 In two cases impacts to the chest wall were so severe as to cause extensive

 bruising to the underlying lungs, affecting the victim's ability to breathe and

 in one of these the ribs were actually fractured and their ends tore the

 underlying lung allowing air to escape from the lung into the chest

 (pneumothorax) and seriously adversely affect the victim’s breathing.



 In one case damage to the nose with subsequent bleeding allowed the inhalation

 of blood into the lungs and this was thought to be a Significant factor in the

 death.




 As one would perhaps have suspected, a very high proportion of these bodies bore

 superficial grazes and scratches - evidence of blunt impact against all manner

 of solid objects such as walls, concrete flooring, barriers and fences. These

 injuries are too numerous to be described or interpreted here and details should

 be obtained in each individual case from the pathologist who actually performed

 the post mortem (see above).



ALCOHOL

In discussing this matter, my impression is that the dead came mostly from the

front (ie near to the pitch) areas of the Leppings Lane end, from amongst

persons who had arrived early in order to get a good view and thus their.1blood

alcohols are not necessarily an indication of the alcoholic status of those who

arrived later and were pushing to get in at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.



No blood was taken from the victim who died last ie no 95, because of -the

interval of time which had passed between the accident and his death.'

Mo alcohol was found in the boc:   nf any of the seven female victims. •

Of the remaining e/rhty-se-"^.      I boys, fifty-one (58%) were shown to have

  nor more than 10 mg% in their Mood, which is n e g l i g e , but flrteen had _

  than 80 mg% in their blood, which means they could not legally have driven a

  car, and six had upwards or lao mg% in their blood.              Six youths below the age c

  18, Who were not legally allowed to drink, had taken drink, of which group one

  boy, aged 17 years, had a blood alcohol or 1«1 mgj, whilst a 15 year old had a
  blood alcohol of 56 mg%.

 EYE HAEMORRHAGES


 I have been asked to cogent on the proposition that a distinction can be made

 in this case between those persons who died rro„ traumatic asphyxia standing up

 in the crowd and those dying from the sa«e cause !yi„g down.              The latter, it is

 said, will have petechial haemorrhages in their eyes whilst the foraer w i n not

 I have seen a very large number or cases or traumatic asphyxia and I a. certain

 that no such distinction can be made , both groups will in all probability have
 petechial haemorrhages in their eyes.

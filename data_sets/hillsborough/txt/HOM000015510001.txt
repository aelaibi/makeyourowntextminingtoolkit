      Actions of crews on arrival.

3.1   Rivelin WrT - StnO Swain in Charge

      Attended the Leppings Lane side of ground and encountered severe
      congestion that prevented immediate access to the ground.

      An immediate request for the use of a resuscitator on     a   casualty
      in the rear of an ambulance was answered.

      Rivelin 1 was made Contact Point in Leppings Lane for the incident
      with StnO Swain OiC.




                                    1.
      A request for resuscitation equipment inside the ground was
      received from a Police Officer. In view of this a "Make Pumps 10
      for resuscitators" message was sent. Crew members were despatched
      into the ground in an effort to make contact with Senior Police
      Officers, and ascertain the extent of the incident.

3.2   Central WrT 1 and 2 - StnO Fletcher and SubO        in Charge

      Attended at the Riverside Entrance off Penistone Road at the rear
      of the South Stand.      The crews were not met or directed by the
      Police so the officers made their way onto the pitch to the area
      immediately in front of the West Stand where they found many
      casualties on the pitch who needed first aid treatment.         No
      rescues as such needed to be undertaken but it was obvious that
      bodies and casualties needed to be attended to.




  I
      The crew members were then directed to perform mouth to mouth
      resuscitation and first aid. Two resuscitators were used by the
      crews.

      A casualty receiving area was set up at the rear of the West Stand
      by so directing T/StnO           and casualties were movedfrom the
      pitch to this area by crews, police and spectators.

      Approximately 20-30 persons were moved to this area. The obvious
      dead being located in a holding area at the rear of the WestStand
      and the injured removed by       ambulance to    hospital.  Later
      information received by StnO Fletcher told him to evacuate
      casualties to the Gymnasium at the rear cf the North Stand.

      The crews of Central 1 and 2 were joined and assisted by those
      from Darnall 1 and 2, Ringinglow 1 and the Emergency Tender from
      Central.

      When the pitch had been cleared of casualties all crews were
      directed to the Gymnasium and carried out further assistance.

3.3   Central Emergency Tender - LFm Housley in Charge

      Attended at Penistone Road but could not gain access to the ground
      because of height restriction for the appliance.     Proceeded to
      Leppings Lane and the Contact Point.

      The crew then proceeded as directed into the ground via the North
      Stand and onto the pitch with a resuscitator treating casualties
      both on the pitch and later in the Gymnasium.

3.4   Rinqinqlow WrT- StnO          in Charge

      Attended at Leppings Lane entrance.




                               2.
      The crew then proceeded as directed into the ground with a
      resuscitator and gave assistance to casualties on the pitch in
      front of the West Terrace together with the crews from Central 1
      and 2 and Darnall 1 and 2. When the pitch had been cleared of
      casualties the crew was directed to the Gymnasium.

3.5   Darnall WrT 1 and 2 - T/stnO          and SubO            in Charge

      Attended Leppings Lane entrance.      Crews entered the ground as
      directed and gained access to the pitch via the West Terrace
      rendering assistance to casualties with two resuscitators and
      mouth to mouth resuscitation. Working with other crews casualties
      were removed initially to the casualty receiving area which T/StnO
      Clay had been directed to establish at the rear of the West Stand
      and subsequently to the gymnasium.

      On instructions from ADO Robjohns, SubO               and his crew
      undertook a circuit of the pitch to ascertain if any further
      injured people needed assistance and get them to the Gymnasium for
      treatment. All crews were eventually located in the Gymnasium
      rendering assistance to casualties.

4.    The "make up" message from StnO Swain was received in County Fire
      Service Control at 1528 by Brigade radio.

 Shortly           a f t e r      this     I became aware o f                  what    I    thought was a puolic

 order         type         situation,           w i t hi n the Central                pen of tne Lappings                   Ln

 terraces,                 together wit h other O t n c e r s                    I went         to this       location           jast

 as       p Iay w as          s t a p pe d o n t he       p i.t c h ,



 U p o n a r r i va 1 a t t h s L e p &x n g s L r.t e r ra c:i n g I was                        s t i 3.1   unde r        the

 assumption                 that      it was a public:                  order s i t uation and               1could        see

 people          climbing             over    tne    fencing and               into    the West S t a n d „



 I then          noticed           that      injured       people         were    Using         carried       out     of    the

‘C e n t r a l     pen, ,         I therefore            went     to     the    gats       C'f t h e   per, w n e r s      1 saw a

 1 could           see        he was      carrying         out     of the        pen a young man                in n:i.s late

 teens y I             a s s i steel t h 1       Q f f i c e r to        carry him to tha               playing area,,



 It was          obvious           at    tnis    stage       that        this man had            stoppec        breathing.

two    prisoners             -    I instructed                 the a r r e s t i n g        Officer                        to      complete

paper       p r ior     to       returning           to P e n i s t o n e        rd    because        it w a s         quiet.        About

■1445 two m o r e            arrests          were        m a d e,    one w a s        quite       violent         ( drunk)          and

they were          taken          to    the       Police        room.           I was       approached            by a m a n w h o

asked       to    complain about                   the     arrest          of    one     of    the    Nottingham

supporters            - he        gave       me    his     details          but       declined        to a t t e n d       at      the     gym

to    see     Inspector            RILEY,          Complaints              and Discipline,                  as    he w a n t e d      to

enter       the m a t c h - he w o u l d                  think       about       the       matter       and      if he w i s h e d            to

pursue        it he w o u l d           see       Inspector           RILEY       after        the    match        in the          gym.

1455               I entered             the       ground and              found       Inspector            RILEY       outside           the

gym and          informed          h i m as        to     p o s i t i o n - he w o u l d           be a v a i l a b l e       after

match.           It w a s        about       now     I heard message                   on     radio      to e f f e c t       "Open

I heard          the    teams            come    onto       the    pitch and             decided          to    return          to

Penistone          Rd      to     collect         my    serial          to     t a ke     them       to s t a n d b y      (Ph as e        2)       at

we were          covering            Penistone          Rd and          Inspector              was     writing        up        his

was     asked      to      bring my             serial       to    the        gym     immediately,              I went          to    round

turnstiles,             although            by    now       very       f ew    people          about.          I took       my       serial

Inspector          SEWELL            instructed             me    to    t ak e      my    serial        to     the    Leppings             Ln

e n d as     there         was       some       unspecifieid                disturbance/trouble.                          Inspector

Beresford/PC               2435 were             not    with       us -        I took          eight      PC's       onto       p i t c h at

ramp       between Kop and North                        Stand.              As we        walked        onto     the       side       of

the     pitch       the      g a me       had    started - Liverpool                          were     playing        to K o p        end.

I looked          to L e p p i n g s        Ln    end and          could         see      supporters            on the          fen ce,         on

the     inside         not      on       top a n d     I could          see      a few         Officers         at    t h at     e nd      on

the     track.          We      walked along                the    front         of      the    north         stand and          became

aware       of a f e w          supporters             on    the       p i t c h at       the    Leppings            Ln    end,       s o me

were       just    straying               onto    the       pitch.            I asked          them     to m o v e        off    the

playing          surface,            a    couple       were       sat       with      their       backs        to a d v e r t i s e m e n t

hoardings          -    I told            them    to m o v e       back        to     the      fencing         at    the    Leppings

Lane       end.        There         was    no    undue          alarm         with       these        supporters           - they          were

s t i ll    watching            the m a t c h .         I then          realised              that     the L i v e r p o o l

supporters             were       climbing           out     of    the        Leppings          Ln end a nd           trying          to    get

Then       Superintendent                  GREENWOOD             ran o n t o        pitch       to     referee        (game

stopped).              I walked along                  touchline              from       corner        (Between North and

West)       towards          the         goal    asking          supporters              to    keep     off     pitch

and    keep       calm    (supporters                 now were           numbered            in    10's).

I assumed match would                       restart             after        pitch      had       been    c l e a r e d as        it was

only    o v e r s p i 11.

At    the    left     side        of    the      goal        (Facing          Leppings            L n end)      I saw a man

being       given mouth            to m o u t h           by O f f i c e r s     and     then a man             started           heart

massage.           (He    said         he w a s       a    doctor).             I saw        blood       come       from       his    mouth

in    bright       red    splashes            when         the    doctor         thumped           his    chest.           His       colour

was    blue/grey.

There       were     photographers                   jostling           to    get    photographs               of    the       man    on   the

floor.

I then       started         to    realise            that       things        were      getting          out       of    normal

proportions           and a        lot      of       supporters              were    on t he         pitch,         all     obviously

suffering          from       crushing           -    feeling           faint-       gasping          for a i r          - and       it was

hot    and     especially               in a n        o v e r p a c k e d Pen.          I could imagine                   some

fainting.            More      and more              people       were being            c a r r i e d out a n d           being       given

mouth       to m o u t h ,     andl       realised              it w a s      serious.             X tried          to    call       for

stretchers           but all           radio         transmissions               were        incomprehensible.                    I s a w Mr

GREENWOOD            stood        by the         left        hand      goal      post        t r y i n g to use          the

radio       but      he      c o u l d not       get       t h r o u g h . I said,       "Let *s get            the

injured        off    th e     pitch        into          the    gym."         He    said,         "Yes    do       it."        I spoke

to O f f i c e r s    nearby and              told         him    to     get     the     injured moving                   i nto      the

gym and        everybody           e l se     would          follow.

Photographers             were         pushing            around        the     goal     area        trying         to    get     close-

ups    of    the     injured/dead and                       I started           pushing           t h e m aw ay.          Supporters

were    incensed          by t h e i r        behaviour             -    it wa s        obscene.

It a p p e a r e d    th e m a i n        p r o b l e m was         the       gate      to P e n 3,        it wa s          crowded

with    Officers/supporters                          trying       to     pull       injured          through.            W i t h PC 2 1 3 0

enormity          of w h a t      had     happened,              there        were      two       piles    of       b o d i e s , on e     to

                 were        all    a    pale       grey          colour          with       their mouths                open - they were                    dead -

                  some       were       twitching             -    I could             not    believe             what     I wa s       looking        at.          I

                  then       saw a m a n           to m y         right       hanging            onto        the    fence         but    trapped           by his

                  legs       entwined          in the             pile       of    bodies.              I then       realised            other        people

                 were        moving       and were                alive       but       trapped          by t h e i r       legs.

a megaphone                 shouting            orders.            PC F R O S T a n d m y s e l f              were     pulling             legs

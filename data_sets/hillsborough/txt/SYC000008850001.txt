   NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic

    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
      C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re

     induced abortion.                                                     Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.

    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


         If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
         of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
         on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
         due course.

         I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
         evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
         coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
         inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

         Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
         under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
         witnesses who wish to give evidence. I am at present engaged in considering
         this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

         Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
         to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
         appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
         consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

         May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
         attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
         to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

         I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by the end of SeptenjJjer I will assume you have no names to
         submit.

         Yours faithfully,

Dear Dr Popper

RE:   COLIN WAFER              **

I have had an opportunity of going through                                                   the Sumary                        with Mr and              Mrs
Wafer.

They have no questions                            aralslng                 from either the summary or Post-Mortem
Report.

Mr and Mrs Wafer will be In Sheffield to hear the Summary presented; they
are a little nervous as       they now know that theywi11 be      the   first familyto
be dealt with and they are therefore likely         to be the subject of a
substantial amount of press attention. I have assured them that everything
possible will be done by      yourself , your Officers,myself and my colleagueMr
Woods to keep them apart from the press and          I am certain that they
appreciate everything that is being done to help them.

Youifs sincerely

Dear Sirs,

Re:       COLIH      \JXSGR                             Ho.11.
                              /


As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1 3 9 0 ,

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not-to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 g.M.Coroner.

 Dear Sirs,

 T?p»         Colin Wafer                 (   decaaned).

 Thank you. for your letter of the 8th of August.

 X enclose a letter Reference SLP/JT/H/PM/OOl which deals
 with the question of the release of the post mortem
 reports to you. On that basis, I enclose the post
 mortem report. If you cannot accept it on these terms,
 please return it unused.

  I am not clear whether you represent your clients in
  connection with the Inquest proceedings.

  As I am anxious to sort out the legal representation
  in order that I may know who to communicate with, I
  would be grateful if you could please let me know as
  soon as possible whether or not you are instructed
  in connection with the Inquest.

   If you are so instructed, I would be grateful if you
   could please let me know who precisely you represent.

   Finally, I would be grateful if you could please let
   me know whether you intend to associate yourself with
   the Hillsborough Steering Committee group of solicitors.
   This is of course a matter entirely for you, The purpose
   of my inquiry is to try and sort out which firms are
   within the groupcand which will need separate communications.

   I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

   Please quote our reference.

   Yours faithfully,



    S.L.Popper,

        Dear Sirs,

        You .will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
        reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
        in fact put in as evidence.

        However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
        and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
        I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
        I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem .
        report of your client(s).

        The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

               a.     They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                      subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                      they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

               b.     They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                      conselling of the deceased's relatives or for proper
                      legitimate purposes in conneccfcion with any legal proceedings
                      in which solicitors may be engaged.

               c.     Subject to tha\;akgxr§, they are to be kept confidential imtil
                      they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

        I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
        of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
        assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
        each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
        above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
        I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
        reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
        the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

        The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is ^5p    per ^ e e t (total £ 1,10
        Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

        Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir

RE:   HILLSBOROUGH


Many thanks for your letter of the 27th July enclosing copies of the Post-Mortem
Reports.

I will certainly make clear to my clients the conditions under which these
Reports have been released.

A cheque for £26.95 to cover your copying charges is attached, might I trouble
you for a receipt for accounting purposes.

Since I gave you my list of deceased a further one has been                                                         , he is
John McBrien                                                                                                    might I please
have a copy of his Report to complete the set.

^Yours faithfully
                             A ________

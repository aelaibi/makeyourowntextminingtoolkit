209. MINUTES

     The Minutes of the last meeting held on l4th October, 1981 were taken as
read and signed by the Chairman as a correct record.

210. ARISING OUT OF THE MINUTES

     (a) A letter from the Football Trust regarding their Income Account was
received and noted.

     (b) The Trustees decided that the meeting arranged for the 11th January 1982
between the Trustees and a working party of the Football Trust must be deferred.

211. POLICY

     Mr. Barclay reported that he had been invited to take over the Chairmanship
of the Trust by the Football League Management Committee. He reported on a meeting
between himself and Mr. J.J. Dunnett, President of the League Management Committee
during which the problems and views of the Trustees were considered. A Memorandum
incorporating these matters had been drawn up by Mr. Barclay and this was laid
before the meeting. No amendments were felt necessary to this Memorandum.

     Mr. Barclay was to attend a meeting of the full Football League Management
Committee on December 6th to discuss the Memorandum.

     ^ith regard to the names put forward by the Management Committee for additional
Trustees, the Secretary reported that he was awaiting background information on
the three nominations. These nominations were: Stanley Cullis, Bill Francis and
Neville Vincent.
                                                      J


     Hie Trustees decided to consider the question of additional Trustees and,
if possible, put forward names of people they thought would make good Trustees.
Each Region i.e. South, Midlands, North and Scotland were asked to consider a
separate nomination for each in, order to assist the existing Trustees help clubs
more fully in these areas.

     It was reported that if Mr. Barclay did accept the appointment as Chairman
he would receive no remuneration, but would be re-imbursed for administrative
expenses including the services of a Secretary.

     The Trustees decided that they should arrange a meeting with the Management
Committee, to dxscuss the Dixon Wilson Survey, as soon as possible. A sub-committee
of Messrs. Barclay, Davidson and Taylor was appointed to attend any such meeting*


                                      1   .                            /Continued

211. POLICY (Continued)

It was decided to ask whether the Management Committee thought it advisable to
meet the P.P.A., and if they did to arrange a meeting with-them.

     As soon as these meetingshad been held the Sub-Committee would then    arrange
to meet a working party of the Football Trust. ^

212. NORTHAMPTON TOWN F.C.

     The suggestion put forward by Messrs. George Corderoy & Co. that the Trust
could make an allowance to the   club against the provision of the backrest portion
only of the new seating was accepted.

     The Secretary was instructed to inform the club accordingly.

213. CAMBRIDGE UNITED F.C.

     An application from Cambridge United in respect of a new camera platform
was refused. This was not a condition of the Local Authority Certificate and
was, therefore, not acceptable.


214. CHESTERFIELD F.C.

     An application from Chesterfield in respect of the replacement of the
roof over the centre portion of the Compton Street covered terrace was refused.

     The Trustees expressed conqern that some clubs were doing   this type of
of major re-development work before informing the Trust. This    made it virtually
impossible to assess the safety element involved in the work.    The Secretary
was instructed to write to Non-Designated clubs informing them   of thig concern.

215. GRIMSBY TOWN F.C.

     Whilst the Trustees were very spnpathetic towards this claim they did not
feel that an audio system for use by blind people came within the Safety of S;
Grounds Act and could not, therefore, be accepted.
                                            #

216. NOTTS. COUNTY F.C.

     An application from Notts., County in respect of a land drain, damaged
as an indirect consequence of Safety works, was accepted.

217. HIBERNIAN F.C.

     A letter from Mr. Marsden of Sports Ground Consultants Limited was
considered. It was decided that Mr. Wharton and Mr. Carter should meet the
club to discuss the position and report back to the Trustees in due course.

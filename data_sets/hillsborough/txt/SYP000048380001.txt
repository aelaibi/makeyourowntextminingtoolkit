Dear Sir,

I refer to your letter requesting a copy of your statement made on 25th May
1989.

On checking our system I can only find a questionnaire which was taken from
you, I believe on 25th May 1989, which you may regard as a statement.

At present, I have been asked not to release any material from the
investigation whilst advice is sought as to the legality of doing so.

When the legal position is clarified I will inform you immediately.




Yours faithfully,




S BEECHEY

          On    the way to S h e f f i e l d we gat                   hey a    up on the M o t o r w a y for about            15

                     nutes - I d o n ’t really know where abouts                                that was      or why but          I
    V t °
          think       it was       just    the     sheer        volume        of traffic.         We tra v e l l e d along            the

i         M 62 and went            onto    the M1»            Just     before we got            to S h e f f i e l d we    stopped

          at a M o t o r w a y S e r v ic es S t a t i o n            just to s t r e t c h our         legs.



          At    1420 hrs we a rr i v e d             in S h e f f i e l d and        parked      in Fox Hill,          a little

          wa y from the ground,                   near        to a pub.         On the way from the              car to      the

          g r ou nd we ate          s an d w i c h e s    w hi c h we had brought               with us and a couple                  of

          cans       of beer       to was h them down.                 One     of the     lads we were with,

          wanted          the    toilet    so we         stop p e d off at the            pub,     1 c a n ’t remember        the

          name       ot    it, and             went       in.        I did     not go     into the       pub myself         but       I

          could       see that        it was a b s o l u t e l y full             of supporters;           so muc h so       that

          they were             spilling     outside           the    pub.      Everyone        was    singing and happy

          a n d there was a feeling                      of excitement.              I did      not see anyone who

          appeared           to be drunk          but most           seemed quite inerry and               it was a usua 1

          match       p re pa ra t i o n situation.                  Whe n         came    out we all         wa l k e d down to

          the       ground,       f o llowing      the        crowds.



          O n the way to the gro u n d                    I saw p o l i c e m e n      by the      coach    parks and also

          by the R ai lw ay S t a t i o n .,              Near       the end of the          d u a l - c a r r i a g e w a y before

          we got          to L e p p i n g s Ln    itself we were               told to finish our              cans      of beer

          or else          leave them behind.                   That a p p e a r e d    to be the end of the                line

          for       drink as frog / t h e r e            on    I didn't        see an y o n e    else drinking.

     there was             just a mass            of    people.        P\^V^ary&y s i d a 0 f f i ce r w h o I have            seen

     lines,        but      it was         just mayhem.             He was     on a horse and he was                   trying      to

             his horse          to sort           it a l l f i t      but    there were         too m a n y    people.         I

     at    the e n t rance            but    it was       no good at all.               I ended up being m o v e d

     ac r o s s    to the side              by the gate             on my    left and then across                  to the    right

     and at        one time           I was       v i r tu al ly     off the     ground wit h my feet                hardly-

     touching           the    floor.         Eventually             I got    swept along with the                  crowd and

     round.         There were              no signs       to show where             to go but         I did know I could

     go    round to the               sides       because       that's what          I dicl last year.               Once    in

     take my ticket                  but    there was          nobody at all.               I still     have my ticket

I was      carried f or w a r d     s ta g g e r i n g    down the        steps    of the terraces.               A

barrier         loomed    in front       of me,        quite a high one,            and    I m a n a g e d to duck

under      it before       being    pushed further               on.      I remember       thinking        that       I

had to keep on my feet and                      that     if I. fell       I w o u l d be t r a m p l e d and

When       1 ended up at         p o s i t i o n 2 square J five,              I. was    squashed up against

a barrier w hich was              digging        into my stomach.               I mana g e d to squeeze

behind the goal and ended up wit h the                            barrier       behind me.             At this    time

I had a little            bit of    room and was able                  to breathe        easier      than before.

I stood up on t i p-toes              to        try get some air,              as there was a crush of

people      then and the          pressure was            getting worse            and worse.          It was     like

being      in a sauna because              it was        too hot       in that area due to the vast

numbers         of   people all     together and               it was a hot        day anyway.

a n d the two friends              of his        I d o n ’t know,          but we       c o u l d n ’t find

anywhere.           The    four    of us went             back     to the       car and w a i t e d for

there     until      1830 hrs.           We    heard on the              car    radio    that a lot of               people

were    dead and we were                panicking          because               w a s n ’t a n y w h e r e    to be

seen.      We even drove            down to the ground and                       looked a r o u n d         but     c o u l d n ’t

see    him anywhere.              I w a n te d      to    phone       home as      I knew my Mother                 would     be

w o r r i e d but    every    'phone we saw had queues                          of hundreds           of    people at

them.



E v e n t u a l l y we made       the    d e c i s i o n to go home w i t h o u t _____                hoping        that     he

had    lost    us and m a n a g e d to get a                   lift    back w ith someone              else.         We

d i d n ’t want      to think       that       he might          be one of the ones who                     had died.

We    later found out             that              went       to Hospi t a l     at S h e f f i e l d




On the way home we                broke       down due to the              car o v e r h eating and had to

get    some water          from a house.                 The    people     there       let us use the               'phone

and    I was able          to tell my Mother                   that    I was OK.         I got        home at about

2130    hrs    that       night.

               organised              queues        at       all.         I only        saw       f o u r j&tfunt e d           Policeman                 and

               stewards           at       all.           I knew             I was su pposed          to     go      theough              the         ’B ’

               going        to    stand          back        near       the     blue       gates        until         it    died              down.            I was

               still        with       my    mates        and          suddenly        Vincent            said        "We       are           here"        I    could

               behind        them.           As     I went             down     I    could       see      that        a    blue           c o n c e r tj. na><foo r

               it.      I went             through           like       the     crowd       with        my    mates         no          cyne a s k e d          for       our

               were     doing          it    to     get       out       of    the     crush.            Hundreds            of          people           were           going

crowds          of    people           weren't           running,             it    was          a    fast          walk.           We    went          into

pen    3 , it         was        crowded           but       not       packed.           I saw             no       fighting             or    drinking

inside          the       ground.             As    we       entered          the       pen          we    were          pushed          forward             by

the    crowd          from        behind.               We    were          pushed       down             the       middle          of    the       pen       and

we    stopped             about        a    third        of       the       way    down.              This          was       good       for       us    as       il

was    a       good       place        to     watch          Pr om.          My    and       I were                sill       together.                 My    two

pushed          down       about           another           three          steps       and          we    stopped             because             we    were

pushed          up    against              people.            By       this       time       I       couldn't                see    V i ^ c ^ ^ t any

more.           WE    were        packed           tight          I    couldn't          move             my       arms       at    all.           My    head

was    pushe^d^jjrp a g a i n s t                  someones             back.           We       had       also          lost       sight          of

                      We    were           like     this          for       about       20       minutes.                    1 couldn't             breathe

properly             I could           only        pant.              1 didnot          see          any       barriers             break          even

though          the       one     that        broke          must       have       only          been          a    couswof               feet          behind

us.        I did          have        injuries           it       was       frrusing         \p       thg^Thest

                                                                                                     men           I was       in    the       crush          I

heard          people       shouting               “ I'm      dying".             There          was       a       bloke       behind          my       left

shoulder             who     1 believe              had       a       heart       attack.                 When          I saw       him       he    was

completely                out     and       limp.            He       just    wasn't             moving.                 This       man       was       only

just       a    face       I couldn't               see       his       body       at    all.              He       was       about       40       yrs       Old

and    he       had       light        brown        hair.              As    far    as       I know                he    was       clean       shaven.

Nothing          could           be    done        for       him,       no    one       could             move          at    all.        I was          not

standing             on    the        steps,        I was             standing          on       something                   else.        After          about

20    minutes             ti>e    crush           got    less          mainly       due          to       the       people          getting             out       of

the    g a\^ y(int o             the       pitch.            When       we    could          move          I grabbed                my    b r o ’^ ' ^ ^ r i i i

turned          around.               We    started           to       go    back       towards                the       tunnel.              We    went

under          one    of    the        barriers              and       got    to    the          tunnel.                 Just       inside          th e

tunXej/lhere                was        a    Policeman                 holding       a    lad          who          was       bent    over.              The

Policeman              asked          if m e       and      my    brother           could          take    him       out       of     the

tunnel.               He    was       completly             out       and     not       moving.           As    we    got       out       of    th e

tunnel        a       Policeman             took       him       off     us.        Me    and                       went       to    the       tea     bar

and     had       a    drink.              After       about          ten     minutes          we    walked          back       towards             the

turnstiles.                     I then          saw    the       lad     who       we    helped          out    sat       aginst          a    fence,.

He     was    slumped             there,            still        not     moving.              WE    then       made       our       way       out    of

the     ground             of    our       own     accord.              The    time       was       about       twenty          to       four.

From     the          time       1 managed             to       get     out    of       the    pen       I saw       no    one        doing

anything              wrong       at       all.The          lad       who     we         rried       out       was    aged          in    his       early

thirties              and       about           5 ' 1 1 “t a l l .      He    was       well       built       and     clean          shaven.

He     had    black             wavey           hair, co l l a r length.                  He       was    w earing         light          blue

Jeans        and       he       had    a        bijack a n o r a k t y p e         jacket          on.      The      last       time          I saw

through           Pen       3    there          was    alot       of     people          lying       on    the       floor,           some      where

being        given          mouth          to    mouth.           I couldn't              say       if    anyone          was       dead.           When

1 went        back          through             the    tunnel           there       was       no    one    lying          in    it a t         all.

There        was       just       one       Policeman             in     the       tunnel.           Comparing             it       to    the       same

game     last          year       there          were       a    l ot    more       Policeman             a bout      directing                people

crowd        crush          then       you       would          have     died.           If y o u        didn't       pant          and       breathed

properly              then       when       you       breathed           in    someone             would       take       the       space

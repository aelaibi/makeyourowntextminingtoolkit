Dear Lord Justice Taylor


I cannot thank you enough for your very thorough report on the
Hillsborough disaster and your non recommendation of I.D. cards.

I've been attending matches at Highbury since I was 7, that was
55 years ago, and thousands like me are against I.D. cards. One
cannot compare the running of a little club like Luton Town with
those of Liverpool, Manchester United, Spurs, Arsenal and
Newcastle.

This country needs more forthright people like your goodself as
our Prime Minister seems so aloof from the 'facts of everyday
life', Hooliganism is not confined to odd football matches and
is a problem of society.




My very best wishes to you.

Yours sincerely

           Suddards. I also note from your letter that you are aiming to be as open as possible and
           therefore fair to all the parties. In the circumstances we have no objection to disclosure of our
           correspondence provided we are supplied with copies and representations made on behalf of
           the Defendants and South Yorkshire Police.

    A     Finally, in your letter of 29 July 1998 enclosing schedule of material you state that this is the
1    5    only material now in your possession. This would imply that there has been other material

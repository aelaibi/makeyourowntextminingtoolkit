FTT.E NOTE DATED 12.4.90



RE HILLSBOROUGH INQUES


          conversation with D.C. Fairfield, neutral

with him [and Superintendant Beechey] the statement from the nurses

and doctors, which they had sent up to me; these are the ones which

had been linked up to any specific bodies.     Having viewed them I

f^Lt that at least in some of the cases it was worth looking into

them a little bit further because:



       some there was su fficient information which might enable them
to identify somebody if they were presented with visual evidence and

others it might be worth asking them to think a little bit harder

before one decided that they could not help.


I realize that it would be impossible to get this done before we

 started, but even if we did get additional information whilst we

 . :re proceeding we could see whether it was worth incorporating it

 into the evidence and if so we could find a slot for it, no doubt.

NOTES
Modify this as necessary according to whether the
inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
with and partly without a jury.
In the case of a death from natural causes or from
industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date             19
rise to the immediate cause of death.
Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
Note 2 applies.
a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
  applies, it is suggested that one of the following
  forms be adopted:
  C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                        Re
  C.D. died from the industrial disease of

  C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
  on drugs.
  C.D. died from want of attention at birth.

  (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
  suggested that the following words may, where
  appropriate, be added:
  "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                     Cause of death
  care/self-neglect').

b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
  infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
  of the following forms be adopted:
  C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
  his/her mind was disturbed).

  C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
  induced abortion.                                                     Verdict
  C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
  C.D. was killed lawfully.

  Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
  further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
  arose.
c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
  it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

  C.D. was killed unlawfully.
d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
  complete the remainder of the form.

        Re:   RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.



        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue wil l be n o t i f i e d in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, n o r of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not a dversarial but
        in quisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
        u n d e r m y control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        ■witnesses w h o w i s h to give evidence.    I am at present engaged in con sid e r i n g
/       this and in determining w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

        W i t h o u t prejudice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am wr i t i n g           to you
        to give yo u an opportunity to dr aw to my atte ntio n the names and other
        a p p r o p r i a t e details of any witness or wit ne s s e s w h o m you w o u l d like me to
        c o n s i d e r calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        M a y I please ask you in co nsidering w h e t h e r you w i s h to dra w any names            to my
        attention, to bear in m ind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also w a n t to make it absolutely clear that    the s ubmission of a name or
        n a m e s for co nsideration is not hing more than that, and that the decision as
        to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

        I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        h e a r d from you by the end of September I w i l l assume you have no names to
        submit.

        Yours           thfullv,

              Dear !lr Popper,

              Tracey Cox - Hillsborough Resumed Inquests.

              I have been approached bv Mr Geoffrey Cox, the father of Tracev
              Cox of
              who has passed to me your letter of the 19th March.

              Whilst Mr Cox and his Wife do not wish to see the summary of
              evidence they have asked me to read through it and to decide
              whether there are any points which I should specifically refer
              to them.

              For this purpose I shall be grateful if you will let me have the
              summary as soon as it is available.

              For the record I have seen a copy of your letter of the 14th
              March addressed tothe Solicitors already on    record  for the
              bereaved relatives.    I think it most unlikely that Iwill be
              asked to attend the limited resumed inquest, but Ishall be
              grateful if you will  pass any further correspondence to Mr and
              Mrs Cox through me.

Bear Mr. Cox,

Thank you very much for your letter of the 27th of March.
You will probably be formally informed of the proposed
date of the limited Inquest into Tracey’s death, but I
note that neither you nor your solicitors will be there,
and we will proceed accordingly.

Yours sincerely,

H.M. Coroner.

Dear Mr. Cox,

According to our records you are not legally represented
as far as the Inquests are concerned.

In order to ensure that you are fully informed as to what
is happening, I enclose a copy of my letter dated the 14th
of March 1990 which has been addressed to the solicitors
who represent other bereaved families. The contents of
that letter are of course self-explanitory.

As you will glean from the letter, we are in the course
of preparing the summaries which will be presented to
the Inquest when it is resumed.

As I am anxious to avoid causing any additional distress,
I am on the whole reluctant to send the summary directly
to you through the post. However, I would not wish to
deprive you of the opportunity of seeing it prior to the
listing of the Inquest.

I would therefore be grateful if you could please let me know
whether there is someone who you would wish me to send this
document to, so that you can look at it should you wish to do so.

Obviously if you would prefer that it is salt directly to you
through the post, then please say so and I will arrange for this
to be done when the summary is ready.

The other matter that we need to have some information on is
whether you would wish to attend the Inquest when it has been
listed.

                                                                         cont1d

To solicitors on the record
acting for Bereaved relatives,
and to the Hillsborough Steering Committee.


Dear Sirs,

                       Limited Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough

You will of course be aware that I have decided to resume the Inquests
(on a limited basis) into the deaths of the persons who lost their
lives on 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough.

You will also be aware that the intention is to take the post mortem
evidence together with a summary of the evidence as it relates to
location of the deceased, the time of death as far as it can
reasonably be established and to clear up any minor matters such as
spelling of names.

The basic format for the inquests will be that the evidence will
be presented either by way of documentary evidence eg. post mortem
report or in the case of the summary by presentation by a West
Midlands Police officer.

The evidence will be presented in a non adversarial fashion and is
intended to give to you and in particular your client(s) non
controversial evidence as it relates to each individual deceased
which is available. I am sure that you will appreciate that the
quality and quantity of evidence which it has been possible to obtain
varies from person to person.

It must be clearly understood and it is the basis on which I have
decided to resume the inquests at this stage that no evidence will be
taken nor will questions or comments be permitted which could be
considered as attacking or criticising anybody or person incorporate
or otherwise or which could in any way be construed as obstruction or
compromising the investigation which is still being undertaken by the
DPP and on which to date no conclusion has been reached.

In order to enable you and if you so wish your client(s) to be aware
of the scope of the evidence a copy of the summary will be sent to
you as soon as possible in order to enable you to consider it and in
particular to enable you client to be prepared for the evidence.

Although it will not be possible to recast the summaries into a
different format it may that in some case there may be a particular
point which is not clear to you or there may be some question which
your client is particularly anxious about and which is not clearly
dealt with on the summary or the post mortem.

 In such a case please let me know the point or question that you wish
 to have more information on. I cannot give any undertaking that
 questions submitted can or will be dealt with but provided that the
 points or questions fall within the parameter of the resumed inquest
then they will be sympathetically considered and if it is conveniently
possible to deal with them at the hearing it will be done.

It may also be that either you or your clients may be aware of other
witnesses who are not referred to in the summaries. The case files do
not contain every witness statement which has been obtained.
Statements which are thought not to advance the evidence have been
excluded from the files prepared for me. However if you wish me to
consider any particular statement which you are aware of and which
is not mentioned in the summary please let me have details so that I
may consider it.

I think that in the majority of the cases it will not be necessary to
call the pathologist to the inquest but there may be a few cases where
a client particularly wishes to hear the pathologist in person. If
that applies to any of your clients please let me know as soon as
possible. I will then consider the evidence in the light of this
request.

I have to make it clear that under no circumstances will any South
Yorkshire Police officer be called to give oral evidence at these
resumed hearings. From my assessment of the files to date I think it
is unlikely that I will be calling any witnesses other than WMP
officers and possibly in a few cases the pathologists to give oral
evidence.

The case files are in the course of being prepared and in order to
give you as much time as possible and also to spread the load over
a period it is proposed to start sending out the summaries towards
the end of this week or the beginning of the next. A consequence of
this is that some families will be aware of the contents of the
summaries before others. I would be grateful if you would make it
clear to your client(s) particularly if they are the ones whose
summary has not yet been sent out that there is nothing sinister in
this but that it is simply a question of logistics.

I am not yet in a position to let you know when any particular inquest
will take place. I will of course try to let you have as much notice
as possible but I am sure that you will appreciate that this is quite
a complex operation and that you must be prepared for alterations in
listing information even at the last moment. I appreciate the
inconvenience that this may cause and I will try to minimise it but I
fear that it is inevitable.

In this   connection I would be grateful if you would please let my
listing   officer whose address appears on the attached sheet know
whether   you are presently aware of any of your clients who do not
wish to   attend the inquest relating to their loved one.

Please also let my listing officer know whether there are any major
committments of your clients which might make it difficult for them
to attend on any particular dates. Whilst I will try to take such
information into account it may not be possible to meet all wishes
and the final decision on timing and date will be taken by me and my
officers.


Yours faithfully,


S. L. Popper.

 Although it will not be possible to recast the summaries into a
 different format it may that in some case there may be a particular
 point which is not clear to you or there may be some question which
 your client is particularly anxious about and which is not clearly
 dealt with on the summary or the post mortem.

 In such a case please let me know the point or question that you wish
 to have more information on. I cannot give any undertaking that
 questions submitted can or will be dealt with but provided that the
 points or questions fall within the parameter of the resumed inquest
  .an they will be sympathetically considered and if it is conveniently
possible to deal with them at the hearing it will be done.

It may also be that either you or your clients may be aware of other
witnesses who are not referred to in the summaries. The case files do
not contain every witness statement which has been obtained.
Statements which are thought not to advance the evidence have been
excluded from the files prepared for me. However if you wish me to
consider any particular statement which you are aware of and which
is not mentioned in the summary please let me have details so that I
may consider it.

I think that in the majority of the cases it will not be necessary to
call the pathologist to the inquest but there may be a few cases where
a client particularly wishes to hear the pathologist in person. If
that applies to any of your clients please let me know as soon as
possible. I will then consider the evidence in the light of this
request.

I have to make it clear that under no circumstances will any South
Yorkshire Police officer be called to give oral evidence at these
resumed hearings. From my assessment of the files to date I think it
is unlikely that I will be calling any witnesses other than WMP
officers and possibly in a few cases the pathologists to give oral
evidence.

The case files are in the course of being prepared and in order to
give you as much time as possible and also to spread the load over
a period it is proposed to start sending out the summaries towards
the end of this week or the beginning of the next. A consequence of
this is that some families will be aware of the contents of the
summaries before others. I would be grateful if you would make it
clear to your client(s) particularly if they are the ones whose
summary has not yet been sent out that there is nothing sinister in
this but that it is simply a question of logistics.

I am not yet in a position to let you know when any particular inquest
will take place. I will of course try to let you have as much notice
as possible but I am sure that you will appreciate that this is quite
a complex operation and that you must be prepared for alterations in
listing information even at the last moment. I appreciate the
inconvenience that this may cause and I will try to minimise it but I
fear that it is inevitable.

 In this   connection I would be grateful if you would please let my
 listing   officer whose address appears on the attached sheet know
 whether   you are presently aware of any of your clients who do not
 wish to   attend the inquest relating to their loved one.

 Please also let my listing officer know whether there are any major
 committments of your clients which might make it difficult for them
 to attend on any particular dates. Whilst I will try to take such
 information into account it may not be possible to meet all wishes
 and the final decision on timing and date will be taken by me and my
 officers.

 and to the Hillsborough Steering Committee.


 Dear Sirs,

                     Linn ted Resumed Inquests ^ Hillsborough

 You will of course be aware that I have decided to resume the Inquests
 (on a limited basis) into the deaths of the persons who lost their
 lives on 15th April 1989 at Hillsborough*

 You will also be aware that the intention is to take the post mortem
.evidence together with a summary of the evidence as it relates to
 location of the deceased,'the time of death as far as it can
 reasonably be established and to clear up any minor matters such as
 spelling of names.

 The basic format for the inquests will be that the evidence will
 be presented either by way of documentary evidence eg. post mortem
 report or in the case of the summary by presentation by a West
 Midlands Police officer.

 The evidence will be presented in a non adversarial fashion and is
 intended to give to you and in particular your client(s) non
 controversial evidence as it relates to each individual deceased
 which is available. I am sure that you will appreciate that the
 quality and quantity of evidence which it has been possible to obtain
 varies from person to person.

  It must be clearly understood and it is the basis: on which I have
x decided to resume the inquests at this stage that no evidence will be
)taken nor will questions or comments be permitted which could be
  considered as attacking or criticising anybody or person incorporate
  or otherwise or which could in any way be construed as obstruction or
  compromising the investigation which is still being undertaken by the
  DPP and on which to date no conclusion has been reached.

 In order to enable you and if you so wish your client(s) to be aware
 of the scope of the evidence a copy of the summary will be sent to
 you as soon as possible in order to enable you to consider it and in
 particular to enable you client to be prepared for the evidence.

 Although it will not be possible to recast the summaries into a
 different format it may that in some case there may be a particular
 point which is not clear to you or there may be some question which
 your client is particularly anxious about and which is not clearly
 dealt with on the summary or the post mortem.
                                      .t
 In. such a case please let me know the point or question that you wish
 to have more information on. I cannot give any undertaking that

Mr, G.C. Co*.__________




Bear Mr. Cox,
Be:      T M Q M ELIZABBfH COX (decease*).

As fax as I am aware, you are not legally represented in respect
of the Inquest into the death of the above named.

I am writing to let you know that although it has been in
my rn-tnfl to resume the adjourned Inquest on the 15th of January
1990, I have had to review my thinking on this.

 You will be aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 has been asked t& look into the circumstances, and I have
 decided that I will not be able to resume the Inquests for
 some considerable time as I will have to review the matter                                           \
 some time after the Director of Public Prosecutions has
 announced what action if any, he would want to take.

 I will be in touch with you again regarding this when I am
 able to do so, but you should anticipate that there will be
 some considerable delay before I am in a position to say
 anything definitive.

 Whilst writing to you, I have had numerous requests for copies
 of post mortem reports from solicitors representing other
 deceased persons.

 Whilst the release of the post mortem reports presents certain
 difficulties I have decided that subject to certain safeguards,
 I am prepared to release a copy to solicitors acting for the
 bereaved, or where that is not appropriate or convenient, to
 medical practitioners.

 Should you wish me to communicate with your G.P. (or other medical
 practitioner) with a view to letting him have a copy of the post mortem
 report so that he may be able to go through it with you, I would
 be grateful if you could please let me know.

 It would also be helpful if you could set out clearly the name
 and address of the doctor involved.

 Finally, if you were to move house before the resumption of the
 Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please let me have a
 note of your change of address, so that I may be able to keep
 in touch with you as and when necessary.

 Tours sincerely,
                                                       S.L.Po-p-per. 5.M.Coroner.

I took          the decision to go to the Hospital                                            in the A m b ulance             to assist

the      crew and take details                               of      injured persons arriving.

Once       at     the Hospital                  two u n i formed officers were                             taking a n              details; so

I returned                  immediately to the ground and. the Leppings Lane                                                  end.            By

                    All        the          people         coming   out    seemed    to be blaming       the Police     for their

                    actions                 and saying         things      such as?      ’YOU *VE E A R N T FUCK I N G B L O O D MONEY

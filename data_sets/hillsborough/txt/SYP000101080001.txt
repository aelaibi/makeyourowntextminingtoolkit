I reported for duty at R a w m a r s h Police                         S t a tion at 8.00 a.m. on Saturday,

15     April      1989,       at     this    time,        I    was     in    full      Police     uniform.       I   was

conveyed       directly          to H i l l s b o r o u g h Football         G r o und   by    Force    coach,   to be

Followi ng       the     briefi ng      in   the N o r t h          Stand    at    the F o o tball     Ground,   I was

de p loyed w i t h the "rest of m y serial                      in R a wson S pring Road,              an industrial

estate      near     to    the     bottom    of     Herries          Road.        At   11.15    a.m,   that    date,    I

took     up    my      p o s ition     to    d irect          the    Nottingham          Forest    contingent,         to

suitable p a rking p la ces a l l o c a t e d w i t h i n the indus t r i a l estate.

The football           fans    I saw were         conducting           themselves         in a g o o d n a t u r e d and

lighthearted             mariner,       with        the       majority        of       fans     parking       up early

  were        a l m o st-        deserted.                        There       was       the       odd       late       arriver          to       the    ground,

  but      the          numbers               were          not        so    great          as    to       cause       any    problems.                 The       next

  stage           of       our       duty          weas           to    attend          Claywheels                Lane       Traffic             Office       for

  meal       and           following                this,              we    were       to       be    on    standby          duties             outside          the

  ground              on    the       Penistone                    Road       end.

  At     about             3.05       pm       that              date       I was       stood          with       the    rest       of       my    serial             at       ti'

  shop.               We    were          approached                    by    a    Superintendent,                      who       had    just          emerged

  from       the           football                ground,              he    immediately                   ordered          us    into          the    ground.

  Inspector                 NEWEY             who       were           both       in    possession                of    Police          radios.              As       I

  approached                    the       playing                 area       from       the       entrance             between          the       North       Stand

 and       Spion            Kop,          I    saw          the        players          leaving             the    pitch          and    a       large       crowd

  of     spectators                   on       the          pitch           round       the       Leppings             Lane       end    of       the

  ground.                  My    immediate                       thoughts          were          that       there       had       been       a    pitch

  invasion                 by    the          Liverpool                 fans.           I    then          ran    across          the    pitch          to    offer

 my      assistance,                      there             were        a    few       Police          Officers          present             but       not    a

  great           number.                      ^

 As      I moved                closer             to       the        goalmouth,                I was       still       under          the       impression

  that       the           Liverpool                fans           had       invaded             the       pitch.        It       was    then          that       I

  heard           a    shout          from          a       fan        that       people          were       dying       in       there,          and    it       was

 at      this          point          I       realised                 the    full          horror          of    what       was    happening.                    From

  only       a        couple          of. f e e t                away       from       the       perimeter             fence,       I    could          see

  people              were       already                dead,           others          were          turning          blue       and    some          were

 having               difficulty                   breathing.

 I     then           with       a    group             of        other       officers,                started          to    shout          to    the

 supporters                     to    move          back           but       there       was          no    movement.              Everything                was          in

 chaos,               there          was       no       guidance              in       what       to       do.     Spectators                in    trying

to escape the crush, w ere s t e pping on bodies to lever themselves over the

perimeter        fence.        Police         O f f icers   were    s t a rting       to pull        specta t o r s   over

the     fence,     many       of    which       were    injured         or    dead,     as    these       persons     were

pu l l e d over I s t a r t e d to dra g the bodies from the p i t c h s u r r o u n d onto the

playing      service         where       other     o fficers       and       medica l    staff       were      trying      to

resuscitate           the    injured.           This    task     was made         all    the more         difficult        by

the     Liverpool           fans    who       understandably            w anted    their       own     relatives          and

friends       a t t e nding        to,    and    tried      to    pull       us   away       from     where      we   were

dealing.

I s t a y e d near to the p e r i m e t e r fence and c o n t i n u e d to carry bodies to the

playing      s u r f a c e , whe re      by     this    time     both    Police       O f f ic ers    and    spectators

alike were c a r r y i n g b odies on s t r e t c h e r s made from a d v e r t i s i n g hoardings.

Af t e r what seemed an a g e , I s w apped places w i t h a n oth er o f f i c e r as I felt

ph y s i c a l l y e x h a u s t e d a n d I felt I c o u l d do n o more.

I then under           the    instructio n         of    a high     r a nking      officer h e l p e d         in trying

to m o v e s p e c t a t o r s from the p l a y i n g surface to the s a n c tuary of the North

Stand,     this p roved            futile     as spect a t o r s    r e fused      to go.        W h e n the terrace

was    clear,     I    tried       unsuccessfully           to    re-join my          serial,        I then attac hed

myself to other C2 officers to await f u r t h e r instructions,                                      it was at this

point     that    we    were       told     to form a c ordon at               the halfway line              and not       to

let a n y body through to the Spion Kop end.

At    approximately           4.30 p.m.         I returned        to R awson Spring R o a d               to assist in

the    removal        of     the    Nottingham          Forest     fans.          From       there    I     r e t urned    to

C l a y w h e e l s Lane,    then bac k to R a w m a r s h Police Station.                      I b o o k e d o f f duty

at 7-30 p.m.          that date.

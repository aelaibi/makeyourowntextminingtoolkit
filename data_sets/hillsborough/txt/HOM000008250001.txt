              From:   Sir Richard Barratt, CBE, QPM.




                                                       5th July 1989.




              HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

     The comprehensive submission which you kindly sent to me
with your letter of 29th June 1989, will, I am sure be of great
benefit to The Rt. Hon. Lord Justice Taylor and his assessors in
their important deliberations.     I will not trouble you for
further copies at this stage but I will let my Inspectorate
colleagues know the main features of it and that a full copy of
the ACPO submission is available at my office.




C J Anderton Esq., CBE, CStJ, QPM, DL, CBIM.
Chief Constable,
Greater Manchester Police.

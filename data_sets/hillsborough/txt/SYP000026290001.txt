                 The Hillsborough Disaster
                 SHEFFIELD
                 West Yorkshire




                 Dear Sir

                 I enclose a copy of a letterwhich I wrote to Mr. Kenneth Clarke M.P.
                 Minister of Health, on 10th May 1989.   You may well receive a copy of
                 this letter via Mr. Clarke.

                 Would you please record this as one of the many letters you receive^
                 regarding the Hillsborough Disaster.  I apologise for not sending it
                 direct to the Tribunal and apologise for the apparent discourtesy,
                 but immediately after the disaster and even before the Tribunal was
                 appointed, I in fact telephoned Mr. Clarke's office to see whether
                 he would receive a letter from me, as I was deeply concerned over the
                 obvious and apparent lack of proper policing outside the ground.

                 Having telephoned to see whether he would receive the letter and deal
                 with it appropriately, I felt that it should still be sent to him out
                 of courtesy but having prepared an original draft, I am afraid that I
                 could not bring myself, with the horrors of that day, to finish it
                 immediately and it took me some weeks on and off to finalise what I
                 really wanted to say. Hence the delay in the date.      I felt I should
                 send a copy direct direct to you, as it could be a few weeks before
                 Mr. Clarke gets the opportunity of going through personal correspondence
                 with his pressing demands in other directions, but as I mentioned,
                 please excuse my apparent discourtesy in not writing direct to the
                 Tribunal initially. I am sure you will understand how that came about.

that there was a wall. There was a mass of fans (so deep and long it seemed
endless) queuing as best they could right up onto the bridge (which was
opposite to our approach) and I could not see any evidence of effective
police supervision.  I looked again and I realised that there was a wall
separating the standing accommodation admittance (which the fans on the
bridge were queuing for) and the stand accommodation.   The latter was bad
enough, the former was just appalling. UJe decided to try to get into the
stand as I felt we were reasonably alright as our queue was nothing like
the other as the turnstiles for the stand and standing accommodation were
separated by the wall. We went towards the gate which admitted us to the
stand and once we got near the gate the crush started. It was one of the
most terrifying few minutes of my life. We headed as best we could for
a centre turnstile hoping that as we were forced one way or the other we
would avoid the flanks.   In all my years I have never been so frightened
and had my wife and son follow me with hands on shoulders. 'Once we were
inside the gates there were no police whatsoever apart from one on a horse
who could do nothing and I can still see a grey haired policewoman (or was
she platinum) saying "My God who is doing what here".   I could still identify
her as I saw her again after the match looking very upset. We got into
the ground somehow but my wife was trembling from head to foot and even
my 16 year old son said "I'll never go in that again",   fit the time I said
this is nothing compared to what the other side must be like. There is
just no control at all. Even in our side there were people from the standing
accommodation side forcing their way through to try to get into the ground
and one sensible policeman on top of the wall was helping them over.    I
am not critisising him in any way but that just showed the extent of the
shambles. On our side of the gate there was nothing like the force of the
crowd that was behind the people trying to get into the standing accommodation.
I felt sorry for the few police officers who were there. They had absolutely
on chance. What surprised me also was that there were no police noticeably
immediately inside the ground when we got in which I will mention later.

Having arrived at that ground at 2.15 p.m. we managed to get into our seats
at 3.05 p.m.  I ask you to note my comment regarding the route march above
which certainly did not help.  I think one point the Tribunal will find
worth examining is the approach to the ground.  If the same attitude was
adopted with regard to the people trying to get into the standing accommodation
as was adopted with regard to us, then if they too were sent on a route
march that could well have been the cause or one of the causes of the massive
build up.  It was massive. There is no other word for it. I have never
seen anything worse. Another point the Tribunal I feel might examine in
relation to the build up is the number of turnstiles.  There were not enough
turnstiles to cope and that surely added to the problems of the build up.
This ground does not carry large support and I must pose a "Haysel" question
as to why what seemed to me to be an out of date ground (even if it is restricted
to just one area) could be considered for a match of this size, and if it
was why the danger in that obvious and particular area was not guarded against.

 It was noticeable when we got to our seats before there was any problem
 that there were vociferous comments about the lack of police presence outside
 the ground by all the supporters around us in the stand. There was a total
 seething feeling that the lack of control by the police was unbelievable.
 One supporter near me remarked that everybody had been "herded like cattle
 into a bottleneck". Once the bottleneck had been achieved the control point
 should have been there but there was no control whatsoever - no marshalling
 - nothing. A supporter near me said that there should have been police
 across the roads at least 100 yards short of the ground to ensure that only
 fans with tickets got through and also that from that point the police should
 have ensured that everybody was properly marshalled into lines. The same
 supporter also commented that if that had happened then the police could
 easily have arranged for the kick off to be postponed as they would have
had control of the queues and would have known how long it would take the
fans to get into the ground.   It is simple to postpone a kick off and I
cannot understand why that was not done. It was obvious to anyone in the
crowd outside the ground at 2.45 p.m. (e.g. us) that the fans on the bridge
could not possibly get in for at least three quarters of an hour with normal
queuing. Why then did the police not order the postponement.    Even on our
"stand side" there was obvious hysteria as kick off approached to get in.
It was obvious that if only in fairness to supporters who had paid to see
the match, it should have been delayed. Our more gentle side was bad enough
but the strong young men looking to get into the standing accommodation
really were desperate and pushing hard. What the crush was like outside
that area must have been terrifying.   The problem having developed something
should have been done. The police had hopelessly lost control and all that
could be done then was to postpone the kick off to take the pressure off.
Word that the kick off had been postponed would have calmed everybody down.
I must say I did not see any evidence of drunkeness outside the ground either
on the approach to the ground or in the queues.   I think it was only desperation
as far as I could see that was causing people to press so hard to try to
get in.

When the crowd started to spill on the pitch, it was obvious to us from
the stand above that there was very serious trouble.  The extent of the
disaster however was totally unknown to us in the stand but there was one
mood in the stand which came over loud and strong and that was a resentment
of police lack of control of the crowd outside the ground.  Although the
people around us had no idea of the extent of the disaster, the whole mood
was why hadn't the police properly controlled the crowds outside and this
should never have happened and would not have happened if there had been
proper crowd control.  Indeed throughout even before the trouble started
there were criticisms severe and unanimous.  It was the talking point in
the stand even when the game had just started and immediately before the
problems developed. Every single person in and around were blaming lack
of police control for discomfort, for crushing, and for problems outside
the ground.

As the disaster unfolded my actual immediate concern was for my eldest son
who I knew was in the stand below, and who I knew always went to the centre
of the Kop. However looking at the people on the pitch I could tell he
was not there and thought that luckily he was out of danger.  It was not
until the three of us were walking back to our car that we heard that at
least 60 people had been killed and then we realised the disaster was much
greater than we had thought. Why had nobody informed us of the extent of
the problems. Football supporters are human beings and should be treated
as such.

Anguish then set   in for us particularly, as    we    heard thatthe main problems
were in the central section of the standing      area and we know^ weir that he
arrives early on the Kop with his friends and always stands in the centre.
We knew he would   be in the centre section. We were given the emergency
telephone number   by a policeman and started    to    try that.We could no g
through from 5.30 p.m. We tried the hospitals and couldn t get through.
We called at one hospital where everyone was so sho^ d    but helpful.     y
showed us the injured list but could not get through themselves to theother
hospital. We left Sheffield at 7.00 p.m. in desperation not knowing whether
our eldest son was alive, injured or dead. We have the advantage of a car
telephone and at last found he was safe at 8.00 p.m., but what X want to
say is that even with the advantage of a car telephone (i.e. no call boxes;
we could not get through to the emergency number dialling every 5 minutes
- so if there is a disaster do we not think there should be an effective
emergency number - I even tried it at 10.30 p.m. from home without success.
How must those people have felt trying to get information.    I shall never
forget not knowing and trying that number so ineffectively. May we learn
a lesson that there should be somewhere where there is an emergency centre,
be it London or wherever so that if there is a national emergency ofany
type a proper and effective emergency number is given.

When I managed to speak to my son at about 11 .00 p.m. that night he c°uld
hardly speak.  He had been in more or less the place where most people had
been desperately crushed. He had been on the ground an hour before the
kick off, and about 15 minutes before the kick off his friends suggested
they should move farther back as' they would get a better view of the far
qoal. That they did, and they avoided the crush but I mention that because
the middle terrace was not terribly packed even 15 minutes before the kick
off. Why? was it because the turnstiles were inadequate to admit or had
everyone been sent on a route march.   Surely all those fans simply did not
arrive on block just 15 minutes before the kick off. The queue was too
long and too deep. Either they had been directed in such a way that they
all arrived at the same time (like ourselves a 30 minute route march) or
the turnstiles simply could not cope.

I feel deeply for the officer who ordered the gates to be open. On his
behalf or to him may I say that if the crush which my wife, and son and
I experienced "the mini crush" outside the stand for the stand seats is
anything to go by some 15 minutes before the kick off, the situation outside
the turnstiles for admittance to the standing accommodation must have turned
into sheer hell as kick off time approached and did approach.  I am certain
he opened those gates believing (as could well have been the case) that
people were going to be crushed to death outside. We found our "mini crush
terrifying.  The weight of the crush from that enormous queue that went
up onto the bridge at 2.45 p.m. must by 3.00 p.m. have been almost unbearable,
It must be remembered of course that they were the younger people, stronger
and even more fanatical. To them to miss the kick off must have brought
near panic. Obviously that officer had a dramatic instant decision to make.
It resulted in disaster in the ground but who knows what could have happened
if he had not taken the action he did.  It is easy to say he should have^
blocked off the central entrance. That is obviously a matter quite outside
my knowledge but I would ask the Tribunal to consider how many policemen
were available to him inside the ground. Certainly on our side we saw none
once we were inside the ground itself. Could he have really called within
seconds or a minute on a realistic force to block that tunnel.  Were there
sufficient reinforcements available as there should have been to control
vunerable point? Again a matter I think of police foresight. UJhat other
gate on the ground, may I ask could possibly have been attacked on the ground
other than the one in this stand.  I realise it was opened as opposed to
being broken down but the former is always a possibility at football matches
and this must have been the vunerable area which should have been protected.
I would also mention that my son as I have mentioned earlier moved easily
within the central section for some 15 minutes before the kick off so that
the section itself may not have been obviously full to the officer making
the decision. At one point my son pointed out that was not obvious to me
was that the fans were all "penned". He said that if they had not been
everybody would simply have spread out. I am sure that is an obvious point
to the enquiry.  It was only after he had mentioned it that re-living the
minds eye I could see the end pens with very few people in it the centre
ones being the problem areas.

There have been suggestions of police abuss from the fans.  I certainly
saw none before the game. The relationship between fans and police was
fine until the immediate panic around the fated stand.  I have already referred
to the comments of spectators around me about the lack of police presence
outside the entrance even before the trouble started.  There was even more
vociferous criticism when the police cordoned the whole width of the field
and the immediate reaction in the stand all around me was "where the hell
did they all come from". They should have been outside. Where have they
been hiding etc. etc.

I also consider as quite significant the point which my son made to me.
For several days he said nothing he was so deeply shocked because when
the crowds moved away after all the problems all he saw were bodies on the
ground "I was 30 feet away Dad and I didn't realise anybody had been killed".
When he did speak about the disaster he simply said that the previous year
there had been a police cordon of the type I had mentioned (before I even
got into the ground)across the bridge, or thereabouts.  At that point tickets
were being checked and then the fans put into orderly queues. He said there
was no trouble although it was slow getting in.  However with police presence
the slowness was controlled.  If that worked effectively that year why was
it not repeated. Why did the senior officers in charge of the policing
not follow that policy again this year? If they had I am sure this problem
would not have occurred.  As I have said very few of the most ardent Koppites
brave a police cordon with adequate horses and then a proper police controlled
queue. They are used to it at Anfield and accept it.

In proferring an opinion for this disaster, there were obviously many contributory
factors such as the fact that fans could not escape onto the pitch, the
fact that they were penned, etc., which are only too clear, but in assessing
the situation it could not possibly have been put down to fans drunkenesss
(I certainly did not see any), it could not be put down to the individual
policemen posted in and around the ground, they were doing all that they
could, it must surely rest with the senior officers in charge of planning
this crowd control, and I cannot see any way in which they can possibly
pass the buck onto anyone else not even the ground.  The senior officers
or officer planning the strategy knew the ground well, he must have known
its achilles heel could only be at this particular point. There was the
experience of the previous year when the large crowd was well controlled,
checked before it reached this sensitive area and therefore the previous
year they must have been aware of the potential danger. They knew or ought
to have known that fans would arrive without tickets. T h e y k e w or ought
to have known that large numbers would arrive at the last minute. Whether
the police themselves contributed to that by a "route march on both sides
of the stadium such as the one we faced on our side, I do not know, but
that could have been a contributory factor to the crowd build up, The
policeman planning this crowd control, knew or ought to have known that
he could virtually ignore the stand entrances at the side of the ground
and the Nottingham Forest end of the Kop. The forces should have been
concentrated where they were blatantly needed. Not only at that point was
the entrances to the turnstiles very restricted, the turnstile numbers were
restricted, that was where the largest number of the most f&natical fans
were going to arrive, that was where they were under subscribed for tickets
and therefore most likely to have ticketless fans arriving and yet there
seemed to be absolutely no effective police presence.    In fact I have never
seen a less effective police presence anywhere.    I would be interested to
know how many policemen were assigned to that area as opposed to the total
number in and around the stadium.   From what we saw in and around that area
as opposed to the number who were spread across the pitch, I would think
the proportion to be unbelievably low. Whether it was low or not, it was
a question of control and it was just not there. If some fans in the shock
and horror of it all took it outon individual policemen with abuse etc.,
it is sad but only to be understood.   I am sure if you ask anybody who was
unfortunate enough to enter the ground through those turnstiles on that
day they will all complain of the lack of police presence and proper control,
and nuturally when the disaster occurred it was those they turned on.
Effectively I am quite sure they were turning on the wrong people.       It was
not the fault of the individual.    It must surely have been the fault of
the senior officers.   I can only describe the total lack of police control
at this vunerable point as gross. It might be that those with the benefit
of all the facts as opposed to my relative fleeting personal view may find
otherwise but I would be very surprised.

Incidentally even before the game many of us had asked why Hillsborough
and not Old Trafford where the ground facilities are far superior and the
police were used to large crowds. What particularly attracted to Hillsborough?
This must surely be questions in the general context for the future i.e.
that the best appointed grounds should take the games as opposed to some
old fashioned vested interest.

I am sorry this is such a long letter Ken but it was an awful day.   I think
that the nation appreciates the sympathy extended to all the fans who lost
their lives and their families and the unity of Merseyside was quite heart
rending.  I am not the best of queuers but my wife and I felt we could not
really be anywhere else the following Saturday but flnfield and we joined
the queue at 1.15 p.m. We eventually got into the ground four and a quarter
hours later to leave our few flowers.  The queue never broke although it
started raining. The queue was subdued.   There was little talk, there was
no humour, there was just a deep feeling of sadness.   The response of the
people to this tragedy showed in so many ways one of the great strengths

Thank you very much for sending me your recent letter.  It was
good to hear from you again and I hope that you are thriving
m

I was, however, appalled to read of the experience which
caused you to write to me.  I am very sorry that you went
through such a horrendous experience at the football match at
Hillsborough.

I have read very carefully your account of the crowd control
by the police at the ground.   It seemed to me that the right
thing to do was to sfend your letter on to Lord Justice Taylor,
who is carrying out the present enquiry, and who will have the
duty of making recommendations to ensure that the risks of
anything of this kind occuring again are reduced to the
minimum.  I have no doubt that he and his team will be very
concerned by your account of events.

I do hope that your son is now recovered from his ordeal.   I
am sorry that such a tragic event was the occasion for us
getting in touch with each other again.

Clerk to the Tribunal
The Hillsborough Oisaster
SHEFFIELD

Dear Sir

I enclose a copy of a letter which I wrote to Mr. KSnneth Clarke M.P.
Minister of Health, on 10th May 1989. You may well receive a copy of
this letter via Mr. Clarke.

Would you please record this as one of the many letters you receive
regarding the Hillsborough Disaster.    I apologise for not sending
it direct to the Tribunal and apologise for the apparent discourtesy,
but immediately after the disaster and even before the Tribunal was
appointed I in fact telephoned    5Clarke’s office to see whether
he would receive a letter from me as I was deeply concerned over the
obvious and apparent lack of proper policing outside the ground.

Having telephoned to see whether he would receive the letter and deal
with it appropriately, I felt that it should still be sent to him out
of courtesy but having prepared an original draft I am afraid that I
could1nt bring myself, with the horrors of that day, to finish it
immediately and it took me some weeks on and off to finalise what I
really wanted to say. Hence the delay in the date. I felt I should
send a copy direct to you, as it could be a few weeks before Mr.
Clarke gets the opportunity of going through personal correspondence
with his pressing demands in other directions, but as I mentioned,
please excuse my apparent discourtesy in not writing direct to
the Tribunal direct. I am sure you will understand how that came about.


Yours truly

    It is a matter which the police are well aware of long before any big game
    and it is a simple, straightforward fact that needs to be catered for and
    usually is.  I consider it to be totally naive for any police force to say
    that the blame for any crowd trouble at any big ground can be placed on
    the supporters who arrive without tickets. They well know in advance that
    they will arrive and on that basis they are fore-warned that that particular
    problem can most easily be catered for by a police cordon away from the
    ground which permits only those showing tickets to move through.  Even hardened
    Kopites would not take on a strategically placed police horse or a posse
    of policemen across a street.

    Returning to that very sad day at Hillsborough.    As you are well aware it
    dawned a beautiful day.    I had stand tickets in the Lepping Lane stand for
    myself, my wife and my 16 year old son (fortunately he could not get one
    with   his elder brother in the standing section below us and deigned to come
    with us rather than miss the game). UJe left home in good time and, in fact,
    we saw our eldest on at the Stockport roundabout in his van with his friends.
    We all waved to each other. My eldest son (a confirmed Koppite aged 21)
    had his usual ticket behind the goal in the facted standing enclosure.
    The atmosphere between the fans who were travelling was magnificent. The
    drive to Sheffield was long and patient.    It was more of a carnival atmosphere
    than   anything. We arrived in Sheffield at 1.30 p.m. We parked our car
    far away from the ground and the three of us walked for three quarters of
    an hour to Hillsborough.    All that time, there were Liverpool and Nottingham
    Forest supporters mixing and I saw not a jot of trouble.    There were hardly
    any police around but it was not necessary.    The atmosphere between the
    supporters was as fine as I have ever known at any important semi-final
    game.

    We arrived at the front* of Hillsborough (the opposite side to our stand)
    at 2.15 p.m. To me this was obviously plenty of time to get into the match.
    This was when the problems started.   We were then sent by the police on
    a route march (which is the only way I can describe it) from the front of
    Hillsborough (facing the ground) off to the right. We then passed a whole
    series of streets which were barricaded.   All those streets could have been
    barricaded to the extent of just allowing a few supporters through each
    street at a time but they were barricaded off completely.   Those accessible
    streets would have acted as a filter and could easily have been policed.
    As it was all the fans who arrived at the front of the ground like ourselves
    were herded all the way round the route march. The filter system which
    would have killed a lotof crowd congestion was barred.    We reached the
    apex of the route march at about 2.30 p.m. and met others coming from the
    opposite direction. We then had to walk the same distance back passing
    the barricaded streets and at about 2.45 p.m. arrived near the entrance.
    When we were approximately 50 yards short of the entrance the queues came
    into view.  As soon as I saw it I actually stopped in my tracks and said
    to my wife words to the effect of "My God where on earch are the police
    what on earth is happening, we are not going in there". We walked a little
    farther forward towards the heaving mass which was in no way under any sort
    of control.  I stopped again and remember saying to my wife and son "This
    is ridiculoua in this confined space there should have been barriers at
    least 50 yards away from those turnstiles to check tickets and control
    everybody and get them in line".   I asked them to stay where they were for
    a moment and went forward to have a look what was happening.   I then realised




    Continued/.
                                - 3 -




that there was a wall. There was a mass of fans (so deep and long it seemed
endless) queuing as best they could right up onto the bridge (which was
opposite to our approach) and I could not see any evidence of effective
police supervision.  I looked again and I realised that there was a wall
separating the standing accommodation admittance (which the fans on the
bridge were queuing for) and the stand accommodation. The latter was bad
enough, the former was just appalling. UJe decided to try to get into the
stand as I felt we were reasonably alright as our queue was nothing like
the other as the turnstiles for the stand and standing accommodation were
separated by the wall. We went towards the gate which admitted us to the
stand and once we got near the gate the crush started. It was one of the
most terrifying few minutes of my life. We headed as best we could for
a centre turnstile hoping that as we were forced one way or the other we
would avoid the flanks.  In all my years I have never been so frightened
and had my wife and son follow me with hands on shoulders.   Once we were
inside the gates there were no police whatsoever apart from one on a horse
who could do nothing and I can still see a grey haired policewoman (or was
she platinum) saying "My God who is doing what here".   I could still identify
her as I saw her again after the match looking very upset. We got into
the ground somehow but my wife was trembling from head to foot and even
my 16 year old son said "I'll never go in that again".   At the time I said
this is nothing compared to what the other side must be like. There is
just no control at all.   Even in our side there were people from the standing
accommodation side forcing their way through to try to get into the ground
and one sensible policeman on top of the wall was helping them over.   I
am not critisising him in any ,way but that just showed the extent of the
shambles.  On our side of the gate there was nothing like the force of the
crowd that was behind the people trying to get into the standing accommodation.
I felt sorry for the few police officers who were there.   They had absolutely
on chance. What surprised me also was that there were no police noticeably
immediately inside the ground when we got in which I will mention later.

Having arrived at that ground at 2.15 p.m. we managed to get into our seats
at 3.05 p.m.  I ask youto note my comment   regarding the route march above
which certainly did not help.   I think one point the Tribunal will find
worth examining is the approach to the ground.   If the same attitude was
adopted with regard to the people trying to get into the standing accommodation
as was adopted with regard to us, then if they too were sent on a route
march that could well have been the cause or one of the causes of the massive
build up.  It was massive. There is no other word for it.    I have never
seen anything worse.  Another point the Tribunal I feel might examine in
relation to the build up is the number of turnstiles.   There were not enough
turnstiles to cope and that surely added to the problems of the build up.
This ground does not carry large support and I must pose a "Haysel" question
as to why what seemed to me to be an out of date ground (even if it is restricted
to just one area) could be considered for a match of this size, and if it
was why the danger in that obvious and particular area was not guarded against.

  It was noticeable when we got to our seats before there was any problem
  that there were vociferous comments about the lack of police presence outside
  the ground by all the supporters around us in the stand. There was a total
  seething feeling that the lack of control by the police was unbelievable.
  One supporter near me remarked that everybody had been "herded like cattle
  into a bottleneck". Once the bottleneck had been achieved the control point
 should have been there but there was no control whatsoever - no marshalling
  - nothing.   A supporter near me said that there should have been police
 across the roads at least 100 yards short of the ground to ensure that only
 fans with tickets got through and also that from that point the police should
 have ensured that everybody was properly marshalled into lines. The same
 supporter also commented that if that had happened then the police could
 easily have arranged for the kick off to be postponed as they would have
 had control of the queues and would have known how long it would take the
 fans to get into the ground.   It is simple to postpone a kick off and I
 cannot understand why that was not done.   It was obvious to anyone in the
 crowd outside the ground at 2.45 p.m. (e.g. us) that the fans on the bridge
 could not possibly get in for at least three quarters of an hour with normal
queuing. Why then did the police not order the postponement.     Even on our
 "stand side" there was obvious hysteria as kick off approached to get in.
 It was obvious that if only in fairness to supporters who had paid to see
the match, it should have been delayed.    Our more gentle side was bad enough
but the strong young men looking to get into the standing accommodation
really were desperate and pushing hard. What the crush was like outside
that area must have been terrifying. The problem having developed something
should have been done. The police had hopelessly lost control and all that
could be done then was to postpone the kick off to take the pressure off.
Word that the kick off had been postponed would have calmed everybody down.
I must say I did not see any evidence of drunkeness outside the ground either
on the approach to the ground or in the queues.    I think it was only desperation
as far as I could see that was causing people to press so hard to try to
get in.

When the crowd started to spill on the pitch, it was obvious to us from   •'
 the stand above that there was very serious trouble.  The extent of the
disaster however was totally unknown to us in the stand but there was one
mood in the stand which came over loud and strong and that was a resentment
of police lack of control of the crowd outside the ground.   Although the
people around us had no idea of the extent of the disaster, the whole mood
was why hadn't the police properly controlled the crowds outside and this
should never have happened and would not have happened if there had been
proper crowd control.   Indeed throughout even before the trouble started
there were criticisms severe and unanimous.   It was the talking point in
the stand even when the game had just started and immediately before the
problems developed.   Every single person in and around were blaming lack
of police control for discomfort, for crushing, and for problems outside
the ground.

As the disaster unfolded my actual immediate concern was for my eldest son
who I knew was in the stand below, and who I knew always went to the centre
of the Kop. However looking at the people on the pitch I could tell he
was not there and thought that luckily he was out of danger.  It was not
until the three of us were walking back to our car that we heard that at
least 60 people had been killed and then we realised the disaster was much
greater than we had thought. Why had nobody informed us of the extent of
the problems.  Football supporters are human beings and should be treated
as such.

Anguish then set in for us particularly, as     we     heard thatthe main problems
were in the central section of the standing area and we know well that he
arrives early on the Kop with his friends and always stands in the centre.
UJe knew he would be in the centre section. We were given the emergency
telephone number   by a policeman and started   to    try that.We could not get
through from 5.30 p.m. We tried the hospitals and couldn't get through.
We called at one hospital where everyone was so shocked but helpful. They
showed us the injured list but could not get through themselves to the other
hospital. We left Sheffield at 7.00 p.m. in desperation not knowing whether
our eldest son was alive, injured or dead. We have the advantage of a car
telephone and at last found he was safe at 8.00 p.m., but what I want to
say is that even with the advantage of a car telephone (i.e. no call boxes)
we could not get through to the emergency number dialling every 5 minutes
- so if there is a disaster do we not think there should be an effective
emergency number - I even tried it at 10.30 p.m. from home without success.
How must those people have felt trying to get information.   I shall never
forget not knowing and trying that number so ineffectively.   (Ylay we learn
a lesson that there should be somewhere where there is" an emergency centre,
be it London or wherever so that if there is a national emergency of any
type a proper and effective emergency number is given.

When I managed to speak to my son at about 11.00 p.m. that night he could
hardly speak.  He had been in more or less the place where most people had
been desperately crushed.  He had been on the ground an hour before the
kick off, and about 15 minutes before the kick off his friends suggested
they should move farther back as they would get a better view of the far
goal. That they did, and they avoided the crush but I mention that because
the middle terrace was not terribly packed even 15 minutes before the kick
off. Why? was it because,the turnstiles were inadequate to admit or had
everyone been sent on a route march.  Surely all those fans simply did, not
arrive on block just 15 minutes before the kick off. The queue was too
long and too deep. Either they had been directed in such a way that they
all arrived at the same time (like ourselves a 30 minute route march) or
the turnstiles simply could not cope.

I feel deeply for the officer who ordered the gates to be open. On his
behalf or to him may I say that if the crush which my wife, and son and
I experienced "the mini crush" outside the stand for the stand seats is
anything to go by some 15 minutes before the kick off, the situation outside
the turnstiles for admittance to the standing accommodation must have turned
into sheer hell as kick off time approached and did approach.   I am certain
he opened those gates believing (as could well have been the case) that
people were going to be crushed to death outside.   We found our "mini crush"
terrifying.  The weight of the crush from that enormous queue that went
up onto the bridge at 2.45 p.m. must by 3.00 p.m. have been almost unbearable.
It must be remembered of course that they were the younger people, stronger
and even more fanatical. To them to miss the kick off must have brought
near panic.  Obviously that officer had a dramatic instant decision to make.
It resulted in disaster in the ground but who knows what could have happened
if he had not taken the action he did.   It is easy to say he should have
blocked off the central entrance.  That is obviously a matter quite outside
my knowledge but I would ask the Tribunal to consider how many policemen
were available to him inside the ground.   Certainly on our side we saw none
once we were inside the ground itself.   Could he have really called within
seconds or a minute on a realistic force to block that tunnel. Were there
sufficient reinforcements available as there should have been to control
matters inside the ground if a gate was opened or broken down at this very

(—_____   i/

                                                                          »
vunerable point? Again a matter I think of police foresight. UJhat other
gate on the ground, may I ask could possibly have been attacked on the ground
other than the one in this stand.   I realise it was opened as opposed to
being broken down but the former is always a possibility at football matches
and this must have been the vunerable area which should have been protected.
I would also mention that my son as I have mentioned earlier moved easily
within the central section for some 15 minutes before the kick off so that
the section itself may not have been obviously full to the officer making
the decision.   At one point my son pointed out that was not obvious to me
was that the fans were all "penned".   He said that if they had not been
everybody would simply have spread out.   I am sure that is an obvious point
to the enquiry.   It was only after he had mentioned it that re-living the
minds eye I could see the end pens with very few people in it the centre
ones being the problem areas.

There have been suggestions of police abuse from the fans.  I certainly
saw none before the game. The relationship between fans and police was
fine until the immediate panic around the fated stand.  I have already referred
to the comments of spectators around me about the lack of police presence
outside the entrance even before the trouble started.  There was even more
vociferous criticism when the police cordoned the whole width of the field
and the immediate reaction in the stand all around me was "where the hell
did they all come from". They should have been outside. Where have they
been hiding etc. etc.

I also consider as quite significant the point which my son made to me.
For several days he said nothing he was so deeply shocked because when
the crowds moved away after all the problems all hesaw were bodies on the
ground "I was 30 feet away Dad and I didn't realise anybody had been killed".
When he did speak about the disaster he simply said that the previous year
there had been a police cordon of the type I had mentionedCbefore I even
got into the ground)across the bridge, or thereabouts.   At that point tickets
were being checked and then the fans put into orderly queues.   He said there
was no trouble although it was slow getting in.  However with police presence
the slowness was controlled.  If that worked effectively that year why was
it not repeated. Why did the senior officers in charge of the policing
not follow that policy again this year? If they had I am sure this problem
would not have occurred. As I have said very few of the most ardent Koppites
brave a police cordon with adequate horses and then a proper police controlled
queue.  They are used to it at Anfield and accept it.

In proferring an opinion for this disaster, there were obviously many contributory "•
factors such as the fact that fans could not escape onto the pitch, the
fact that they were penned, etc., which are only too clear, but in assessing
the situation it could not possibly have been put down to fans drunkenesss
(I certainly did not see any), it could not be put down to the individual
policemen posted in and around the ground, they were doing all that they
could, it must surely rest with the senior officers in charge of planning
this crowd control, and I cannot see any way in which they can possibly
pass the buck onto anyone else not even the ground.  The senior officers
or officer planning the strategy knew the ground well, he must have known
its achilles heel could only be at this particular point. There was the

    experience of the previous year when the large crowd was well controlled,
    checked before it reached this sensitive area and therefore the previous
    year they must have been aware of the potential danger.   They knew or ought
    to have known that fans would arrive without tickets. T h e y k e w or ought
    to have known that large numbers would arrive at the last minute. Whether
    the police themselves contributed to that by a "route march" on both sides
    of the stadium such as the one we faced on our side, I do not know, but
    that could have been a contributory factor to the crowd build up, The
    policeman planning this crowd control, knew or ought to have known that
    he could virtually ignore the stand entrances at the side of the ground
    and the Nottingham Forest end of the Kop. The forces should have been
    concentrated where they were blatantly needed. Not only at that point was
    the entrances to the turnstiles very restricted, the turnstile numbers were
    restricted, that was where the largest number of the most f&natical fans
    were going to arrive, that was where they were under subscribed for tickets
    and therefore most likely to have ticketless fans arriving and yet there
    seemed to be absolutely no effective police presence.   In fact I have never
    seen a less effective police presence anywhere.   I would be interested to
    know how many policemen were assigned to that area as opposed to the total
    number in and around the stadium. From what we saw in and around that area
    as opposed to the number who were spread across the   pitch, I would think
    the proportion to be unbelievably low. Whether it was low or not, it was
    a question of control and it was just not there.   If some fans in the shock
    and horror of it all took it out on individual policemen with abuse etc.,
    it is sad but only to be understood.   I am sure if you ask anybody who was
    unfortunate enough to enter the ground through those turnstiles on that
    day they will all complain of the lack of police presence and proper control,
    and nuturally when the disaster occurred it was those they turned on.
    Effectively I am quite sure they were turning on the wrong people. -It was
    not the fault of the individual. It must surely   have been the fault of
    the senior officers.  I can only describe the total lack of police control
    at this vunerable point as gross. It might be that    those with the benefit
    of all the facts as opposed to my relative fleeting personal view may find
    otherwise but I would be very surprised.

    Incidentally even before the game many of us had asked why Hillsborough
    and not Old Trafford where the ground facilities are far superior and the
    police were used to large crowds. What particularly attracted to Hillsborough?
    This must surely be questions in the general context for the future i.e.
    that the best appointed grounds should take the games as opposed to some
    old fashioned vested interest.

    I am sorry this is such a long letter Ken but it was an awful day.   I think
    that the nation appreciates the sympathy extended to all the fans who lost
    their lives and their families and the unity of Merseyside was quite heart
    rending.  I am not the best of queuers but my wife and I felt we could not
    really be anywhere else the following Saturday but flnfield and we joined
    the queue at 1.15 p.m. We eventually got into the ground four and a quarter
    hours later to leave our few flowers. The queue never broke although it
    started raining.  The queue was subdued.  There was little talk, there was
    no humour, there was just a deep feeling of sadness.  The response of the
    people to this tragedy showed in so many ways one of the great strengths

of Merseyside.  Like many places it has its weaknesses but it certainly
showed deep and lasting respect.

As I mentioned at the beginning of this letter I write it not in any way
vindictively, not to try to put to the Tribunal suggestions for the future,
they are obviously better equiped than I to comment on those matters and
I am sure no stone will be unturned, but I did think that perhaps the impression
of one family very close to this disaster on the day may be of some assistance.
I have delayed writing not through any lack of respect but because I wanted to
put my thoughts together rather than write immediately after the disaster when
I am sure I would have been even more forthright in some of the views expressed
in this letter perhaps tinged earlier with a little unfairness. UJe had
the experience'of Old Trafford on Sunday last and cannot begin to believe
the difference in the cntrol.  Obviously everybody was very much on their
toes after this disaster but that control was really very little different
to what we have experienced previously going to Old- Trafford.

With kindest personal regards.

Yours sincerely,
r,

                 UJest Yorkshire




                 Dear Sir

                 I enclose a copy of a letterwhich I wrote to Mr. Kenneth Clarke M.P.
                 Minister of Health, on 10th May 1989.  You may well receive a copy of
                 this letter via Mr. Clarke.

                 Would ''cu please record this as one of the many letters you receive
                 regarding the Hillsborough Disaster. I apologise for not sending it
                 direct to the Tribunal and apologise for the apparent discourtesy,
                 but immediately after the disaster and even before the Tribunal was
                 appointed, I in fact telephoned Mr. Clarke's office to see whether
                 he would receive a letter from me, as I was deeply concerned over the
                 obvious and apparent lack of proper policing outside the ground.

                 Having telephoned to see whether he would receive the letter and deal
                 with it appropriately, I felt that it should still be sent to him out
                 of courtesy but having prepared an original draft, I am afraid that I
                 could not bring myself, with the horrors of that day, to finish it
                 immediately and it took me some weeks on and off to finalise what I
                 really wanted to say. Hence the delay in the date.      I felt I should
                 send a copy direct direct to you, as it could be a few weeks before
                 Mr. Clarke gets the opportunity of going through personal correspondence
                 with his pressing demands in other directions, but as I mentioned,
                 please excuse my apparent discourtesy in not writing direct to the
                 Tribunal initially. I am sure you will understand how that came about.

that there was a wall. There was a mass of fans (so deep and long it seemed
endless) queuing as best they could right up onto the bridge (which was
opposite to our approach) and I could not see any evidence of effective
police supervision.   I looked again and I realised that there was a wall
separating the standing accommodation admittance (which the fans on the
bridge were queuing for) and the stand accommodation.    The latter was bad
enough, the former was just appalling. We decided to try to get into the
stand as I felt we were reasonably alright as our queue was nothing like
the other as the turnstiles for the stand and standing accommodation were
separated   by the wall. Wewent towards the gate which admitted us to the
stand and   once we got near the gate the crush started.   It was one of the
most terrifying few minutes of my life. We headed as best we could for
a centre turnstile hoping that as we were forced one way or the other we
would avoid the flanks. In all my years I have never been so frightened
and had my wife and son follow me with hands on shoulders. 'Once ue were
inside the gates there were no police whatsoever apart from one on a horse
who could   do nothing and Ican still see a grey haired policewoman (or was
she platinum) saying "My God who is doing what here".    I could still identify
her as I saw her again after the match looking very upset. We got into
the ground somehow but my wife was trembling from head to foot and even
my 16 year old son said "I'll never go in that again".    At the time I said
this is nothing compared to what the other side must be like. There is
just no control at all. Even in our side there were people from the standing
accommodation side forcing their way through to try to get into the ground
and one sensible policeman on top of the wall was helping them over. I
am not critisising him in any way but that just showed the extent of the
shambles.  On our side of the gate there was nothing like the force of the
crowd that was behind the people trying to get into the standing accommodation.
I felt sorry for the few police officers who were there. They had absolutely
on chance. What surprised me also was that there were no police noticeably
immediately inside the ground when we got in which I will mention later.

Havino arrived at that ground at 2.15 p.m. we managed to get into our seats
at’3.05 p.m.  I ask you" to note my comment regarding IIie ixjiite march ^bove
which certainly did not help.   I think one point the Tribunal will find
worth examining is the approach to the ground.     If the same attitude was
adopted with regard to the people trying to get into the standing accommodation
as was adopted with regard to us, then if they too were sent on a route
march that could well have been the cause or one of the causes of the massive
build up.  It was massive. There is no other word for it.          I have never
seen anything worse. Another point the Tribunal I feel might examine in
relation to the build up is the member of turnstiles.         There were not enough
turnstiles to cope and that surely added to m r p r o b l e m s of the build upT
This ground does not carry large support and I must pose a "Haysel" question
as to why what seemed to me to be an out of date ground (even if it is restricted
to just one area) could be considered for a match of this size, and if it
was why the danger in that obvious and particular area was not guarded against.

  It was noticeable when we got to our seats before there was any problem
  that there were vociferous comments about the lack of police presence outside
  the ground by all the supporters around us in the stand. There was a total
  seething feeling that the lack of control by the police was unbelievable.
  One supporter near me remarked that everybody had been "herded like cattle
  into a bottleneck". Once the bottleneck had been achieved the control point
  should have been there but there was no control whatsoever - no marshalling
  - nothing. A supporter near me said that thRrp .qhnul^ have been police
  across t.hp rnaHR_atJ_l.RfleLh..inn yards short of the ground to ensure that only
  fahs with tickets got through and also that from that~pITXiiL U ib po±xce~~should
  have ensured that everybody was properly marshalled.into lines. The same
  supporter also commented that if that had happened then the police could
  easily have arranged for the kick off to be postponed as they would have
 had control of the queues and would have known how long it would take the
 fans to get into the ground.         It is simple to postpone a kick off and I
 cannot understand why that was not done. It was obvious to anyone in the
 crowd outside the ground at 2.45 p.m. (e.g. us) that the fans on the bridge
 could not possibly get in for at least three quarters of an hour with normal
 queuing. Why then did the police not order the postponement.          Even on our
 "stand side" there was obvious hysteria as kick off approached to get in.
 It was obvious that if only in fairness to supporters who had paid to see
 the match, it should have been delayed. Our more gentle side was bad enough
 but the strong young men looking -±n. get into the standing accommodation
\re^lly were desperate and pushing hard. What the crush was like outside
 that area must have been terrifying.         The problem having developed something
 should have been done. The police had hopelessly lost control and all that
 could be done then was to postpone the kick off to take the pressure off.
 Word that the kick off had been postponed would have calmed everybody down.
 I must say I did not see any evidence of drunkeness outside the ground either
 on the approach to the ground or in the queues.         I think it was only desperation
 as far as I could see that was causing people to press so hard to try to
 get in.

When the crowd started to spill on the pitch, it was obvious to us from
the stand above that there was very serious trouble.   The extent of the
disaster however was totally unknown to us in the stand but there was one
mood in the stand which came over loud and strong and that was a resentment
of police lack of control of the crowd outside the ground.   Although the
people around us had no idea of the extent of the disaster, the whole mood
was why hadn't the police properly controlled the crowds outside and this
should never have happened and would not have happened if there had been
proper crowd control.   Indeed throughout even before the trouble started
there were criticisms severe and unanimous.   It was the talking point in
the stand even when the game had just started and immediately before the
problems developed.   Every single person in and around were blaming lack
of police control for discomfort, for crushing, and for problems outside
the ground.

As the disaster unfolded my actual immediate concern was for my eldest son
who I knew was in the stand below, and who I knew always went to the centre
of the Kop.  However looking at the people on the pitch I could tell he
was not there and thought that luckily he was out of danger.  It was not
until the three of us were walking back to our car that we heard that at
least 60 people had been killed and then we realised the disaster was much
greater than we had thought. Why had nobody informed us of the extent of
the problems. Football supporters are human beings and should be treated

ho s p i t a l We left Sheffield at 7.00 p.m. in desperation not knowing whether

we could not get through to the emergency number dialling every 5 minut

Hou must these people haUe felt trying to get information       I shall never
foroet not knowing and trying that number so ineffectively. Nay we learn
a lesson that there should be somewhere where there is an emergency centre,
be it London or wherever so that if there is a national emergency of any
type a proper and effective emergency number is given.

When I managed to speak to my son at about 11.00 p.m. that night he could
hardly -peak. He had been in more or less the place where most people had
been desperately crushed. He had been on the g r o u n d a n hour before the
kick o f f , and about 15 minutes before the kick off his friends suggested
they should move farther back as'they would get a better view of the far
o S      That they did, and they avoided the crush but I mention that because
the middle terrace was not terribly packed even 15 minutes before the kick
off. Why? was it because the turnstiles were inadequate to admit or had
everyone been sent on a route march.     Surely all those fans simply did
arrive on block just 15 minutes before the kick off. The queue was too
long and too deep. Either they had been directed in such a way that they
all arrived at the same time (like ourselves a 30 minute route march) or
 the turnstiles simply could not cope.

 I feel deeply for the officer who ordered the gates to be open. On his
 behalf or to him may I say that if the crush which my wife, and son and
 I experienced "the mini crush" outside the stand for the stand seats is
 anything to go by some 15 minutes before the kick off, the situation outside
 the turnstiles for admittance to the standing accommodation must have turned
 into sheer hell as kick off time approached and did approach.   I am certain
 he opened those gates believing (as could well have been the case) that
 people were going to be crushed tc death outside. We found our "mini crush"
 terrifying.   The weight of the crush from that enormous queue that went
 up onto the bridge at 2.45 p.m. must by 3.00 p.m. have been almost unbearable,
 It must be remembered of course that they were the younger people, stronger
 and even more fanatical. To them to miss the kick off must have brought
 near panic. Obviously that officer had a dramatic instant decision to make.
 I t resulted in disaster in the ground but who knows what could have happened
 if he had not taken the action he did.   It is easy to say he should have
 blocked off the central entrance. That is obviously a matter, quite outside
 my knowledge but I would ask the Tribunal to consider how many policemen
 were available to him inside the ground.   Certainly on our side we saw none
 once we were inside the ground itself. Could he have really called within
 seconds or a minute on a realistic force to block that tunnel. Were there
 sufficient reinforcements available as there should have been to control
                t. _      i ,•f      i.i^ c nnonprl nr brnken down at this very

vulnerable point? Again a matter I think of police foresight    What other
gate on the ground, may I ask could possibly have been attacked on the ground
other than the one in this stand.   I realise it was opened as 0PP°sed to
being broken down but the former is always a possibility at football matches
and this must have been the vunerable area which should have been protected.
I would also mention that my son as I have mentioned earlier moved easily
within the central section for some 15 minutes before the kick off so that
the section itself may not have been obviously full to the officer making
the decision.   At one point my son pointed out that was not obvious to me
was that the fans were all "penned".   He said that if they had not been ^
everybody would simply have spread out. I am sure that is an obvious P°int
to the enquiry.   It was only after he had mentioned it that re-living the
minds eye I could see the end pens with very few people in it the centre
ones being the problem areas.

There have been suggestions of police abuse from the fans.  I certainly
saw none before the game. The relationship between fans and police was
fine until the immediate panic around the fated stand.  I have already referred
to the comments of spectators around me about the lack of police presence
outside the entrance even before the trouble started.  There was even more
vociferous criticism when the police cordoned the whole width of the field
and the immediate reaction in the stand all around me was "where the hell
did they all come from". They should have been outside. Where have they
been hiding etc. etc.

I also consider as quite significant the point which my son made to me.
For several days he said nothing he was so deeply shocked because when
the crowds moved away after all the problems all he saw were bodies on the
ground "I was 30 feet away Dad and I didn't realise anybody had been killed".
When he did speak about the disaster he simply said that the previous year
there had been a police cordon of the type I had mentioned Cbefore I even
got into the ground)across the bridge, or thereabouts.   At that point tickets
were being checked and then the fans put into orderly queues.   H e _said there
was no trouble although it was slow getting in. However with police presence
the slowness was controlled.  If that worked effectively that year why was
it not repeated. Why did the senior officers in charge of the policing
not follow that policy again this year? If they had I am sure this problem
would not have occurred.  As I have said very few of the most ardent Koppites
brave a police cordon with adequate horses and then a proper police controlled
queue.  They are used to it at Anfield and accept it.

In proferring an opinion for this disaster, there were obviously many contributory
factors such as the fact that fans could not escape onto the pitch, the
fact that they were penned, etc., which are only too clear, but in assessing
the situation it could not possibly have been put down to fans drunkenesss
(I certainly did not see any), it could not be put down to the individual
policemen posted in and around the ground, they were doing all that they
could, it must surely rest with the senior officers in charge of planning
this crowd control, and I cannot see any way in which they can possibly
pass the buck onto anyone else not even the ground.  The senior officers
or officer planning the strategy knew the ground well, he must have known
its achilles heel could only be at this particular point.  There was the
experience of the previous year when the large croud was well controlled,
checked before it reached this sensitive area and therefore the previous
year they must have been aware of the potential danger.      ey new or oug
to have known that fans would arrive without tickets. T h e y k e w or ought
to have known that large numbers would arrive at the last minute. Whether
the police themselves contributed to that by a "route march on both sides
of the stadium such as the one we faced on our side, I do not know, but
that could have been a contributory factor to the crowd build up, The
policeman planning this crowd control, knew or ought to have known that
he could virtually ignore the stand entrances at the side of the ground
and the Nottingham Forest end of the Kop. The forces should have been
concentrated where they were blatantly needed. Not only at that point was
the entrances to the turnstiles very restricted, the turnstile numbers were
restricted, that was where the largest number of the most f&natical fans
were going to arrive, that was where they were under subscribed for tickets
and therefore most likely to have ticketless fans arriving and yet there
seemed to be absolutely no effective police presence.    In fact I have never
seen a less effective police presence anywhere.    I would be interested to
know how many policemen were assigned to that area as opposed to the total
number in and around the stadium.   From what we saw in and around that area
as opposed to the number who were spread across the pitch, I would think
the proportion to be unbelievably low. Whether it was low or not, it was
a question of control and it was just not there. If some fans in the shock
and horror of it all took it out on individual policemen with abuse etc.,
it is sad but only to be understood.    I am sure if you ask anybody who was
unfortunate enough to enter the ground through those turnstiles on that
day they will all complain of‘the lack of police presence and proper control,
and nuturally when the disaster occurred it was those they turned on.
Effectively I am quite sure they were turning on the wrong people.       It was
not the fault ofthe individual.    It must surely have been the fault of
the senior officers.   I can only describe the total lack of police control
at this vunerable point as gross.    It might be that those with the benefit
of all the facts as opposed to my relative fleeting personal view may find
otherwise but I would be very surprised.

Incidentally even before the game many of us had asked why Hillsborough
and not Old Trafford where the ground facilities are far superior and the
police were used to large crowds. What particularly attracted to Hillsborough?
This must surely be questions in the general context for the future i.e.
that the best appointed grounds should take the games as opposed to some
old fashioned vested interest.

I am sorry this is such a long letter Ken but it was an awful day. I think
that the nation appreciates the sympathy extended to all the fans who lost
their lives and their families and the unity of Merseyside was quite heart
rending.  I am not the best of queuers but my wife and I felt we could not
really be anywhere else the following Saturday but Anfield and we joined
the queue at 1.15 p.m. UJe eventually got into the ground four and a quarter
hours later to leave our few flowers.  The queue never broke although it
started raining. The queue was subdued.   There was little talk, there was
no humour, there was just a deep feeling of sadness.  The response of the
people to this tragedy showed in so many ways one of the great strengths

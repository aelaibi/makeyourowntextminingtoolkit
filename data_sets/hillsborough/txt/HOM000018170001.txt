From the Private Secretary                     18 April 1989




     I enclose a letter which the Prime
Minister has received from Mr Roderick Robbie
of RAN International.

     I should be grateful if you would arrange
for either a Minister or a Private Secretary
in your Department to reply to Mr Robbie
on the Prime Minister's behalf.

LORD DORMOND OF EASINGTON'S PRIVATE                 PEER'S     BILL    ON   SPORTING
EVENTS (CONTROL OF ALCOHOL ETC)

Thank you for copying me your letter of 20 February to Malcolm
George concerning the above.

I can confirm, as I think you know already, that the Minister for
Sport strongly supports consideration to be given to extending
the maximum period for which an exemption order under section 3
of the Sporting Events (Control of Alcohol etc Act 1985) may be
made. This was raised with the Minister by Arthur Sandford of the
Football League early last year. Mr Sandford said that the
current five month maximum period meant that clubs were faced
with a major uncertainty in their budgeting for the financial
year as a whole and that given that they behaved responsibly over
the sale of alcohol it was hard to see why the exemption period
should not be increased to twelve months. Mr Atkins said that he
was sympathetic to the case being put but that it was a matter
for the Home Office. As you know he asked officials to raise this
with yourselves which we did. I have no doubt, therefore, that
the Minister would not wish this Bill to be blocked should it
succeed in obtaining a second reading. I would be grateful if you
could keep me informed.

I am copying this letter to Malcolm George,                      Richard    Clayton,
David Hillier and David Peters.

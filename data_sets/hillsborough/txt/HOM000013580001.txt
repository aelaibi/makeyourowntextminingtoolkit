          CRIMINAL AND DISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS STEMMING FROM THE                                                                    '«
          HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER


          Mr Peter Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, telephoned
          me on Monday 4th September 1989 to express his concern over delay
          in West Midlands Police progressing thfe criminal and disciplinary
          enquiries arising from the Hillsborough disaster.

          Apparently Mr Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of West Midlands,
          was acting under guidance from his police authority not to incur
          further expenditure on these matters until the dispute with South
          Yorkshire Police Authority over payment had been clarified.  For
          the time being no investigation work was being done and Mr Wright
          was disturbed that should this information leak out all the
          parties concerned, including Home office, would be liable to
          severe criticism.

         We discussed the matter on 4th September.  For my part I will
         arrange for Mr Dear's position to be established and for further
         information to be supplied so that consideration can be given to
         offering him advice on his legal position should he continue
         enquiries in the public interest in the face of the advice of his
         police authority.

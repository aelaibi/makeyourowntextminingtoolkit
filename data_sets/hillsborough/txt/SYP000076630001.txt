                We    had no d i f f i c u l t y      in finding       our    parti c u l a r     set of turnstiles.             It

                took about        fifteen m i n u t e s       to get to the            t urnstiles       but we were moving

                pressure          eased.



                Other       people were          scr e a m i n g and          calling       out    because     their      ribs were

                being       cracked and they              couldn't            breath     properly.          This      continued        from

                Whe n      the    barrier       col l a p s e d          trapped a bout            ten to twelve          people

                underneath          it who       I pro^fume were                  killed.      I could not         describe any of

                these       people,       you^prauldn't see faces                      or nothing         it was      just      bodies.

                There       were    two    or      three      people          on top of them and the barrier and

                t ogether         with    the      other      people as I have                said above we        pulled them              off

                Other       people were          being      pushed on top and we                    pulled these          people       off

                as well.           We then       formed a human                   barrier     to try arid stop anyone                 else

                It was       impossible            to try and            lift the barrier from on top of the

                people       because       the     pen was         packed          too tight.        I could      not   tell      if any

                of the       people       were m o v i n g        or alive           because      there was       that many of them

                     We        st a y e d    in a human         barrier         for about 5 m i n u t e s       before     the    crush of

                         people       eased off.



                         In the       first       five m i n u t e s      of being at        the   point mar k e d        ’2 ’ I had

                         he l p e d to       pass     people     over my head to the               gates at the front,              because

                         they were hurt               or   could      not      breath    properly'.



                         After      the      crush had e ased             I did not do a n y t h i n g         else    to help the dead

                         or    injured and did not                   see what       h a p pened to the         people    trap p e d beneath

                         the    barrier.



                         The main factors                  I consider          caused the     deaths      or    injuries      started

                         right      from the          beginning.            There were       no orde r l y queues          outside     the

                         ground.            At A n f i e l d   the    police always ma]*# you form queues                        they may    be

                         long     but       they are always            orderly.

                         Once     inside        the    ground        there were         no s t e wards    giving       dire c t i o n s where

Once      the    crush had e ased _____ and                     I then began to                look for                  who

we   had      lost     on the       terraces.            We    could not       get       on to the       pitch to

look      for    him,    but    con t i n u e d to         look    on the      terraces.           At about 4.20-4.

30   pm      (1820)     (1630)      we were a sked by the                    police       to    leave   the ground so

we   then went          out and s tood by the                   outer    gates        in L e p p i n g s Lane and

wa i t e d   to see      if                  came out.



He   d i d n ’t come and then at about 3 pm                            (1700)       we    returned to the          car

intending         to go       to the       local        hospitals       to    look       for him.       However,      we

f ou nd h im wa i t i ng for              u s at    t h e car.



I would         like    to say that           I believe L i v erpool                should have         been a l l o t t e d

the S'pion Kop end of the                    ground as we have a far                       larger       fallowing and

24,000        tickets was           not    enough for           the    number       of Liverpool          fans who

wanted        to go.



1 also        believe      there      is a need for a new                    large       stadium with a capacity

big eno u g h to         cope wit h such                large a t t e n d a n c e s      in the N orth of

England.          Liv e r p o o l    football           means     every t h i n g     to a lot of         people and

they have         such a       large       following.             There are         not many grounds           that      can

cope wit h the sheer                 number        of    people who w o u l d wish to watch them

in major         games.



I do      not    think    football          grounds           should    be made all             seating.      1 have a

s eason ticket           for    the Kop at A n f i e l d and                 believe       the game w ould         lose a

lot of       its atmosphere.



I also       think      that w here         there        is fencing          then     there should         be adequate

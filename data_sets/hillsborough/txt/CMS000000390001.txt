Thank you for your letter of 7 June about your research project
at football grounds.


I recognise that there is a particular problem with litter around
and in football grounds, and I commend the work TBG have been
carrying out to research this problem.


As you rightly point out, clubs will need to do more to tackle
litter,   particularly   in   the   light        of   Lord     Justice          Taylor's
report, and the possiblility of their grounds being designated as
litter control areas by local authorities, once the provisions of
the Environmental Protection Bill come into force. I am sure that
any advice TBG could give as to the best ways tb approach litter
control and prevention would be welcomed. However( the level of
financial support that the Football Association and the Football
League continue to give TBG is a matter for them to decide.




                                            I.


                                                       *

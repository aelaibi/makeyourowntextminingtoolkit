offic e r s       this duty was          commenced.

About     2 pm        (1400)    that     same day        I remember         speaking w ith stewa r d s and

stating        how good the a t m os ph er e was.

About 2 .50           pm <1450)      that      same     day,    myself      other    officers and stewards

began to c o n t i nually            tell      people      not to      climb on the            t u r nstile    roofs

as   they were           not safe.        At    this     time    there was       quite a lot of               room       in

About     3.0 5       pm (1505)     that       same    day,, the m a t c h had kicked off a n d the

crowd began to get excited.                         A ga i n   people were       climbing          on top of the

turns t i l e s       buildings     trying          to obtain a good view of the                    pitch.         Other

o f f icers working            nearby went           to at t e n d    to youths     who were           trying      to

climb from the L e p p in gs LN area over                        into    the S o u t h S tand via the

s eg re g a t i n g    fence.      I remember          stewards        c omplaining about yo u t h s again

climbing          on top of the t u r nstile              building.          I a g a i n went       to speak         to

these youths.             When     I looked a r o u n d         I noticed       the Police          o f f i c e r s who

had been with me earlier                    had gone,          but at this       stage         I. did not know

where.         I looked over           to the        pitch and saw          people a l r e a d y spilling

onto     the      pitch and being           lifted from the s t a nding                  area of L e p p i n g s LN

into     the seating area.                At    this     stage       I believed      that       fighting       was

a bout    to take        place     betw e e n opposing           s u p o r t e r s and    that a pitch

invas i o n was          inevitable.           My    concern then was           to make         sure    that    no

L iv er p o o l    supporters        climbed the          fence      near    to where          X was    stood.

Th e r e was       quite a lot         of space        for     people    to stand         in the L e p p i n g s         LN

end and there were                no signs w ha t s o e v e r        of an y kind of overcrowding.

A ft e r a short while             I was       informed by a s t e w a r d that                they had been

told that          several      people      were      dead on the        pitch and at            this    stage       I

made     my way through            the    crowd       in the N o r t h Stand,            and down onto          the
       ,                                                                         P AGE

             pitch.         As soon as        I a r ri ve d   I was   c o n f r o n t e d by a r guments   and       near

             f i g hting with o p p osing Liverpool                and N o t t i n g h a m Forest   fans.        A large

             amount       of Police      officers       were    in a t t e n d a n c e at   the area where           the

             disaster         took    place a n d     I therefore       began to calm down both sets                   of

             supporters.             I was    then a p p ro ac he d by a stew a r d who         stated     he was

             having       problems at         the    turnstile area w hich          I had just      left.        I

             im m e d i a t e l y   returned an d took         charge of the mai n gate at the N o r t h

             S t a n d / L e p p i n g s LN area where        I m a i n t a i n e d a clear   entrance and exit

             for     the e m e rgency        services.        I continued      this      duty until    everything

             q u i e t e n e d down.     I then       returned     to the     pitch and       joined up with

             of f icers      from Serial        S.

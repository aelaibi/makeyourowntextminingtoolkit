                 fob      ,
Thank you for your letter of 23 May. You asked for a quick initial indication
as to w hether th is Department was lik ely to w ish to offer evidence to the
Inquiry. As you know, the Welsh Office is a rather complex Department and
in consequence I have not y e t been able to consult all the colleagues here who
might have an in terest in th is iss u e . In the in te rests however of haste I
think I can sa y with some confidence that it is unlikely that the Welsh O ffice
will w ish to make a subm ission. Should an yth in g em erge which changes that
view I w ill, of cou rse, be in touch with you d irectly and will in any case
en su re that any subm ission is made within your deadline.

sh o u l d go there.            I ran to this Police Station.                    There were        no

relatives        or other helpers              present.           A Police Officer,       an    Inspector         or

above,       a sk e d me   if we had an area we                   could use    for a reception a re a                  .

for    the    families.           I was joined by the               local    vicar,    the Rev.       David

POTT^LEY,      and during           the    nej^t quarter          of an hour,    the    clergy a tt en d e d

in response            to my earliejr calls.                Rev.    B O TT LE Y s uggested opening           up

the    nearby B o y ’s Club,v^and he had                    it opened and showed us around.

The    club f acilities were                very basic,           not enough    chairs,     one telephone

only,     poor    toilet        facilities,          but the mai n hall was            large    enough to

use for a r eception area.                     We were       soon joined by some           social       workers;

it became a pp arent              that     e me rg en cy helpers and social workers                   had been

called out by local                 radio.         The    local    radio    response    produced an

o ve rw h e l m in g    number      of volunteers,           some    professional,       highly qua li fi ed

and some        voyeurs and            some just         plain workers.

The     next 2 hours            were      chaotic;        relatives,       friends started to arrive at

the     same time as            the    volunteers,         and     little    or no services were

a v a i la b le at      this    stage.        L ia i so n with the Police,            at this    stage,       was

poor an d we had to ask for help from C on st a bl e s                          to try to stem the

flow of       people       entering        the building.

A p sy ch iatrist and             p sy ch ologist         set up a b ereavement         counsell ing

service       in a quiet          room upstairs,            and the W.R.V.S.          a rr i ve d with tea

a nd    sandwiches.             T el ep h on e s    provided a particular problem and                   I

a r r a n g e d for    clergy      to take         some    local    supporters    to clergy's           houses

to use       the telephones.               After an hour           or so,    it became     clear      that all

of the C h r i s t i a n       church d en om in at io ns          present we/e       happy to     recognise

relatives.             We also      offe re d support                accommodation       in the area.             It

B O T T L E Y was to arrange               for more     chairs.         I a rr an ge d     for the      church

hall      at Forbes Rd to            be opened as a second                 reception         centre.       In the

light      of experience,            we might       have done          better to have           chosen the

more      s a t i s f ac t or y building,        that      is Forbes Rd,            for    reception

purposes,          rather      than the Boy's Club,                  w hi ch was simply the            nearest

b u i ld i n g . Af te r    a couple        of hours a Police             Inspector was          s ec on ded for

l iaison      purposes;          I can't       remember        his    name.     This did        improve     the

situation,             a l t h o ug h he also was       kept     short     of    information.           Dif fe re nt

stories were             circulating         concerning         the    i d en ti fi ca ti on of bodies at

either H i l l sborough,             H a ll am sh ir e Hospital           or the M ed ic o-Legal           centre.

We   had no        lists a va i la b le        for H al l am s hi r e     or N o r th e rn General

Hospitals;             this meant      that the main            reception        point,      H a m m e rt o n Rd,   had

no means          of    referring      relatives        seeking         information on casualties.

“‘his was         the    case for some 4 to             5 hours.

It was most             fr us tr at in g    for us at the Boy's Club,                     who were     getting      the

brunt      of the        emotions      of     relatives and friends,                 not to get any

i n f o r m a t i o n from the Police Officer                   in c h a r q / at H am m er t on Rd Police

Station.           I felt      that we were          not    being      ii^cluded in any of the

dec i s i o n s    taken by the Police.                 C o m m u n i c a t i o n at this stage w ith the_

P o l i c e was        not a s ^g o od as      it should hije           been.        We were     trying      to

c ommunicate with our work e rs who                        had been given labels                to d is t in g ui s h

them for          friends and        relatives;         a sense        of trust and          confidence

b e tw e e n Police,         Social        S er vi ce s and C h ur c h was          not apparent at this

stage      in the evening.

J o h n P I L L I N G and myself ag re ed we must speak                         to the senior Officer,               to

see what          i nf or mation     could be got           from him,         and    it was with some

d i f f i c u l t y that he found time to speak                       to us.        I expect     this was

because       he       lacked firm         i nf or ma ti on and had not de ve lo pe d a good enough

r el a t i o n s h i p wit h us         in order    to share      other     than the firmest

i.rtforinat ion,

We    began to hear           of sh or ta ge s      of clergy at         the N or th er n General.            I

was      keen to ensure            proper       support was      being    given to the         chaplains at

both hospitals,              so some        clergy were         sent there.

J o h n P I L L I N G and     I were       told that      i de nt if i ca t io n of bodies w ou ld        take

place at the football                    g y mn as iu m and     requests were made for           us to go

down wit h some            clergy,        to deal with          the first      group of people         to be

brought        for    identification.              I am unable       to give a time but           it w ould

be about 9 pm (21QQ hrs).                        I went down,       where      I found some      clergy,

some      social      workers,          some S a l v a t io n Army a l re a dy there;       they were         not

part      of our spe ci al ly            chosen teams.

The      i d e n t i fi ca ti on   process w as about           to start;       the   person    irt charge         of

this      process was         very good.           He told us that          the Officer would           lead

relatives          through the           ide nt if ic at io n and    if positive,        to a table          to

take a statement.                  We    could     att ac h a clergy to them          at this     time.

1 quic kl y        realised this was               not practical,         as   the Police were          having

di ff i c u l t ie s with the grief                of the families and the             length of time             it

was      taking.        Rel at iv es were          having to queue outside             in the    cold,       on a

first       come     basis    to enter,          with only 2 Police            to support      them.     I

negotiated           to a tt a ch a m in ister         to each family           before   they went       into

the      identification.                As the system  improved these at ta ch me nt s took    .

CRANWELL,          c ^ e c t o r ^ o f ^ C R U I S E , sorry,   chairman of CRUSE,          in the area,

w it h    some o pp os i ti o n from the Police,                 said that       the queueing      in the

cold was         to stop forthwith.                He took a list         of names of those waiting

an d sent        people      inside       the    gym corridor and workout              room,    to wait

until       called.        Urtf o r tunate l y ,this      still meant          one or two      people

waiting        outside       for 2 hours,          as the early       i dentifications were             taken

half an hour           each.        The     system wo rk ed well         on both sides         of the    I.D.

process?          in some       cases    the     clergy becomyrtg the           chief      supporter and           irj^

some     cases         the   social     worker?      both quickly          learned the value            of “U/ b

professional             skills      of the other a n / we began to develop a first                          class

work i n g       rel a ti on sh ip wit h the Fdli^e            in the gym.            We were able        to help

identify across                the    professions      including         the Police,        people under

severe       emotional          pressure and to have them                  relieved.

At about 2 am                (0200 hrs),        a further     bus    load of      relatives arrived.

The    building was             becoming        overcrowded,        but we     got everyone           inside.

Some     had      clergy and social              workers a tt ac h ed       to thjarflf.    Others a rr i ve d

in cars          driven       by clergy and social            workers       f r/fm the hospitals.

I left       the gym at 5 .30 am                (0530 h r s) w hen Vh&         I.P.    process        had been

c om pl e t e d for          the night and the bodies y / r e               being m oved to the M e d i c o -

Legal      Centre.

I think          it was       important at        the gym that           relatives     could touch and

hold the victims.                    There was     o cc as io n al l y    room for a relative to spend

a longer           time wit h the d ec ea se d when a separate area                        could be found.

For    some        it was      important for C at holic Last Rites?                   others      for    prayer

and    blessing;             some did not want          clergy at all.            Others      just w a n t ed      the

presence and support                   of the     clergy.       I a r r a n g e d for the same          system t o

continue at 9 am                (0900 hrs)        at the M e di co -L eg al       Centre a n d this

c o n ti n u e d until         all    i de nt if i ca t io n had been       completed and the bodies

r et urned         to Liverpool.            I also    checked that a de quate              support was

p ro v i d e d     at the hospitals and the Ground.                       I learned        at the N o r t h e r n

Gene ra l        that some       clergy had not o bs erved good practice,                        going

d ir e c t l y to the wards,              in the way of the medical                staff.        In

e m e rg e n c i e s    the hospital        chaplains       should have a senior               c le rgyman to

or ganise         the deplo ym en t        of    proper m i n is t ry under        the     chaplain's

direction.

Fa mi l i e s     at the M e di co -L eg al        Centre were           having more difficulty,

because          of glass       screens     betw ee n them and the bodies,                  preventing

               The    club    chaplain a r r a ng e d a rota of clergy at the Gr ou nd for about

               the whole week.

               I think       it is vital       that the      churches are        included within       plans    for

               any disaster          eme rg en cy   plans.       There should be 2 or 3 senior            clergy,

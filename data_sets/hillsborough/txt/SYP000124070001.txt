 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS NOT ENOUGH EQUIPMENT AND STAFF AT THE GROUND,       IN THE RESPECT OF

 DEALING WITH CASUALTIES FROM A MAJOR    INCIDENT.

 THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS STANDING AROUND WHO APPEARED NOT TO KNOW

 WHAT TO DO AND THERE SEEMED TO BE NO COMMUNICATION AT ALL.

 Q34

       THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND,        AND VERY LITTLE MARSHALLING.

THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH POLICE AT THE TURNSTILES AND GATES.

 I WAS SURPRISED AT BEING ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE BLUE CONCERTINA GATES

WITHOUT BEING CHALLENGED.

THERE WERE NO SIGNS OR DIRECTIONS GIVEN INSIDE THE GROUND, AS TO WHERE YOU

SHOULD GO.

 I THINK THAT IF PERIMETER FENCES ARE TO REMAIN THEN THEY SHOULD BE COLLAPSIBLE

^      ALLOCATION OF TICKETS WAS STUPID, KNOWING WHAT GATES LIVERPOOL GET.

 I'D LIKE TO ADD THAT AT NO TIME DID I SEE THE PERIMETER FENCE GATES TO PENS

3 OR 4 OPEN.

THE NEXT     I   CAN REMEMBER WAS A DEAD MALE APPROXIMATELY 30 YRS OF AGE WITH

A COMPLETELY BLUE FACE LYING ON HIS BACK WITH ARMS OUTSTRETCHED ABOVE HIS

HEAD.      I WOULD ONLY BE GUESSING IF I TRIED TO DESCRIBE HIS CLOTHING.                 HE

WAS LEFT OF THE BARRIER AND FORWARD OF             IT.

THERE WAS A VERY LARGE WHITE. MALE APPROXIMATELY             18 STONE IN WEIGHT     AND TALL HE

WAS WEARING A WHITE VEST.            HE APPEARED   UNCONSCIOUS AND WAS GASPING     FOR

BREATH.      HE WAS JUST GOING THROUGH THE         MOTIONS OF BREATHING VERY FAST.            HE WAS

LYING ON HIS STOMACH.            I MOVED HIM ON TO HIS SIDE AND KEPT HIS MOUTH OPEN BY

PUTTING MY FINGER        IN IT TO KEEP HIS AIRWAYS I-RLE.        WE CARRIED THIS MAN O U 1

THAT WAS I                    A POLICEMAN OR FIREMAN AND A ST JOHNS AMBULANCEMAN AND

MYSE'LF.     WE" TOOK HIM OUT OF THE PEN THROUGH THE GATE TO THE RIGHT            GOAL POST

I P THE SIX YARD BOX. WE JUST LEFT HIM IN THE CARE OF OTHER ST JOHNS

AMBULANCEMEN.         I MOVED AWAY AND SAT DOWN FOR A SHORT TIME WITH

AND WE BOTH BROKE DOWN AND CRIED.             AFTER A SHORT TIME I PULLED MYSELF

TOGETHER AND WE WENT AFTER SEEING SOME DEAD BODIES AND ASSISTED TO PLACE A

BODY OF A YOUNG MAN ON ADVERTISING HOARDING.               HE WAS 23-24 YEARS BROWN

SHORTISH/WAVY HAIR HE HAD A MOUSTACHE.              WEARING A NAVY BLUE NYLON JUMPER.

HE WAS WHITE FACED.         A POLICEMAN POINTED THE WAY OR TOLD US WHERE TO TAKE HIM

POINTING TO THE FAR CORNER OF THE PITCH.              ABOUT SIX PEOPLE STARTED TO HELP

CARRY THE        BODY BUT IM NOT SURE.    I REMEMBER THERE WERE TWO AMBULANCES ON

    PITCH        AT THIS TIME.     WE CARRIED THE BODY ON PLACED IT IN THE TEMPORARY

MORTUARY.        THERE WAS ONLY APPROXIMATELY TWO OR THREE BODIES IN THERE AT THIS

TIME.      HE WAS THE LAST ONE ON THE FIRST ROW.

I PHYSICALLY REMOVED HIS JUMPER AND PLACED IT OVER HIS FACE.                  WE HAD BEEN TOLD

BY A MAN VERY WELL DRESSED IN A SUIT AND I THINK CARRYING A WALK IE TALKIE TO

DO THIS.         HE APPEARED TO    BE A MEMBER OF THE SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY H E I R A C H Y .

I WENT TO LEAVE WITH                        BUT WE COULD NOT GET OUT AS MORE BODIES

WERE ARRIVING AT THE DOOR.            IN A HALL WE LEFT AND I ASSISTED TO CARRY A

COUPLE OF MORE BODIES IN.            THIS PERIOD   IS ALL A BIT OF A BLUR.      I HAD

 G'/M,       I SAW ONE DISTRESSED FRIEND OF A DECEASED START TO SCUFFLE WITH A

 POLICEMAN.        HE WAS PUSHED AWAY BY ME,      I TOLD THE FAN TO CALM D O W N .    THE

 POLICEMAN DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO, HE DIDNT SEEM TO KNOW HOW TO REACT.

 ALL THE PEOPLE I HAVE TALKED ABOUT SO FAR            I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE

 THEM.        THAT INCLUDED THE POLICE,   FANS,   OTHER ASSISTANTS AND THE MAN IN

 THE SUIT.        I THINK   I WOULD BE ABLE TO RECOGNISE THE LARGE MAN WHO I CARRIED

 OUT FIRST AND THE FIRST DECEASED I TOOK TO THE MORTUARY.                THERE WERE A LOT

 OF OFFICIALS ABOUT SO I WENT BACK AND ONTO THE PITCH.                THIS WAS THE". EXACT

TIME A FEW DOZEN LIVERPOOL FANS RACED TOWARDS THE NOTTS FOREST END.                    WE HAD

WALKED THROUGH THE POLICE CORDON AND I SHOUTED AT THE FANS TO GO BACK.                       THEY

REALISED THEY WERE BEING STUPID AND THEY STOPPED AND DISPERSED.

W     e.   AREA BEHIND THE GOAL WAS FAIRLY CLEAR.       I RETURNED PEN THREE.        THE GATE

WAS CLOSED SHORTLY AFTER         I WENT BACK    INTO THE PEN.      THERE WAS NOT A LOT OF

PEOPLE LEFT IN THE PENS,         I WAS STRUCK BY THE AMOUNT OF DISCARDED CLOTHING,

SCARFS AND TRAINING SHOES,         JUST LYING THERE.      I REMEMBER VERY VIVIDLY

A STENCH OF STALE URINE TYPE SMELL.             I HAD A CUP OF WATER WHICH WAS GIVEN

ME BY EITHER A STEWARD OR CLUB EMPLOYEE.

 I WAITED FOR A WHILE THEN I LEFT THE GROUND Or- MY ACCORD WITH _______________

     AT ALL DIRECTING THE FANS WHERE TO GO.      INSIDE THE TURNSTILES,   I HAD NO

     IDEA WHERE TO GO BECAUSE THERE WERE NO SIGNS INDICATING WHERE THE

     TERRACES WERE.    I SAW THE TUNNEL,   THRU WHICH THE    PITCH WAS VISIBLE AND

     ASSUMED THAT THAT WAS WHERE THE STANDING AREAS WERE.

     ALSO THE EXIT GATE FROM THE TERRACES OUT ONTO THE PITCH IS RIDICULOUS


    G-16

f    IT ALLOWS ACCESS FOR ONLY ONE PERSON AT A TIME.        IF IT HADN'T HAVE BEEN

f FOR THE FACT THAT 2 POLICEMEN AND A FAN WERE DRAGGING PEOPLE OUT OF

     THE GATE, NO ONE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT OF THE GATE AT ALL DUE

     TO THE NARROWNESS     OF THE GATE AND THE SHEER    VOLUME OF PEOPLE PRESSING

           GET OUT OF THE PENS.

<316

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 iA    rE   SHOULD HAVE BEEN A TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT   INFORMING FANS IN THE GROUND

 WHAT WAS HAPPENING - BECAUSE FANS FROM NOTTINGHAM WERE JEERING NOT KNOWING

 THE TRUE SITUATION - WHICH COULD HAVE CAUSED FURTHER CROWD PROBLEMS.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 BOTH FANS & CLUB OFFICIALS WERE SAYING BEFORE MATCH TOOK PLACE THAT LIVERPOOL

 SHOULD HAVE HAD THE LARGER END OF GROUND AND NO-ONE TOOK ANY NOTICE.           THE

 PREVIOUS YEARS SEMI FINAL WAS ALSO PACKED IN THE PENS AND THIS SHOULD HAVE

 BEEN A FURTHER      INDICATION.

 DID YOU WI INEBS ANY iHINCa iHA I YOU CONSIDER         iO BE A CRi.Mi.NAL. OF i"hNCL?

 NO

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBBERVA i1ONb ON            iMfc. WAY   IHis. J.NC J.DtiN i WAb HANDLED,

 AFTER    IHE MAiCH WAS SIOPPtD?

AT THE TIME 1 HE. MATCH WAS SiOPPED          i. iHOUuH Ii.i WAS r ANB GOING       ON I0   iHE PI iCH

l^GET     OUT OF THE CRUSH.       IT WAS     SOME TIME BEFORE I REALISED THE EXTENT OF

THE PROBLEM.       I FEEL IT WAS A COMP LET E WASTE: OF POLICE. PERSONNEL WHEN                 iHE

CORDON WAS PLACED IN FRONT OF         THE NOR IH STAND,      WHICH SEEMED       iO BE A

CONFRONTATION SITUATION THAT DID NOT HELP.               I FEEL A LOT OF OFFICERS WERE NOT

AWARE FOR SOME TIME THAT A SI fUA I’iON HAD OCCURRED AND 1HERE ShEMtD A LACK OF

COMMUNICATION.

Q54

 IS THERE ANYiHING     IHA i YOU WISH    10 ADD WHICH YOU F EEL IB Vi iAL           iO IHxS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1.      I FEEL TICKET ALLOCATION SHOULD BE IN PROPORTION TO THE AVERAGE

A ^ ^ N D A N C E AT HOME MATCHES AT EACH C L U B .

2.       CO-ORDINATION OF TRAFFIC AND        ROUTES TO GROUNDS. ON THIS OCCASION

LIVERPOOL FANS WERE ADVISED TO USE THE M63 AND A6'16 AL iHOUGH PROBLEMS

HAD BEEN EXPERIENCED LAST YEAR USING THE SAME ROUTES.                     WE ACTUALLY TURNED

 OFF ONTO THE A626 THE GLOSSOP ROAD AND HAD A CLEAR JOURNEY.

3.       I D O N ’T FEEL ALCOHOL WAS ANY FACTOR       IN THIS DISASTER.

 4.      I FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR OFFICERS FROM AREAS WHERE THE FANS

 CAME FROM WHO BE ABLE TO ORGANISE TURNSTILES BETTER AND THERE WAS A NEED

 FOR A LOT MORE STEWARDS DIRECTING FANS.

 5.      I FEEL HILLSBOROUGH WAS ADEGUAIE GROUND FOR              iHIS MAS Chi BU l IHE.Rfc. NEEDS     SO
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     QSL.996


 BE A LOT MORE DIRECTION MARKERS TELLING PEOPLE WMgRE TO GO AND POLICE AND

 STEWARD S UP ERV ISI ON„

 6»     THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM AT THE GROUND WAS INAUDABLE AND THERE WAS A

 TOTAL LACK OF INFORMATION BEING GIVEN TO THE CROWD LETTING IT BE KNOWN OF

 THE SEVERITY OF THE PROBLEM.           THIS IS BORN      OUT WHEN THE FOREST FANS

 STARTED JEERING AND COULD HAVE CAUSED A VERY NASTY CONFRONTATION WITH

 THE LIVERPOOL FANS,

 7.     I D O N ’T FEEL ALL SEATER STADIUMS WILL         IMPROVE MATTERS AND WOULD

 NOT HAVE ALTERED THIS AS THE PROBLEMS WERE OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES AND LACK OF

 ACCESS INTO THE GROUND.

8.      I CANNOT SEE THAT IDENTITY CARDS WILL SOLVE ANY PROBLEMS OF FOOTBALL BUT

\ M L   CREATE GREATER QUEUES AND MANY MORE PROBLEMS „

 THE ORGAN ISA IION Oh    (HE POLICE AND OFF ICiAL i~ 1RST AIDERS WAS POOR.

ALTHOUGH THERE WERE QUALIFIED ST JOHNS AMBULANCE PERSONNEL AVAILABLE THEY WERE

        OLD ENOUGH   (IN THE MAIN)   OR MENTALLY EQUIPPED TO DEAL WITH MANY OF THE

 I ) THERE WAS A PI STING LACK OF ORGANISATION OUTSIDE^yfiE GROUND IN CONTROLLING

THE CROWD.      THERE WERE MORE POLICE AVAILABLE TO SEARCH INCOMING MINI BUSES

THAN WERE ACTUALLY PRESENT OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GROUND OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE REALISED WHAT WAS

HAPPENING IN THE PENS.

A LACK OF STEWARDS DIRECTIONS.

 THE DECISION NOT     TO TELL THE SUPPORTERS THAT THE GAME WAS ABANDONED      WAS

 BRILLIANT - S O 'S   TO ALLOW THE EMERGENCY SERVICES THROUGH.       THE REACTION OF

 ’THE S E R V I C E S ’ TO THE GROUND WAS SLOW AND INADEQUATE.   POLICE GROUND:   REACTION

 AT FENCES YOU COULD SEE WHAT WAS UNFOLDING AND DELAYED OPENING GATE AND

 AND LIFTING PEOPLE OUT.

 Q54.   IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 FOOTBALL CLUBS IN GENERAL SHOULD HOLD THE FANS IN THE SAME RESPECT THAT THEY

 HOLD THE CLUB.     THERE SHOULD BE    NO SIDE FENCES     STOPPING SIDEWAY MOVEMENTS AND

 THERE NEEDS TO BE     THE NECESSARY ACCESS ON TO THE PITCH IF NECESSARY.

fH~RE   SHOULD BE BETTER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE POLICE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE

 GROUND.

 POLICE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY ON THE TURNSTILES TO CREATE ORDERLY QUEUES.

MY OPINION IS THAT ID CARDS WILL CAUSE PROBLEMS - BECAUSE IT WILL SLOW DOWN

 ENTERING   INTO THE GROUND

 THE FACT THAT THE     BARRIER BROKE CONTRIBUTED TO       MANY UNNECESSARY DEATHS,.

THE DISTRIBUTION      OF      TICKETS SHOULD BE REVIEWED.

 THE MATCH SHOULD     BE      POSTPONED UNTIL EVERYONE HAS       ENTERED.

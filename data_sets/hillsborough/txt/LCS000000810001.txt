    COPING AFTER A TRAGEDY




THE HILLSBOROUGH CENTRE
 Someone you know may have been injured in an accident.

You may have been involved in a traumatic accident.

You may have seen people dead or injured.

You may be living with someone who has been involved in an
accident or traumatic incident.

You may have a friend or relative who has committed suicide.

WHAT HAS AND IS HAPPENING TO YOU IS A VERY
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.

The following are some of the things that have occured to people
who have been involved in an accident or disaster in the past.

FEAR                                              HELPLESSNESS
GRIEF                                             GUILT
SHAME                                             ANGER
MEMORIES                                          HOPE

Everyone has these feelings. They are especially powerful after an
accident or trauma of any kind.

Letting these feelings out is natural, it helps you to get better. If you
try and stop these feelings coming out, you may end up feeling even
worse.
Even if you have not felt anything like this, your body may react to the
crisis even months later. Some common problems are:

TIREDNESS                             SLEEPLESSNESS
BAD DREAMS                            LOSS OF CONCENTRATION
DIZZINESS                             PALPITATIONS
SHAKING                               BREATHING DIFFICULTIES
CHOKING                               NAUSEA
DIARRHOEA                             TENSION
HEADACHES                             NECKACHES
MENSTRUAL DISORDERS                   LACK OF SEXUAL INTEREST

You may make new friends as a result of your experiences, but existing
relationships can become strained. You may think you are not getting
enough support, or cannot give as much help as people need. You might
drink more or start using drugs.

MAKING YOUR FEELINGS EASIER TO BEAR:

NUMBNESS at first you may feel numb, everything may seem unreal.
This is your mind telling you it cannot take it all in at once.

ACTIVITY its best to keep active, but don't overdo it.

REALITY we have to come to terms with what has happened.

TALKING I I OVER in time you will need to talk and think about what
has happened, Ypu will probably dream about it. Children may want to
draw tilings or even play games about it.
SUPPORT you may need physical and emotional help. Don't reject
it Talking to other people who have been through the experience is
useful.

PRIVACY sometimes you may need to be alone, or just with
your family and friends.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO GO THROUGH THE EXPERIENCE
AGAIN, IT IS VERY PAINFUL. THIS DOES LEAD TO
HEALING, YOU MAY COME OUT OF IT WISER AND
STRONGER.

DO’s and DONT's

DON'T bottle up your feelings.
DON1T avoid talking about what happened.
DON'T expect the memory to vanish overnight.

TRY AND DO THE FOLLOWING THINGS:

Let your children share your feelings and their own.
Take time to rest and be with friends.
Tell family, friends how you feel.

DO be more careful, accidents are more common when you are
under stress.

ABOVE ALL, DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK FOR HELP IF
YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOURSELF, YOUR
FAMILY OR YOUR FRIENDS.

 Dear

 I’m writing to you as chair of the Hillsborough Centre Advisory Group. As the vicar of a
 local church, the new one opposite the Kop, I’ve been involved in the advisory group
 representing local churches since November, 1989. Over the time I have been
 involved, the work of the centre has seen a number of changes and with that, changes
 in the relationship between user groups like yourselves and the workers at the centre.

 The advisory group has always seemed to me to be a place where problems can be
 discussed, questions asked, practical issues sorted out, and the general direction of
 the centre open to debate. In reality, however, the-group has never really achieved
 whal it hoped to do in this, respect. One of tiie problems has been, 1 gather, an
 uncertainty on the part of user groups about the precise role of the advisory group arid
 their part in it. There have been some issues, like a policy statement on files,that have
 been ironed out successfully. But equally there have been other issues and I’m
 thinking especially of the recent “Team Brief” that was discussed by user groups,
 where there is a good deal of confusion about just what the user groups are expected
 to say or do. We could add to, that the lack of clarity concerning the request for
 volunteers for telephone and reception duties.

 From the Social Services viewpoint the nature of referrals to the centre is changing,
 with a decreasing number of Hillsborough related referrals and an increase in referrals
 from traffic accidents, bereavement, suicide etc. The uniqueness c-i the Hillsborough
 Cer-.tre lies in its ability to respond in an informal and skilled way to such incidents ->f
 traumatic loss and I am very supportive of that. Nevertheless I know that the workers at
 the Centre are very much wanting a partnership with user groups as the life of the
 centre develops rather than two distinct bodies using the same building. I am also
 aware, however, of a lack of clarity over what this actually means.

 Can I respectfully suggest that a possible way forward may be that at y o u r invitation, I
 could attend one of your meetings to discuss these and other issues. My primary
 concern is not just to secure additional members for the advisory group ! Rather I m




                                                                               P .T.O.




When calling     or   telephoning      please     ask     for
looking for a way forward for the positive benefit of all who are involved in the.
Hillsborough Centre and to unravel some of the tangles that seem to have developed.

I hope it is a suggestion that meets with your group’s approval and I hope that as
someone from “outside" I can be non-partisan in our discussions. I await your reply
with interest.


Yours sincerely.,



            (■erct.


Rev. Stephen Pierce.

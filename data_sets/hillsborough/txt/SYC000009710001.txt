MR FRAZER:            One of the points at issue, is that without going into all the details, at the
                      moment a broad swipe has been taken at this pre-death pain and
                      suffering, pre-death terror business. Those summaries are almost
                      bound to contain information which will benefit us, and I certainly would
                      have no objection to the other side seeing them. I don’t know whether
                      they want to see them, but --

COUNSEL 1:            Yes, I think the distinction - you are quite right - the distinction that can
                      be drawn between us and the other defendants is that we’re doing the
                      paying out --

CORONER:              That’s right.

COUNSEL 1:            -- at the moment and so we have a very legitimate interest.

CORONER:              If you say it would be helpful if I could see them before we begin, I don’t
                      think we would -- you know, we would say, “No way”. I think that’s right
                      isn’t it (several inaudible words) a copy but --

COUNSEL 2:            That’s no problem. The first thing was to clear of coursewith Mr Frazer
                      in terms of that side of things, but obviously --

MR FRAZER:            I’ve certainly got no -- we are sworn enemies in public but we have to
                      work together. I mean, if the document became available and the
                      plaintiff relied upon it I would have to disclose it anyway.So you might
                      as well see it at the beginning rather than ...

COUNSEL 3:            Certainly it would seem to make sense if it doesn’t cause you any --

CORONER:              If it were to produce great difficulty then we’ll come back to you. I mean
                      you’ll hear it anyway, because --

MR FRAZER:            It’ll be a matter of public record after the hearing.

CORONER:              That’s right, indeed.

MR FRAZER:            Because it’ll be part of a deposition.

CORONER:              So it isn’t a question of it being kept a secret. It is just a question of how
                      to make the thing run more smoothly with the minimum amount of
                      inconvenience for everybody.

COUNSEL 1:            I suppose the only thing which I ought to say perhaps harping back now
                      really to the beginning of this is, there is I think a line to be drawn in
                      making clear what these preliminary hearings are intended to deal with
                      and what they are not intended to deal with, between saying, “Well look,
                      we’re doing this to prevent any possible risk of a prosecution”, but not
                      actually giving the idea that a prosecution is certainly going to follow.

MR FRAZER:            Absolutely.

CORONER:              Yes, I am going to come to that.

MR FRAZER:            Yes, that’s something that, as we sit here, has occurred to me, and if it’s
                      occurred to me it’s going to occur to --

MALE SPEAKER:         Lots of other people.

MR FRAZER:            The people 70 miles up the road; why this now?

CORONER:              Well I’ll tell you why, now. In fact I can tell you that we had actually
                      thought of doing something like this some little while ago and turned it
                      down. I turned it down for that very reason, because I thought that if I
                      have a limited inquest at this stage, everybody will assume that I know
                      what the DPP is going to do, that he’s already made up his mind but
                      we’re not letting on. So I decided - and there were various other factors
                      as well, the complication, the difficulty that we manage and so on.
                      Anyway, the reason why I feel we can do it now is because of Miss
                      Steel’s letter. She, if you like, requested more or less, in fact she
                      requested the information.

MALE SPEAKER:         Yes.

CORONER:              But what we are doing is trying to comply with her wish and so it
                      certainly would be my intention to make it clear - whether to make it
                      clear 95 times I don’t know, but it would be made clear at some point -
                      that this is endeavour to help and that under no circumstances can it be
                      construed that I am already privy to information as to what the DPP
                      intends, which I am not. Some people will not believe me.

MALE SPEAKER:         No.

CORONER:              But do we say that because somebody will not believe it we don’t do
                      anything at all?

MR FRAZER:            That’s right, as I say, as we sit here that’s the thought that occurs to me.
                      There will be one or two hotheads who will look for the ulterior motive
                      behind this. The vast majority will accept it in the spirit in which it’s
                      done.

MALE SPEAKER:         Yes.

MR FRAZER.            But there will be people, and the press will do the same. They will say,
                      “Well, if Peter Wright retires on 1 May and the decisions are going to be
                      made by then, why are you doing this now?” and that’s what the press
                      are going to think. Because they’re wicked, they have a wicked way of
                      looking at things, the press, sometimes.

CORONER:              I am quite satisfied in my own mind that we are not doing it for that
                      reason. Perhaps I could just talk about what would happen. There are
                      three scenarios that I think are worth mentioning, and by the way
                      gentlemen, if we are more or less agreed today - with the end of the
                      meeting we’ll see - as I said, we intend to have a formal pre-inquest
                      review next week, so you may hear all this again, assuming that you
                      attend.

CORONER               Of course you are free not to. But you will forgive that I hope.
                      But the only three possible major scenarios: First, that the DPP decides
                      to prosecute somebody or several people for manslaughter, all right? If
                      that were to happen then Section 16 of the Coroners Act would apply
                      and I would adjourn the inquest under the provisions of that section.
                      Whether I resume or not I would decide at the end of the prosecution,
                      but it is only fair to say that it is my normal practice not to resume, where
                      prosecutions for murder, manslaughter, or indeed (inaudible) take place.
                      But I am not going to say positively what I’m going to do because I will
                      exercise my judgement, so to speak, at the end of the day. It would be
                      foolish of me to say I will definitely resume. It is probably more likely that
                      I will not, but I am not deciding.

                      The second scenario is that he decides not to prosecute for
                      manslaughters or a charge which falls within that section. In that case I
                      will obviously have to decide on a resumption and I will then make up my
                      mind how much further evidence I am going to need to call in the light of
                      all the circumstances prevailing at the time and taking in whatever
                      information I have available at the time.

                      The third possibility is that he decides not to prosecute but that
                      somebody decides to bring a private prosecution, which again I am not
                      saying will happen but it is a possibility because I think Mr Heidner(?),
                      again, hints at that possibility.

COUNSEL 1:            I listened to his remarks very carefully and he at no stage gave the idea
                      that he or his colleague, King, thought that there was anything which
                      they were putting forward. What they were saying was, “Some of my
                      clients believe”.

MALE SPEAKER:         That’s right.

COUNSEL 1:            He was very careful in his wording.

CORONER:              Sorry, I wasn’t suggesting that he thought that one should be brought. I
                      was just saying that he recognised that there were some people who
                      might wish to do so, and that he recognised that it was obviously a
                      possibility. Now assuming for a moment that somebody were to bring a
                      private prosecution and that it got off the ground, then of course you’re
                      back in the Section 16 situation, because it doesn’t actually restrict you
                      to public prosecutions. What it says is that if I’m notified that a person
                      has been charged, and if they’re charged that’s that.

                      So those are the only three possible scenarios. This, if you like, is one
                      of the reasons why I am quite keen really - now that I’ve started thinking
                      about it, go on with this - if the DPP were to prosecute, if he were to
                      prosecute, then if I haven’t done the resumptions at this stage, I would
                      have had to resume on a limited basis to at least take the medical
                      evidence if nothing else. But bearing in mind that even if the DPP does
                      prosecute he may not actually prosecute 95; he may select. It might be
                      that it would be unfair not to at least take the sort of evidence we’re
                      talking about, put the other (inaudible) unmentioned(?) on the charge

www.merrillcorp.com
                                                                                                  4
                      sheet. But it would be covered under Section 16, there is specific
0 0 :0 9 :0 7
0 0 :0 9 :0 7


CORONER:              provision for that in that section. So I would then be faced with having to
                      do all this anyway after the DPP has decided what he wants to do.
                      Assuming that we do it now, that work will have been done. If the DPP
                      decides to prosecute I will resume the inquest for the purposes of
                      adjourning under Section 16. Then I will make up my mind when it’s all
                      over in the Crown(?) Court (inaudible). So there is an element of
                      preparation on an assumption that, if somebody were charged, but I
                      think it’s a benefit to the DPP(??) because it would mean that I would be
                      able to deal with the issuing of the death certificates and so on that
                      much quicker.

MR FRAZER:            Yes it’s going to take heat out of the presently fairly hot situation if they
                      have information that is a need to know, that is a want to know. I think
                      so far as it’s possible to give them that information I think it’s an
                      excellent idea.

COUNSEL 3:            Humanely, Sir, I mean if you look at it in terms of not doing anything at
                      this stage it could be quite a while. And of course the psychologists tell
                      us that the grieving process needs this in order to work through.

MR FRAZER:            Yes, it needs the last link.

COUNSEL 3:            That’s right. The vast majority of families just basically want to settle
                      down and start rebuilding their lives.

MR FRAZER:            By far and away the majority wants it doing. Yes, yes that’s right.

CORONER:              (inaudible) I mean I don’t know what the DPP’s going to do anymore
                      than you. We can all have private guesses but that’s all they are. When
                      I mention it, that’s got to be put as an option, or as a scenario if you
                      prefer. It can’t be excluded, we can’t say that it won’t happen, because
                      it’s not within my power to decide.

COUNSEL 3:            Just to help you on that as well, if this goes ahead about the timing that
                      we’re talking about, the final submission to the DPP won’t have been
                      made whilst this is going on.

MR FRAZER:            What sort of dates are we talking about?

CORONER:              Oh yes, we haven’t actually mentioned the date. What do you want to
                      do? Assuming that you are happy, and this is (inaudible) because it fits
                      in with our timetables. We want to have a papers reviewed next week
                      because we want to give everybody a chance to hear and know what’s
                      going on, and then resume the inquest on 18 April and start to actually
                      take evidence in individual cases on the 19th.

COUNSEL 1:            Easter Tuesday, is that right?

CORONER:              Wednesday. We did think of Tuesday but we thought other people
                      (inaudible).

MR FRAZER:            There is a problem actually in terms of, when is the right time? Is there

CORONER:              I mean when we’ll first set it, everybody, “My goodness, how can you do
                      it around the anniversary?” and it’s certainly a point. But, Mr Jones’s
                      point - and I agree with you in fact - the people will, if you like, be very
                      emotionally involved on the 15th and it may possibly be better to take
                      them while they are already, if you like, upset--

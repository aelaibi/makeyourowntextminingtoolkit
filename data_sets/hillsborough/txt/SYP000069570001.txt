He said       that    both sets             of s u pporters were welc o m e a n d that                          s u pporters

from    both teams were a l r e a d y                   in the       premises-           He    said that

wish i n g    to enter          the    premises and he did not a n t i c i p a t e any trouble.

I visi t e d the          premises          wit h Police S e r g e a n t            KEENAN      there were

a small       number       of    persons          inside       but no      problems.            Police S e r g e a n t

were    in position,             a bout      11.45am          (1145),.     I returned to H a l i f a x Rd at

into the       premises and             saw that          t herp'were            only two       female a ss i s t a n t s

serving,       but there were                no    problems.            I returned a bout m i d d a y and

c o n t r o l l e d and    limited to about                   six    persons at any             one time.             One    shop

a s s i s t a n t was mann i n g        and       locking       the e n t r a n c e      door whilst            the    other

was    formed     up on the            pavement          outside and whilst                   I had the         premises

under     observation            the    queue          remained fai r l y           constant at          that     sort       of

number.        (The       premises          later       closed about 2 . 0 0 p m              (1400)     apparently

Police Con s t a b l e O S B O R N E m e n t i o n e d         to me that a youth had gone                        into a

ladies        hai r d r e s s e r s    shop s i t uated above           the    shopping         precinct         near     to

the T h r e s h e r O f f - L i c e n c e      and had to be ejected after                      requesting         the

staff     to do his hair.                  He was      under     the    influence         of drink.             Large

numbers        of Liv e r p o o l       s u p p o r t e r s were a r r i v i n g    in private            cars and vans

and     parking        on the         estate    roads     off Halifax Rd.               As the suppo r t e r s

wa l k e d along Hali f a x Rd               I noticed that man y of them were                            drinking       from

cans     or b o t t 1e s .       A l t h o u g h some were         drinking         soft drinks,            I

distinctly           recall      thinkin g        to myself        that    I had never            in all my

expe r i e n c e     of work i n g and a t t e n d i n g         football          matches,       seen so m a n y

people        consuming         i n t o xicating       liquor      in the st r e e t .Somet ime after                    12.

30p m    (1230)        I heard a radio message                   to the       effect      that a transit                van

had dr i v e n awa y from a shop after                       the occupants             had been shoplifting.

I then heard that                the     vehicle       had been seen t ravelling                   along Foxhill

Rd w h i c h     forms a j un c t i o n wit h Halifax Rd at                        the W a d s l e y Bridge

R a i 1way S t a t i o n . A     few min u t e s       later     the transit           van was       dr i v e n on to

the     car    park     of the White Horse Public House                            f o l l o w e d by a Police

transit        van    containing           Inspector        R O B I N S O N and other Officers.

The occupants,             who were Liv e r p o o l          supporters,            were d e t a i n e d and

placed        in the the Po l i c e            transit      van.       I n o t i c e d that       the supporters''

van con t a i n e d a m a t t r e s s          in the     rear w h i c h was         s ur r o u n d e d    by empty

beer/ l a g e r      cans.

A short        time     later whilst            I was     speaking        to Police S e r g e a n t K E E N A N

outside        the White Horse P u b l i c House,                   a group of a p p r o x i m a t e l y          twenty

youths,        led by one y o u t h            in particular           started       to sing an obscene

song.         I went      to the       leader wit h Po l i c e S e r g e a n t K E E N A N and the                 group

immedi a t e l y      stopped singing.                 I warned        the y o u t h a bout         his     future

despite man y of the yo u t h s                   present      being      quite      ob v i o u s l y a f f e c t e d    by

About        1.3 0 p m    (1330),     I saw Police S e r g e a n t D I X O N who was               in charge of

Serial        Number 41        in Hali f a x Rd at          its j u n c t i o n with K i1ne r Way.

Police Sergeant DIXON                  told me       that    his     serial      were    keeping        a w a t ching

eye over Liv e r p o o l           supp o r t e r s who were         buying      large    quant i t i e s      of

intoxicating              liquor    from the        o f f - l icence     department       of the G a t e w a y

Superrnarket.              These    premises        subsequently          sold out of          packs and

bottles        of beer and          lager.

A bout 2 . 3 0 pm         (1430),     I returned to H a l i f a x Rd near                to    its j u n c t i o n

with S o u t h e y G r e e n Rd where              I saw Chief          Inspector       PURDY.        Li v e r p o o l

supporters'              coaches were        now    parked     in Hali f a x Rd down as far as                      the

Pelican        crossing       just     below this junction.                   The Fire B r i g a d e were

called to a coach at                  this    j u n c t i o n w h i c h was     leaking       diesel     fuel.           I

recall        Chief       Inspector        P URDY saying       his      radio was       not work i n g       very

well     but my          radio was working           efficiently,          although       rec e p t i o n was

sometimes         d i fficult       due     to traffic       and general          noise.        There       were

large        numbers       of L i verpoo l     s upporters         walk i n g    down H a l i f a x Rd towards

H i l l sborough,         m a n y of them were          under      the    influence       of drink a l t h o u g h

there was         no trouble.              It was    noti c e a b l e    that all       those     heading

towards Hi I Is bo rough a pp e a r e d              to be     in no      particular          hurry    desp i t e        th

gr o u n d bei ng a ten mi nutes walk a w a y .

I also        saw a group of           forty to fifty supp o r t e r s walk i n g                 in the

o p p osite      d i r e c t i o n awa y    from the ground.              On speaking          to them one            of

their        number       i n dicated that         their    coach driver          had a l l o w e d    them      to

al i g h t    near       to the    gr o u n d but    had driven off             taking    the m a t c h tickets

with him.            They were all           walking       back, to the         coach to       collect       their

tickets.

At 2 . 45pm        (1445)     there were           still    large       numbers    of s u p p o r t e r s    walking

towards        the ground.           Customers        at the White Horse P u b l i c House were

leaving        in small        pockets and          I noti c e d those L i verpool              s up p o r t e r s who

making       their way down H a l i f a x R d .              They a p p e a r e d to be well

i ntoxi c a t e d but were            not    causing any         problems.

About      that       time    I noti c e d a group of a p p r o x i m a t e l y forty                 to fifty

Liv e r p o o l      s u p p o r t e r s walking    down tj>e side            of the     parked       coaches

towards        the ground.            Ti^fy a p p e a l e d to be well           intoxi c a t e d      but a ga i n

were     not      causing any p r o b l e m s .          I recall       mentioning         the group to Chief

Inspector P U R D Y and waJKfe r ed where                    they had been drinking.                      We

co ncluded that              they must       have    been d r i nking at             the W a d s l e y Bridge

Working Mens C lub w h i c h                is situa t e d     in Hali f a x Rd near             to    its j u n c t i o n

with Doe Royd Ln or                 perhaps        one   of the      public      houses       on the a d j o i n i n g

hcsusing estates.

Th r o u g h o u t    the day     leading       up to ki c k - o f f , it was            particularly

noticeable            that    large     numbers      of s u p p o r t e r s were drinking              from     cans        or

bottles        and many were            intoxicated.           In fairness,            however,        with     those

exce p t i o n s mentioned,             I will      say that      the fans were well                  behaved

although          in man y     cases     boisterous.           I was      surprised        that       those

supp o r t e r s heading          for    the    ground after 2.3 0              pm    (1430)     appeared         to

be    in no particular              hurry      to get     to the      ground even up to 2 . 5 0 p m

(1450).           Traffic      in H a l i f a x Rd,      whilst      busy an d        cause    serious

North.         The     remaini ng two serials,               42 and 43,          were due        to take        their

meal     break at         that    time at C laywhee 1 s Lane T r a f f i c De par trne n t .                      We      set

off    to walk         to the gr o u n d and by this time                     there was       only     the

o c casional          football      s u p po rter    heading      for     the ground.            Traffic        was

very     light and of a local                  nature.       E n- r o u t e    to the     ground       I saw a

number       of O f f icers       near      to the Gate        Inn Pu b l i c House           in P e n i s t o n e     Rd

       N o r t h speaking         to a group of about               six m e n who were obv i o u s l y

       intoxicated.              Those   s u p p o r t e r s made    their way along L e p pings                Lane

       watched       initially       by O f f i c e r s   in my      company■         We then       c o n tinued alonq

       Peni stone Rd towards              the ground.As             we did so,        I heard a radio message

       from a voice          I did not       recognise asking               for    the     gates    to be opened.
t ,I
\      Although          I was    unaware    of what was            h a p p e n i n g , the    ca 11 er s o u n d e d quite

       panicky and          I remarked       to Police Serge a n t               D I X O N to that effect.                As we

       a p p r o a c h e d Gate    *0*   to the ground          I heard a radio mess a g e                d i recting

       all    O f f icers at C l a y w h e e l s    Lane    to a t t e n d at       the       ground    immediately.

       At 3 . 1 5 p m     (1515)    we ^entered the ground a nd went                       i m m e d iately    to the

       opening       between thre N o r t h S t a n d and the S pi o n Kop where                        I saw

       S u p e r i n t e n d e n t ffiREENWOOD.     I saw that           there were a large              number          of

       people      on     the/pitch at       the L e p p i n g s Lane        end of the ground an d                  I

       assumed       th      L i verpool     supporters         had      invaded      the      pitch.     I had          no

       idea at       that    time    the game       had been under way or the extent                           of    the

       problem.

       I a s k e d S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G R E E N W O O D where    he w i s h e d me to de p l o y my men

       and he      indicated the          playing area          p e r imeter       track       facing   the N otts

       Forest      supporters        on the S p i o n Kop.

       At that       time there was          only a handful              of P o l i c e   O f f icers   on the           track

       a n d the Notts Fo r e s t         s u p p o r t e r s were     chanting and taunting                  the

       Liv e r p o o l    supporters.

       Several       supporters were           half-heartedly attempting                       to climb the

       perimeter          fence.     I instructed Officers                  to    spread out across             the

       perimeter          track    facing    the S p a o n Kop.

       Several      Notts Forest          s u p p o r t e r s were     scr e a m i n g at me to         clear       the

       pitch and          it was    evident? that         they too a s s u m e d          there    had been a pitch

       invasion by Liver pqsiAr s u p p o r t e r s .

       I had been          in p o s i t i o n for a few minu t e s           w h e n a youth        ran ac r o s s        the

       pitch from the o p p o s i t e          end shouting abuse                 towards       the S p i o n Kop.            I
d e p u t e d one Officer          to    remove     him but the y o u t h               ran off back          towards

the L e p p i n g s Lane stand where                 I saw he was               d e t ained by other Police

O fficers.          About    five m i n u t e s     elapsed before                I realised that             the

s i t u a t i o n was more      serious        than     I had first              env i s a g e d and     I noticed

that     there were         injured       persons       lying        on the       pitch at the L e p pings

Lane     side of the ground.                 I attempted             to calm the shouting Notts

Fo r e s t    supporters      by     pointing       out that          there were            injured      people on

the     pitch and that          it      could not simply              be cleared.

The    taunts       by the N o t t s Fo r e s t       supporters               continued,        then s u d d e n l y a

large        number of L i v e r p o o l     s u p p o r t e r s who were          on the        pitch,     clearly-

incensed by the             taunts,       ran towards           the S p i o n Hop           in response.              I

f e a r e d a large       clash when         the Liverpool                suppo r t e r s    reached       the S pion

Kop but Officers             in front        of the S p i o n Kop s u c c e s s f u l l y ushe r e d

the L i v erpool        s u pporters        back across             the    pitch to the L e p pings

Lane     side and a large               cordon of Police              officers          f o r m e d across      the

w i d t h of the       pitch to         prevent     further          problems        of that        nature.           Whilst

all    this was       taking       place     I did not hear any                   radio messa g e s         from the

P o l i c e Control,        although        had any been made                   I doubt      that    I would          have

h eard what was          being       said due       to the          level       of noise       from the        crowd.           I,

did hear K e n n y D A L G L I S H make an a n n o u n c e m e n t                over      the ground        public:

addr e s s     system and wh i l s t         I could not make                   out what       he said his

message        seemed to have a calming                   effect          on    the Notts Fo r e s t         supporters.

Liverpool          s upporters       were    di s m a n t l i n g    the a d v e r t i s i n g    h o a rdings        to use

as stret c h e r s and        it was        then that         the s e r i o u s n e s s      of the s i t u a t i o n

became        known to the N o t t s F o r e s t          supporters,             and myself         for    that

matter,        whe n several         bodies were          brought          from    the L e p pings Lane               stand

d i r ec t i o n   towards    the S p i o n Kop.At 4 . 2 5 pm                  (1625)    an a n n o u n c e m e n t       was

made     that      the m a t c h was      to be abandoned.                     In the absence          of any         other

instructions           I caused Serial            Number 41           to       remain    in position until                  the

bulk     of the Notts F o r e s t           s upporters         had       left    the Spion Kop.              Following

               that     I a n t i c i p a t e d that     there would          be Public Order              problems       outside

               the gro und so took              the d e c i s i o n to       revert      to Phase 3 and took                the

               serial      from the ground             on foot a long P e n i s t o n e Rd N o r t h towards

               Hali f a x Rd.         On that       journey although               I was     subject       to numerous

               comments about            the Police            causing      the    deaths      of s upporters          by opening

               the    gates,      I saw no signs               of t r ouble.At 6 . 3 0 p m           (1830)    I went     to

               C l a y w h e e 1s Ln w i t h Serial            41 and s u b s e qu e n t l y    returned to M ain St Pstn

                On S at u r d a y 9th April               1 9 3 8 I was on duty at FA Cup semi-final m atch

                 b e t w e e n Liverpool           and N o t t i n g h a m Forest at H i 1 i s b o r o u g h .

                My duties            concerned         the    supervision             of serials            responsible     for     the

                 Po l i c i n g    of the       turn s t i l e s     at    the L e p pings           Lane    end of the     ground

                 designated             for    the L.iverpoo 1 s u p p o r t e r s .                I a tt e n d e d at both     brief i m

                 in respect             of the m a t c h and            received         no specific          instructions        on

                 chan e l l i n g       fans    into    the     t u r n s t i l e s and        cannot       recollect    any

                 inst r u c t i o n s     being      given      regarding           fans a r r i v i n g      without    tickets.

                 I took      up position after                  the       p r e-match       brief i n g      on the   f(3recourt are

        Other        officers were              on duty on that                forecourt a rea on general                    public

        order        duties       but there was               no    chaneliing         of fans       into       the    turnstiles

        or    cordons          either      by P o l i c e m e n or         barriers        to filter           the    fans   in

        Le & p i n q s L a n e ,       The      turn s t i l e s were          i n d i v i d u a l l y ma r k e d and    on arrival

        fans were making                 their        own way through               the    gates     to the          turnstiles

        a l t h o u g h where         possibly         I assisted,             as did other          officers,          by

        d i recting         fans      to the a p p r o p r i a t e         t u r nstile     queues,

        I was        unaware       of any        specific           arrangements           in hand to q u e s t i o n or

        s e a r c h fans arriving                with o u t        tickets      but any fans who a pp e a r e d               to be

        ar o u n d w i th tic ka t s were               encouraged            to ent e r t he q r o u n d .

        Wh i l s t   that was an easy                  task        in the     early       part   of the a f t e r n o o n         it

        became more             difficult         as    the        numbers      of suppo r t e r s        arriv i n g    increased

        p r o g r e s s i v e l y towards            kick-off        time.

        I noticed           that      large      numbers           of f ans     s m e 11ed of      i n t o x 1 cants and          I

        recollect           two        or three       o c casions         turning       a way fans who            were so

        in t o x i c a t e d    that      they were           being       supported        by friends.               One officer

        ar r e st ed a y o u t h for             d r un ke n e s s .

        D u r i ng t he        last    half      hour       or so before           kick-off        time        up to 3 . Q Q p m

        (1500)       the       forecourt are a              became        c o n s i d e r a b l y more    c o ngested a l t h o u g h
r
        it was       still        possible           for me to stand and                  direct     fans       towards      the

        appropriate             turnstiles.                 In particular           I recollect           a large       queue

        gat h e r i n g     at one set           of t u r n s t i l e s whilst a m u c h            smaller           queue was

        g a t h e r e d at another              set    of turns t i l e s         giving access            to the       same area

        of    the ground beyond                  the    t u r nstile         entrances.          1 was able            to direct

        fans     from       one queue           to another           without an y fears              of    injury       to myself

               or the       fans,       I have       seen t e 1 e v s i o n shots           of the scene        outside

               t urns t i l e s      in L e p p i n g s L.ane this year and                1 can say that        the      si tuat •

               in 1988 bore            no    comp a r i s o n   to what     I saw on the            television,           Althou^

               queues at the turn s t i l e s               in 1988 were         heavy and there was a lot of

               shoving,        pushing and eagerness                   to get    into       the ground      I did not        see

               any    real     signs        of danger       to anyone       in the         queues.

              By 3 . Q Q p m      C 11300} most       of the Liverpool             s upporters        had e n t e r e d    the

               g round y only those               persons arriv i n g         after        that   time were      outside at

               k i c k off     time,

               I a ct u a l l y went         into    the    seating a rea of the west S tand at                     k i ck — o f f

               time and noted that all                     seats   in the       stand were          occupied,

               I remained            in that      general       area    thro u g h o u t    the game and        r e t urned to

              the Leppi n g s          Lane    a rea a f t e r the m atch          until      all    fans had     dispersed.

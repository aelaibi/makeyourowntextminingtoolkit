    We a r r i v e d    in S h ef fi el d at about          1 pin7 and       parked about     1/2 mile from

    the ground on a small                    road,    leading     to an industrial           estate,     it is

    opposite a garage and a r o u n d a b o u t .

    We finally got to the                    ground about       1.45pm or 2.00pm.            There were    no

    queues,      the sit u at io n was         chaotic and eve ry bo dy was moving                 en-mass       and

    all   trying        to get      in together.       We    received no directions              from

    P olice    or Stewards             and we found      it difficult         to get     to the turnstile

"7 because we           could only        see one,     and had to move           over    at an angle.      We
/

    found     it difficult           to get through the turnstile                  because    of the     crush

    of people.         We all      had tickets       purchased      from A n fi el d for £6 to the

    L ep p i n g s Lane         End,     and this was    the end we went          to.



    I got     into      position to watch the m atch at ^bout 3 .00pm and stood                            in

    the terrace          in pen 3 , I went t h rough theX'unnel,                   easily with no

    o b s t r u c t i o n s at first      1 was stood with my brothers and at that time

    the   crowd were          crushing and           it was very difficult            to move.    Very

    shor t l y after            this     I felt asurge and         1 was     pushed forward        at this

    point     I lost      sight        of my brothers. There was              sheer     panic some      fellow

    had his arm around                 my throat and        I c o u l d n ’t breath,     my feet weren't

    even touching            the    floor,    then he must have              seen my eyes and       realised       1

    c o u l d n ’t breath,         he then grabbed my neck and                  pulled me    upwards,     I was

    by the f e n c e , I m an a ge d to put a foot on the bar and he pulled me up

    and over       the    fence      into    the ne;<t pen       (5)     this    is the small      pen where

    the   police       used to stand.

    I cannot           recall      how    I got from        pen 3 into       pen 4 and all the way to            the

    fence     itwas      sheer      panic and    chaos going           on.

    I went     from the small             pen and onto the          pitch thro ug h the gate.            Whe n    I

    got   onto         the   pitch       I saw a young        lad staggering around, and tried to

    help him,          after a while         he seemed to         be alright and I let him go.

    unconscious.            I picked up one end of the board,                                           and Pc Wa lt on         picked up

    the other ^ n d , also helping was a man I found out to be

              ^ W e carried the man on the board, and as we got to the                                                             half­

    way     line somebody said he'd stopped breathing.                                                  We   immediately        put him

    down and started to give                      the kiss of                         life Pc Wa lt on was            checking         his

    pulse avid X said to                     try and give him heart m a s s a g e . I kept

    breathing        into him until               X c o u l d n ’t any more,                            I was   physically sick

    w ith    the    effort Pc Wa lt on thsn took over the mouth to mouth and                        <                  -

    star t e d giving         him heart massage.                              Then a doctor               came over and said

    there was        no more we         could do for him,                               he had d i e d , but          I carried on,

    Peter     W a l t o n then took me by my arm and told me to stop because

    nothing more           could be d o n e _________________________________________________

    was     none,    Peter      then    called to a WPG                               for a stretcher            because       he did

    not want        to    carry him out on the board.                                       She    returned with one we

    t r a n sf e r r e d him onto       the s t r e t c h er and                        carried him to the makeshift

    morgue,        with the help of other Police                                       officers.          I gave my name and
1                                                                                     ,hen Peter         took us outside and
    addr e s s     to a PC so did

    gave     us a cup of tea,            that was about                               it.

    I w ou l d describe          the man on the stretcher as                                        receding and fairly well

    built,       wearing      I thi nk h r own trousers and a white                                          shi rt with       I think

    After all        this     I found my brothers                                 outside         the ground they were             both

    all     right.       I did not go to hospital                                  but a ft er w ar d s my ribs            left

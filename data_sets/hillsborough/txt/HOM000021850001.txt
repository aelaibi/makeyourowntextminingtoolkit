  2, STRUCTURE AND ORGANISATION

            in n^h?,two lft*Sues require a licence from the
     .       uflball-Bund (DFB) and are represented in the DFB bv
  member associations (Mitgliedsverbiinde).
  The membership levy paid to the DFB is 3% of ticket sale
  revenue for the Bundesliga and 1% for the 2nd Bundeeliga.
  Issuing of licences ;
  flfnh                a contract with the DFB, which obliges the
  club to observe the DFB statutes and decisions. On payment of a
  period*        DM100, a licence is issued for a twelvemonth

  Prerequisites for obtaining a licence i
  - written application by the club
  - evidence   of club's Bporting qualifications
    ®3iI9tloe  °5 °lub's technical and administrative facilities
  - evidence   of economic viability in line with DFB guidelines

  Technical and administrative qualifications «
  Co.urt^       R®^i-®ter of Associations at the competent Local
  - non-profit-making and largely honorary management
  - a minimum of 12 licensed players under contract
  - employment of players and coaches only through official
  channels
             to hold’ its games in a local stadium whioh possesses
  u      ? necessary facilities,    Stadium must be authorised to
  hold at least 15,000 spectators and have floodlights of 400 lux
  (or 700 lux if built after 1/7/81)
  - be subject to statutes and ordinances of the DFB and the
  decisions of the DFB bodies.

   audited final balance sheet plus profit and loss account for
 previous financial year
 - standard costing of expenditure and income from 1st Jan to
 30th June

   The DFB vraB founded in 1900 and has 4,800,000 individual
   members,     122,500 teams are registered, ranging from the 38
           ll        ®ma11 associations.   Half of this number are
       I t i?amS <play®*s under 18 years of age), Professional
   footballers have only been accorded this status since 1948/49.
   The structure of the DFB ie pyramidical, with the two
^^professional leagues at the top of the pyramid.       Under these
   C0!?®i.u *        S^oups of top amateur clubs, based regionally,
   and then the wide base of smaller local and youth clubs,      The
         f    *f?vtrnB the 7 National teams*   The parliament of the
   DFB has 183 delegates, drawn from the member olubs.      The DFB
   has been a member of FIFA since 1904 and UEFA from 1954,      The
   secretariat of the DFB is based in Frankfurt.

    Sport in the f r g is largely Independent of the State, In a
    recent statement by the Home Secretary, this independence was
    underlined, although Herr Schfcuble did say that sport~related
    violence was something which the Federal Government was keepina
    an eye on.                                                     *

    3. FUNDING

    Formerly clubs were funded solely by ticket sales.     Over the
    past ten years advertising and sponsorship have become more and
    more important.  (e, g, 1. FC  Kftln: only 42% of their budget
    was from ticket sale revenue   lastyear).

    A club has one major sponsor   (e, g, Sharp for the HSV, Samson for
    the 1, FC Ktiln) who will have theadvertising space on the
    players' shirtB,   Each club also has cosponsor.     Another form
    of sponsorship is the pitch-side advertising,

    Television rights for all Bundesliga matches which have been
    sold via the DFB to the UEFA amount to DM1. 4 million for each
    First Division club and about DM800, 00 for each Second Division
    club,  For any other matches d(e. g, European Cup) the clubs can
    negotiate special deals with TV companies.

    The olubs sometimes receive public funds, e, g. when they want
    to build a new stadium which can be used by other town olubs or
    schools as well,

    4. TRANSFER ARRANGEMENTS

    Another major resource for clubs are the transfer fees paid for
    top player* which occasionally reach astronomical levels,
    especially where transfers to foreign olubs are involved.  In
    theory, there is no limit to the sum which a club can demand
   1989-10-30   12=28     CONSULAR DEPT FCO.              01 270 4139   P.05



       ??ot the DFB haB a '8ohiea*geriqht' (arbitration
                 wi H decide on a reasonable amount in oases of
 0 troversial transfers.     The poor oluba have little chance of
™   ?g     t0P            who would in turn attract many
            aru* thus have lower ticket sale revenues.   The
ricner clubs can easily become even richer by these transfers

 Transfer compensation
    any club which takes the player of another club under
u ^ n;Ja0 19 obl±^r»a to pay transfer compensation to thii» club;
lin the case of amateurB possibly to several former clubs
 - the club paying the transfer fee is also liable for the VAT.

Transfer regulations for professionals j
-transfer fees for professionals may be freely agreed between
the two clubs concerned.
“ the new club is obliged to inform the DFB of the amount of
the transfer fee within 8 days of the conclusion of the
contract
- disagreements about the amount of the transfer fee may go to
arbitration.   Such a disagreement may arise if a club has
           a oo«tr*ot with a player before reaching agreement
with his present club.

Transfer regulations for amateurs j
I if a league club engages the services of an amateur the
following transfer fees must be paid:
a) for 1st division olubs     DM 33,000
b) for 2nd division clubs     DM 25,000
  the right to claim transfer compensation exists for seven
years.  Any club for which the player was eligible to play
during these seven years may claim a proportional share of this
fee.
- if an amateur club is promoted to the 2nddivision, the
players may retain their amateur status orturnprofessional,
in which case the above transfer regulations apply.

5. SAFETY ARRANGEMENTS

The d f b has set up general safety instructions, e.g. escape
routes at the stadiums.     Apparently, the DFB is considering
prohibiting standing room in the stadia for Bundesliga matches.
This of course, puts some financial strain on those clubs who
do not dispose of all-seat-etadia and would have to spend quite
a lot of money for building new stadia or adjusting the
existing ones to a higher standard. No final decision has been
made.

In most cases, football clubs rent their stadium from the
municipal authorities for usually 15% of the ticket sale

                                                            /revenue
        1989-10-30   12:29   CONSULAR DEPT FCO.      01 270 4139   P.06




      revenue from each match,  Therefore the municipal authorities
      are responsible for the security/safety of the stadia,  The DFB
      formed a 'Sioherheitskommission' (Security Commission) about
      two yeare ago which conducts regular but unannounced checks on
      all stadia.

      The olubs are responsible for providing security staff for each
      match on homeground.  They usually have a contract with a guard
      company.  In addition, the police send officers to each match
      according to the number of expected spectators.  Altogether
      there would be between 250 and 500 security officials at a
      match/ depending on sis*.

        As with every public event the fire brigade and ambulance/Red
        Cross personnel are prosent.    Three clubs in the First Division
        own their own stadium and have their own security force.    As far
        as security checks, police etc. are concerned the same applies
    ^ ^ t o them as to the other olubs.   Before a match there will
    ^Palways be co-ordinating talks between all security people
         involved.

       In the case of international games the police hand out leaflets
       explaining the situation in the stadium, how to get there, ate.
       Up to now the clubs do not have to pay the police for this
       service.  But it has already been discussed whether to ask the
       olubs to pay for the security units.

       5, we sent information on the organisation of international
       Tournaments last year, for the European Nations Cup.   This may
       have some relevance to the Inquiry, although it is not
       included in the specific topics you asked for in your TUR.
       See, for example, L. Walker's note of 23 May 1988 following his
       visit as Overseas Liaison Officer to the FRG; and CO
       Frankfurt's letter of 15 June 1988 to HM Ambassador Bonn - both
       oopied to Consular Dept.
       7. I also attach notes from the CGs In Hamburg and Berlin on
       individual clubs in the FRG, which give some additional general
       information.

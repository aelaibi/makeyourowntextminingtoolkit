                                     27th April, 1989




Dear Sir/Madam,

     Thank you for your kind letter regarding the
Hillsborough Tragedy which I received on the 25th
April, 1989.

     Your supportive comments have been noted and
will be communicated to the appropriate authorities.

     As you are probably aware Lord Justice Taylor
is conducting a detailed enquiry into the events of
the tragedy and I have no doubt his findings will
prevent a further traffgdy on this scale.

                        Yours faithfully,




                          J. qOLLEDGE

                      car.

              I obtained my ticket from Anfield and paid six pounds for it, which

             was for the Leppings Ln standing area.

              On route to the game we did not s t o ^ o r           any reason.    The only delays

              we suffered were due to heavy traffic on the M62 just outside

              Manchester.     I only saw a cpu|         of fans,     drinking out of cans on

              route to the game.

              I d o n ’t know where we parked exactly,          I can say that it was about

              twenty minutes walk from the ground.

              Walking from the car to the ground I d i d n ’t see that many Police

              officers,    I saw Policemen stood together     in t w o ’s outside shops.       I

              had to ask a Policeman the way to the ground.            He directed me to the

              ground,    but other than this I was not escorted or directed in anyway.

              There was no trouble,     everyone was   in good spirits     looking forward to

              the game.

              We arrived at the entrance to the ground at 2.30 pm. There were no

 <-(          queues    it was just a mass of people/      I saw two mounted officers in

              the middle of the crowd.        TheyNwe/j just outside the main perimeters

              gate I saw a group of about ten        Pdflice off ice rs stood by the shops

              These officers were also trying to get people at the back of the mass

              of people to move back.      They obviously realised that it was crushed

              at the front of the mass     crowd.    The only problem was that fans were

              crossing over the river bridge and j o i n i n y t h e   crowd without realising

              what was going on.     Police officers werar trying to get the fans back

              but all the time,    the fans    coming ovejr the bridge were just swelling

              the crowd.

              I also saw aboi     for or five Pol: :emen stood by the perimeter gates,

              They were tryiiig^to^Ke^p the gafl,es shut,     the fans were been pushed

              from behind and were crlishing^up against the gates.           It w a s n ’t a

              deliberate effort to op^n t/e gates fans at the back were pushing to

              get in.     Fans at the f r o n Y were trying to push back to get out of the

              crush.     Some at the front were having to climb over the gates to get

              out of the crush.     Police at the gates were trying to keep the gates

              shut,    fans were pleading with them to open the gates as they were been

              crushed.     The two mounted officers    in the middle of the crowd seemed

              to have little effect, whatever they did the crowd just continuing

          surging forward.      I did not see any stewards outside the ground.

          I have previously been to the ground so I knew where I had to go.

          Obviously the problems      I had were just the crowd,    I ’ve never seen a

          crush like this before.

          Eventually one of the perimeter gates was opened.          The one nearest the

          river,    I went through the gate and I was then just in front of the

          tu rns til es.

          As far as I can see there was only three turnstiles open.            In this

          area it w a s n ’t as packed.   I hung back as I was waiting for my friend

                           to come through.   The perimeter gates had now been shut

          and he was still outside.

          I was stood waiting for about one and a half minutes when the

          perimeter gates were again opened.       This time d mass of people came

          through             was   right at the front   andr joined me.

          At the same time all the people went to m y right and went to an open

          were walking about trying to sort out where to go.          The time by now

          was about 2.50 pm <1450).

          I did not see anyone      climbing into the ground, all    I   saw was people

          trying to get out of the crush.

          As I entered the Court yard I saw a lot of Police         at   theback of the

          turnstiles.      They werent doing anything they just     had to let people

          through.

          To the right of the gate I saw another group of Police officers with

          some stewards talking to some fans,       I d o n ’t know what they were

          actually doing.

          As I say it was very busy just outside the court yard.           But I was able

          to make my way through the people and went to the toilet.
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S160S

As I went through the gate         I d i d n ’t hand my ticket in no one was

asking to see them.          I retained this ticket LL3            until   I

surrendered half of it for a refund.

When I came out of the toilet I went dafwn the tunnel             I d i d n ’t realise

that you get to the sides of the stand which is where I wanted to go
              <^rr~ D i e - e c j n o N / o i G r r S D
to.  I did not see any signs directing me to the sides.

I had free passage along the tunnel although it was packed.                Although

if I wanted to I could          of teamed round and gone out I     saw no disorder

or drinking inside the ground.

As I reached the end of the tunnel           I hit a wall of people who were

stood in the terraces.         I wasnt able to get into the terraces they

were   really packed.

As I stood facing this wall of people I was pushed from behind by

people coming down the          tunnel.   I was then pushed from the end of the

tunnel   into the terraces.       I was    forces to the right into what you

call   pen three.      I was pushed straiafnt down the terraces to a position

half way down directly opposite tJfe gate onto the pitch.               On the grid

reference it would be in a position of about 5D.I             lost my friend in

this crush down from the tunnel.                          *

As I got pushed from the tunnel           the game kicked off by the time I was

half way down the terraces play was in motion.

Once   I was stopped I couldnt go any further.          The pressure from behind

was constant it was not a sudden suge.

The crush was       very uncomfortable, it d i d n ’t effect my    breathing I

c o ul dn’t move    my hands and it was very hot.

A man who was       stood right next to me to my right suddenly began           to

fall onto the       floor.    I realised that he had fainted. I tried to

grab hold of him,       to stop him going on the floor, as did other fans

around him.        This man fell onto the floor and ended up lying on his

back directly underneath the crash barrier.            As he went down he must

                of reco#erd/a bit because he was then trying to pull himself up.                  He

                had hold of the barrier pulling up but people were on his legs and

                he couldn't get up.              Two other people who were trying to help this man

                 also went down on the floor,             one also ended up under the barrier and

                the other one was to the right of the barrier.

               People were trying to push back to let those people up.                It was

               hopeless they couldn't do a thing.               the crowd just kept forward coming

               over       them.      with all the crowd surging over the people     I couldn't see

               what       happened to the other two people.         I could only see the man who

                fell      down first.      He was lay on the f^Loor for at least a minute when I

               saw him go blue and he became motionless,              he just starred up at the

TO     \ / W   sky I realised that he was dead. /This man was middle aged, about 45

               years with dark hair, with a b^ld patch.               He was wearing a dark jacket
vitwru         ^----------------------
                *"'0 S S * k ^    leather with a whi^e shirt underneath this.      He was a

'JQ            heavy build man with             c^it ^ a big pot belly.   I couldn't do anything to

               help       him,     I couldn't even bend over.

               By this time I realised things were getting very dangerous.                I began

             [\ shouting at the Police on the pitch to open the gate and let people
TO     \/   \A
                out.  By this time there was a line of Police against the fence, they

 /Pw           wfere      stopping people climbing over the fence telling them to get back

               into the terraces.               But people just continued climbing over the

                fencing to get           out.     Some Policemen and even some of fans were stood

               directing the fans to move back.

                I think the police officers thought initially that it was a pitch

                invasion as there was still a lot of singing going on from Liverpool

                fans who didn't know what was going on.              This drowned out a lot of the

               shouting and screaming.               Also Notts Forest fans to the right were

                booing,          which I think put pressure on the Police to stop fans getting

               on to the pitch, which would interfere with the game which was still

                going on.

All the time in the terracing      it was still a made panic a couple of

people,   including a twelve year old girl were passed over our heads

from behind.     3                        d.

Gradually peopl                           o    fall over and ended up in a big

heap at the frc

blocking it on]                           eople out.    Eventually he moved

away and people                           I didn't feel any surge of the

crowd it was ji

Just   in front of me    I saw a lot of people   just fall over like a      pack

of cards.    They all    ended up lying on top   of one another.     As soon as

this happned people from behind began climbing over them trying to get

out over the fencing and also through the gate.          It was then that

people really started to panic.

I d o n ’t think these   people that fell over   had any chance of getting

up.    So many people    just walked or climbed over the top of them.       I

d o n ’t know why those people fell over.      People were finding     it hard to

stand up, as once one fell others tripped over them which made matters

worse.

I am sure that by this time,      the game had been stopped. But I dont

know how long for.

I saw one fan try and pull the fencing down who was on the pitch.

A Policeman and women took hold of him and lead him away.

By this time the pitch was full of fans and Police,         people in the

terracing were crying and screaming.              le were lying on the floor

with others trying to help them up.

I saw a friend of mine                    lying in the heap at the front of

the fencing.     He used to go to\ thus same school as me.             was about

five feet to the right of the g/te r i o m       on top of the heap of people.

 I could see that he was unconscrioii/.        I tried to get to him

but I couldn't get through the crowd.          I only moved forward about four

feet when I lost sight,of               This heap just seemed to be getting

bigger and bigger.

People by this time were climbing out over the sides of the pens.

Still    people were climbing over the front.       It wasi^t a mad panic to

get out of the gate.       People were carrying injur/ni people out through

the gates.

Eventually the terraces began to clear.          Thafre were people lying on

the terraces some in obvious pain and others that I think were dead.
r       --           ---  --       .- X  -J
Most of those dead or injured seemed tlj p e       in front of me towards the

fenc i n g .

I was still stood in the same spot and I couldn't see this man that

had fallen I think he must have been moved.

A Policeman came up the terracing and asked to gov6ut through the

back.     I di d n ’t hear any loud speaker ann ou nce ment s.   I then left

through the tunnel      it was about twenty five >£ast three by this time,

Once back in the Court yard I began to he^p other Liverpool            fans in

carrying injured people to ambulances.

It was here that I saw a lot of P o l i c M e n wandering around doing

nothing.       Fans were screaming at them in anger to do something to help

the injured.      But they didn't seem to be helping anyone.        When an

ambulance arrived they seemed more-xoncerned about getting it through

the crowd.      All around people amp st] Johns Ambulance men and women

were helping the injured.

I did not see any fan committing a criminal offence.             All the fans

were trying to help.       When I eventually left the ground I went and

stood on the river bridge just outside the gates.            I saw a lot of

Policemen stood around.       Who could of been inside helping.I d o n ’t

think the Police realised that people were dying in the

terraces.       I fail to see though,   how they did realise that people were

                 being crushed.      It was fair to obvious.     Problems were obviously

                 caused by lack of communi cat ion s.     The tui'm^l should of been closed.

                 when it was apparent there was a crushy^/lnstead fans were just

                 allowed into the terracing making FH&Fters worse.

                 There should have been more control       inside the ground and stewards to

                 direct you to where to stand,     rather than just lejf people crowd down

                 the tunnel.

                 I believe that if the perimeter gate had noir been opened people would

                 have been killed outside.      They had no osaion but to open the gate.

                 There was no crush by the turnstiles £<ut I think it got worse once          I

                 got inside the ground.

                 Outside the gates,     I saw a Liver po ol^ giving a Po^fce officer some

TO               ve rbal abuse.    This officer punched this fan ojjr the head with a

                 clenched fist as hard as he could.

                 This aggrevated a lot of fans who started yfhouting abuse at the

                 officer.More so about the situation a n d / o    open the gate.   Fans
OfffrJCt
C                immediately around the officer began slitting at him only about five

                 or six fans,     but eventually the farys calmed down again.

o f f i c e      This officer moved his hors      tow*   ds the right hand perimeter gate

 4               to stop people surging througiv'it.

                 I was close to the gate and this Policeman I was been pushed up

                 against the horse.      I had no alternative but to go under the horse,

                 or I would have been injured.      The gate was then opened,

                        ot receive any injuries.

               Further to the statement         I made on 13.5.89 <130589)      in relation to the

               semi final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on April                15 1989

               < 150489*)N*t Hillsborough.

               In that statefRfint I referred to an incident outside the perimeter

               gates at the Lepp1sQgs\ L a n e ^ u r n s t i 1 es , where a mounted police officer

               struck out\at a fan in the           crowck^

               ^1147.    I am positive this is the same incident,          I was just behind the

               man in the red shirt.          I d i d n ’t see which man the Police Officer

               struck,    but he did connect        with somebody.

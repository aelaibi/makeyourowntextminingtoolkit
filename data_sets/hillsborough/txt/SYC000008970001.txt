Dear Sirs,

Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.



If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the C o r oners’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
witnesses who wish to give evidence.   I am at present engaged in considering
this and in determining who I wish to' invite to attend.

Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
appropriate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m you would like me to
consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
submit.

Your$ faithfully,

Further to ay letter of the 14th of March Reft- HILljfSOI*/!
X now enclose the text of the summary in respect of the deceased
listed on the attached schedule.

It will immediately be obvious that the summary has been prepared
as a concise and factual report. In places it refers to the
deceased by number or without designation of title.

I am very anxious to try and ensure that the disclosure of
this summary should not either cause offence or unnecessarily
upset family members. I am conscious that there may be some who
may find the style rather too cool.

Whilst it is of course a matter for you, I would be grateful
if you would very carefully consider how and when to disclose
the summary to your clients in order to try and avoid unnecessary
upset or distress.

I should mention that it is the intention that at the hearing,,
the contenis of the summary will be presented to the Inquest
in as sympathetic a way as it is possible to do so in the
circumstances.

I would be grateful if you would please acknowledge receipt of
this letter with enclosures by Fax to Det. Superintendent S.
Beechey, West Midlands Police, Nechells Green Police Station,
Fowler Street, Birmingham. B7 5DA Fax No. 021 356 6735 immediately

te a *      Sirs,
He:         Joseph J. Clark (deoeased) Ho.25.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990.

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
ha,g decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

 I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
 is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
 fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



 S.L.Popper,
 H.M. Coroner.

        Bear Sirs,

        You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
        reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
        in fact put in as evidence.

        However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
        and the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
        I have decided that subject to certain conditions sat out below,
        I am prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
        report of your .client(s).

        The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

               a.      They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                       subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                       they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

               b.      Tney are to Qe used only for the purpose of bereavement
                       conselling of the deceased’s relatives or for proper
                       legitimate purposes in c o n n e x i o n with any legal proceedings
                       in which solicitors may be engaged.

               c.      Subject to tne.':ab,3v § ? they are to be kept confidential until
                       they come into the public domain at the resumed Inauests.

        a have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
        of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
        assumption that you will confirm that the renort in respect of
        each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
        above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
        I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report.  If for any
        reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
        the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

        The cost for the copy post mortem report (s.) is fly* Per sheet (total                                 }
        Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

     Re:      Joseph James Clarke                       (Deceased)

    We refer to previous correspondence in connection with this
    matter.  We do of course appreciate that for very obvious reasons
    it will be some time before the Inquest in full will be convened
    but in the meantime, in view of the distress that the
    continuation of this matter is causing to our clients, we would
    be obliged to receive advance disclosure of the post mortum
    report and await hearing from you.

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

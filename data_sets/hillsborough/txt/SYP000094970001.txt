        Dear Sir,


        RE:      ADLINGTON V DUCKENFIELD and MURRAY
                 LEEDS MAGISTRATES’ COURT - 21 DECEMBER 1998


        In early July 1998, the solicitors for these defendants wrote to the Crown Prosecution
        Service asking that we take over a discontinue the criminal proceedings against their
        clients which have been brought, by Ms Ann Adlington on behalf of the Hillsborough
        Family Support Group.

        We have considered this request in detail.

        Mr. Duckenfield faces two charges of manslaughter, one of wilful neglect to perform
        a public duty and one of attempting to pervert the course of justice. Mr. Murray faces
        two charges of manslaughter and one of wilful neglect to perform a public duty.

        We have considered the evidence, the representations made by the parties and all the
        surrounding circumstances of the case. We have concluded that we should not
        intervene to take over any of the charges.

        For your information I enclose a copy of a press notice.

        Yours faithfully,



        Christopher H. Enzor
        Branch Crown Prosecutor

Dear Sir,


With all due consideration to the relatives and loved ones

of the deceased I feel there is only one group of people

to blame for this horror.   These people are those so-called

fans who turned up at Hillsborough without tickets.

The police are completely blameless as this was an all-ticket

game and was a complete sell out. If these idiots, who call

themselves fans,had only obeyed the rules and not turned up

at the ground the problem would never have arisen.

Therefore if the blame is to be placed anywhere and costs

re-couped from anyone let it be from these lunatics who created

the disaster.      THE SO-CALLED FANS.


Yours sincerely,




The Coroner to the Hillsborough Disaster,
Sheffield Metropolitan Council,
Sheffield.

                          Chief Constable’s Memorandum

      SUBJECT




                               The attached are notes made
                          approximately 48 hours after my return
                          from Hillsborough and are, I feel, an
                          accurate recollection of the events
                          that day.  I have not turned these
                          notes into an official statement, as,
                          in themselves, they probably reflect
                          the actuality better than anything else
                          I could comprise at the present time.

                               I am prepared to make a formal
                          statement or, indeed, give any evidence
                          that the Inquiry so wishes.

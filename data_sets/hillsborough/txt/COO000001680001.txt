"FAST-TRACK" PUBLISHING
Many thanks for your letter of 6 February and for your account of
HMSO1s experience in relation to the Taylor report.    I am also
grateful for the proposals you make for introducing a new fast-
track arrangement for printing reports of this type.

I shall be putting advice to the Lord President shortly
reflecting the proposals you have made, and I am sure the Lord
President will then minute the Prime Minister.  I will keep you
in touch with developments and meanwhile I am grateful for your
speedy and positive response to my letter.

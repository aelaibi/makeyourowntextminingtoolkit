              2.35pm (1435).

              he did not have a ticket for the match but was meeting someone at the

              On arrival   I saw a large number of people on the road outside the

              g ro und.



              I reported to t>te ground gymnasium as directed.                   A few minutes       later

              something was radically wrong.         I went behind the goal mouth and saw

              People were obviously trapped.         The noise at this time was deafening.



                assisted at the gate to the right of the goal,                  getting people from

        aJ>   the terrace onto the playing area.            I then assisted in pulling one

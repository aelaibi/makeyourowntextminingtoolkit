              on the barrier we began                   to get      crushed       on this       b a r r i e r and    I thought

              my    right    leg was      going        to be broken,            and my     brother was         screaming

              beca u s e    the b a r riers wer e           so low,       he was       just    crushed totally against

              it.    1 was     then     carried along             by the       crowd further          down the Pen towards

              the    front,     I lost                   then      I knew the          players were          on the    pitch at

              this    stage,      but    I d i d n ’t see         them a lt h o u g h    they were       playing,          I

              remember       this     because      I thought,^ "d be stuck                    in the    crowd for

              made    eye    contact w i th a P o / i c e m a n who was                 leaning       over the       perimeter

              fenc i n g at the front,             / was         screaming at          him to get us out and all

              he did was        look fet riyf and tell me to move                       b a c k . I c o u l d n ’t move

« | T O ^     anywhere,        I. was        t ig h t l y    crushed,          my arms were        stuck      compl e t e l y by

              my sides and all            I could move was my head.                      I saw the       little       gate at

              the    front     open and thought              thank God for             that,    I'll    be able       to get

              out,    then     I saw them only              corning out         one at a time,          I thought          I'd be

              in here       forever.      It se e m e d      like     I'd been         in there       for ages       but       I

was    shouting,         "Get      her     out,    s h e ’s going," He was                screaming    this at         the

P o l i c e m a n at    the front.          S om e h o w   I was      then    lifted out from where                I

was and        passed to the             back where           there was       space,       I remember       the space

b ecause       I a ct u a l l y    crawled under a barrier                    to get       there,    on the way

although        it was a blurr,                there were           people    lying       on the ground       1

believe        they were          d%ad or u n c o n s c i o u s       but    I ’m not sure.         I was    then

l ifted up into              tl/e W S t a n d by some           people and         I recovered up there.                 I

was    p a n i c k i n g Y ^ t i 11 about                     and    two    lads who were          up there       helped

me    to get      out    of the       stand and go and                look for him.          I don't       know who

they are        or anything.             But     I was     in such a state,               I didn/t    think       to ask

who    they were         but we       found                    in the       gym entrance,                    :ame

down from the stand w h e n h e ’d realised what was                                   happening and had               come

to    look for me and                             He    found me       first and          then went    round the

gym    looking         for                  We    left     the gr o u n d about           four    thirty    (1630)       to

quarter        to five        (1645),       went       back    to the       car- and      came home.       As a

result       of the      crushing          I received an             in jura to the top of my               right

leg.    I had a dent, in it where                       the barriar          had been and was          still

having       trouble         b r eathing




I w ou l d     like to say that                1 thought        it was awful           and totally

u n d i gn if ie d     the way       the    dead were          treated.       Some     of them where         they had

been    pulled out of the                  pen,     had there         trousers       still       round their

ankles w h e n they were                 lying on the           pitch and         I even saw one hanging

out    the back of an a m bu la nc e as                    it was      being      driven a way from the

pitch area.                                                                          y'

Another        thing     that made me a ng r y was                   the    f^t    that a lot of Po 1 i ce

O ff i ce rs    just     stood a r ou nd          looking at                not   helping a n y o n e or

anything,         I just       couldn't          u n d e r s t a n d f w h y they did that.         Also    the man

            d i d n ’t look f o K ^ v e j f y   long because as soon as      I r e cognised the jumper

            he had on I looked away,                because    it upset me so much.

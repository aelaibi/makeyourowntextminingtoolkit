                  NorthQtand,          when the gates opened at 12.00 noon.                       At about     11.45 am

                 we positioned ourselves on gates 9 and 10 aiyrwhen they were opened at

                  approximately 12.05pm we began s e a r ^ h i t h e                      L iverpool fans before

                  they passed through the turnstiles.                           For the next two hours or so I

                  searched the fans before they entered the ground.                               There were no

                  queues at all at this stage and the several groups of young fans that

                  were    crowding outside the stand were continually broken up by the

                  mounted officers and were ordered to either enter the ground or move

                  on.

                  At approximately 2.-15 pm queues of fans began to gather outside the
                                                                                                 PAGE

turnstiles however it was still           possible to search them, and several

cans of alcoholic beverage were taken from fans before they were

all owed eij<fuy*>

By £.3Q|ffri it was impossible To                     my       of the fans due to the large

crowds at the                .es trying to force their way/t'n.                       At about this

t ime I noticed that several^,youths were climj^rlig t h e w a l T aajacent to

        tie and gaining ei^&ry into the rear of the idlest Strand, so I

forced myself through the crowds away from the turnstiles and located

PS468 WhiVlam outside the entrance to the stand.                           I pointed out the

                                                isji^e through tft/f olice

Contr       At this I returned to my turnstile No,                               It took me a good

"fO minutes to force my way back to the turnstile,                         a distance of

approximately 30 feet, as by this time huge numbers of fans had

gathered outside the turnstiles and were shoving and pushing                                 in an

attempt to gain entry to the ground before kick-off.                                At the turnstile

I stood by the wall to the left of the No.                     9 gate helping the old folk

and the children who were being pushed against the wall to move across

and pass through the turnstiles.              By this time it was absolutely

impossible to search anybody as I could hardly-afffve myself                                     not i ced

that several of the fans, mainly aged                 U            years were ver                nk and

were shouting,       swearing and s h o v i r ^ a l 1 the time.                I remember three or

four of these were so drunk thd*y could hardly stand but were leaning

over people in a stupor,           their eyes extremely glazed and I was very

angry that I could do nothing to prevent their entry to the ground as

by this time I was literally pinned to the yafl 1 and could not move at

all.    I can also remember several           peop1           o n arriving at the turnstiles

discovering that they had the wron^/toloured ticket and^Others with no

ticket but o ^ e r i n g   cash.     The^e people were turng^'away from the

/   turnstile      in front of him as he could see that I was helplessly

    crushed against the wall.              I told him I had to stay where I was and

    that I couldn't move anyway.              At this he shouted through the

    turnstiles telling the officers inside the ground of my predicament.

    I did not hear thei r reply but remember the man grabbi^rgmy .jacket and

    pulling me in front of him saying that they had^rfSld him to bring me

    through.      Real ising I was doi ng no goo^fieiiig pi nned to the wall         I let

    myself be forced through turnst i                by the weight of the crowd.

    Having    passed through the J^frnsti le I looked around for a way out of

    the ground intending i?o get to the rear of the queues outside and try

    to prevent the shoving and pushing;              As I looked around I saw the

    youths    climbing over the w a l y a n d     down the roofs of the turnstiles and

    into the ground.          They wei*e being helped down from the roof by a/

    couple of Police Officers.              I remember seeing Inspector          ,t climb

    up onto the r o o f ^ T'Tbe 1 ieve in an effort to prevent mf^e fans from

    entering.       i^remember that several of the fans jumping off the roof

    had t i cj^ets in their hands.           A cq>«pl e of minutes later 1 saw ’     gate

    opej^ng and around 300 fans rjiChing in.              I would estimate the gate was

    open for no morj^fhan 30 seconds.              As they were closing,.the gate I

    rushed out           it and went back round to the front            ,es where locj

came alongside the Police Box I saw a young woman, SO years,                lying on

the floor screaming hyster i ca lly .    I stopped to help this woman who

had been crushed outside the stand and inside and was crying and in

shock.   Myself,   and another WPG and a man I believe to be the g i r l ’s

boyfriend helped her to her feet and started walking her back round,

through the back of the West Stand intending to take her through the

Worth Stand to the First Aid Room.            However as we passed the tunnel

leading to the West Stand central terrace X saw several             police

officers running    in and Liverpool    fans coming out crying and shouting

that there were dead people      in th|#re.     At this time I told the

boyfriend to take the womar^Xfirough the North Stand/Co the First Aid

room and I ran down thj^tunne1 to the central terrace.              At the rear of

the cent ral ter r a j p ^ ^ saw Inspec^or^l^CTs       several other officers

clearing the>f?ack of the stand and moyjmg the fans down the tunne 1 and

out of yKe stand and so I joined %/C this Op er ati on, at this point

sti 1 lSinaware of what was goin*f on, believing that they were fighting

at the front of the terrace and on the pitch.           As we were moving the

fans on, several    of them were clearly upset and crying,          others calling

us "Bastards" etc. and wj#rflng to fight but being dragged away by

their friends,

At the back of ^ h e . t e r s a w     fans         'helped to cl imb up into

the seated                           These           were          way being

crushed at\the back of the terraces but I believe were merely trying

to get a seat.     Within a few minutes of havijgfef^cfeared the back of

the terraces I saw officers      carryinq^jaffconscious/deceased people out

of the ter race and along the tiyrtfel to the back of              stand,

followed these officers oj^T and attended to an^fnconscious youth who

had stopped breajhii       manaqiixr to revive jflm.        At this time I was
                     fl ,
working beside       75FB>ynis who waSvjaJ*Co attendiQg-'to an unconsciqus

         I then attended to the conscious casualties suffering from broken

         bones and shock.     I did not handle any o

         Throughout the whole    incident I did not

         either in the terraces or at the back of the West Stand.

         During my period of duty on the turnstiles during the final surge       I

         was in great fear for my safety and believed I might well be injured

         in the crush.    At several   points when I was   crushed against the outer

         wall    I found it hard to breath properly but could not move to help

         I have worked at Sheffield Wednesday Football ground many times,

         several of the matches being principally first division games.

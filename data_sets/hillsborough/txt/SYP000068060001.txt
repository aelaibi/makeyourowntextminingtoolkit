that    of       a Carnival.                    They    were       all       well        behaved          except          for    one

incident          when       a    group          of    2Q    tried        to       make       their       way    towards             the

Liverpool             end    of       the       ground       to    Leppings              Lane.           We    very       quickly             pointed

At    2.40       I heard          a    transmission                on     my       personal          radio       b y / PS       M b 1/        Thomas

ground.

During       the       briefing             myself          and    PC     Hurman             had    been       directed          to       stand

down    for       meal       at       2.45pm.           Inspector              Charles             was    told       of    this       and       at     2.

5Qpm    in       view       of    the       fact       that       all     was       quiet          and    the    coaches             had

arrived          he    instructed                us    to    return          to     the       stables,          we    were       not          aware

of    the    situation                at    Leppings          Lane.

crowd       of    Liverpool                supporters             making           their       way       down    Penistone                Rd

towards          Leppings             Lane.           They    were        rowdy          and       hurrying          presumably

because          of    a    shortage             of    time,       most        were          carrying          cans       of    beer.           At

3pm    I entered             Niagara             stables          complex          when        I heard          tranmissions                   on

the    radio          which       told          me    that     the      situation              at    the       ground          was    seriaus.

I    immediately             made          my    way    to     the      Leppings              Lane       end    of    the       groun/t.             On

my    arrival          which          I would          estimate           to       be    at    about          3.15pm       I jointed            PS

1764    Thomas.              The       only          fans    about        were          stood       on    the    kerb          side       opposite

the    entrance             to    the       ground          and    it     was       only       2    or    3    mins       later       that          the

first       ambulance             arrived.              Myself          PS     Thomas          and       other       Liverpool                mounted

officers          then       left          that       position          to     a    side       street.

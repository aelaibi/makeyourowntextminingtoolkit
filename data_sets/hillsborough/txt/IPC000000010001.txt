                                 1ENT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE, MR RICHARD WELLS
                              AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST




    If    there seems to be any sense of relief in South Yorkshire Police                                          today it
    should not be mistaken for celebration.                 I have the profoundest sense of sorrow
    for    the   95   deaths    that    occurred,   any sense            of      relief          that we    do     feel    Is
    diminished by the desolation of the families who lost loved ones.                                       We have come
r   to    the end of another phase of the long,                    slow process of understanding and
    healing.


    The inquest has been a protracted and detailed enquiry in front of 11 ordinary
    men   and women.      The evidence has allowed the jury to come to the conclusion
    that the various factors of the event amounted to an accident.                                     We take no joy
    in that at all, because it does not bring back the 95 who died.


    Perhaps      there   is    now     an   opportunity     to      rebuild            and       out   of    the    mutual
    recriminations of all the parties involved to find a new measure of understanding
    and an ability to forgive.


    The question of disciplinary proceedings is s£ill open and is a matter for the
V   Police Complaints Authority to decide.                  The       files will be prepared and will
    incorporate the details of today's jury verdict for them to consider.                                           I hope
    the Police Complaints Authority decision will be reached within the week.

          had      tickets        for       the    West       Stand,




We    left W a l l a s e y       a^r a b o u t     10.30am             (1030)       on    the     morning      of S a t u r d a y

delayed        in l>eavy t r a f f i c            on the       way          but    as    I w a s n ’t d r i v i n g      I can't

remember\j«here             the       delays       were.




We a r r i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d at a b o u t             midday and             parked        our   car       about       one

mile     from      the     ground       in a s id e           street,             the    police        directed         us    to    our

parking        area.




We    had a walk           around       looking          for       a    pub w h i c h       was    open,      we    found a             pub

at a b o u t    1.15pm        (1315)         and       the    three          of    us    had about        3   pin t s        and

something          to     eat.




We    left     the      pub at a b o u t          2pm     <1400)            and    had a slow walk             down          to    the

ground,        stopping          at    a bookmakers                on       the    way.




I never        saw any       signs          of    disorder             or    fighting        on the w a y          to    the       ground

although        I did       see a f e w f o o t b a l l                supporters           who    appeared         to       be d r u n k

We    d i d n ’t get       any    directions             or    escort             from    the P o l i c e     as    we w a l k e d        to

I couldn't             move,        1 was       being           c i^oshed to a n             extent       that    I was        having

When    I got          to    position           one        (1)    the       game      had     kicked       off,       just     before

After      being        in      position        one       (1)       for a     time,      I c a n't       say       how       long       other

than      the    g ame       was    s t ill     in       play,       there was          a man who         was       about          three

or    four      people          to m y    left a n d a b o u t             six    people      in f r o n t         of me

shouting         " t h e r e ’s a f e l l a w h o              c a n ’t b r e a t h e    here",      a    short          time          later

was      shouting         because         there       were          so m a n y    people      around          me    its          hard     to

I remained             roughly          in the       same       position          although         there       was       a       lot    of

movement         in the           crowd,       I could          j ust      see    a glimpses         of       the     game         in     play

and whilst             the      game     was    s t ill        in    p lay    I could        see    people          climbing              up

over      the    front          perimeter           fence       also       people       getting      out       of     the         pen

through         the     gate       in the       perimeter              fence.



I can      remember             seeing        the    players          walking        off     the    pitch,          at       that       time

I was      still,         roughly         in    position             one     (1),    although        by       t his      t ime         the

crushing         sensation              had    decreased and                 I was      now able         to    stand             on m y      own

We    carried                      o ver      to w h e r e       the    Ambulance           was      and    sat          him    down    by

the    fence       alongside              the    riv e r          As    we    sat     him       d own                    itarted to

regain       concicusness.




A young       man aged about                    25    to 30 y e a r s         who     was       wearing         glasses          came    up

to    us,    he    said       he was          a Doctor,           he was          dressed        in s m a r t        casual

clothing,          he      examined                        and    said       he w o u l d       be a l r i g h t ,        this    man

then went          off       to a s s i s t      others




In the a r e a          where        we    had       sat                down       there        were     other           injured and

what    appeared             to    be     dead       fans




The    only       person who              I could          describe          who     1 saw       in this         area          outside

gate    C are         as     follows.

I saw       the    body          of a y o u n g       man who          was     obviously            dead       he wa s         l y ing        by

the    wall       at       the     end    of    the    terrace            turnstLses and                 close      to     gate      C.            I

would       describe             this     young       m a n as     a      whiLe       male aged about                SO        to 2 5

years,       I c a n ’t s a y            how    tall    he was            hot      he w a s of m e d i u m          to     heavy          build

and    he    had a          fait of a b eer            belly/             I think          he had      blonde        hair.            I

can't       say w h a t          style     it was       o r/ h o w      long.         I think            he was       clean          shaven,

He    was    only          partially           dressed       he      was       naked       except         for a     pair        of

boxer       shorts          and a        pair    of    socks         I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r           the c o l o u r       of the

shorts       or    socks.




The    only       other          body     I saw outside                which. I can d e s c r i b e ,                was       lying          by

the A m b u l a n c e        w h i c h was       parked       outside              Gate               the      body was           lying

towards       the          b ack    of    the    Ambulance             between        ttare A m b u l a n c e        and       the    river

fence,       the       body was           that    of a w h i t e          male       mqed       about         60 years,          he       had

no    teeth       in,       he     had    lost    I presume             his / a l s e          teeth,         he    had    dark       hair

greying       at       the       sides     he was       bald       on     y b p , he w a s          wearing          an    ordinary

button-up          t ype         shirt     and    trousers             t/it    I can't           remember           what       colour

t h e y were.              There     was       a younger          rs^an w i t h      the       b o d y who         said    the       body
                                                          fU 1 6 3 ) - .
was    his    fat h e r .           The    younger              was white                 m     his      early       thirties             I

think       he was          wearing        glasses,/he             was        wearing          jeans      and a woolen                crew

necked       jumper.




There       were       a    lot m o r e        people     about         who        were       being      treated          by

ambulancemen                and     the    Doctor        I have         mentioned              be f o r e ,    I saw P o l i c e m a n

in the       area          but     they    didn't       seem         to       be   doing        much.




I can't       really             describe        any    of    the       other        bodies         or    injured           people            I

saw    in the          area        outside       Gate     "O'.

During       my    time       inside       the    ground         I had     not      seen any          kind       of    fights          or

disturbances             I had       not    seen      anyone        consuming            alcohol       in    the       gro u n d .




I was       not a w a r e      that       a barrier       had       broken         in    pen    number       three.




I was       not    injured myself.




I remained with                            and             in the         s am e    position          by    the R i v e r          fence

unt i l    about        4.QGpm       (1600)




I did       not a s s i s t     any       other    injured          people.             I did    not w i t n e s s          any

deaths       or a s s i s t     any       dead    people.




After       ensuring                      was    alright        1 went       b ack      to     the    car at          about        4pm

( 1600)      and    eventuality                          and                                   came    back       to       the     car,

The    only       thing       I wish       to a d d    to y fn y    statement            is    that    I think             the

It    is    obvious       that       people       were     in      trouble         on    the    terrac/s          a

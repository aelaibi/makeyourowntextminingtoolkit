Dear Sirs

HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your letter of 30 October.

We did not ask for draft reports, correspondence etc. to be
provided, but all reports and data, i.e. samples and results
of tests obtained for use in the civil proceedings.

Since, as you say, there can be no objection to providing a
copy of the expert's report for disclosure in the civil trial,
we look forward to having your confirmation that condition 3
of our earlier letter is acceptable as so understood.

Yours faithfully




C J Cleugh
Head of Police Complaints Division

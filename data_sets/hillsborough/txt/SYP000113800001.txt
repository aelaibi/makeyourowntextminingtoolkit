                   An account                  of my      involvement            in the events          of Saturday,           15 April,         1989

                   took        up a l a b i l e           patrol      of B a r n s l e y    town      centre.         It was a quiet

                   afternoon with                    no    reports         of any      trouble

                   At about 3 . 05prn (1305)                         we    received a r ^ t ft) message                from Force Control

                   on channel                  2 V’HF .       The message was              "Operation Support            at

                   times.               It was       not      clear what          exac t l y    had    taken     place and       indeed      I

t urn s t i l e s    approximately           100 yards away.                  There were a . f e w Liverpool                        ,

s u pporters         in C e p p i n g s L a n e , probably only 200-300.                        T hey were            very

quiet and- a.ppareriV.dazed,                  some were           openly       crying and           distressed.                 I

was    still        unaware     of what       had happened.                 I returned my VHF                  radio       to

channel       25 and       began to hear            parts       of messages.            I h e a r d someone                say

"I have 3 bodies               w ith me and         I m ean b o d i e s 1’.          I, heard       someone          else       say

"We    need some         bolt    cutters.           I can see            people      dying    on the           other       side

of the      fence and          I can't       do a n y t h i n g       for   them."      These       may        not    be the

exact words           but are        very similar.              I began        to    realise what              had

happened.            I was a p p r o a c h e d     time and           time again/       by dist r a u g h t           fans

wno    kept asking           "How many dead".               Ail        I would say was              " I *m sorry           I

don't     know w h a t ’s happened,                I've    just        come    from the B a r n s l e y match".

P eople w o u l d       come    up    to me for          help     in finding          friends        and       relatives

and    I was        unable     to assist.

After     a few m i n u t e s        Insp,    Phen'i x (Dog Section)                  came    by and gave us a

brief     rundown of what              had happened.                  He s t r ongly a d v i s e d that              the Dog

H a n dlers     remain       in groups        of 4 for          safety and a sked us                 to assist             with

keeping       Leppings         Lane    clear       for    emergency           vehicles.

suddenly       became m u c h         thicker       in L e p p i n g s      Lane and things              began to get

ugly.       Instead        of shock and bewilderment,                         a large    p      r    o     t     h     e

crowd were           abusive     and very angry.                  This      part of the         crowd ware

pr e d o m i n a n t l y males       aged    18-25 years,              many smelled s t r o n g l y of

a l c oholic        drink.      There       were    of    course        other       people    of    both sexes and

all   ages      in varying           degrees       of shock,           anger,       grief and        confusion.,

There was           a. lot of    shouting          mai n l y at        the Police.           Men' I had never

killing      their         friends,          m any were         very abusive           but       it was    clear     that

The    f o l l o w i n g are         just a few examples' of a non stop stream of abuse

w hich    lasted a bout half an hour.

‘'Hell    done       lads youf’ve done a good job                          in there      killing          our    kids."

‘‘Why d o n ’t you          get your          dogs    out and kill some                  more you bastards. "

“What's       happened           in there         is fucking           disgusting,           you    ought       to be

fucking asjfamed. 11

“You're -af d i s g r a c e           to your      county."

"You." r a al 1 fucking                m u r der er s ."

“Vou'/e       just      shit."

“ Ipjfs is your            fault and nobody                else-::;."

In a d d i t i o n    1 was          kicked on the             shins,      jostled       by group of youths               and

srodded       in the        c h e s t , not       just     once      but    cont i n u o u s l y    over at       least

half an hour,,              I saw youths             kicking         shop doors and windows,                     fire

appliances           and    police         cars.      A doctor who                parked his        car near       to my

van was       v e r b a l l y ab u s e d      by a group            of youths        who ,said something                like

"Where       the     fuck i n g       hell    have you          been,,     it's     too fucking           late    now,

tney' re all ...dead” .                i   took    the doctor            to the a m b u l a n c e     reception.

The whole          s i t u a t i o n was      very very tense               but     o c c a s i o n a l l y a well

mean i n g    Liv e r p o o l        supporter       would        come     up to me and say               "Don't worry

lad,     it's      not your           fault,      they're         idiots,         ignore     them".

It became          clear     that a large             proportion            of the youths            giving       the most

abuse were           in the          IS-25 years age              bracket.,         In my service           I have       seen

a   large     number        of       people    in shock and at                least an equal              number who
                                 (                         '                                 -


were     drunk.        Man y         of the most a b u s i v e youths                were with o u t        any doubt

drunk.

After     about       half an hour most                  of the abuse             seemed         to subside.         There

was    still       a number           of L i v erpool          supp o r t e r s   in L e p pings      Lane,       a large

  distressed.               I was       very    concerned          for    some       of them and          I began to

  realise       the      full      horror       of what       they must          have      been through.

 •Inspector Ph e n i x             then i n s t r u c t e d me and PC Wa t s o n               to move         to the

 P S Jarvis           of WYMP Dog Section.                    To do       this       it was    n e c e s s a r y to travel

‘.along L e p p i n g s          Lane    to P e n i s t o n e Road,        up P a r k s i d e Road and back to                     ;

  journey,           p a r t i c u l a r l y along L e p p i n g s       Lane,       our   van was       sub j e c t e d to

  Liverpool           s upporters.             On arrival          at PG See d h o u s e *s' location we

  resumed our             duties        in traffic          control.           On a number          of occasions             I

  heard a tel e p h o n e              number       being    given       out    on the      radio S 7 0 S C 3 P I

  assumed       that        tins was          the    incident       room number,.             As    it happens          1 was

  right.        W hen       people       a p p r o a c h e d me,    if    I was       unable       to help       them

  then and there,                 I wrote       this     number        on their        hand    in biro and

  su g g e s t e d    they       try    ringing       it,    if they        couldn't        find their           friends/

  f amily after             a t h o r o u g h search.

  At about           6 „ 15 pm    ( 1815)      Inspector P h e n i x           i nstructed         us   to    patrol        the

  A61    to the Ml           i n t e r s e c t i o n and     the Ml       to Haig and to make                  ourselves

  from duty and              retur n e d home.

  This     is as true an account                      of the events             as    I am able         to    recall,         The

  times      given are a p p r o x i m a t e           but    I believe          to be very accurate.

  Likewise           some    of    the    comments made, to me and                     parts       of the      radio

  m e s sages are           recalled          to the    best       of my ability.,

  These      notes are            dated       190489.        On Sunday,          16 April          (160489)          I went       to

  the Lake D i s t r i c t             camping      for a few days.                  I returned         to work        for

  nights      on      19th       (190489)       and made       these       notes.

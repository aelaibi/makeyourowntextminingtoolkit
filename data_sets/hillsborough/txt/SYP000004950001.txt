      No    uniformed           f oo t     Police        personnel          appeared             to    be       deployed       within         this

      allowed        into       this       inner       area,       all    the     time       being          pushed       from     behind           by

      the    massing          crowds,           again       possibly        numbering             2,000.

      Once     within         the     inner        area       and yet       to    reach          the       turnstiles          the

      safety,        however,            was     unable        to m o v e    backwards                to    leave       the    area      with

      the    pressing           numbers         arriving           from Le pp in gs              L ane.

      The    mounted          Police         officers          appeared          to    h av e     no       c o n t r o 1 o ver    the

      turnstiles,             again        no    uniform          foot    personnel              visible.

      Within       three        or    four      minutes,           I managed           to    reach          the    turnstiles            and

      entered        the      Hillsborough              Ground        a r ea ,    behind          the       turnstiles,           where        I

vVT   stopped        to    recover           from      the     crush and          to a w a i t         my       brother,       when      I saw

      a uniform Police                   Inspector            standing       a matter             of       feet    behind        the

      turnstile           I had       entered          through.

      I approached              t h is     officer          and    introduced           myself             as    a Police        officer

      and    produced my Warrant                       C ar d .     I informed              t h is     Police          Inspector,         who       I

      do    not    know,        that       beyond       the       turnstiles           there          p r e s e n t l y was,      in m y

      opinion,          a serious            risk      to     l i f e , to w h i c h        he    replied,             "I'LL     TRY     AND

      SORT     IT."

      At    this     t i me     the      only      entry       into      this     area       was       via       the    three     or     four

      turnstiles           and       the     large       perimeter          concertina                gate,       a matter        of     feet

      around       the     corner          of    the     turnstile          was       closed.

      My    brother        approached              through         the    same        turnstiles                I had    entered

            (1450),           I came        out       of     the       urinals        and      as    I walked            towards         the     tunnel

            entrance,             could         see     that       a    la rge      number          of    supporters            were       entering

            These        supporters              were        entering           in a w a l k i n g          manner,           not    running          at

            at    the       t un n e l     entrance,              they were           not      restrained               by P o l i c e     officers             at

            behind          the      goal       mouth,        where        the      terracing             already           appeared          congested

            and      people          were       pushing           down     the      terracing             to      leave       the    confines          of

            towards          their         own    supporters.

            The      Liverpool             Supporters              m a s s e d at       this        end     became          excited        and       there

            was      further          pushing           from       behind        with        roost       persons         close       to m y      position

            being        squashed.               Together              with my        brother            I attempted            to m o v e       over       to

            the      r i g ht     wing      of    terracing              as     I faced           the     pitch,         but    was      unable        to       do

            so,      due     to a w a l l         of       railings           so me     6 -8      feet      tall.

            I could          see      no-one,           Police          nor S t e w a r d s         directing            supporters             to    the

            of    the       game      at    1 5 00      hours,          I managed            to     find a gatewa y                 through          the

            railings            to    the       less       c r o w d e d w i ng ,       this        gatewway            being       at   the     top       of

    ■       My    observations                  within        the       terracing            were        t ha t     supporters           at     the

            f ro n t ,      behind         the    goalmouth,               were       obviously             trapped           and    being       crushed

            by the          volume         of    people           entering          the      pen,        via      the    tunnel,           behind          the

            goalmouth,               however,           their          requests         and       those        of    several         uniform          Police

officers          standing           pitch       s ide       of    the    pitch       perimeter             fence        to    back-off

were       impossible           to     carry       out       and    were       only       successful              once    uniform

Police       officers           e n t e r ed     the     terracing             via    the     t u n n e l,        in e f f e c t     behind

the    supporters            and managed                to m o v e       them    back.

During       t hi s     ti me    I had          felt     badly       crushed          myself          as    together           w i t h my

brother          left     the    Hillsborough                 Ground       to    return          home       at     1600       hours

(1600).

I saw       no    evidence           of     public       disorder          at all          t h at     afternoon           to

associate          with      the       problems          behind          the    goalmouth.

I    can    only      describe            the     Police          Inspector          I spoke          to     regarding           the

serious          crushing        outside           the       turnstiles          as       being       approximately                 5'10

tall,      white        with     black          hair,        possibly          a be ar d,        aged       approximately               40

years.

When       I saw      there      was       a very        serious          risk       to    life outside               the

turnstiles,             I say        t h is     due     to    the    f a ct     I could          see       adults        and    children

alike,       f a i n t i ng a n d         obviously           distressed             at    the      crush         from Le ppings

La n e,    all     unable        to       do a n y t h i n g       about       their       predicaments,                 the    only

escape       route       being        up a       12 f o o t        fence       and wall          at    the        side    of    the

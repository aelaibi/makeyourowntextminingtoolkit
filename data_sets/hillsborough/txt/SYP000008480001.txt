The    circumstances                of this was           road accidents,                   pit a c c i d e n t s an d     I

I a r r i v e d at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F o o t b a l 1 G r o u n d at a bout 2 pm

(1400)        on S a t u r d a y     15th April           1989       (150489)          in a St John's              ambulance

w h i c h was       parked at         the      rear     of    the N o r t h Ston'd a d j a c e n t               toythe First
                                                                            NT                        AJ            LI

                         I remember           we went along Penis tone Rd N o r t h from the

direction          of N eo p e n d s       Bridge.           I c o mmented           to the other            people       in the

ambulance           that     every      pub we seemed s                h    a    v     e              been        full    with

two    to three          hundred        people        spi 11 ingo^fxs ide                  drinki ng .       I    could not

say whether            they were           Liverpool          or /Nottingham Forr e s t                    fans and,

although          they all          appeared        to be drinking,                  I saw no d r u n k e n e s s         or

disorder.            Apart       from      this     I w ould say            1 saw          nothing more           out of       the

ordinary          except      for     being a Cu p s emi-final                       day     the volume           of fans was

far    greater.

Our a m b u l a n c e      was      to be     the     principal            ambulance          for    casualty

dis p e r s a l    with a spare a m b u l a n c e               to the          rear       of the S o u t h Stand.

Having        parked the a m b u l a n c e            I went         straight          to the First Aid Room

w here       I signed        in the        book.

        certain                 that       each me m b e r w o u l d have                           had all      that       equipment         but that
would      be a s t a n d a r d     issue.

I am     not       the keenest          football         s u pporter an d           tend to spend the

majority           of my time       checking           on the      crowd and          each    corner       that

members        are    situated          in.

I remember           that,    upon        taking        our    ground        positions,       I was     surprised          to

see    that,        although       the S p i o n Kop an d S o u t h S tand were                     full     w ith what

I. took      to be N o t t i n g h a m F o r r e s t          fans,     the    sections a l l o c a t e d      to

L iv e r p o o l    fans,    na m e l y     the N o r t h S t a n d a n d West Stand,                 were

noticeably           emptier       with       plenty      of    room.         This    I f ound most          unusual

for    such a big game.                   I would        say from a b o u t 2 .45            pm    (1445)     the

^Liverpool          side    started         to    fill    up steadily.

It was       at a bout       this       time      or s h o r t l y a fter       that     I wa l k e d a l o n g     the

t rack     parallel         to the S p i o n Kop and met Peter                        W E L L S who    told me       the

game was           going    to be d e l a y e d due            to the        fact    there were        crowds       of

Li v e r p o o l    fans    still       outside.          I left P e t e r and           r e t urned    to my       corner

w here     I informed my team of the                          fact.         I then w a l k e d down the            length

of the N or t h S t a n d a n d             told

As    I r e t u r n e d to my           corner      I noticed           that the players           were      coming       out

I remember           thinking           when     the     players        came out that         it was       unusual        in

view of what Peter                 had just            told me.

The    game        kic k e d off    bang         on 3 pm        (1500)       by the    g r o u n d ’s digital

clock.         I did notice             that a l t h o u g h     the        central    pens       in the West        Stand

t e r r a c i n g were      fill i n g      there was          quite        clearly still          room on the wing

As    I have        said,    I am not            the    keenest       football        fan but       I remember           the

Liverpool           side was       playing         towards        the goal          at the Kop end.            About

three m i n u t e s        into    the game,           one     of the Liv e r p o o l        fans must        have hit

a shot w h i c h        struck          the    crossbar.          A / g r e ^ T cheer went up an d             I

looked down towards                     the L i v e r p o o l    9^ 0   .     I saw some      fans were        climbing

pushing        them back          in.       I remainber         in last year's            semi-final,          fans       had

tried       to    invade       the    pitch s i m i l a r l y and one             or two     had been         injured

in    30    doing.        I commented             to the     rest    in my        corner     to the         effect          of

'here       they go a g a i n ’ .           I walked        down the N o r t h S t a n d side and,                    on

r e a ching       the    corner,          I met a man who           had o b v i o u s l y    hurt        his ankle.               1

realised          this ma n w o u l d           need    to be removed         from the         ground.            1

r e t u r n e d to the         corner       I had       been      in and     instructed                                     to

fetch a wheelchair                   to take        the man out,

I called          to the other             people       in my corner and we all returned                      to the

W e s t S t a n d end.

As we a r r i v e d       back at          the    end     1 noticed       now that        the    police were

assisting          fans       in c l i mbing        over    the    p e rimeter      fence.         There were a

lot    of     people      on the          track a rea also          by this        time,      it had become

chaos,        people were            clea r l y     injured.        I s ur v e y e d     the s i t u a t i o n and saw

the    prob l e m to be           in the are a of            pen 3.         The    game was        still      being

played at          this       time    beca u s e       I remember        the Liv e r p o o l     g oalkeeper

t ell i n g      a fan    to get          off    the    pitch.      I c o n c e n t r a t e d my a t t e n t i o n s         to

T h e r e must         have    been some          room at the        front        for    the fans         to have           been

p ulling         the    fence.        A police          officer     turned        to me and said,             ’It       looks

as    though we have             got a f a t a l i t y . ’         I looked        closer       into the          fencing

and    saw       that    there were             people,     in my opinion,              dead bodies,          on the

floor       near       the fencing          and     the    fans    ripping        out    the fencing were

Realising          the    situation             that was     unhiding,            I wa l k e d onto         the       pitch

                 that,     as        I passed this message,                Peter       W E L L S ’ team was a l r e a d y      coming

                 down.

                 I turned a r o u n d and             saw       that    casualties        were    now being          brought       out

                 from     the        pen 3 are a and            laid onto       the    pitch.         F r o m this    point    on I

                 I would         say the area was                chaos,    there were           bodies,        fans and    emergency

                 se r v i c e    personnel          all    over.        I could not d e s c r i b e          s p ecifics wi t h i n

over my face and head.                            I remember a strong                    smell       of alcohol

accompanying                  this.       It was         like    turning a h o s e p i p e            on full    force.              I

exc e l l e n t         job althswagh was                clearly upset             herself.          Again,     I could not

des c r i be           the    fan at all          but I m e r e     was      no    response          to our actions.

I remember               being          impres sjdT by the             numbe r of          people      comi ng over         tome

an d        stating          they were        t r a i n e d first aiders                and    could they help.

I do not               know how        long we          carried this          on for          but a man       came    over and

stated            he was a doctor.                  I    could not d e s c r i b e            him.     He said the

c a s u a l t y was           dead so        I got       up and m o v e d         on to another, a g a i n            in    the

same            area.        I did not        see the        p o l i c e w o m a n again.

The         third       c a s ualty      I moved        on to      I remember            had no shirt, on.             His

body was               black and         blue,      as was       his    face.           Again,       I found    no    life

signs            so star t e d CPR,           this       time    on my own.              Again,       prior    to the

se c o n d        inflation,           the     casua l t y      empt i e d    his       stom a c h    contents all          over

me and,               again,       it was     obvious        he had       consu m e d alcohol.

I cannot               remember        how     long      I carried on but                 I realised it was           too

late so m ov e d on to another,                            a g a i n nearby.             This    casualty a g a i n was

black/blue               and       brui s e d w i t h     s w e llings       cons i s t e n t wit h      crush

injuries.                 I can only          remember          that    the       casua l t y was wear i n g a cream

shirt w h i c h was                 open necked.             I also       n o t i c e d a bout        this    time    that       I

saw a            police       line acr o s s        the    pitch and see m               to    remember       seeing       the

digital               clock    showing         1620 hrs.           There were            people       carrying

c a sualties about                   as well.

Again,            with o u t       success,       I a t t e m p t e d CPR         for an unkn o w n          period    of

time.             This       fan also        e m p t i e d his s t o m a c h       contents          over me,    a ga i n    I

smelt alcohol.                      I did     not       receive any          signs       that    indicated       to me       the

c a s ualty may               be    revived       so,     again,       I eventually             left    this    casualty.

E3y now the               only      people      being      brought        out      the     pen a rea were        dead so             I
                                                                                                                          PAGE      8
                                                                                                                          S752

              went     amon g s t     the     fans and       injured,     nursing       and     reassuring        injured

               casual ties.

              The     one    comment        I w o u l d make    is that        it a p p e a r e d a lot of        people

              giving m a s s a g e       were    doing       it far     too    fast.      I would not           criticize

               them as       I am sure         they were       doing     the    best    they      could.

              As     the    pitch      cleared       I realised        there was       nothing more           I could do so

               I started          looking      for    items    of equ i p m e n t     that     had gone missing.              I

               looked brie f l y         inside       the    g y m n a s i u m and saw dead bodies all               over     the

               place w h i c h        brought    the scale        of    the    tragedy        home     to me.

               I would       have      left    the    gr o u n d at about 6 . 3 0        pm    (1 S 3 0 ).

               The    events,         people and timing           I have       d e s c r i b e d are    the   best    I can

               offer and are,            to the       best    of my     r e c o llections,        correct.

               I w ould      d e s cribe mys e l f      as a white male,              age d 59,        about 5 *S ,

               proportionate            build,       with medium        length      hair,      tidy,     b r u s h e d back hair.

               I was w e a r i n g      a St John's          uniform,     namely black            trousers,       white

               shirt,       black      tie,    black    tunic,     black       peak    cap and y e l l o w       over-vest.

               I would       be    prepared      to a t t e n d an enquiry.

It s e e m e d     only a few m i n u t e s a fter                 kick       off whe n        I looked          towards       the

L e p p i n g s Lane      end of the           gro u n d only         to      see crowds trying                  to    climb the

perimeter          fence      on to the             pitch.        I thought         it was a pitch                invasion and

I mentioned            this      to                            who was        in my       company at             the    time.

The ma n n e r      these        persons       were        climbing        over     the      perimeter           fence       it was

obvious         that    there w o u l d        be     people wit h          injuries          so    I w a l k e d down         on

my own to the L e p p i n g s               Lane      end of       the g r o u n d      to as s i s t and supervise.

I a r r i v e d at      the L e p p i n g s         Lane    end and as           I did so a Po l i c e Officer

standing         on the       perimeter             track    trying        to s u pervise           the    crowd        climbing

over     the     perimeter            fence,        pointed out          this m a n to me who was                      standing

an d    obviously         had an        injured ankle.                I went        up to him and a s s i s t e d him

by taking          him to a first aid team                        p o s i t i o n e d at the        corner where              the

North Stand meets                 the L e p p i n g s Lane           terracing.              Howe v e r    this        team

had     left     this     position          to as s i s t      other       injured        persons.

At     this     point     I reali s e d         that all          first aid staff w o u l d                be     required at

the L e p p i n g s     Lane      end     so    I summoned           them     by using my             personal          radio.

This     ma n    in my     comp a n y o b v i o u s l y        had a bone           injury         in his ankle and                 I

explained          to him that            it was my          intention           to get a s s i s t a n c e           so that he

could     be taken         to the         first aid          room for         treatment.             At    this        point he

refu s e d      to a t t e n d    the     first aid           room stat i n g          that     he w a n t e d        to watch

the m a t c h and at             this     time       he was       h appy      to sit      on the       trol l e y stretcher

at     that     l o c a t i o n to w a t c h        the match.

                        came      over      to me      in the        corner and           T. e x p l a i n e d    to him the

fact     that      this m a n was           refusing         to a t t e n d      the    first a i d        room.         1    then

explained          to this man            that we          r e q uired     the     trolley         s t r etcher        for

persons         far more         s e r i ou s l y    injured       than he was and upon doing                           so he

b ecame       irrate      but      rather      reluctantly            he    came       off    the    t r o l l e y and we

placed him a g a i n s t              the wall        at    the    front      of    the N o r t h Stand.                By this

time     the m a t c h     had s t o p p e d and            because        of this        he was more

                                                                                                                  S752A

             cooperative.             The    next and    last    time    I saw him was w h e n he was              being

             c arr i e d along        the    perimeter       track   in front      of   the N o r t h S t a n d   towards

             the      first ai d      room.     He was       being   carr i e d   in a ‘'carrying        chair"     by at

             least      one St J o h n s A m b u l a n c e    member.

             I ’m sorry but           I cannot    d e s cribe    this m a n neit h e r      can    I remember

             a n y t h i n g a bout    the    police    officer      that   pointed him out to m e .               I did

             not      see this ma n that was            injured      being a b u s e d at a n y     time.

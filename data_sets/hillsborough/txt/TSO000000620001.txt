THE POSITIONING OF DECEASED IN PENS 3-4


Our research to date (12 June 1989) indicates that of the 64 persons so far
identified as dead, 59 were in pen 3 and the remainder in pen 4. There are
no indications at this stage of any persons dying other than in those two
pens.

I trust this is of assistance to you. I have, if you wish, a breakdown of
the persons who died in the pens which can be related to the Pathologist
reports if so required.

             LOCATION OF DECEASED - PLAN AS AT 16 JUNE 1989

             I enclose the latest edition of the plan showing the position where, in
             our opinion, the deceased can be identified in some instances alive,
             others where they are dead, together with possibles which are as yet
             awaiting confirmation.  Enclosed also is an explanatory note.

             I must stress at this time, because there is considerably more work to
             be done, the plans should only be used as a guide and not to be
             considered the definitive statement.

             I enclose a total of 11 copies for your use and that of Counsel
             representing interested parties. The copies for Lord Justice Taylor,
             Secretary of the Inquiry and the Assessors have been forwarded direct to
             them.

                        HILLSBOROUGH JUDICIAL INQUIRY


                                 INTRODUCTION




The information shown on the attached plans has been compiled by the West
Midlands Police Video/Photographic Section of the Hillsborough Judicial

Inquiry for the purposes of assisting the w or k of the section.


The coloured and numbered stickers indicate, what are believed to be the
position of deceased either prior to or following their death as seen on
either video footage or photographs.



In some instances people have been seen in different locations ie pen or

pitch and as such may have more than one identifying sticker shown.



It should be noted that the stickers in the bottom right hand corner are

designed to show the flow of persons towards the Spion Kop end of the

pitch.    Having regard to the size of the maps they are presently

reproduced on, they should not be regarded as precise locations on the

pitch.


The plan showing stickers which are all the same colour is drawn up from
information contained in statements only and at this stage does not

differentiate as to whether dead or alive.      These are additional

identifications to the above.


It should be stressed,that the identifications are based on the opinion

of officers researching the material available to them as at the 16.6.89.

The plans produced as at the 6.6.89 should now be disregarded.



The plans should be treated as a GUIDE to movements of persons at this
stage and NOT a completed document.

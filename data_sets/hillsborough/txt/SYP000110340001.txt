                                                                            C. CALVERT

                     Q. When the 1985 proposals were being considered and going
                        through there was a suggestion at one stage from the
                        Police that there should be a second gate in the radial
                        fences. - A. I have seen that on the papers.

                     Q. Was that something that you initiated, that suggestion?
                        - A. I have looked at it and I will be quite honest, I
                        cannot remember initiating it. I can remember it now
                 B      but it was not one of my main priorities.

                     Q. Can you remember what the specific purpose of the
                        suggestion was? - A. Not really, no.

                     Q. Go to page 265 and 6. Notes of an officer working party.
                        You were not present. - A. No.

                     Q. The natter I would just like your help with is on page
                        266, Letter I, a reference to the gates in the pitch
                        perimeter fence being for both security access and
                        emergency egress purposes. - A. Yes.

                     Q. Was that your understanding? - A. Yes. I heard the
                        comment about the gates and I have always considered
                 D      the gates were used for both purposes.

                     Q. Did you;'give :arty thought as to what'Emergency mrgfttr*"- ' vrc-
                         occur at that end of the ground? - A. One of the reasons
                         I have seen the gates used for is when there has been
                         fighting on. the terraces and I have also seen it used
                         when there has been a flare discharged, an emergency ships
                       / flare discharged on the terraces, which has caused
                         total chaos.

                     Q. And has that resulted in large numbers of people being
                        evacuated on to the pitch?- A. We have certainly brought
                        them out.  I would not say large numbers.

                     Q. Because we now know that on the day this disaster occurred
                        the gates were not large enough for people to come out
                        either quickly or in any numbers.   Is that not something
                        you have considered beforehand?- A. When we have had to
                        use then for any purpose in the past they have been
                        adequate for bringing the numbers out we wanted to bring
                        out.   We have brought them out to transfer them round
                        from one pen to the other when they have got themselves
                        into the wrong area of the ground and certainly it has
                        been a d e q u a t e .

                     Q.   Can you go, please, to page 292? These are the minutes
                          of an officer working group, 13th of November, 1985, at
                          which you were present. - A. Yes.

                     Q.   And it is items 5 and 6 that I would like to ask you
                          about.  Item 5, the Police reported on the continuing

           Drink        in excess was evident in a considerable number of supporters,

            both Liverpool and Notts Forest.                                                       This         included those in a drunken

            order not to deplete manpower.

                    At about 2.45 p.m.    it became apparent there was a fault on the radio.

                    Transmissions fro® control were becoming broken, although still

                    audible.   I informed control of    this.

                    I   was on the Spion Kop at 3 p.m. with the serials I had detailed to

                    supervise the.area containing the Liverpool supporters.         An apparent

                    pitch invasion shortly after kick off created a situation which

                    incensed the Notts Forest fans and the actions of some of them

                    "towards the Liverpool group of supporters suggested there would be a

                    public disorder situation on the Kop.       I therefore remained at this

                    location with my serials until      the ground cleared.   I tooK no part in

                    the events on the Leppings Lane terrace.

                    Prior to early 1988,    I was responsible   for several years   (9) for

                    Police liaison in connection with Policing at Hi 1lsborough.            In

                    connection with this I made various suggestions in regards to the

                    ground,    in particular,   in respect of the Leppinqs Lane end of the

         1987 SEMI FINAL - L E E D S U T D .   V. COVENTRY

         Leeds on Leppings Lane Terraces - played on               Sunday wi uh lunchtime

         kick off.     I was on duty outside the ground            before    kick off.          Despite

         time numerous drunks arrived.           In planning this match we h a d » because

         of Leeds Utd reputation,          gone to great pains to:

          1.         prevent fans arriving without tickets.

         2,          taken steps to contain those Leeds fans who arrived without

                      tickets.

          In the event there were no problems at Leppings Lane — that end of

          ground filled to capacity.           The only problem was Coventry fans

          arriving   late because of traffic on Ml - kick oft               Lime delayed.

         To the best of my knowledge there was no pitch invasion.

          There was., however, a pitch invasion in 1981 Semi ? i n a i . Spurs v .

          Wolves.    This was caused!

          -j.         by the Spurs fans purchasing Wolves tickets to the Hop

points    in all the iriformal and formal discussions I have held with

Stewards and the club since that time.

The situation improved with the appointment of Mr Lock as security

officer       (in 1985 I think) who on match days acted as the club's                            'link'

man for their stewards and the subsequent adoption of a personal

radio system to maintain contact with their chief stewards in various

areas of the ground.

Over the period I was                liaison officer   I had frequent and various

contact with club officials - the secretaries usually, when I pointed

out problems with stewards - this included the clubs                        responsibilities

for spectators on the terraces as well as in the stands.                                I am aware

tnis     theme was frequently repeated oy senior officers both to the

secretaries and the c l u b ’s security officer on several

occasions.          I gained the         impression that the club believed that

ae c a u s e, out of necessity,            the police occasionally performed

the function of crowd packing,                 they had no need to show interest

or responsibility for the s tandi n§ c r o w a s.

suggestions which were                 incorporated in new instructions for

and explained by club staff.

held with Stewards and the club since that time.

The situation improved with the appointment of Hr. Lock as security

officer      (in 1985 I think) who on ma t c h days acted as the club s

'link' man for their stewards and the subsequent adoption of a

personal radio system to maintain contact with their chief stewards

in various areas of the ground.

Over t n e     period      I was          liaison   officer                            1 had frequent          and       various

this    theme     was      frequently            repeated                  by          senior officers.              I   also       mace,

 obtained a copy of the club instructions to stewards which was

 completely .inadequate - giving only information on conditions o-r

 service and an            o u t d a t e d   evacuation procedure.                                     I   made   certain

 suggestions which              w e r e      incorporated in new instructions for

 stewards.         These        instructions were                              circulated at every annual meeting

 and   explained          by    club      staff.

 In 1984 I (and other officers)                                realised that after Sheffield

Wednesday Football C l u b ’s return to Division 1 problems were evident

at Leppings Lane turnstiles due to increase                                                       in away fans.                          I

suggested with a rough sketch that tne whole of Leppings Lane

turnstiles - then a crescent shape - should be demolished with new

ones built parallel to and near rear of stand with access to

individual                pens and to the stands.                                  This was discussed with then

senior officers - Chief Superintendent Moseley and Superintendent

Lock - agreed should be put to club.                                                   Then secretary Mr. Chester                                      came

forward with compromise as turnstiles are laid out now — new

turnstiles A/G built                                in the lignt of climate then prevailing on

spending at football grounds accented on basis tnat anything                                                                                 is

better than nothing.                               The intention was twofold (1) on tne u(«ci.ic8

then operating to allow different sets of supporters into different

pens and (£) to give greater space at the turnstiles.

I was greatly involved in the planning, and on the day, execution of

policing for the '1987 Semi Final - Leeds Utd. v. Coventry.

Leeds were allocated the Leppings Lane Terraces.                                                                 This game .was

played on Sunday with lunchtime Kick off.                                                        I was on duty outside-

In the event there were no problems at Lappings Lane — tnau enu -ot

arriving             late because of traffic an Mi.                                           The kick oft time was

delayed.                  To the best of my knowledge there was no pitch invasion.

There was,                 however, a pitch invasion in 1981 Semi t inal Spurs v.

Wolves. This was caused -

           1. ' by the Spurs- fans purchasing Wolves tickets to -the 'Hop--'terraces

       2.       late arrival of Spurs fans who rushed onto terrace shortly after

                kick off causing surge.

           Me took this into account this year a nd last toy ensuring that fans

       who had tickets for the Kop who were not Notts. Forest fans were not

           transferred to other -ends' of ground so capacity would be exceeded ~

           they were held on segregated area of Kop.

           It should be noted that in 1980 Semi Final Arsenal v, Liverpool that

           capacity was exceeded on Leppings Lane terraces fay at least 1000 due

           to forged tickets - no problems experienced.                  (This terrace was at

           that game occupied by Liverpool supporters).

           responsible for two serials on the S p i o n          l<Gp.     Following briefing and

           refreshments    I took-'./fcoith"serials-’onto '""the" Spibn M p     terraces at about

           11   am <1100) and briefed them.         I also briefed the stewards allocated

           to the Spion Kop at about        11.30am    (1130).     The turnstiles opened at

           about   this time.     It had been anticipated that Liverpool              supporters

           would enter the Spion Kao with tickets allocated to                  the -N o t t s . Forest

           fans.    To contain them an area adjacent to the North Stand had been

           set aside for them.        This assumption proved correct and by 3pm                (1500)

           about 500 Liverpool      supporters were      in the area under close Police

           supervision.     The majority were not,        from their accents,         from

           Merseyside.     Those from Merseyside numbered 2 0 0 + , some said they had

           obtained tickets from friends in Nottingham,                  others said from touts

           both in Liverpool and around the ground.

           Drink in excess was evident in a considerable number of supporters,

           both Liverpool and Notts. Forest.            This included those         in a drunken

           condition and in possession of drink.             The extent was such that I

        gave instructions that only those              in an extreme state would be

        arrested in order not to deplete ma n p o w e r «

        At about 2 .45pm (1445)           it became apparent there was a fault on the

        radio.     Transmissions from control were becoming broken, although

        still a u d i b l e .     I informed control of. this.       The radio fault can best

        be described as a warblipg/clicking - missing out one word in three.

        I was on the Spion Kop at 3pm              (1500) with the serials              I had detailed

        to supervise the area containing the Liverpool supporters.                               An

        apparent     pitch invasion shortly after kick off created a situation

        which incensed the Notts. Forest fans and the actions of some or                                 tueui

        towards the Liverpool            group of supporters suggested there would be a

         public disorder situation on tne Hop.                I therefore         remained at this

         location with my serials until the ground cleared.                       I took no part in

         the events on the Leppings Lane terrace.

         My briefing to stewards was for those on Kop only - also Sergeants

         present and identified.

         I askea if worked Hop before — yes.

         Tney were told to           sseD aisles ciear as possible.

           On 7 August       1985 (070885)          I attendee a meeting at Hillsborough

           Football Ground of the Officers Working Party in relation to Safety

           in Sports Grounds.

           At this meeting various matters were discussed including the new

           secondary radial fence 2m from tne existing                        radial        fence,   dividing

           the North from the Central                 pens.

           At this liios it was agreed 'that i n s                   cate at tne perxme ter fencs

           At this time there was no common key and                        the practice employed was

           for gates       in radial fences when closed,                 to be bolted but not locked.

           The introduction of a common key was to facilitate ease of access for

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                         Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                 Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
to you on 9 April.
                 In the interim period several of the points which you
raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                                          However I
would ask that further consideration should be given to the
request in paragraph (c) of your letter for a second gate to
be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.                                                                          If these
gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                                                        a
steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
would hardly be justified.                                              It is our view that in the event of
emergency spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
gates on to'the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
We will of course be prepared to discus4 the matter with the
Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                            Yours sincerely,
                                    An Unlimited C M i f                 J^HListered in   England - N a 1833144

             i
                                         D. Vaughan                 422


Dear Sirs,
      '••••*            ,*
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

In reply to your letter of 8th May, the extra gates referred to in paragraph •
(c) of ray earlier letter of 2nd May were Included primarily at the request
of the South Yorkshire Police.
                                 *


Provided that the remainder of the points raised by the Officer Working Party
are incoprorated in the latest proposals (yet to be considered by the Club),
the Police are prepared to concede the request for two gates per radical fence
in the right feand area of the tappings Lane End Terrace (indicated as hone
supporters' terrace on the plan).


                                        Yours faithfully,




                                        Chief Executive.

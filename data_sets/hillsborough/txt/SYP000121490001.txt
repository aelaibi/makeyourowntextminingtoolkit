            was     continually               occupied with                problems         at    turnstiles               numbers         9 an d

            10.        There        were      a fe w       people        trying       to    get      in w i t h o u t         tickets          and a

            lot     of    p eo p l e      with      the w r o n g        tickets.           (Some       were         Notts.        Forest        fans)

            It wa s       impossible               to    send      them      back     because          of    the      crowd        behind

people          outside        for     being       unable         to    get      into     the       correct       queue.

The    Inspector              who     had    been       up on        the     roof    came       to me       and       a s k e d me       to

try a n d        get    people         through          the    turnstiles            as     quickly         as    possible.               I

tried       to    do    this        but     one    of    the      turnstile          operators             refused          to

operate          his    turnstile            for    people           who     did    not     have      the     correct            tic k e t ,

which       meant       that        they     had    to    climb         over       and    t h is     caused       some       delay.

At    this       time    also         I noticed          t ha t      the     air    coming          through       the

turnstiles             smelled         strongly          of    alcohol,.            The     best w a y        I ca n        describe

it    is    'passing           a    public        house       doorway*.             I did       not    see       evidence           of

the    fans       drinking            but    it was       obvious            that    quite          a few     had.

Whilst          working        at     the    turnstiles              I did       notice        that    the       l a r ge    gates        to

my    left       were     opened and              then     closed           again,       but    I d id      not       think        it

unusual          at    th e    time        because       they        had     been    opened          several          times       during

the    d ay      to    allow        officers        with       prisoners            through          from     the      outside.

When       the    turnstiles               were    eventually               closed       I was       immediately             called

to    give       assistance            in    the     tunnel          a r ea .      1 w as      told    to m o v e        people          out

of    the       ground        because        people       had        been       crushed        outside.           It     proved

impossible             to m o v e      the    c r o w d who          became        very abusive.                 I made          my w a y

into       the    "pen*        and     gave       assistance            to      several        people       who       were       on the

verge       of    c o 1 1apse         or    had    injur ies           to a r m s    and       chest»         1 he 1 ped           them

back       to    the    front         of    the    “pen'' w h e r e          I helped          to    lift     the      unconscious

people          through        t he    holes       that       ha d     been      made     in the       perimeter             fence,,

Some       of    these        p e o p 1e were        obviousIy              a 1 ready     dead.

position          on    the        inside     of a hole              in the        fence       in o r d e r      to     prevent          the

crowd       from       climbing            through       o nto       the     field       where       the    injured          were

being       treated.               I allowed         people          through        who     said      they       could       see

friends          or    relatives            on the       pitch         and      quite     a number          who       said       they

were       trained        in F i r s t       Aid and also               a    doctor.

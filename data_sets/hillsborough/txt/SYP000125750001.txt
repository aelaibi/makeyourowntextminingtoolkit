«   WHO WITH    »
I WENT WITH MY FATHER MR                        I THINK HE'S A DENTIST TO THE
CLUB AND HE'S ALREADY GIVEN A WRITTEN STATEMENT TO THE CLUB AND ASKED FOR IT
TO BE PASSED TO THE ENQUIRY. I ALSO WENT WITH A FRIEND
                LIVERPOOL

I'M TALL 6'4", AND WENT STRAIGHT IN BEHIND THE GOAL,   BUT ABOUT THREE QUARTERS
OF THE WAY BACK. I CAN BE PINPOINTED IN SOME OF THE    PRESS PHOTOGRAPHS IF
THAT'S ANY HELP. I MUST SAY THAT WHEN IT ALL ENDED,    I SAW ABOUT 15 BODIES AT
THE LAST CRUSH BARRIER FROM THE BACK OF THE TERRACE,   SO IT WASN'T ONLY PEOPLE
AT THE FRONT WHO DIED.

B^ABOUT 2.15 IT WAS LIKE A NORMAL KICK-OFF FOR SPACE, BUT BY 2.40 I WAS
COTSHED, AND FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO BREATHE AND COULD FEEL ELBOWS IN MY
RIBS. IT WAS ALL GOOD HUMOURED STILL, THOUGH. AT ABOUT 2.50 PEOPLE NEARER
THE FRONT STARTED SCREAMING, IT WASN'T THE USUAL WINGEING BUT MORE OF A
PANIC. ABOUT 2 MINUTES LATER IT WAS STILL THE SAME, AND I SAW TWO POLICEMAN
DIRECTLY ABOVE US IN THE STAND LOOKING DOWN AT US, BUT THEY DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING. WE WERE SHOUTING UP AT THEM TO HELP, BUT I DON'T THINK THEY HEARD
US.
WHEN THE TEAMS CAME OUT THERE WAS AN ALMIGHTY SURGE OF PEOPLE, AND I GOT
THROWN DOWN AGAINST THE BARRIER, AND SOMEONE NEXT TO ME WAS GETTING CRUSHED
AGAINST ME. I DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE PEN UNTIL ABOUT 3.10 - THERE WERE STILL
PEOPLE COMING IN THROUGH THE BACK DOOR AND I WENT OUT THAT WAY, AND HELPED A
FATHER AND CHILD UP INTO THE STANDS. THEN, OUTSIDE, A GROUP OF FANS BROUGHT
OUT A FAN AND STARTED RESUSCITATING HIM, THERE WERE NO POLICE THERE OUT AT
THE BACK.   BY ABOUT 3.15 THERE WERE 15-20 BODIES BROUGHT OUT THE BACK, I
THINK ALL EXCEPT ONE WAS DEAD.
THERE WERE NO PA ANNOUNCEMENTS UNTIL AT 3.20 TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO DO, AND
BY THEN ALL THE DAMAGE WAS DONE ANYWAY. IF ONLY THEY HAD TOLD US, WE COULD
HAVE GONE TO THE WING SECTIONS - WE COULDN'T SEE THAT THEY WERE NEARLY EMPTY
FROM WHERE WE WERE STANDING.
IN MY OPINION I WOULD SAY THAT MOST PEOPLE DIED BETWEEN 2.50 AND 3.05 PM,
MAYBE EVEN EARLIER.

THERE SEEMED TO BE A PUSH THE POLICE WENT AND PUSHED THEM BACK OFF THE

THERE WAS A LOT OF MOVEMENT FORWARD AND THE SPECTATORS WERE SPILLING OUT ON
TO THE PITCH. WHEN IT BECAME OBVIOUSE HOW BAD THINGS WERE THE POLICE WERE
JUST STANDING AROUND DOING NOTHING, ITS POSSIBLE THEY DID NOT REALISE WHAT
WAS GOING ON, THE POLICE IN THE MIDDLE OF IT WERE MARVELOUS. AND WHILE THEY
WERE WORKING SOME OF THEIR COLLEGUES JUST STOOD WITH THEIR ARMS FOLDED, EVEN
WHEN THERE WERE BODIES AT THEIR FEET. THE FIRE BRIGADE WERE DOING A
WONDERFUL JOB. IT WAS JUST SOME OF THE POLICE WHO JUST STOOD THERE DOING
NOTHING TO EVEN HELP THEIR COLLEGUES LET ALONE THE FANS.

               ABLE TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE CROWD AND ABOUT TEN MINUTES LATER

INTO THE GROUND VIA THAT GATE. IT WASNT TOO BAD THROUGH THERE AND ONCE INSIDE
I WENT TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE TERRACES. THE SIDE WHERE I WAS , WAS
RELATIVELY UNCROWDED. A MAN IN HIS FORTIES CAME TO ME AND ASKED ME IF I
COULD HELP HIM OUT BECAUSE HE WAS FRIGHTENED. I AGREED AND DID SO. I STAYED
IN THE GROUND MYSELF BECAUSE MY NEPHEW WAS IN THE GROUND IN THE CENTRE OF THE
STAND SOMEWHERE. A LITTLE WHILE LATER I SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE
BARRIERS AND REALISED THERE WAS SOMETHING SERIOUSLY WRONG. I STAYED THERE
UNTIL ICONTACTED MY NEPHEW.

THIS TIME BUT IT WASNT TOO BAD. I FOUND MYSELF AT THE CENTRE OF THE TERRACE
TO THE LEFT OF THE GOAL BUT THE CROWD WAS CAUSING PEOPLE TO SWAY. THE CRUSH
GOT WORSE IN SECONDS AND IT WASNT LONG BEFORE YOU COULD ONLY MOVE YOUR HEAD.
I HEARD PEOPLE SHOUTING TO MOVE BACK BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED AND
THERE WERE SHOUTS THAT PEOPLE WERE DEAD. BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH THERE WAS
NOTHING I COULD DO. AS THE CROWD WERE BEING REMOVED TO THE FRONT OF THE
GROUND ONLY THEN THE PRESSURE EASED. I REMAINED THERE UNTIL I WAS ASKED TO
LEAVE.

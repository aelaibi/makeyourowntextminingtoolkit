 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED , AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS A LONG DELAY IN ANY ACTION BY THE EMERGENCY S E R V I C E S .

 I FEEL THAT THE POLICE REACTED INITIALLY AS IF THERE WAS A CROWD

 TOOK A LONG TIME FOR THE POLICE TO R E A L I S E . / THE POLICE DIDN'T

                  SEEM TO HAVE ANY ORGANISATION fiA^Y

 HAVE HELPED OR IF T H E Y ’D HAVE BEEN ON     THE TERRACES LIKE AT MANY

OTHER GROUNDS THE SITUATION W O U L D N ’T EVEN HA^E OCCURRED.


Q19
A

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THE OBVIOUS PROBLEMS STARTED WITH THE TICKET ALLOCATION,            IT SHOULD BE

OBVIOUS THAT WITH L I V E R P O O L ’S FOLLOWING T H E ' SHOULD HAVE HAD THE LARGER

ALLOCATION.    THE ENTRANCES AT LEPPINGS L           '^TOTALLY INADEQUATE FOR BIG

MATCHES AND ON THIS OCCASION THE TURNSTILES C*pULDN *T COPE WITH THE VOLUME

OF PEOPLE.    ALSO THERE WAS A DISTINC/T LACK Of/ Pj^tTlCE IN THE IMMEDIATE

AREA OF THE TURNSTILES RESULT!          tN A DISORGANISED CROWD ALL GOING FOR

T ^ SAME ENTRANCES.     ON THE TICKET IT SAYS TAKE UP YOUR POSITION 15

MINUTES BEFORE KICK     OFF,   THIS WAS MISGUIDED    AND RESULTED IN LOTS OF

PEOPLE TURNING UP LATE.        I FEEL THAT IF THE KICK OFF HAD BEEN DELAYED THERE

W O U L D N ’T HAVE BEEN THE RUSH OF PEOPLE.   I FEEL THAT THE DECISION TO OPEN THE

GATE WAS RIGHT, HOWEVER STEPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN TO CLOSE THE TUNNEL OFF

AND DIRECT SUPPORTERS AROUND THE SIDE.         THERE ARE NO SIGN:            CATE     ANY

OTHER ENTRANCES TO THE TERRACING.         I WENT. LAST SEASON 7               UGH BUT

DID NOT REALISE THAT THERE       WERE   OTHER ENTRANCES.     IF THE POLICES-.HAD

BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THE WROUGHT IRON GATES OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES SHUT

IT WOULD HAVE BEEN FINE, BUT DUE TO THE LACK OF / O L I C E PRESENCE THE

OFFICERS THERE COULDN'T CONTROL THE CROWD WHO               USHED THROUGH THE

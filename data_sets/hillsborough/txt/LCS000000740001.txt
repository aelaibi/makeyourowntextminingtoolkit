Dear

I hope that you do not mind us contacting you as someone who was involved in the
Hillsborough Disaster.

You may be aware that since the Disaster we have had a psychologist working with
us at the Centre. She and a colleague are presently setting up a project to look at
certain after-effects of being part of a tragedy such as Hillsborough, with a view to
identifying the best methods for helping people cope wi|h thee.

For reasons of confidentiality we would not be prepared.to disclose your name and
address to anyone outside of the Centre so are writing to you initially-to ask if you
would be willing to be contacted again by the psychologists themselves. They would
then explain their work more fully and you would not be committed to any further
involvement unless you chose to be.

Enclosed is a short questionnaire about some experiences which may still be affecting
you. If you are willing to complete this jt would helpful to receive it back in the pre­
paid envelope, even if you do not wish to be contacted further. Just leave blank the
name and address section at the bottom.

If you are willing to be contacted by the psychologists please fill in your name and
address in the space provided.

Yours sjncerely


Sarah Darcy
Team Leader

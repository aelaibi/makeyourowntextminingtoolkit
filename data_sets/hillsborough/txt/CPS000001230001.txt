Dear Mr Enzor

Adlington -v- Duckenfield and Murray

Further to your letter of 1 December and the helpful advice contained therein, I write to
confirm, although I anticipate you will probably already know, that the criminal
proceedings have been adjourned further to Monday 21 December 1998, and the
Defendants are remanded to appear on that date.

The prosecution has indicated a wish to apply for the issue of Witness Summonses for the
attention of Assistant Chief Constable Ian Daines, and Former Inspector Henry White in
regard to documents allegedly in their possession. It is intended that South Yorkshire
Police will be represented on the 21st to argue as to whether the Summons should be issued.

The magistrate has also fixed the committal to commence, on a 4 week estimate, for 19
April 1999. I look forward to hearing your further advice regarding the decision to take
over the criminal proceedings on or before 18 December as previously advised.

Yours sincerely




  imoh Eastwood

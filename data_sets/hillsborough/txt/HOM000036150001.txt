                      'We owe it to the families of those who died to get to the bottom of these matters once
              and for all.' The words of Home Secretary Jack Straw as he announced a new independent
              investigation into the events at Hillsborough in April 1989. The families of the 96 people who
              died have broadly welcomed the news which comes after a long campaign to unearth the full
              truth behind the tragedy. They had been hoping for a new public inquiry and a fresh inquest,
              that might still happen but it depends on this new investigation.

              that there should be an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
              evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously available.
              G.B.:
                     The new investigation led by Lord Justice Stuart Smith will consider new video
              evidence which challenges the police version of events, new medical evidence which claims to
              show that people were still alive after 3.15, the time at which the coroner decided all victims
              had died, whether a new public inquiry and a new coroner's inquest should be held, if criminal
              charges should be brought and whether there should be fresh disciplinary proceedings against
              senior police officers.

                     (Mother of Hillsborough Victim Richard) How do you live without your son but we
             have to learn to do that but fighting the authority has been very difficult and when your son is
             called, like they were in the beginning, drunken hooligans and you know this is not true that
             was just a guise, that was just a cover up for the mistakes that they made and that is
             unforgivable.
             A.U.:
                     Some said it would be a difficult day for them whatever the outcome. Les Jones works
             nights so he couldn't travel with his wife Doreen to Westminster but what he heard on the radio
             at home in Huntscross gave him some hope.
             LES TONES:
                    (Richard's Father) As long as the evidence is presented and the families have a chance
          • o input into that inquiry and has access to the evidence that has been in the hands of the police
             for so many years I'm quite happy.
             A.U.:
                        Paul Robinson's brother Steven was among the 96 who died. Paul was cautious in
             welcoming new scrutiny.
             PAUL ROBINSON:
                    (Brother of Hillsborough Victim Steven) I am a little disappointed that the fresh
             evidence available wasn't enough for the Home Office Minister or indeed the DPP to look to
             order an independent inquiry before this scrutiny goes ahead.
             A.U.:
                     It was a television drama documentary written by Jimmy McGovern and broadcast last
             December which gave the families campaign fresh impetus.                                        Three months ago the
             Hillsborough Family Support Group found a video footage they say wasn't seen by the original
             inquest and they say their case has also been strengthened by evidence from a doctor who
             believes some victims were still alive after 3.15, the time the coroner decided all had died.
             DR ROGAN TAYLOR:
                     (Football Research Unit, University of Liverpool) My hope very much is that it will
             lead to what the families want here which is a reopening of the coroner's court of the inquest
             into the deaths of these people. If it doesn't I don't think the resentment will go away, I don't
             think the interruption in people's lives will go away, in fact it may well lead to private
              prosecutions.
              A.U.:
                     That prospect means no easy resolution for the families concerned. Allan Urry, North                                         *

              G.B.:
                        Well joining me now is the Home Secretary Jack Straw. Home Secretary why couldn't
             you have gone for what the families wanted which was a full public inquiry?
             1.5.:
                        Because I thought that it was appropriate to have the allegations of new evidence
            examined fully by an independent senior member of the Court of Appeal in the way that I'd
            proposed and that's partly because four possible causes of action could follow such an
            examination. There could be a recommendation for a new full public inquiry, there could be a
            recommendation to the Attorney General for him to apply for a new inquest or a
            recommendation to the Director of Public Prosecutions for criminal proceedings or to the Chief
            Constable of South Yorkshire for disciplinary proceedings against police officers. It seemed to
         • n e that it was important to have a focus and a funnel if you like for a consideration of these
            allegations of new evidence and I think that Lord Justice Stuart Smith is a man who is ideally
            placed to conduct that investigation. And although I understand...
            G.B.:
                        Well...
             1.5.:
                     ...if I may just say this, that the family support group would have liked me to go, go
             further they made it clear to me in my meetings today with them that they welcomed what I'd
             done.
             G.B.:
                     Yes, but will this new investigation or examination deal only with what is regarded as
             new evidence or will it consider what the families feel was evidence ignored or not given
             enough importance in previous inquiries or inquests?
             J.S.:
                        Well it'll, it'll deal principally with allegations that there is new evidence which was not
              before the original inquiries and in particular as far as the families are concerned before the...
              G.B.:
                      The new medical evidence...
              1.5.:
                      Yes and that, and that principally, not exclusively but it principally relates to the video
              evidence, that there is, there are claims now that there was video evidence which was available
              at the time which was not shown to the inquest or to Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry and also
              evidence about the time of death which is obviously critical so far as the families are concerned i
              in then establishing other issues including for example culpability of those who did not allow

             the, or would not permit the ambulances to go onto the field. So it's those issues which will be
             among the items which will be examined by Lord Justice Stuart Smith.
             G.B.:
                    And if this investigation feels that there is significant new evidence like for instance the
             video that you talked about then could it then lead to disciplinary action or indeed criminal
             proceedings against the South Yorkshire Police?
             1.5.:
                      Yes is the answer, that will be a matter for Lord Justice Stuart Smith to make a
              recommendation as far as criminal proceedings are concerned to the Director of Public
              Prosecutions. If Lord Justice Stuart Smith makes a recommendation to me as Home Secretary
              for there to be a further full public inquiry then I've already given an undertaking that I will act
             l>n that and in any event I will ensure that his advice to me is made public.
              G.B.:
                      Home Secretary thank you very much indeed for joining us.
             1.5.:
                        Thank you.
             G.B.:
                      Well Phil Hammond who lost a son at Hillsborough was one of the relatives who met
             Jack Straw before his announcement. Earlier I asked him for his reaction to today's news.
             PHILIP HAMMOND:
                      (Hillsborough Family Support Group) We're happy with what Jack Straw has come up
             with, it's not everything we want but we're happy, it's open the door for us and we're about to
             just walk through it now.
             G.B.:
                        Yes, I mean it does fall short of what you were actually asking for doesn't it?
             P.H.:
                     It does, does fall short but it's up to Lord Justice Stuart to how, how he's going to do this
             inquiry, how he's, how he's going to do this. We'll have to get in touch with our barrister and
             our barristers are getting in touch with him to put pressure on that we want legal input into this.
             G.B.:
                        I mean do you have worries about that inquiry as to what evidence might be admissible
             and what evidence might not be admissible?
             P.H.:
                   No, Jack Straw has said all the evidence that we put forward will be admissible so all the ,
             evidence we've got he's going to take on board.

             G.B.:
                        So how did the Home Secretary break this news to you because he did this before his
             Commons statement didn't he?
             P.H.:
                    He took us up to his private room, seven committee members, and read to us exactly
             what he was going to put to the floor and then we asked questions then about full disclosure of
             evidence and all that and he said, you know, he can't see no problem with that.
             G.B.:
                    And did any of you say to him that it wasn't the full inquiry that you wanted and why
             wasn't it?
             P.H.:
                     Well we told him that we wanted a full inquiry, we wanted to... but he said it was up to
             the Attorney General, he said this way you're getting the best of both worlds, let this Lord
             Justice Stuart look at it and he, he can recommend then to the Attorney General, to himself and
             to the Attorney General exactly what we want.
             G.B.:
                     So it's taken eight years or so to get this far, are you happy now with the outcome?
             P.H.:
                        We're happy, we're happy but not over the moon, it's another fight for us and we'll carry
             on.
             G.B.:
                        Phil Hammond thank you very much.
             P.H.:
                        Okay, thank you.
             G.B.:
                        Well much of the recent television documentary was based on the research of Professor
             Phil Scraton who runs The Hillsborough Project and a short time ago I asked for his reaction to
             the news.
             PROFESSOR PHIL SCRATON:
                    (Director, The Hillsborough Project) Well it's a qualified welcome, I mean I think that
             the door is slightly ajar now so that at least we can go forward and present some of the new
             evidence for independent scrutiny. However I am concerned that it hasn't gone far enough,
             what is needed here is a full public inquiry into all aspects of the Hillsborough disaster and the
             aftermath which particularly will focus on the evidence presented, presented to those, the
             inquiry into the inquest and also will focus on the suppression of a whole range of evidence

             which is yet to see the light of day...
             G.B.:
                    But it's the families, it's the families who are saying look we have got vital new evidence
             here and the Home Secretary is saying fine, we will look at that and if you're right we will have
             a full inquiry.
             P.S.:
                      Well I think that some of the evidence that is there at the moment is only a small part of
             what exists. There has been no disclosure of the full extent of the evidence that Taylor did not
             use and didn't come before the inquest. At the same time as that there was no cross-
             examination of that inquest, it was presented at the inquest of that evidence, it was presented
             simply by the West Midlands Police from their summaries, so the families were denied their
             fundamental right to cross-examine evidence, so that cannot be right and I think that's what I
             mean by a wide ranging inquiry.
             G.B.:
                    But if the new evidence is as strong as the families say there will be this new inquiry in
             which all those things can be taken into consideration, is that not right?
             P.S.:
                    My problem is that we are getting tied up in the quality of this particular piece of
             evidence when in actual fact the entire process, the way in which the evidence was collected,
             the way in which... that certain bits of evidence were selected, the way in which it wasn't cross-
             examined, they are the key issues.
             G.B.:
                    Professor Scraton thank you very much indeed.
             P.S.:
                        Thank you.
             G.B.:
                        And this new investigation announced by the Home Secretary into the Hillsborough

                                GOOD NEW FOR FAMILIES OF HILLSBOROUGH VICTIMS

                       First tonight though, some good news at last for the families of the 96 football fans who
               died in the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. The Home Secretary Jack Straw has appointed a
               senior judge to see if there should be a full public inquiry into the tragedy which happened on
               April 15th 1989. He said he was determined to get to the bottom of the disaster once and for
               all. In a moment we'll have reaction but first this report from our Political Correspondent Mark
               Lyons.
               MARK LYONS:
                       The families of the victims of the Hillsborough disaster arrived at Westminster this
               afternoon hopeful that after an eight year battle they were finally on their way to getting to the
               truth of what happened on that fateful Saturday afternoon, confident new evidence that's
               emerged since the tragedy would warrant the Government and authorities to look at the case
               once again. At the original inquest a verdict of accidental death was recorded, the coroner
               declaring none of the 96 victims were alive after quarter past three. New evidence now
               challenges that decision, as does the Granada drama documentary on the subject which
               uncovered that the police camera overlooking the Lepping Lane terraces where the fatal crush
               took place wasn't broken, as the public inquiry was told. In the Commons with the families
               watching on the Home Secretary told Parliament it was time to look again.
               JACK STRAW MP:
                       (Home Secretary, speaking in the Commons) I can therefore tell the House today that
               the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have agreed that it is in the
               public interest that there should be an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now
               exists any new evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously available.
               M.L:                                                                                 *
                       The Home Secretary announced that he was appointing a senior Appeal Court Judge to

             re-examine the case.
             J.S;
                      ... To advise whether any evidence not previously available is of such significance as to
             justify establishment by the Secretary of State for the Home Department of a further public
             inquiry.
             M.L:
                     After his statement the Home Secretary went straight to see the families to discuss his
             decision. In private he outlined to the families what, as Home Secretary, he could and couldn't
            authorise but promised he wanted to finally get to the bottom of what happened.
            VICTIM’S PARENT NO .l:
                   Well I'm quite pleased, yes. Jack Straw has opened the door for us, what we've been
          ^fvaiting for for eight years. He's given us the chance now and we'll prove our case now in court.
             VICTIM’S PARENT NO.2:
                    Kevin didn't die until 4 o'clock that day and I've got all the evidence to prove that and it
             has been to the Attorney General, Sir Nicholas Lyell, three times and I've been refused so
             hopefully now if it goes back they'll do something about it this time.
             M.L:
                        Relatives tonight are confident that justice might finally be round the comer.
             L.M:
                        And we now go over live to Westminster where we can join Mark. Mark?
              M.L:
                   Thank you Lucy. Well how did Jack Straw's comments go down today here at
             Westminster? Joining me, Phil Hammond, whose 14 year old son died at Hillsborough and local
             Merseyside MP Peter Kilfoyle. First of all Phil was that enough today, what Jack Straw said to
              you?
              PHIL HAMMOND:
                     (Hillsborough Families Support Group) We're quite happy with it. He's appointed Lord
              Chief Justice Stuart-Smith to look into this new evidence. We'll be getting our barrister to get
              in touch with him because there's no format set for how this is going to go ahead and we'll be
              getting our barrister to get in to him him to see could we have some mpre input into it.
              M.L:
                     So there was slight concern. Was there anything more, Peter Kilfoyle, that Jack Straw
              could have done? Was there anything else that he was able to do through legislation or is this
              the maximum he could have offered the families left after Hillsborough?

                        (Lab, Liverpool Walton) I think in a very difficult situation Jack Straw has shown
              exemplary judgment and great sensitivity. I think what he's actually done in appointing an
              independent senior judge to assess the new evidence, he actually complies with the constraints
              of the law as they currently stand and yet meets the initial concerns of the parents and the
             families involved. It's now a matter obviously for the Lord Justice to report on what steps, if
             any, need to be taken after that assessment.
             M X:
                     So Phil Hammond, for the families of the Hillsborough victims, what is the bottom line
             for you?
             P.H:
                     The bottom line is, as I say, Hillsborough was no accident. We want to know what
          h ap p en ed after 3.15, all the ones that were alive after 3.15. We've got witnesses now to prove
             that they were still alive. We want to know why that wasn't brought up in the inquests.
             M X:
                     Peter, it was always said that Merseyside and the people of Liverpool didn't get justice,
             that they never knew the full facts around it. Do you think finally the door's being opened now?
             P.K:
                     I think Jack Straw has given the opportunity now to hopefully, once and for all, get to
             the bottom of what was and remains and always will, particularly for the families, be a
             tremendous tragedy but I think that Jack Straw's conduct today, the way in which he handled
             himself and the substance of his statement to the House, will go a very, very long way towards
              assuaging the doubts of those on Merseyside and indeed far beyond about the Hillsborough
              tragedy.
              M X:
                        Just a quick word Phil, you're happy with the situation so far but more can be done?
              P.H:
                        Oh more can be done, yes, we'll be, go and do more.
              M X:
                   Okay, great. Thank you very much. That's all. Back to you in the studio.
              SO RAHMEN:
                        Thank you Mark Lyons, our Political Correspondent there.

                         Hillsborough
                        inquiry decision is a
                        step nearer to
                       justice
                        AFTER eight long years
                       [battling for justice for
                        those who died in the
                        Hillsborough disaster, the
                       [families of the victims today
                       [have new hope in their
                       ihearts.
                          In yesterday's Commons
                       announcement. Home
                       Secretary Jack Straw
                       stopped just short of
                       ordering a new public
                       Inquiry into the events
                       surrounding that terrible
                       afternoon in 1989.
                          But the fact that there is
                       to be an independent
                       scrutiny to decide whether
                       any new evidence exists, is
                       proof that at last someone is
                       listening to the
                       Hillsborough families’ pleas
                       for justice, -
                          Tliemove may not have
                       gone as far as some of them
                       would have liked, but this is
                       the most positive step yet
                       on the long and often
                       difficult road to justice for ■
                       the 96 people who died .
                         The families have
                       campaigned long and hard
                       for the the opportunity to
                       put their case into the
                      [public domain, and
                       yesterday they won that
                      [opportunity.
                         The independent inquiry
                      :1s a tribute to the
                      persistence and strength of
                      will of those who were
                       touched by the tragedy but
                      who have refused to rest
                     auntil all their questions are
                     lanswered.
                        Thoso answers are now a
                      step nearer, and the
                      campaign goes on.

screening of a powerful Granada

the creator of Cracker;
   His Sim challenged the police
version o f events and highlighted
the evidence of a video technician
on duty at the ground.
   He disputed the claims of police
in the control room that they were
unaware o f the crowd build-up
because of a faulty closed circuit
television camera.
   Last     March      the    Crown
Prosecution Service announced that
it was reviewing the case. This has
not yet been completed.
   The families believe the new evi­

o f the coroner’s inquest into the
disaster, where the jury returned a
verdict of accidental death.

Time for truth                       6
THE relatives of the Hillsborough
victims have got what they want. A
new inquiry.
  Yesterday’s announcement by Home
Secretary Jack Straw was welcomed
all-round.
  Now there can be justice for those
parents who have suffered twice over
because the tragedy was not investigated
completely.
  Even the new Shadow Home Secre­
tary, Brian Mawhinney, welcomed Mr
Straw’s announcement.
  It is more than six months since the
devastating TV reconstruction'of Hills­
borough which led to demands for a
new inquiry.
  The then Tory Home Secretary,
Michael Howard, said there m ight be
grounds for re-opening the case. But
he did nothing.
  Thankfully we now have a Labour Borne
Secretary who doesn't just talk, but acts.

Dear Dick,
        During the course of the excavations at Leppings Lane,
Gleesons uncovered a gas main which runs across to the West
stand and goes up the wall inside the gents toilets to feed
the gas cookers on the first floor.      It is quite a large
pipe about 2" diameter.     Where the pipe was uncovered there
were signs that it was leaking because bubbles were rising
in the water whJfeh was standing in the base of a foundation
excavation.
        We have called Eagas to do an inspection and they
wish to block off the pipe and carry out a pressure test.
They were unwilling to do this however without an instruction
from the Club so they could give the work an order number.
I tried to ring your office a few minutes ago before leaving
for London and was unable to get through.      I have therefore
placed an instruction with Emgas on your behalf for the test
to be carried out and trust that this is acceptable.

                                Yours sincerely,


                          Signed in Dr. Eastwood's absence

Dear Dick,
                   Alterations at Lepplngs Lane Entrance
      Excavation for the foundation to the dividing wall at the
Leppings Lane entrance has uncovered a 3" diameter gas main
running between a gas meter box adjacent to the turnstiles
across to the West stand.
      There is considerable corrosion of the gas pipe in the
exposed portion and evidence of a previous repair.     It is thought
likely that there is further corrosion of the pipe, and possible
leakage along the length of the pipe.     In addition the Contractor
has had to repair the pipe due to iiechanical damage during the
excavation work.
      It is suggested that this pipe be scheduled for replacement
within the near future,     ft may be possible to insert a new
flexible pipe inside the existing, to effect a repair without
the need to remove the existing pipe.


                               Yours sincerely,
                                                     WE/KWP/KH/6705

Dear Dick,
                   Alterations at Lepplngs Lane End
      We enclose      marked up prints of our drawings 1610/9, 6 7 0 5 / 1 8
indicating proposed locations of barriers and gates within
the West stand, showing two barriers in the seated area
rows 77/78 and 102/103, and opening gates to the access floor
area in front of the refreshment bar.
      The proposal for two barriers in the seated area would give
flexibility to the areas allocated to visiting supporters.                        The
gates in the access floor would maintain the division of
supporters. However we would have to consider placing a steward
in attendance at these gates to allow opening in emergency for
unrestricted access to both stair towers.
      It is anticipated that the cost of the additional barrier
and gates should be within the contingency sum allowed in the
present contract with Gleesons.
      we await your comments before proceeding further.


                                      Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                  Alterations at Leppings Lane End
      As mentioned in your telephone conversation with John
Strange yesterday we have now received tenders for the work
at the back of the West stand and including afeher general
maintenance items.
      Four completed documents were received together with A
completed Form of Tender from J. Lee and Sons.     The tender
return envelopes were opened by Richard Eastwood, witnessed by
John Strange on 11 July 1985.
      The total tender sums are as follows

      Gleeson {Sheffield) Ltd.
      J. Lee and Sons
      J. Finnegan L£.d.
      J. Glossop Ltd.
      A.J. Loveland

      Each of teh tenders includes a contingency sum of 10%.
which may or may not need to be expended.     The arithmetic
in Gleesons document has been checked and a minor error increases
their tender sum by fi)                  I.
      You will recall that on 4 June we wrote to you saying
that we expected the cost of the work to be around £62,500.
Since then we have added the extra fence on the Leppings
Lane terrace (£2087), the barrier down the West stand seated
area £612) and repairs to and replacement of some crush
barrier posts which did not pass the load tests which we
recently carried out on Spion Kop (£1606).    The only surprise,
as John Mentioned to you, is the figure of £3000 entered
against the item for removing and resiting the infrarred
counters and control gear on turnstiles Nos. 17 and 18.    We
had to ask the tenderers to go to Phillips Alarms for a quote for
this work because it is their equipment and they are still in
the process of installing it.   They have, we suspect, taken
advantage of the situation and given a high price for the work,
though it may be that the exercise of moving the control box
is more involved than we imagine.
      So, after deducting the 10% contingency in the tender
offered by Gleesons and deducting the aboveeextras we arrive
at a figure just over our estimate, though we do have to add
planning and building regulations fees and professional fees
which will probably amount to about £6000.
      We recommend that the tender submitted by Gleeson
(Sheffield) Ltd. is accepted but we will wait until you have
had the opportunity to discuss the tenders with your board
before sending Gleesons a letter of intent.   Gleesons have
told us that they can start work almost immediately.


                           Yours sincerely,
                                                  WE/JAS/SLW/6705

Dear Dick,
                    Alterations at Leppings Lane End

     We have pleasure in enclosing a set of prints of our drawings
showing details of the work at the Leppinqs Lane End.
     Drawing 6705/8A is worth a look at because it shows the proposed
layout of the turnstiles and fences.   South Yorkshire Police have
given their approval to the scheme though we have not received
anything from them in writing.
     Tenders are due back on 11th July, 1985.

                             Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
                 Alterations at Lepplngs Lane End
     We have pleasure in enclosing two prints of each of our drawings
6705/5 and 6705/8 showing two possible alternative arrangements for
the turnstiles and toilets at the back of the West stand.
     Both drawings show the following turnstile arrangements.
             Turnstile Nos    1-8   -    North stand
                              9 - 13 -   North west terrace, home supporters
                             14 - 16 -   West stand, home supporters
                             17 - 19 -   West stand, away supporters
                        20 - 23 - South west terrace, away supporters
     The proposals for the toilet and refreshment facilities are also
the same on each drawing. You will see that we propose to build a new
ladies toilet for away supporters using the end of the existing
refreshment bar. The existing ladies toilets will be refurbished for
the use of home supporters. The existing gents toilets will be
divided and refurbished.
     Drawing 6705/5 indicates present turnstiles housings (17 & 18)
remaining with the ajoining fence covered with sheeting to completely
separate the home and away supporters. However, doing the calculations
for the evacuation of the ground reveals that there is a pinch point at
the two external gates on the left hand side of the row of six.
It could take over 20 minutes to evacuate that end of the ground
depending on how many people leave the South stand from that side.
We, therefore, show on drawing 6705/8, an improvement to that
arrangement by demolishing the two end turnstiles (17 & 18) and
constructing a new dividing wall angled across to enclose three
gates on the left hand side instead of two.
     We believe that the cost of the scheme on drawing 6705/5 will
be about £57,500 and for the one shown on drawing 6705/8 around
£59,500, both including professional fees. To these figures add
say another £3000 for the maintenance work mentioned in our letter
of 2 May.
     If a decision to proceed with one of the proposed schemes is
given within the next few days it may be possible to have the work
substantially complete by the start of next season. This is not
certain but we would have a go.


                             Yours sincerely,
\

 Dear Dick,
                                          Re-organisation of Turnstiles
                        and New Toilet Facilities at Leppings Lane
                 As requested we have now prepared an estimate for the
 cost of works envisaged at the back of the West stand for the
 segregation of visiting spectators.
                 The scope of the work falls into two categories, firstly
 the turnstiles, fences, walls and gates, and secondly, the
 toilets and refreshment facilities.
                 The proposed layout of the turnstiles etc. at the back
 of the stand is shown on our drawing 6705/4, a copy of which is
 enclosed.            Including the radial fence on the West terrace, we
 estimate that the cost of this work, including professional
 fees, is likely to be in the order of £66,600.                                       This
 assumes that five of the existing turnstiles can be re-used
 and seven new turnstiles are purchased.
                 Also enclosed is a print of our drawing 6705/7 showing
 the proposed layout of the new and refurbished toilets beneath
 the West stand.                  We estimate that the cost of the toilets,
 again including professional fees, will probably be around
 £60,700.            This includes stainless steel fittings which are fairly
 resistant to abuse but are expensive.                               The saving if vitreous
 china is substituted for stainless steel urinal troughs and

  sinks would be about £2,200.            If the items of maintenance
 work, listed by S.Y.C.C. Working Party on their last visit,
  and agreed to be done i.e. investigate the condition of the
  concrete frame at the back of the South stand and the corrosion
  of stanchions at the back of the West stand, repointing the
  boundary wall on Penistone Road and providing the mesh infill
  on the bridge to the kitchens are added to the same contract
  we suggest that an allowance of £3,000 be made for this.
                The total expenditure for the whole scheme plus
  the mainteannce work is therefore likely to be about £130 300
  including professional fees and Building Regulations fees.


                                     Yours sincerely,

Dear Hr.

     Thank you for your letter dated 15th April, 1985 enclosing the
drawings of the turnstiles at Hillsborough.   I hope to be in tough

    Dear Mr Vaughan,
                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
       Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Loppings Lane End

        The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team’s supporters
    as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control
    their exit at the end of a game.
        We have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
    drawing 0705/2. This Involves the construction of two new banks of
    turnstiles (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various ruas of fencing
    and new gates.
        It would be appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
    proposal at an early dfcte. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
    the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                       Yours sincerely,




     c.c.   Mr R C h e s t e r

Dear Dick,
                Entrance Routes at Leppings Lane End
      I have pleasure in enclosing three copies of our
sketch 6705/2 showing a possible layout which segregates visitors
from home supporters reasonably well.   It also allows flexibility
in allocating varying amounts of accommodation to visitors.
      Suggestions are also made for new refreshment and toilet
areas utilising vacant volume under the West stand.
      We have not attempted to cost the scheme until you have
had time to comment and suggest improvements.


                            Yours sincerely,

Dear Dick,
             Re-arrangement of Entry and Exit Arrangements at
                         Leppings Lanei
        I understand, following John Strange's telephone conversation
with you yesterday, that South Yorkshire County Council did not send
you a copy of their letter to us dated 2 May.      A copy is now
enclosed.
        A number of things that they request have already been
incorporated since we wrote to them on 9 April.       However I do
not think that it is realistic to ask for the gates in the radial
fences and have written to David Vaughan accordingly.


                                Yours sincerely,
                                                                                   Dm.      Chd.   Date

Dear Sharron,

              Modifications to Leppinqs Lane Entrance

                            Gas Pipe Repairs

      We have today forwarded a certificate for the payment of
£600.80 plus V.A.T. to Murphy Pipelines Limited.            The original
is enclosed, together with their invoice dated 3 September, 1985.
      Since receiving their invoice, we have contested the dates
given by them for when the work was carried out and also the sums
involved.     Ten days ago they finally produced sufficient evidence
to prove to us that the number of hours they spent working are
correct but not o n t h e d a t e s   they said.   We believe that this
is now sorted and they are genuinely due to the money.
      The work involved replacing the old underground gas pipe
which was found to be leaking and in poor condition when exposed
by Gleesons at the back of the West stand and for testing the
gas supply.     Further leaks were then found and more repairs
found necessary to the pipes and valves within the stand itself.

                           Yours sincerely,
                                                      WE/JAS /SW/6705

Dear Sharon,

                  Refurbishment of Toilet Facilities
                Modifications to Leppings Lane Entrance


      We are pleased to report that we have at last come to an
agreement with Gleesons for the work done in 1985, on the toilets
and entrance modifications at the Lfeppings Lane end of the ground.,
You will recall that we wrote on 24 March this year setting out
the likely financial outcome of the job.          The Contract Sum agreed
is £74,896     which is £479 more than we expected.         This is mainly
due to two extras involving electrical work w&ich was found to be
necessary because the existing wiring from which we were taking
supplies for the new toilets and r e f r e s h m e n t b a r s was found to
be sub-standard and had to be replaced.          The extra only came to
light during the discussions we held last Friday with Gleesons.
Their other claims have been resisted,and in the event we have
deducted £3168 off their proposed final account.            However, we believe
that i t   is reasonable for them to be paid for the electrical work.
We have therefore issued our Final Certificate for the payment
of £1930.    The original is enclosed.A copy of the Certificate,
together with their statement will, as usual, be presented to
                                                                   2




you by Gleesons.
     Our Maintenance Certificate is also enclosed.    To tidy up
this job we now need to certify the S      for the gas pipe
repairs carried out by Murphy Pipelines Ltd. and there is also
our own fees account to prepare, which we hope to send within
the next week or so.


                        Yours sincerely.

Dear Sirs,

              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic.

     I   happened to be sorting through some old prints today when
I came   across your telex dated 22 January, 1986.    How it got
amongst the prints I do not know but looking through the files
for the Sheffield Wednesday job, I am sorry to report that you
were not given a reply.     However, a little research indicates
that we never received a reply from you to our letter dated
23 October, 1985.
     I   would like to sort this out fairly quickly now because we
are   at present trying to agree the final account with the Main
Contractor.
     Please accept our apologies for misplacing your telex and
not replying sooner.


                          Yours faithfully,

       Please find enclosed single copies of twenty pages of my
comments on your final account.     You will see that some of the
quantities need re-measuring but unfortunately we cannot have access
to the two refreshments bars until Mr.              returns from holiday
on 28 July.    He has the only keys.     I suggest we make a visit early;
that week,, unless of course you already have records.      We could m e a g r e
other items sooner but it would have to be Thursday 24 July which Is
the only day I am free this week.

                     FOR THE ATTENTION OF DR W EASIWOOD

                     Dear Sir

                    SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB PLC
                     MODIFICATIONS TO LEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE

                    We are in receipt of your letter of 30 June 1986 and have passed your
                    observations to our subcontractor and will therefore reply in detail
                    in due course.

                    However, we would point out that the bottom guide to the folding
                    shutter door was not bent whilst being broken out; this was
                    in fact brought to your attention at the time and agreement reached
                    that payment would be made.

                    We can and will demonstrate the per centage addition to the metalwork
                    element of the account when we next meet.

                    We trust that this meets with your acceptance.

                    Yours faithfully

               For the attention of Dr. W Eastwood

               Dear Sirs

               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic
               Modifications to Leppings Lane Entrance

               We refer to our letter of the 22nd January 1986 enclosing a draft summary
               of final account and despite subsequent reminders, both written and verbal
               we have to record that no action appears to have been made towards settlement.

               We would again request your attention to this matter in order that agreement
               may be reached and a further payment made.

               We await your favourable reply.

               Yours faithfully

Dear Dick,
               Leppings Lane - Safety Works
               Messrs. Gleesons Account
     Please excuse the delay in replying to your letter of 26
February. I think it will be some time before we have
agreement on Gleesons final account.     In our view they have
overclaimed on a number of items and it will take many months
before they accept our figures.
     Our present assessment is that the final account we shall
agree will be about £         At the moment Gleesons are
asking for i
     We informed Corderoys some weeks ago informally that the
final cost is likely to be around £          They have asked
for a split of the work which is associated with toilets and
that which is exclusively safety (repairs to barriers, investigation
of south stand concrete etc.). If you would like us to have a
further word with Corderoys or to write to them formally we will
be very pleased to do so.
     With regard to our own accounts, the £123 tfas planning fees
which we paid to the City Council on your behalf and which you
have already reimbursed us. Our account for £           covers
97|% of fees based on an estimate of S       for the final account.
Assuming that we eventually certify £      .00 as being due to
Gleesons the balance of our fees, including the 2i%
not yet claimed will be about si     [


                         Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,

     During the past two weeks or so I have been inspecting the
various sections of work. Enclosed is a copy of a list of items
requiring completion or remedy together with single prints of our
drawings 6705/6, 12, 13, 15A, 17, 18A and 20 which have been
narked up to indicate items requiring completion or remedy.
     The items should be attended to without undue delay.     Some
of them involve work dome by your sub-contractors.
     Mr. Shaw of George Shaw Engineering Ltd. rang me this morning
to say that you have given him permission to proceed with their
remedial work.   He collected the prints of the above drawings a
few minutes later. There are things noted on those prints which
involve your work so you had better take a look at the prints
whilst they are on site.

                        Yours faithfully,
                                                                      FILE

For the attention of Mr.


Dear Sirs/
             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic.
     Thank you for your letter dated 11-October/ 1985.    There is
something disturbingly wrong with the dates you give for the work
because on 12 August, 1985 I received a telephone call from
Mr. Mulgrew to say that all your work, including the testing had
been completed the week before.
     We know that your men were on site the early part of that
week, installing the new pipework. We also know, from our records
that your men were not on site on the morning of the 9th August, 1985*
Kevin Pullan went to see them that morning and could not find
them. However, later that day he did speak to Mr. Mulgrew over
the telephone about blanking off a leaking valve. We presume
that job and subsequent testing was done on 10th August, 1985.
     So, how is it that you are recording work done on 15th,
16th and 17th August, 1985 after we were told that you had finished and
on days when we know your men were not on site?    Sort it please
and write back to us with a full explanation.

                                      Yours faithfully,
                                                   ___

                 For the attention of Mr. John Strange


                 Dear Sir,
                 SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL GROUND.
                 Thank you for your letter dated 19th September, 1985 relating to our
                 invoice number 802188.
                 On instruction we inserted a 32 mm. pipe up the existing 2" steel
                 service from the metre position to the stand.          Before connecting
                 the new service to the existing service, which of course was not being
                 renewed, a test was carried out in keeping with safety regulations.
                The test would not hold and our team began tracing the leak or leaks.
                They eventually narrowed it down to an old disused bar below the stands
                where they found a large leak.     They cut off that service and retested
                the remaining pipework.      This time only a small pressure drop was
                recorded which again had to be traced and found.      This was eventually
                found to be a defective cooker which was very old.   This leak was also
                repaired and the pipework tested again.         This time the test held
                and our new service was connected.
                The work was carried out on 15th, 16th and 17th August.
                If you have any further questions we can arrange for our Mr. Mulgrew
                and your representative Mr. Pullen to meet on site and examine the
                extra work which was carried out.

                Yours faithfully,
                MURPHY PIPELINES LIMITED

Dear Dick,
             Modifications at Leppings Lane End
       Please find attached a financial statement relating
to the work which is now almost complete at the Leppings Lane
end.
       Without the additional items requested by S.Y.C.C. at
the meeting held on 7 August we could have expected a final
contract sum of about £70,357 leaving approximately i
change from the tender sum.
       However, after adding the likely cost of the extra items
requested by S.Y.C.C. it looks as though we can expect an
overspend of around £     |     The figures used in the statement
have been built up from our own estimates.       We still have to
agree various costs with Gleesons and this may take a
while to resolve, for we already detect some resistance from
them, but we will see.


                              Yours sincerely,
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

            Modifications and Toilets at Leppings Lane End


Gleesons Contract Sum                                    £
(whfMah included a contingency sum of £      )


1.   Additional items instructed by us or were found
to be necessary as work proceeded, the cost of which
can be legitimately taken out of contingencies.     The
cost of theselitems has been estimated by us btit the            ---
final cost has yet to be agreed with Gleesons                £


2.   Items instructed by us as work proceeded which
results in a likely saving.   Again the cost of these
items has been estimated by us but the final
savings that may be made have yet to tee agreed with
Gleesons.                                                    £


Likely final contract sum that could have been
expected before the meeting with S.Y.C.C. on 7 August
                                                     £


Additional items requested by S.Y.C.C. during the
meeting on 7 August or with Superintendent J. Freeman on 31 July.
a)   Three gates in perimeter fences                     £
b)   Fence and gate at first floor level in the
     West stand                                          £
c)   Sign board fixings in the West stand

                                                         £


The cost of these items has been estimated by us but the final
costs that may be incurred have yet to be agreed with Gleesons
and their sub-contractors.


If the cost of the last three items is taken from the
remainder of the contingency then there is an overspend of
approximately £
                                                      WE/JAS/SW/6705

Dear Dick,
             Planning Consent for Safety Work at Leppings Lane
                         End of Ground
    We have today received the formal planning consent for the
works.   The original is enclosed.    We have kept a photo-copy
for our records.
    You will notice that there are two reserved items.    The
first has been complied with because we have already started
work.   The second relates to the proposed external materials.
We shall be conducting the planners round the work in the next
few days and I do ntit foresee any difficulties.
    I mentioned to you a few days ago that in connection with the
work on Leppings Lane, we had received a Building Regulations
rejection for the brick walls forming the toilet cubicles and also
for the brick wall forming the front of the new refreshment
facilities under the South West corner.   In each case this is
because we have built the wallsoff the existing concrete slab
instead of breaking through and forming a separate foundation.
    In my view it is perfectly absurd to request that the walls
be taken down to new foundations bearing in mind that they are
on good concrete slabs and only single storey high, and do not
carry any load.    I expressed my views very firmly during
the inspection by the Working Party at which the representatives
of the Building Control department implied that they were
dissatisfied and could not approve what we are doing.   In
theory the Town Council could issue a summons in which case
I take full responsibility.   However we can take comfort
from the fact that under the new Building Regulations which
come into operation on 1 November, matters of this kind are
excluded.   In the circumstances I am sure that the City Council
will take no further action.


                           Yours sincerely,

                     Dear Sirs

                     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Pic
                     Toilet Facilities and Modifications at LeppirigS Lane

                     We refer to the writers telephone conversation with Mr
                     and confirm that we have damaged two electric ca^es in the following
                     locations:

                     a)       Excavation of the footing to the new brick retaining wall -
                              resulting in the failure of the emergency supply.

                     b)       Excavation of the bases for the new handrail to the Leppings
                              Lane Entrance - resulting in the failure of the external
                              lighting standards.

                     In both instances the supplies were not identified on drawings neither
                     had they been previously brought to our attention.

                      We cannot therefore accept any responsibility for the resultant
                      costs for the reinstatement and will submit further details in due
                      course.

                      Yours faithfully

        Modifications to Leppings Ldrte End Entrance

        We refer to your letter dated 22nd August 1985 and wish to clarify
        that the wire baskets in each of the four toilet blocks have been
        supplied by ourselves as discussed with you on site and not the employer,
        as stated in your letter.

        Yours faithfully

  ^ 1) Please supply and fix two MoInlyeke 'M' box paper
towel dispensers, colour, orange.             One to be fitted in each

instead of the 'Cresco' towel holders specified on the
Drawings.
  ^ 2) Please fix four wire baskets supplied by the Employer.
One to be fitted in each of the four toilet blocks.
    3)        Please fix a toilet paper holder, supplied by the ^

neatly cutting a hole in the brickwork, inserting a timber

  / 5) Please supply and fix 31 supporting straps and fixing
bolts as shown on the attached sketch.     Remove the existing
advertisement boards to fix the straps and rehang them over
the front wall of the stand.     On the two end boards please
provide and fix a timber batten at the back of the board, say
150mm in from the end of the board so that the strap can be
secured to it and the bolt has sufficient edge clearance at
the end of the wall.
    Please remove all dirt and rust from off the straps
before painting with one coat of red lead primer followed by
a coat of alkyd undercoat and a coat of alkyd gloss, all applied
before filing.
    6) Please supply and fix a new 100 x 50 x 5 R.B.S post,
as described on the sketch accompanying our lettter dated 15
August, to secure the end of the new radial fence where it
meets the existing perimeter fence.    Weld the post to the
existing horizontal angle and tack weld the mesh to the new
post.   The post and base plate is to be prepared and painted
as described in the Specification.
    7) Please provide and fix a new 2.3m (approx) length of
60.3mm diameter C.H.S. between the two new posts on Spion Kop.
The rail is to replace the existing rail which was so badly
deformed that it could not be re-used.

For tire attention of Mr.


Dear Sirs,
                  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
               Modifications to Leppings Lane End Entrance

    We write to confirm the instructions given last week by
the undersigned.
  /1) In the existing toilets please fill with concrete
and trowel smooth the top surface, the existing urinal
channels.    Stop the concrete on each side of the gullies,
feed the new waste pipes from the urinals into the gullies
and provide and fix new gulley covers neatly fitted round
the pipes.
  ^2)    Please take down the two existing "Refreshment Bar"
signs.    Re-use the long sign to produce a new sign reading
"REFRESHMENTS BAR" and fix above the door of the bar
serving the visiting spectators.
    Provide a new timber sign with the same style and size
of lettering as the one mentioned above,   reading REFRESHMENTS
BAR —* and secure it to the existing fence so that it is
easily seen by home spectators coming from the north end of
                                                                    2




the terrace.     Craig Gibbons will show you where tojfix the
board.
    3) Paint, on the concrete wall adjacent to the new
refreshments bar a sign reading REFRESHMENTS BAR — %        Black
letters on a white background.
    4) Please weld two short lengths of 75mm wide steel, in
line with the existing 75 x 50 R.H.S's, between the end
repositioned post and existing gate post at the Leppings
Lane entrance.    The steel members may be of just sufficient
thickness (but not less than 12mm) to allow a fixing to be
made for the new profiled steel sheeting.     It could be
either a solid member or a hollow section.
    5) Please prepare and paint the existing steelwork posts
between the new profile sheeting.     Grind off any sharp edges
and the remains of fixings which have been removed as a
result of the re-alignment, before painting.
  / 6) To the personnel door in the new dividing wall please
provide and fix one dead lock with escutcheons, one pull
handle and one push plate.    The escutcheons, handle and plate
are to be in stainless steel and two keys are to be provided
with the lock.
  ^7) Please provide three new Squire "Old English" padlocks, key
type PES11, together with two keys.    Fit one lock to the
existing gate in the centre radial fence, after removing the
present lock, the second to the gate in the new radial fence
and the third to the new gate on the first floor of the stand.


                               Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

   We write to confirm the agreement between Mr.           and the
undersigned on 19 July to rake out the joints in the existing
brickwork instead of fixing expanded metal sheets as specified,
where the brickwork was to be rendered.
   We also confirm that this proposal was not implemented
and that on 23 July you were instructed to apply uni-bond over
the walls to be rendered instead of raking out the joints.

              Our site records indicate your bricklayers have been
 gainfully employed throughout the period 25-29 July on the main
 division wall, the new turnstiles, and two walls of the new
 refreshment bar. It is considered that our request to delay
 the front wall of the new refreshment bar has not caused a delay
 to the works.

                                Yours sincerely.

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                    Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club FLC
       Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
outcome of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.       We note
the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
by the Building Surveyors Department. We believe that all the
calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
checking and comment.
       With regard to your detailed observations our response
is as follows :-
(a)    We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
the proposed extra security gate. There is already a gate in
the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
police. This saute gate will still be available for the spectators
in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
which will be under the control of the police.   This point may
perhaps be clarified during the Working Party's visit on 7 August.

(b)    The foundatlDBsffor this fence are in fact already aligned in
                                                                    2.




 the way pou suggest.                                              0 \

 (c) and (d)                                              /
        We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
 single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
walls. The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

.(e)  The refreshment area is under the most westerly
staircase up to the north west corner terrace. There will
be an opportunity to inspect on 7 August.

 (f)   The handrail is to be at a height of 1250mm (4'1")
 above the horizontal step, measured at the face of the vertical
’step.'

(g)    The stepping of the face of the wall is achieved by 45°
chamfers which will not form good footholds.

(h)   Mr. Chester says that the club will certainly not
object to the provision of another gate at this point, and
the precise location can be discussed on 7 August.

(i)   As with point (a), we are not sure what is intended,
and the matter can be discussed on 7 August.

(j)   Your comment regarding stewarding will no doubt, be
taken care of by Mr. Chester.


       It will.be much easier for your Working Party to
appreciate vhat is intended when they see the works under
construction. There will also be an opportunity to see
the metal decking of the South stand.


                          Yours sincerely,



c.c.   Mr. R.H. Chester

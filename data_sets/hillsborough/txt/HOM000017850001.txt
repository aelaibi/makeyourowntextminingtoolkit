Thank you for your letter of 5 May to the
Prime Minister about the tragic events at
Hillsborough. I have been asked to
reply.
As you may know, an Inquiry has been set
up under the Chairmanship of Lord Justice
Taylor to investigate the events of
Hillsborough and to make recommendations.
I have therefore passed on your letter to
Mr Robert Whalley, the Secretary to the
Inquiry, who can be contacted at this
address.

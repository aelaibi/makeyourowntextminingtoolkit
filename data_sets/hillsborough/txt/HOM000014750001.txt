Dear
Thank you for your recent letter about the position of the Chief
Constable of South Yorkshire, Mr Peter Wright.
The decision of the South Yorkshire Police Authority not to
accept Mr Wright's resignation is a matter for the Authority
alone. There is no provision in police service legislation for
the Home Secretary to instruct or overrule them on that.

There is a power under section 29(1) of the Police Act 1964 for
the Secretary of State to require a police authority to exercise
its power to call upon the chief constable to retire in the
interests of efficiency (The Police Authority's power is in
Section S(4). However, the Home Secretary is not aware of any
grounds which would justify his invoking Section 29(1) in this
case.
I know that the Home Secretary would want to express again his
sympathy to all the families and relatives concerned for their
great loss.
                                                              Yours sincerely




                                                             D P C JONES

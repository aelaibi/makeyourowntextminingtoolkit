identified             the       area     that       went          to    last       year           as    pen 7.

Like      I say,         I saw                      coming          b ac k      through             that       g a te     and      I asked

him,      ’ Aren't            we    going       through             to     t h at      other            side       again.'          He     said

’No,      Th e     Steward          told       me    it was             for     the      Stands           only.’
We     went       b ac k        towards             the     tunnel          and       could          see     no S t e w a r d s           or P o l i c e

or     any    signs             giving          any        indication                of    other        routes           into        the       actual

standing            a r ea .         There            was       still       a    large          crowd        of     people           coming           into

th e    ground and                   going          into        the      tunnel.             We      joined         the       c r o w d a n d we

could        se e      the        ground            and     that         the     players             were       out      and       moving

around.             I did            not       no w    if t h e y         had a c t u a l l y           kicked           off       at     t hi s      time.

We     went       through             t^tit? t u n n e l         without             being        held       up at         all       and       towards

th e    end       of       it,       which          wa s    dark,         it     began          to     slope        downwards              towards

the     standing                area.           Once        again         there           was     no    sign        of a n y S t e w a r d s or

pressure            was       still        increasing              and          I could             see     police        and       St.    John

ftm.bulancerrien t r y i n g                 to     shout         to    the          crowd          to    b a ck    up.        We    j u st     couldn'

d o it .

When      they        realised             it w a s        impossible                 they          went     towards           a gate          in the

fence         to    open        it up.             there w e r e            a    lot          of    people         climbing          up and          over

the      f en c e .

I tried            to m a k e       my w ay         towards            this          gate.           I saw                     near       to    the

gate      but       he     didn't          get      through            it.           I was          being      forced          forward          again

with      the        pressure,             towards          the        fen ce .               As    I was      shuffling             my    fe et      I

could         feel,        at      one     po i n t ,      a body           on       the       floor       with      my    feet.           With       the

pressure             of    the      crowd         it w a s        impossible                   to    even      look       down       let       alone

bend      down        to      help        anyone.           I think              that          if    I had         have    tried          I would

have       probably             finished            up     on     the       f lo o r          myself.

After         stepping             over      the       body       I came             up       against         the     fe nc e. I t r i e d                to

climb         up     the      fence        but      by     now     I wa s            so       weak        I couldn't manage                    it.        As

Dear Sir,

Hillsborough Stadium Inquiry

On behalf of the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire Police, we
enclose written background material, which our clients wish now to
place before the inquiry.  Bundles of photographs and of the
principal documents referred to in this material are also enclosed.

In preparing this written material, our clients have attempted to
concentrate on matters which will be of relevance to the inquiry,
but which are unlikely to be the subject of substantial controversy.

Our clients are considering what, if any, oral evidence might assist
the inquiry and would appreciate hearing from you as to which, if
any, Officers of the South Yorkshire Police are to be called by
Counsel to the inquiry.

Our clients wish to assist the inquiry and,to that end, we would
like to make, through you, a request to all interested parties who
may wish to raise specific questions concerning the actions of the
South Yorkshire Police on and prior to 15th April, 1989 that prior
notice of such questions be given to us as soon as possible.

Our clients will use their best endeavours to find and provide full
and timeous answers to any relevant questions which are notified to
them.

Yours faithfully,

 'V

      THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE: HISTORY, GEOGRAPHICAL

                   AREA, MANNING AND ORGANISATION



1.1   The South        Yorkshire          Police     was formed in

      April     1974 by amalgamation of the Sheffield

      and     Rotherham           Constabulary and part of the

      West Yorkshire Constabulary.



1.2   The force        was        originally coterminous with

      the boundaries of the former South Yorkshire

      Metropolitan           County       Council.       In 1985 the

      council      was            abolished        and     the     South

      Yorkshire        Police        now serves the four local

      authority        areas        of    Sheffield,       Doncaster,

      Barnsley and Rotherham.



1.3   The South        Yorkshire          Police     has    a police

      establishment           of 2978 officers and, on 15th

      April     1989,        an    actual       strength     of 2929.

      This     equates        to     a    population       ratio    per

      officer of        440,       and a ratio of one officer

      per 53 hectares.



1.4   The Chief Constable of the Force is Mr Peter

      Wright     and     he       has held the post since 1st

      January     1983.            To     assist     in the overall

      management        of     the       Force there is a Deputy

      Chief     Constable          and    three Assistant Chief

      Constables,        each of whom has been allocated



                                            3
specific            responsibilities                by     the     Chief

Constable.



The     Deputy        Chief Constable Mr Peter Hayes,

QPM      LLB         MA         deputises           in     the     Chief

Constable's           absence           from    the       Force.         He

hears        minor charges laid against any member

of    the         Force under the Police (Discipline)

Regulations               1985      and        he        also    has      a

responsibility                    forCommunications                and

Computer           Development           within the Force.             He

has     held this post since 1st March 1985 and

prior        to     this         held the post of Assistant

Chief Constable from 1st May 1978.

The     Assistant               Chief Constable (Operations)

Mr      Walter            William          Wilson Jackson,               is

responsible               for      all     police         operational

matters,          including the policing arrangements

for     any       major         event     occurring within the

county.           He has held this post since 1st May

1985.



The two remaining Assistant Chief Constables

are     Mr        Terence        Watson,       BA,       who     has     a

responsibility             for Management and Financial

Services,          and     Mr     Kenneth Stuart Anderson,

who     is    responsible               for the Staff Services

function of recruiting, training, personnel,

career development and welfare.                          Mr Anderson
      has also undertaken temporary responsibility

      for     complaints           and discipline matters.                Mr

      Watson         was         appointed         Assistant            Chief

      Constable on 25th March 1984 and Mr Anderson

      on 3rd April 1985.



1.7   The     Force        has     six divisions.             'A',   'B' and

      'C'      Divisions           are     coterminous           with     the

      local     authority           boundaries           of     Doncaster,

      Barnsley        and        Rotherham        respectively.           The

      city,      and         local        authority           district     of

      Sheffield            are      served         by     three      police

      divisions.             'D'     Division incorporates the

      city     centre        and     the East of the city,                'E'

      Division        is     to the South, and 'F' Division

      covers         the         North      and         West     areas     of

      Sheffield.



1.8   'F' Division has two sub-divisions.                            'FI' is

      known     locally           as Hillsborough Sub-Division

      and     Sub-Divisional Headquarters are located

      at     the Hammerton Road Police station.                          'F2'

      is     referred        to as Ecclesfield Sub-Division

      and is based at Ecclesfield Police Station.

      On      15th     April        1989     the        'F'     Divisional

      Headquarters           were        sited at Hammerton Road.

      However,        on     Monday        24th     April        1989     the

      Divisional           Headquarters           were        transferred,

      along with 'F2' Sub-Divisional Headquarters,



                                              5
       to     a     new     building,           purpose built for the

       South         Yorkshire            Police        at    The     Common,

       Ecclesfield.



1.9    Hillsborough           football           stadium        is situated

       within        'F'     Division.               It is approximately

       one     mile        north     of     Hammerton           Road Police

       Station.



1.10   Hillsborough is the home ground of Sheffield

       Wednesday           Football        Club       who     play     in the

       First        Division        of     the        football       league.

       Hillsborough           has        also        been    used     on many

       occasions in the past as a neutral venue for

       FA     Cup     Semi-Final           games.            There are four

       other Football League clubs within the South

       Yorkshire           Police        area.        There is therefore

       substantial            collective              football       policing

       experience            within         the         South       Yorkshire

       Police.



1.11   In     addition,        large crowds are attracted to

       horse racing at Doncaster where the St Leger

       Classic        is     run,     to    the        venues for rugby

       league,             speedway,        the         world        snooker

       championship           at    the     Crucible Theatre, and

       many         more.           Furthermore,               the    R.A.F.

       Finningley Air Display is attended each year

       by      in      excess        of     140,000           spectators.



                                                 6
       The     Sheffield             Marathon,         and     the National

       Milk     Cycle Race are also significant annual

       events requiring police supervision.



1.12   The     South       Yorkshire             Police      has        a    broad

       experience              of     controlling            situations         in

       which        crowds, sometimes hostile towards the

       police       or a third party, gather together in

       a confined area.



1.13   At     the    beginning             of 1980 Sheffield became

       the     focal point of a 13 week national steel

       strike.            On        14th    February          of    that year

       massed        demonstrations               occurred         at       Vulcan

       Road,        Sheffield          and,       at the height of the

       demonstration                       approximately                      1500

       demonstrators                  confronted             the        police.

       Despite         this           concentrated             crowd,          the

       workforce          of        Hadfield's steel company were

       enabled        safe          passage       into       the    factory.

       During       the        whole       13    weeks        there         was no

       notable        injury          or damage caused during the

       demonstrations.



1.14        Similarly,          during the extended industrial

       dispute         between             the    National         Union        of

       Mineworkers             and     their         employers over a 12

       months       period           1984/85, the South Yorkshire

       Police experienced some of the most intense,



                                                 7
       and     violent,           crowd     demonstrations          in the

       country.               Despite           the      size     and,     on

       occasions,           ferocity of the crowds, no fatal

       injuries        were        sustained in South Yorkshire

       as a result of the demonstrations throughout

       the twelve months of the dispute.



1.15   Each    South        Yorkshire        Police       Division         is

       commanded           by a Chief Superintendent.                   Chief

       Superintendent David Godfrey Duckenfield was

       promoted        to     his present rank on 27th March

       1989,     to        take     over     the       command     of     'F'

       Division.            Mr Duckenfield has over 25 years

       police        service and was a Superintendent for

       5\     years        before     his       latest promotion.



1.16   Each     Divisional Commander is supported by a

       deputy        divisional commander who carries the

       rank     of     Superintendent.                 The 'F' Division

       Deputy        is Superintendent Roger Marshall who

       has held the post for Ik years.

       During          his          time        at      'F'      Division,

       Superintendent Marshall has been involved in

       the policing of the 1988 F.A. Cup semi-final

       match         and     many     first          division     football

       league matches involving Sheffield Wednesday

       at Hillsborough.




                                            8
1.17    'FI'         Sub-Division               is         commanded       by     a

        Superintendent              who          is         responsible         to

        Superintendent                   Marshall                 and      Chief

        Superintendent              Duckenfield.                  The    present

        sub-divisonal              commander           is     Superintendent

        Bernard        Murray who took up the post on 14th

        March        1988.          Like        Mr Marshall he has had

        experience           of     one        previous F.A. Cup semi­

        final        event at Hillsborough,                   in April 1988,

        but     has     regularly              been        involved       in    the

        policing              arrangements                   at         Sheffield

        Wednesday's first division home games.



1.18    'F'     Division           is     normally           policed       by 299

        officers,            131         stationed            at    'FI'       Sub-

        Division.



1.19    In     addition to the territorial divisions of

        the     Force there are also police departments

        such     as Operations and traffic which have a

        functional            responsibility.                       Operations

        Division Controls the deployment of officers

        in     Dog     Section, Mounted Section, and other

        operational           support staff.                 The Division is

        commanded            by         Chief        Superintendent            John

        Arthur Nesbit QPM, who is responsible to the

        ACC,    (Operations).



1.2 0   Whilst        Operations           Division has a Forcewide

        responsibility                   for         the      provision          of



                                                 9
operational          support        services,    the    direct

policing        arrangements          for   major      sporting

events         are     usually        retained      under   the

control        of the Division hosting the event.

This     was     the       case     in respect of the F.A.

Challenge            Cup          semi-final        match    at

Hillsborough on 15th April 1989.

       walkway          which runs the entire length of the

       stand           (in         between              the lower            and      upper

       levels)         to gain             access               to     the    uncovered

     2.40   These         terraces      are accessed via turnstiles

            9-16      and        A-G    in Leppings          Lane.    As    with

Toilet        facilities           are available in each of

the     two enclosures referred to at paragraph

2.37 and refreshments in the South enclosure

only.            There        are       neither    toilets    nor

refreshment            facilities           in    the   terraces

themselves.



The      terraces         are           divided     into      five

sections         and     have       a     total    capacity     of

1 0 ,10 0 .



For     reference        it     should       be noted that in

studying        photographs of the terracing taken

from     the pitch the gate marked '3' leads to

the Centre South pen and the gate marked '4'

to the Centre North pen.



The division between the North West terraces

and the North Pen is by crush barriers and a                         26 and 30

raised        concrete area where the elevation of

the North West Pen commences.

2.49   For     this match the Leppings Lane end of the

       ground        was         given        over         to      Tottenham

       supporters.               There        were         problems         with

       packing the terraces on that day, supporters

       being       reluctant        to      fill the centre of the

       terraced           enclosure.                This        problem      was

       exacerbated          by     the      late      arrival          of many

       spectators          who     were still making their way

       into the ground when Tottenham scored a goal

       in    the     third        minute.            There was a surge

       forward       which        caused crushing and injuries

       at      the        front        of     the     terracing.             The

       emergency          exit     gates       which give access to

       the     perimeter          track       were     used to release

       spectators from the front of the terrace and

       to      redistribute             them        elsewhere          in    the

       ground.



2.50   The     police       felt       that     the       Leppings          Lane

       terraces required divided enclosures so that

       spectators          were    not packed in such a solid

       mass.         It     was suggested, in a letter from

       the     Chief       Constable to Sheffield Wednesday

       Football           Club,        dated        5th         June        1981

       (available           as     SYP        Document 5), that the

       Safety      at       Sports          Grounds        Committee          of

       the South Yorkshire               County       Council          should

                                                                                   Number

       visit         the     Leppings                Lane    terraces       with

       a     view      to recommending measures to prevent

       a     repeat of the                problems          encountered       on

       11th         April 1981.



2.51   It      is     worthy of note that this letter also

       expressed            the        view that the accepted crowd

       capacity            of 10,100 at Leppings Lane terrace

       offered no safety margin.                       Such concerns had

       previously           been        passed        to Mr England, the

       Club         secretary,           in a telephone conversation

       with         Chief          Superintendent                Herold      who

       suggested that "... our (the South Yorkshire

       Police)         consensus              view    is that the 10,100

       crowd          figure           specified            in    the     safety

       certificate                is     too     high."          The response

       of     the     Club        was         that    the    terraces       had

       previously accommodated 11,100 spectators at

       all     ticket        matches.                The report of Chief

       Superintendent                  Herold,         dated       30th April

       1981, is available as SYP Document 6 .



2.52   The     South Yorkshire County Council reported

       in    September 1981 (correspondence available

       as SYP        Document            7)      with       proposals       for

       the     erection            of         barriers       on     the    West

       Terrace.            These         were erected             later    that

       year,        and     created           the     divided pens which

       exist today.

2.53    These        pens        were then also of assistance in

        segregation              of     opposing              supporters.        The

        Leppings            Lane            end     of        the    stadium     has

        traditionally                 been        used        for accommodating

         'away7 supporters. In the past, however, the

        seating           enclosure           and terracing was shared

       ' with         season                ticket             holding       'home7

        supporters.                   There has grown, over time, a

        need         at      football               grounds           for      total

        segregation              of 'home7 and 'away' supporters

        and     the        barriers           ensured that segregation

        could        be achieved by creating separate pens

        for each element. This reason for having the

        segregated           pens           disappeared             in the 'close

        season7        of        1987        when        the newly appointed

        Football           Club        PLC,       Graham McKrell, at the

        request        of        the        police,           re-allocated      the

        season ticket holders from the West Stand to

        other        parts of the ground.                       Since that time

        the         West     Stand          and      terraces         have     been

        reserved           for        the     use        of     away supporters

the    stewards            meeting which was held at the

Hillsborough                Stadium          gymnasium.               (SYP

spectators            and        the         packing       of     these

terracing       is         primarily         their function and

not a police one.



The    historical           background          to the Leppings

Lane turnstiles is as follows.



During       the early 19807s both the West stand

and    terraces           were     exclusively utilised by

away supporters.



In    1984     Sheffield           Wednesday Football Club

returned       to        first     division          football         and

increased       attendances made it necessary for

the     club         to         make    provision          for    home

supporters          to     share       the    West     Stand          and

terrace area facilities.
                                                                                   Photograph

                                                                                   Number
     2.58    It     was     drawn           to     the clubs attention that

             mixed        use     would cause problems with regard

             to segregating opposing fans as they entered

             the        Stadium.             Inspector Clive Calvert was

             the        Football        Liaison       Officer at that time

             and         brought            this    potential     problem     to

             attention.



     2.59    At that time the entrances to the West Stand

             consisted           of     a     crescent    shaped     bank     of

             turnstiles               occupying       basically    the      same

             position           as they do now but were numbered 1

             to     18.          Five turnstiles numbered 19 to 23

             occupied        the       same        position as the current

             turnstiles 'A ' to 'G'.



     2 .60   As     a     result       of the representation made by

             the        police,       the bank of turnstiles 1 to 18

             were        reduced       to their current numbers 1 to

             16.          Turnstiles 19 to 23 were increased by

             two and renamed 'A' to ' G f .



     2 .61   At     the same time current gate 'B' was moved

             outwards        from       a line extending between the



l»           old turnstiles 18 and 19.

           fencing     extending           from     turnstile     16   to

        Leppings        Lane           perimeter      gates     was    re­

       positioned           and     clad        to its present state.

       Additionally, the interior wall dividing the

       West      stand enclosures between the two banks

       of     turnstiles          was constructed.            Previously

       segregation          at that point had been achieved

       by     movable       crash barriers manned by police

       officers.



2.63   These          alterations                facilitated      total

       segregation          at      the        turnstiles, enclosures

       and in the stand and terraces.

       is available as SYP Document 9.



       PERIMETER TRACK

2.64   There     is     a     low        boundary wall between the

       North     Stand        and        the    perimeter     track but

       this     increases           to    head height directly in

       front     of     the       area     designated       for use by

       disabled persons.



2.65   A     small    gate is sited in the boundary wall

       directly in front of the aisle giving access

       to     gangway       'A'     in     the North Stand (lower

       level - West e n d ) .

                                                                         Number


2 .66    There      is     a     low boundary wall       between the

         South      Stand        and the perimeter track.         This

         is     broken in the centre providing access to

        and egress from the players tunnel.



2.67    Additionally, a low metal gate is sited at a

        point       where the South Stand meets the Spion

        Kop, giving access to the South Stand (lower

        level - East e n d ) .



2 .68   The     boundary         between the Spion Kop and the

        perimeter          track is maintained by high metal

        fencing.            This fencing has 6 access/egress

        gates       which        are served     by   a   hinged and

        spring loaded bar.



        Leppings Lane Terraces

2 .69   The      boundary         between      the   Leppings     Lane

        terraces           and     the      perimeter     track     is

        delineated by a low concrete wall surrounded

        by    high       wire     fencing.      This fencing has 7

        access/egress            gates    each approximetely one

        metre       wide       which are secured by hinged and

        spring       loaded       bars.   Six    of the gates are

        situate       in       the section of fencing parallel

        to    the    terracing to the west of the ground

                                                                        Number
        and the seventh in the fencing giving access

        to     the North West elevated section adjacent

        to the North Stand.



2.70   Whilst        these     gates     open outwards onto the

       track at ground level, there is a difference

        in     level    at     the point where the terracing

       meets      the       perimeter       track    fencing on the

       supporters           side.    The terracing drops below

       the level of the playing area with the first

        (lowest)        step        being      deeper     than   the

       remainder        so     that there is a 'well' on the

       spectators           side of the perimeter wall.          The

       depth     of     the     'well'      varies from North to

       South     and        is greater at the North end. The

       perimeter        track gates will open only to 90°

       due     to support stanchions on the track side

       preventing           them     opening        further.     The

       location        of    gates and dimensions are shown

       in the photographs available as SYP Document

       10.

2.77   The     Club     has        a    facility to independently

       monitor the 97 turnstiles around the ground.

       In     the     Video        Room, which is situated near

       the     player's entrance on the South Stand of

       the     ground,        there       are     20     closed circuit

       television monitors, which are strategically

       placed          to          enable        continuous      visual

       monitoring             of         all      the     turnstiles.

       Additionally,           a       television monitor is able

       to     show     the     situation          in any part of the

       ground.           A    police           liaison    officer,   is

       situated in the Video Room.



2.78   A     computer facility is also installed which

       enables        continuous monitoring of the number

       of     persons passing through each turnstile.

       The     computer       is       equipped        with   a warning

       device        which    indicates          when     a particular

       part     of     the    Stadium is within 15% of full

       crowd capacity.

2.79   In    addition, 4 further       cameras serve 4 more

       screens       but these give a view to the clubs'

       internal office complex.



2.80   There     is     one   further    screen   which   is

       directly       linked to the police video cameras

       and     can    monitor the views available to the

       officers in the Police Control Room.

      recommendations             of the enquiry, and to urge

      a quick and constructive response.

 3.3    In    respect      of    the     police, Chief Officers

       were asked to,



        (a)       Consider how evacuation procedures at

                  individual           grounds could             be    best

                  incorporated          into police training to

                  form part of a pre-event briefing.



        (b)     Continue           provision               for     police

                certificates.



        (c)     Control         the     management          of     sports

                grounds          where       police        presence      is

                required          at     an        event     for      crowd

                control         within       the     ground,       and to

                consider the training of stewards and

                how best they could assist the police

                in evacuation.



       (d)      Consider         in collaboration with Local

                Authority              and         sports          ground

provisions            of the Sports Events (Control of

Alcohol) Act 1985.
As far as the police are concerned, this Act

This Act received Royal assent on the 15 May

1987 and contained five separate parts.

grounds             and     the          issuing     of      safety

               POLICING AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL STADIUM



       HISTORY

4 .1   Hillsborough          has    during       the past 15 years

       been     the    venue       for    semi     finals on eight

       occasions, as follows:

       1974      Burnley -v- Newcastle

       1975      Birmingham -v- Fulham

       1976      Derby -v- Manchester United

       1980      Arsenal -v- Liverpool

       1981      Tottenham -v- Wolverhampton Wanderers

       1987      Leeds -v- Coventry

       1988      Liverpool -v- Nottingham Forest

       1989      Liverpool -v- Nottingham Forest



       PLANNING - GENERAL

4.2    As     with    all     major events being policed in

       the     South Yorkshire area the responsibility

       for     planning       falls to the Commander of the

       Division       where     the event takes place.        The

       Assistant       Chief       Constable (Operations) has

       an    overall        responsibility and oversees the

       planning       of    these    events.         Hillsborough

       falls within 'F' Division.



4.3    in the planning of such events reference has

       to be made to the 'Standing Instructions for

       the    Policing of Football Matches' issued as



                                     52
a     Force       Policy document (SYP Document 11),

PLANNING 1988 SEMI FINAL

The     1988    semi final staged at Hillsborough

involved       Liverpool      and     Nottingham Forest.

Coincidentally,         the     1989     scheduled        Semi

Final    involved       the same clubs.          In view of

this     it     was     possible to          draw   on    the

experience of the previous             year and to make

particular       reference       to    the      Operational

Order prepared for the event in 1988 and the



                                54
Intelligence              Report prepared for that year.

The     two Operational Orders are available as

SYP Documents 13 and 14 (the latter of which

also     includes           Inspectors Briefing Notes to

the Operational Order).



The      1988        Intelligence              stated       that   when

Liverpool played at Tottenham 2000 Liverpool

fans     were        locked        out and ran riot outside

the     ground, stealing from shops and causing

public        annoyance.                For     this       reason, the

Serials        included           officers           giving    special

attention to shopping areas, to counter such

eventualities.                   This     contingency plan was

repeated in the 1989 Order.



The     planning           of     the     1988        semi final was

under     the        direction of the then Divisional

Commander,           Chief Superintendent Mole.                    This

officer       had         also     been        in     command of the

Division        the        previous           year     when the 1987

semi     final        between           Coventry and Leeds was

held     at     Hillsborough.                   The Deputy at 'F'

Division             in         1988      was         Superintendent

Marshall,        who        was        still the Deputy in 'F'

Division        in        1989.         Both        officers took an

active        part in the 1988 semi final, in that

Chief     Superintendent                 Mole        was    in overall

command        of the operation and Superintendent

Marshall        was        the Commander responsible for

policing the ground sector.
4.8     In     planning terms it is important to liaise

        with     all       interested parties, including the

        Football          Association,          The     Club,    Fire and

        Ambulance             Services,               The       Transport

        Representatives             and Traffic Management.             In

        addition          there     is    continuous liaison with

        other        Divisions      of     the        Force who will be

        affected          by the operation, and with support

        services             such           as          catering       and

        administration.



4.9    On      9th    August 1988, Superintendent Murray,

        'FI' Sub Divisional Commander, had a meeting

        with     the Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer, Mr

        Hopkins,          Assistant       Chief Ambulance Officer

        (Operations)           Mr         Jones,        of      the South

        Yorkshire         Ambulance        Service       and Assistant

        Divisional         Officer,        Mr    Rowlands,        of   the

       South     Yorkshire          Fire Service.             The purpose

       of the meeting was to further liaison                        in the

       event     of       a major        disaster occurring at the

       Sheffield          Wednesday        Football          Club Ground.

       The     report       of this meeting is available as

       SYP Document 15.



4.10   Because       of     the manner in which semi finals

       are     determined,          there is often little time

       to    plan      these      operations.           The usual time




                                           56
period        is     3 - 4       weeks.        In view of this it

is     essential           that early action is taken to

determine           the     manpower           level        required to

police        the     Stadium           and this is one of the

first priorities in planning.



Following           consultation              with all interested

parties,            the         examination            of     available

intelligence              and     the     drawing           together of

experience           of policing other similar events

the     manpower           level        for    policing the 1988

semi final inside and outside the ground was

determined and set at 928 officers.



In     the     course        of a de-brief following the

1988      match, certain aspects were identified

which        may    have        a bearing on future events

and     these       were        noted.        The de-brief notes

are     available          as      SYP    Document           16.   Some

resources          were under employed in and around

the      ground,           particularly           in        peripheral

areas.       Much     of this was as a result of the

general       change         in policy for policing Semi

Finals        in      that            during     normal        matches

officers are used for more than one role and

are    moved to different locations during the

various phases of the match.                      In the case of

Semi     Finals       it        was     decided        all officers

would be allocated a specific task and would
       remain         with        that        task       throughout      the

       operation,           the    intention          being     to ensure

       that        the police had control both inside and

       outside        the ground throughout the operation

       in     an     effort       to     thwart those individuals

       intent        on causing disorder or attempting to

       enter        the     ground      without          tickets.       This

       policy       was        found    to     be     sound in that it

       prevented            anticipated             roaming     gangs     of

       disappointed              supporters          causing    disorder

       during       the        match.     However, as stated, the

       levels       of      officers         available was found to

       be    excessive, particularly at the Liverpool

       end     of     the       Stadium      where       this   type     of

       activity          had been expected as a consequence

       of      their           reputation          and     considerable

       following          of     supporters. Additionally, the

       number       of     CID     officers outside the ground

       was found to have been excessive.



       SEGREGATION - STRATEGY AND REASONS

4.13   The     main       arterial roads (A61 and A616) and

       the     exits       from    the Ml motorway (junctions

       36,     3 5A and 35) for traffic travelling from

       the     north,       all     feed the north side of the

       ground.           Similarly, the main arterial roads

       (A616       and    A57) and the motorway exits (29,




                                             5.8
        30,    31      and 34) for traffic travelling from

       the     south,         all     feed the south side of the

       ground.          The         natural       arrival    routes    of

       supporters        therefore              lend    themselves to a

       Middlewood Road and Halifax Road approach to

       the     ground         from Liverpool and Herries Road

       or Penistone Road approach from Nottingham.



4.14    The      area     within          the     ground having       the

       largest capacities are the Spion Kop (21000)

       and     the     West     Stand           and Terraces (14565).

       The     former     is        accessed via Penistone Road

       North     turnstiles           and       South Stand car park

       turnstiles        and the latter via Leppings Lane

       turnstiles.



4.15    With     natural        approach          routes in mind,     the

       Spion     Kop lends itself to Nottingham Forest

       supporters         with            the      West    Stand      and

  .    Terraces to the Liverpool supporters.



4.16   Giving       priority to segregation and the fact

       that      Nottingham               Forest       supporters   will

       utilise       South Stand car park turnstiles for

       the     Spion     Kop,        it    logically follows that

       they     should        also occupy the South Stand as

       turnstiles        to     that       area        are also in that

       location.



                                            59
4.17   The    North     Stand is accessed via turnstiles

       both     in    Leppings    Lane    and Penistone Road

       North,        therefore     by    closing       those   in

       Penistone       Road   North,     the    stand could be

       used     by    Liverpool   supporters          and optimum

       segregation maintained.



4.18   This     division of the ground resulted in the

       combined      capacities    for the two segregated

       areas being:-

       LIVERPOOL

       West Stand                              4465

       Leppings Lane Terraces              10100

       North Stand                             9705



                                           24270



       NOTTINGHAM

       Spion Kop                           21000
       South Stand                             8834



                                           29834



4.19   The decision to segregate was made in accord

       with   the     recommendations of the Popplewell

       Report, Appendix 'E' - 'Working group on the

       Green Guide', recommendation 57.



                                    60
4.20   The     areas    were       therefore allocated on the

       basis      stated          in     paragraph           4.19.           Any

       alteration       would          have resulted in opposing

       fans       crossing              each        other       therefore

       increasing the likelihood of disorder and in

       addition        excessive           disruption              to        the

       residents       of       Sheffield        and     traffic choas

       both       before          and      after         the         event.

       The     segregation                     plan      attracted some

       criticism from both Liverpool supporters and

       Liverpool           Football        Club,         in        that,       of

       necessity,          it    meant     that        Liverpool had a

       smaller         allocation               of      tickets              than

       Nottingham.                Nevertheless,               as        stated

       earlier,        the       1988event       went off without

       difficulty          and    was considered a successful

       operation.



       PLANNING 1989 SEMI FINAL

4.21   On     20th     March       1989,       the     South Yorkshire

       Police        were again approached with a view to

       the      Semi         Final        being         staged          at    the

       Hillsborough             Ground     on         15th April         1989,

       coincidentally             with     the        same    teams being

       involved.             Bearing       in        mind the previous

       years experience, Chief Superintendent Mole,

        'F'    Divisional          Commander,          agreed that the

       event     could          be staged on the same basis as

       1988.         The        same      segregation              plan       was



                                               61
        intended and this brought a protest, via the

       Football          Association,                  from      Liverpool

       Football        Club.         The same arguments as the

       previous        year     pertained          and        the Football

       Association were advised that the game could

       be     staged,     but       on     the    same terms as the

       previous        year.         After       consideration              the

       Football Association decided that they would

       stage       the event at Hillsborough under these

       conditions.



4.22   An initial meeting of all interested parties

       took     place at Hammerton Road Police Station

       on     Wednesday        22nd March 1989.               The meeting

       was chaired by Chief Superintendent Mole but

       he    was      accompanied          by then Superintendent

       Duckenfield,          who     was    to     be     promoted           on

       Monday 27th March 1989 and assume command of

       'F'     Division.           Also present at the meeting

       were Superintendent Marshall, Superintendent

       Murray,          Superintendent                  Chapman             and

       Superintendent               Greenwood,                who          were

       identified       as the sector Commanders for the

       match     on    the     15th April 1989.                The sector

       Commanders            were        selected              by      Chief

       Superintendent          Mole due to their experience

       in      policing        football           matches            and     in

       particular their previous involvement at the

       Hillsborough        Stadium.              All     the        officers



                                            62
        concerned had been involved in the 1988 Semi

        Final.      In general they were given the same

        command    positions             with        the      exception         of

       Superintendent              Marshall          and Superintendent

       Greenwood,        whose        roles          were reversed.             In

       1988      Superintendent               Marshall         had been the

       Ground       Commander                 and          Superintendent

       Greenwood         had         been       in       command        of     the

       Leppings Lane end of the Stadium.



4.23   In     addition        to     the Sector Commanders each

       Superintendent              was        allocated             2        Chief

       Inspectors        as        Sub Sector Commanders. Again

       these     officers          were specially selected for

       their     knowledge of policing football and in

       particular             their           knowledge              of       the

       Hillsborough           Stadium.                   At   the       meeting

       discussions once again took place concerning

       the    allocation           of areas to supporters but,

       for the reasons previously explained, it was

       agreed that the allocations should be as the

       previous     year.          In dealing with this aspect

       consideration           had        to        be     given        to    the

       intelligence           then        available            as       to    the

       current     attitude of the fans from Liverpool

       and Nottingham.             In both cases the behaviour

       during     the    season had been relatively good

       in    respect     of both sets of supporters with

       the    exception        of     the       tendency            for pitch

                                         63
           invasion           in    the    case    of   the     Nottingham

           supporters.



    4.24   There        was     a    pitch      invasion      by Liverpool

           supporters at the end of the 1988 semi final

           and     for        this reason contingency plans were

           written into the 1989 serial instructions to

           increase the manpower on the perimeter track

           at 'full t i m e '.



    4.25   A     particular area of concern at the meeting

           was the method of travel adopted by visiting

           supporters and experience indicated that the

           use      of       trains       and    particularly     special

           trains was diminishing.                 It was felt in this

           connection          that       supporters      knew that when

           travelling          by     special trains they would be

           met     by    police          resources,     escorted to the

           Stadium and made to enter straight away.                     It

           is    clear        that this is the greatest form of

           control       on        those spectators and to a large

           extent       prevents hooliganism.              In past years

           the use of trains has been more predominant.

           This is somewhat important particularly with

           regard       to     the Liverpool supporters to whom

           the     Wadsley          Bridge      Railway Station on the

           north     side of the ground is made available.

*          The      number          of       supporters       using   this

           facility,          the number of trains and times of



                                                  64
       trains        were     not       known      at     this       planning

       stage.



4.26   Subsequent           planning          meetings         under     the

       chairmanship               of         Chief        Superintendent

       Duckenfield          took        place      on     the 29th March

       1989     and        10th     April        1989.         The     actual

       planning       team        who prepared the Operational

       Order comprised Superintendent Murray, Chief

       Inspector       Beal        and       Inspector Sewell under

       the      supervision             of   Chief        Superintendent

       Duckenfield.



       MANPOWER

4.27   In     view    of     the       need to urgently identify

       manpower       requirements the task was embarked

       upon     taking       into        account         the     following

       areas:-



       i)       The        need        for   a     level       of manpower

                 capable          of    policing         the     match and

                 maintaining public order

       ii)      The        experience         of the previous year

                 and any lessons learned

       iii)     The          responsibility               of      ensuring

                 effective and efficient policing

       iv)      The    cost of the operation




                                              65
4.28   In   the    light of all       these aspects manpower

       requirements         were identified     and    the

       necessary        manpower     level was determined to

       be   801     officers representing approximately

       27% of     the     entire      South Yorkshire Police

       Force.



4.29   The total        deployment    of    officers   of all

       ranks      in the various roles for 1989 were as

       follows:-

 4.30    The     manpower          referred       to        in   this report

         involves           that      utilized         in    policing         the

         actual       events         at     Hillsborough          under       the

         command       of      the        Divisional Officer.               There

        were         also      officers         deployed         to    Traffic

         Control       duties and officers deployed in the

         city        centre.              These       officers        work     to

        separate         Operational Orders prepared by the

        Commanders          of Operations and Traffic and of

         'D'    Division respectively (SYP Documents 17

        and       18).            Allocated           manpower        was    154

        officers and 167 officers respectively.



4.31    Taking       into      account          the     three aspects of

        policing         the      total      manpower available for

        deployment          was      1122 being just over 38% of

        the South Yorkshire Police.



4. 32   The     three areas of command maintain contact

        through        radio       and land line communications

        in     order     to       cater      for flexibility in re­

        deployment .



4. 33   An     example       of      the flexibility of the plan

        can     be    drawn from the fact that in the 'D'

        Division       Order         officers         are    allocated to

        escort       duties of public transport vehicles,



                                           70
        travelling          from the Midland Station to the

        Hillsborough         ground,             and       a contingency is

        incorporated         for          those arriving at 2.45 pm

        to remain at the Hillsborough Stadium in the

        Gymnasium           as       a        standby           reserve         for

        deployment          as and            when     required.            This

       contingency           was adopted                   in    1988     and   on

       completion           of the            match        the officers are

       again       used      for escort                duties back to the

       railway          station          in    the         city    centre. The

       same        contingency                plan        was     incorporated

       in the 1989 Order.



4.34   The     method      of        raising manpower for events

       such        as      the Semi            Final       and     all     other

       operational          matters                 within        the      South

       Yorkshire         Police          area        is     based on policy

       which       reflects that the Division upon which

       the     event      is to take place should identify

  •    the     manpower         it        can raise and then inform

       Operations         Division             at     Force Headquarters

       of     that        additional                 manpower       which       is

       required.           The additional manpower is then

       raised       from across the Force area from duty

       and    off       duty time officers and is notified

       to    the    host     Division                for    allocation          of

       duties.




                                                71
4.35    In    view of the fact that Hillsborough hosts

       First Division Football Matches on a regular

       basis,       the vast majority of officers in the

       Force       have        at    some       time     or another been

       involved          in    policing at the Ground.               Every

       effort       is        made to ensure that officers are

       deployed          to those areas with which they are

       familiar          or if they have not been regularly

       involved          are     deployed on duties where they

       may       take     up a static point and carry out a

       specific          role.            The    actual deployment of

       officers         was undertaken by the Control                 Room

       Commander              Superintendent Murray            and     his

       Deputy Chief Inspector Beal, assisted by the

       Support          Inspector, Inspector Sewell.                 These

       officers         all      have experience of deployment

       of     manpower at Hillsborough Stadium and can

       recognise         those individuals with particular

       knowledge.             The manpower provided to police

       such      events        reflects          the     general age and

       experience         of        the    Force and deployment is

       based      upon        Serials       under the command of a

       Sergeant         with 5, 6, 8 or 10 officers at his

       disposal.          The        experience           amongst    these

       officers         ranges       across the board from none

       to    a    vast        experience             of policing similar

       events.




                                                72
       SEGREGATION - ADDITIONAL FACTORS



4.36   In     connection           with segregation much effort

       was     put       into the total segregation of fans

       working        on       the North/South divide.                     In the

       first         place,        as       indicated,             the    command

       structure           was based upon this segregation.

       In     addition as in 1988 through liaison with

       the     FA     and        the     Club,         it was agreed thet

       Sectors        of       the North Stand adjacent to the

       Kop     and       the     South           Stand          adjacent to the

       Leppings Lane Terraces would be reserved for

       neutral supporters in the form of FA Members

       and     their        club        representatives.                 This was

       intended to act as a buffer between opposing

       fans     who      were likely to come into conflict

       at     those        two     locations.                   Furthermore, to

       prevent        throwing          between             opposing       fans a

       fine net was erected on the end of the North

       Stand          adjacent              to        the        Kop      through

       consultation with the club.



4.37   The     number       of     turnstiles giving access to

       the North Stand was reduced as a consequence

       of    the     closure           of    the           12    turnstiles in

       Penistone         Road      North.              For the purpose of

       segregation          these        were          not utilized in an

       effort       to     prevent          clashes             between    rival

       supporters.               Entrance             to    the North Stand



                                                 73
       was,        therefore,                     via        Leppings            Lane,

       turnstiles           1-10.               Normally,        Leppings Lane

       access      to the North Stand is via turnstiles

       1-8.       It was a club decision in hosting the

       Semi      Final to allocate two extra turnstiles

       to      compensate               for        the       loss     of     twelve

       turnstiles           in     Penistone              Road       North.          A

       further         means            of         segregation          was       the

       introduction               of        a     sterile        area       in    the

       service         road            behind            the        South     Stand

       extending from the Leppings Lane terraces to

       the Police Control Box.



4.38   This     was     done           in       1988     and was effective

       in     ensuring           that        Liverpool supporters did

       not     have the ability to confront Nottingham

       supporters in the South Stand area.



4.39   A further point which had been identified in

  -    1987 at the match between                        Coventry and Leeds

       concerned            the        housing          of     lost     property

       offices.             In     1987          the     property had been

       taken to the gymnasium from all areas of the

       ground,         consequently                    resulting        in       some

       difficulty                and            confrontation              between

       opposing        fans       when           they     went       to collect

       their     property              after       the match.           In 1988,

       and     again        in     1989, arrangements were made

       with    the      club           for       property        stores to be

       utilized        at     both ends of the Stadium.                           For



                                                  74
the        Liverpool          supporters          a portacabin was

erected          in     the West Stand enclosure whilst

Nottingham             Forest supporters were allocated

the        souvenir          shop situate behind the Spion

Kop.          With          the     agreement of the club the

gymnasium              was         identified       as    being     the

logistical centre for operations in that the

allocation             of     radios       and     other equipment

would       be       dealt         with    at     that    location.

Additionally,                the     gymnasium was identified

as     a    venue           for     lost       children    or     other

messages             which         had to be responded to by

visitors to the Stadium.



Particular             emphasis          was    placed     upon    the

accommodation               and     separation         of vehicular

traffic          for       both sets of supporters.               Some

supporters             travel       by     rail, some by coach,

mini       bus and their own modes of transport.

In     view      of this arrangements were made for

'special              trains'             carrying         Liverpool

supporters            to     be brought to Wadsley Bridge

Station,         a     station        which is only used for

football             supporters.                 For      Nottingham

supporters            the     trains were scheduled to go

into       the    Midland           Station in the centre of

Sheffield.            Contingency plans were also made

to     deal      with Liverpool supporters arriving

at Midland Station on scheduled trains.
           They        were     to     go by public transport buses

           direct from the station to the Leppings Lane

           end     of     the        ground.      So far as coaches are

           concerned,           the     coaches from Liverpool were

           to     be     accommodated            at        the    North     of the

           Stadium        in Claywheels Lane and Halifax Road

           and     the        coaches from Nottingham in Herries

           Road.         Mini         buses      and       private cars were

           likewise        accommodated               in    the        North/South

           divide.



    4.41   These       plans were identical to those for the

           1988     Semi       Final       and    would have the added

           advantage          of      ensuring         that supporters who

           had     attended          the      previous           year    would be

           familiar with the arrangements.



           TICKETS

    4.42   Previous experience regarding the allocation

           of     tickets had indicated some difficulties,

           both     in    the        identification               of    the areas

           where       ticket        holders      should attend and in

           respect       of     forgery.          Efforts were made to

           combat       both these problems.                     In relation to

           forgeries,              special       material was used for

           printing       so       that    they        could       quickly     be

           identified.               The tickets were colour coded
P

                                           76
        and      over           printed           with         Liverpool    or

        Nottingham             dependent upon the area to which

        they     were          allocated.               This procedure had

        been     embarked             upon in 1988, but at the de­

        brief       for        that     match it was felt that the

        colour        coding          was not prominent enough and

        was     not       linked        to a colour code system at

        the     turnstiles.             In 1989, the club arranged

        for     the       colour code to be made much bolder

        and     respective             colours          were     shown at the

        turnstiles             where        those       tickets     should be

        surrendered.



4.43   Additionally,                 tickets for the Spion Kop and

        Leppings           Lane        Terraces          were     overprinted

       showing            'Nottingham                 Forest      area'    and

        'Liverpool             area'        respectively.            This was

       done     to        try        and overcome the difficulties

       ■experienced             in     the       1988     Semi     Final when

       Liverpool           supporters             purchased        Spion   Kop

       tickets,           gained        access, claiming ignorance

       of     the fact that they had purchased tickets

       for     the 'wrong end' and created segregation

       problems.



4.44   On     the        Spion        Kop    near to the North Stand

       there        is     a        small area with limited access

       which        can        be    used        to     isolate    Liverpool

       supporters                    from             Nottingham      Forest



                                            77
       supporters.             This contingency plan was put

       into     effect     utilizing          police       officers to

       ensure segregation between the two.



4.45   A     similar contingency plan for the Leppings

       Lane      Terraces        in     respect       of    Nottingham

       Forest     supporters           is    not    viable        because

       there      is      no      natural          small        area   for

       segregation.



4.46   It    will be noted that the rear of each Semi

       Final     ticket        requests that supporters take

       up    position     15     minutes        before          kick off.

       Publicity circulated both locally and to the

       Liverpool and Nottingham areas (available as

       SYP     Document        19)     asks supporters to time

       their       journey             to          arrive        between

       10.30 am. and 2.00 pm.



       NON TICKET HOLDERS



4.47   Whilst      the      colour           coding        of    tickets

       described       at paragraph 4.42 was intended to

       expedite     entry       into        the Stadium, there is

       always     the possibility as in previous years

       of spectators attending without tickets.                        To

       this end such persons loitering in the

       immediate vicinity of the ground, after kick

       off, would be collected together and, in the




                                  78
        case        of Liverpool supporters, taken to Coal

        Road,        an     area       adjacent    to Wadsley Bridge

        Station           dispersal or to await for transport

        after the match.               Nottingham supporters were

       to      be     taken to Hillsborough Park where the

^      same procedure would apply.



4.48   This         course       was    intended to deal with the

       nuisance            problem         caused        by     non-ticket

       holders         loitering          in     the area whilst the

       game was in progress.                   In 1988, whilst there

       were      a number who attended without tickets,

       the      number       was not excessive and they were

       simply dispersed from the area.



4.49   All     ticket games have been discussed in the

       past     at        pre—season meetings held each year

       between             Senior        Officers        of     the   South

       Yorkshire           Police        and     the club        officials

       (usually            the     Secretary       and        Chairman   or

       Representative Director).



4.50   At one of their meetings held on the 24 July

       1987,        the club representative asked whether

       or    not the police would permit entry to non

       ticket holders rather than have them milling

       about        the     streets around the ground.                They

       were told that entry would not be allowed as



                                            79
       the     long   term effect would be to encourage

       non      ticket          holders         to   travel      in    the

       knowledge that they would be admitted.



       PUBLICITY

4.51   During     planning            stages     it was agreed that

       the     information concerning the arrangements

       for      the   match           would     be   promulgated        to

       supporters        through         the     media      and through

       their      club      programmes.              This      task    was

       undertaken          by     the       Football      Intelligence

       Office     under         the     directions        of the Chief

       Superintendent             (Operations            and     Traffic

       Division).           Emphasis           was made on the need

       for     supporters         to attend in good time and,

       to     accommodate this, arrangements were made

       with the club for turnstiles to be opened at

       12     noon,   that is 3 hours before kick off.

       Detective         Superintendent              McKay      made     a

  *    broadcast      on    Radio Merseyside on Friday 14

       April     1989,     stressing           that as this was an

       all     ticket match, non ticket holders should

       not attend.



       COMMUNICATIONS



4.52   In     terms   of communication the ground has a

       base     station     which           can operate on UHF for




                                       80
       all     officers employed on duty in connection

       with      the event.             The Control Room was under

       the      command            of     Superintendent         Murray,

       assisted        by a Sergeant            and 2 Constables all

       with      previous Control                 Box experience. In

       addition             to     the UHF      facility,        the    VHF

       traffic          channels are           monitored          at that

       location.             The        police     officers      in     the

       Control Box also have landline facilities to

       the     club, Hammerton Road Police Station and

       a     direct outside line.                The club have their

       own       personal          radio        system     for    use by

       stewards. The          Police           Control      staff link

       into     this        by way of one of the clubs radio

       sets.           The       Police       Control    Room     has     a

       facility        to     over-ride          the    grounds public

       address system.



4.53   In      order        that        communications           can    be

       maintained           each    Supervisory Officer of the

       rank     of      Sergeant and            above was allocated

       a    personal         radio.          Radio checks were made

       prior to the commencement of the operation.

        EMERGENCY EVACUATION

4.55   At      all sporting events emergency evacuation

       procedures                 are        essential               and,       at

       Hillsbrough,           these are tested on a regular

       basis.          The        procedures            have in fact been

       tested        twice during this season, on the 1st

       February        1989 at the Symod Cup Match and on

       the      18      February              1989           when        Sheffield

       Wednesday            played              Southampton.                   The

       procedures         were          found      be        effective.         In

       accordance         with          the     guidance contained in

       the     Guide to      Safety at Sports Grounds                          the

       management            of     the club         are           required     to

       consult       with       the       Fire Authority regarding

       the       suitability                  of         the         evacuation

       procedures.                Details          of        the     evacuation

       procedures         are      included             in     the Operation

       Order     (SYP       Document           14) and are issued to

       all     Supervisory          Officers            of         the    rank of

       Sergeant and above.



4.56   In    brief,     the        plan        requires,            on     a pre­

       arranged        signal, officers being deployed to

       gates,     gangways          and doors in readiness for

       evacuation and specific officers are briefed

       prior to the event on their function. Should

       it be necessary to implement evacuation then

       instructions,          particular             to the problem in

       hand,     are    given           to    officers             through the



                                              82
        Police       Control          Box.            In essence, the plan

        caters       for       egress        into           identifiable safe

        areas       of     the       ground such as the pitch and

        enclosures         behind           each       of     the respective

       stands.                 These        plans       are        arranged     in

       consultation                  with        the         Fire        Service,

       Ambulance           Service,              Club         Officials       and

       Stewards.



4.57   The     ground public address system is brought

       into     use to advise the crowd or sections of

       the      crowd           to        leave        the     Stadium       once

       contingency             plans have been formulated.                     It

       should       be mentioned that regular testing of

       this     system,          using       the        police          over-ride

       facility          revealed          that one of the speakers

       (adjacent          to     turnstile             73) was defective.

       It     has    taken repeated requests to the club

       to have this repaired, this being achieved a

       matter       of     weeks          before the Semi Final was

       scheduled to take place.



4.58   By     way    of     comparison                the     need       has been

       identified          in    the        past        for        a    system of

       speakers          actually outside the turnstiles in

       Leppings           Lane       to     enable           the       spectators

       awaiting          entry       to     be        addressed should be

       need     arise.           The        club        implemented          this

       change without undue delay.



                                                 83
       INTELLIGENCE

4.59   Whilst the majority of planning can be taken

       in     advance       of        the event, changes do occur

       and     the       role        of the Football Intelligence

       Officer           cannot        be     underestimated.             His

       liaison           with         the        clubs        involved    and

       assessment               of          background          information

       concerning          their behaviour is considered in

       depth and it can dictate the need for change

       to plans right up to kick off.



4.60   Additional          reference was made to the 'match

       summary7          (SYP        Document       20) completed         and

       submitted following the 1988 Semi Final.



4.61   In      terms       of        Intelligence, Liverpool              had

       played       at     Hillsborough             against       Sheffield

       Wednesday           Football          Club        on    Saturday    14

       January           1989.              On    that        occasion    the

       Liverpool          supporters totalled 6,100 and the

       home     supporters            25,424.        The total at the

       ground       was     therefore 31,524.                 The attitude

       of     all    supporters can best be described as

       good     and in fact there were only 4 arrests,

       all     involving          the visiting supporters from

       Liverpool, 2 being inside the ground and two

       outside the ground.                  In addition, there were

       29     ejections          from       the    ground       under     the
       Ground     Regulations,              25 being in connection

       with     home     supporters              and 4 being visitors

       from Liverpool.



4.62   In     terms     of transport,              it was noted that

       there were no special trains from Liverpool.

       On     scheduled service                 trains approximately

       900      attended        and        on     buses    and   coaches

       1,100.        Therefore,            some 4,100 travelled in

       their own transport.                The manpower committed

       to     policing          that            event     totalled     313

       officers.                An          Operational              Order

        (available       as SYP Document 21) was produced

       and    took      the     same format as at all league

       matches         staged         at        Sheffield    Wednesday

       Football Ground.



       ALCOHOL

4.63   The      role    of the        Divisional          Intelligence

       Officer     has    also        been enlarged to include

       liaison     with       licensees           in the area of the

       ground with a view to encouraging closure or

       the      operation        of        'selective       doors'     to

       prevent     clashes       of rival supporters inside

       the    premises.         This is done as a matter of

       course     for each match day and was also done

       pre Semi Final day.




                                            85
     4.64   Alcohol is not on sale to the general public

             inside       the        Stadium.          This is as a direct

            result        of    application            by    South Yorkshire

            Police        to         the     Licensing        Bench   of   the

            Sheffield Magistrates' Court.                      The effect of

«m          this        is that those wishing to drink have to


<•          do

            ground.
                   so    at     licensed

                               The
                                                  premises      outside

                                       police seek to control this,
                                                                           the



            utilizing           the         procedures         outlined     in

            paragraph 4.63.



     4.65   Consideration             was     given to applying to the

            Magistrates          Court        for      a Restriction Order

            under       Section        67 of the Licensing Act 1964

            as amended by Section 3 of the Licensing Act

            1988.         However           any   Restriction Order can

            only    specify           closure       between      2.30 pm and

            5.30 pm. As 'drinking up time' of 20 minutes

            would       result        in public houses closing only

            10    minutes        before       kick      off,     it   was not

            considered that a Restriction Order would be

            of any benefit.



            BRIEFING

     4.66   Following          the     arrangements for planning of

            any    major event it is essential that plans,

            and    the     policies determined, are explained

            to    all officers involved.                    To achieve this,

            briefings          are     arranged and, because of the



                                                  86
            wide         spread          of        people        involved      in    the

            operation,             it     was           decided       that briefings

            would        be    held           at        the    Stadium on the day

            prior to the event for officers of Inspector

            and     above          to     allow           them       to    familiarize

            themselves             with       the ground and surrounding

            locations.                  Prior       to        the     briefing, each

            Inspector is issued with relevant details of

            the      Order          and       specific              details    of    the

            Serials under his command (SYP Document 14).

            This     course          of action was followed in both

            1988 and 1989.



    4. 67   A     full    briefing took place at Hillsborough

            at 10.00 am on Friday 14 April 1989 and full

            details       of        the       plan        were discussed.            The

            briefing               was         undertaken                 by      Chief

            Superintendent                Duckenfield,                    followed    by

            Superintendent               Murray.               Sector Commanders

            briefed       all the Inspectors.                        Following that

            briefing,              arrangements                were        made      for

            officers          to     report for duty at the Stadium

            at 9.45 am on the day of the event.



            STEWARDS

■   4.68    On    each        match       day stewards are briefed by

            supervisory officers.

P
                                                   87
4.69   During      actual         games, at ad hoc meetings on

       other      than     match         days     and    at the annual

       briefing       of     stewards           held at the club and

       to     which      the police attend certain matters

       relating       to stewards have been raised.                 Two

       such     meetings          were     held     on the 15 and 23

       August     1988       and at those meetings stewards

       were     reminded          of     their duties.       A copy of

       'Instructions              for    Match     Day     Staff'   and

       'Instruction          to        Stewards' which are issued

       by the club are SYP Documents 22 and 23.



4.70   In     practice, the police have the ability to

       perform        some        stewarding            duties.      in

       particular,         Inspectors and above are issued

       with a key to the padlocks which either lock

       or fasten back spectator gates, all padlocks

       being identical and requiring the use of one

       'common k e y '.



       OTHER MATTERS

       Sunday Match



4.71   In    considering          the     possibility of staging

       the    Semi    Final        on a Sunday, the following

       applied:




                                          88
       (i)       The        Football           Association express a

                    wish     for       both     Semi         Finals        to     be

                    played        on    the     same         day     with        the

                    caveat         that        they          would    consider

                    changing            to         a     Sunday       if        live

       monitor        through          CCTV all the turnstiles at

       the stadium.           This monitoring is linked to a

       computerized           counting system and this has a

       warning        facility          when levels of supporters

       in the various sections of the Stadium reach

                      EMERGENCY CONTINGENCY PLANS



5.1   In     the event of any major disaster in their

      area South Yorkshire Police have contingency

      plans      contained           in     the      Major    Incident

      Manual     (SYP     Document          24) aimed at dealing

      with      all    aspects         of      the    results of the

      disaster being faced.



5.2   In       definition        the        major     incident       plan

      identifies a "major incident" as

                "a     serious            disruption         of   life,

                arising       with     little        or no warning,

                causing        or      threatening           death    or

                injury to numbers of people in excess

                of    those     that        can be dealt with by

                the    Public        Services operating under

                normal    conditions, and which require

                special mobilisation and organisation

                of those services."



5.3   The plan further outlines the objectives and

      states

                "it    is impossible to cater for every

               contingency          which      might     arise in a

               major     incident situation.                 The major

               incident       plan, therefore, contains a



                                          92
             basic format on which the response to

             all major incidents should be based.

             Whilst       setting     out basic principles

             and     responsibilities          to   be adhered

             to,     it   also      allows for flexibility

             and      initiative         in   the   prevailing

             circumstances".



5.4   The plan details full descriptions of action

      to be taken but specifically outlines police

      duties and responsibilities as follows

      1.     Prevent further danger.

      2.     Mobilise emergency services.

      3.     Command of incident.

      4.     Site control and security.

      5.     Off-site control.

      6.     Communications.

      7.     Casualties.

      8.     Logistics.

      9.     Investigation.

      10.    Reports.



5.5   Due to the fact that the disaster took place

      at an event which was already being policed,

      many   of     the     resources         and   facilities

      required     under the Major Incident Plan were

      already in being.      Examples of this refer to

      manpower,     first     aid     facilities,      police

      control point and communications.



                                    93
In addition to the Major Incident Plan there

is    a     facility        (Code     named   "Operations

Support")     to        raise     additional manpower in

the   event       of     emergency.       This   plan was

requested     at        3.06 pm and activated at 3.10

pm, resulting in 261 officers responding.               A

further     176        off-duty     officers volunteered

there services on hearing of the diaster.

          COMMUNICATIONS - F.A. CUP SEMI FINAL AT

                 HILLSBOROUGH ON 15 APRIL 1989



 INTRODUCTION

The       following         communication          arrangements

were      made        for   the     police     operation      at

Hillsborough           on    15th    April     1989     and the

subsequent emergency action.



--------------         of   the     Communications         staff

attended         a      planning          meeting     at     'F'

Divisional           Headquarters,         Hammerton Road on

the 22nd March 1989 to note the requirements

defined        by the Division and offer advice if

required.



RADIO



The     arrangements         for     radio     cover for the

match     were       the same as for all other games

at    Hillsborough          save     that     an    additional

facility was provided at Neepsend to control

CID     officers       working       on     crime prevention

duties.



Radio Cover

Radio     cover       for    the    Hillsborough ground,

for     both    internal and external patrols, is

provided        by     a    UHF     scheme    operating      on
channel 2 5 with the aerial on the floodlight

gantry        at     the        side    of the police control

room      inside          the    ground.      This gives radio

cover     over a radius of approximately 1 mile

from the ground.



The radio installation in the police control

room     is     permanent and used for all matches

at the ground.



Channel        25     is    one of 4 emergency channels

available            to     all        U.K.    police     forces

(channels           19:    23: 29 are the others) which

are     regularly used for controlling activity

at football grounds.                   It is a matter for the

force to control use to prevent interference

between        police       operations        working     on the

same channel.             There was nothing else taking

place     in-force          on 15th April 1989 to cause

interference.              Because of the hilly terrain

between the ground and adjacent police force

areas      interference                from    other     force's

communication is highly unlikely.                      There was

none reported on the day.



In    addition to the UHF scheme at the ground

channel        19 was used by CID officers working

on security duties in the designated parking

areas     at       Neepsend        and    Parson Cross.     The
aerial         for       this     is on Shirecliffe College

which         is     high       enough        to provide cover of

approximately                 3 miles radius which includes

Hillsborough.                  This     use     of    channel 19 is

similar to the arrangement in previous years

for semi-final matches.



Finally        the FI Sub-Division Regular Channel

35     was     available              to officers with the Pye

Multi-channel radios.



Radio Issue



Paragraph           4.11.4       of     the Operational Order

(available               as    SYP Document 14) identifies

radio        issue        to    all     supervisory        officers

on the detail.



On     the     morning          of     the     15th    April     1989

Communications                 Department            delivered    100

Burndept 3 channel radios, tuned to channels

19:     25:        29,    and 120 Pye PFX multi-channel

sets     to        the police room at the ground.                 In

addition,           36 earpieces were delivered which

would     fit either of the radio types.                       Spare

batteries were also provided, but no battery

chargers.



Allocation           and distribution of the sets and

earpieces was effected by
6.12   Two        radio      issue       books were used which are

       now             at         Headquarters               Communications

       Department.                 76    PFX     sets and 63 Burndept

       sets        are      shown       to have been issued.                Four

       earpieces            are     booked out to serial 21 (see

       operational               order).       More earpieces were in

       fact        taken for        use       because at 24.4.89 20

       were        still           outstanding              for    return    to

       Headquarters.



       Radio Equipment



6.13   There           is    a    permanent           UHF     radio    scheme

       installed            at    the        ground     for policing all

       football          matches.            This scheme was used for

       the F.A. Cup semi-final on 15th April 1989.



6.14   The radio set is provided by the Directorate

       of     Telecommunications                and referred to as a

       W15U portable base station.                          It is in fact a

       Pye Westminster Mobile radio adapted for use

       as     a    temporary            fixed    base station.           This

       type       of     installation is in frequent use at

       all        football         grounds        in the Force and by

       most        other          forces         who        have      similar

       requirements.                The set is powered by mains

       electricity           and        is    located        in the police

       control room.




                                               100
       Method of Operation



6.15   The     W15U     can       be operated in either 'talk-

       thro' or 'non talk-thro' mode by pressing or

       releasing        a     button    on the radio set.      The

       choice is with the radio control operator.



6.16   The     radio operator in the control room uses

       a     handset with a 'press to talk' switch and

       a      speaker       for    incoming     messages.      The

       installation         at     Hillsborough has a 'tulip'

       microphone which stands on the desk in front

       of      the     controller       and    an   in-car   radio

       speaker, also desk mounted.



6.17   It is normal practice at Hillsborough to use

       the UHF radio scheme on 'talk-thro' and this

       was     the case on the 15th April 1989.              Talk-

       thro'     is    also used at other grounds in the

       force for policing football matches.



6.18   Even     with    the       use   of    an earpiece, noise

       levels     in crowd situations, particularly in

       the confines of a football ground, can reach

       a level where the volume of the radio output

       is not sufficient for the user to be able to

       receive transmissions.




                                        101
       Effect of Talk-thro' Choices

       Talk-Thro' on



6.19   Everyone           with     a     radio,          turned     on to the

       appropriate                channel,               can       hear      all

       transmissions              by anyone else, including the

       control room.



6.20   If     more than one radio transmits at any one

       time     all        other        sets including the control

       room,        get     all        the     messages.          However, it

       becomes increasingly difficult to understand

       individual           messages           when       several officers

       are speaking.



6.21   If     the     controller              is     transmitting on the

       handset        and        one     of        the   personal         radios

       transmits at the same time, then the control

       output is cut off.                    All the users,         including

       the     controller,             will         receive       the message

       from     the       personal radio.                This arrangement

       is     electrically             built into the equipment.

       It     can     only       be     overcome          by de-selecting

       talk-thro'.



       Talk-Thro' Off



6.22   If      the        controller           transmits,          all     sets

       switched       on     to        the     channel will receive.



                                                102
6.23   A     message transmitted from a personal radio

       is only heard on the controllers set.



6.24   Whilst the controller is transmitting any of

       the     personal         radios     can     transmit and the

       message       will be received on the controllers

       set.        The    transmitting personal radio will

       not      receive         the    message      being    sent   by

       control.



       Radio Control Operational Order



6.25   Paragraph         4.11     of     the     operational    order

       (SYP     Document 14)           deals with radio control

       on the day.



6.26   In     connection        with paragraph 4.11.5 of the

       Operational        Order        transmissions        cannot be

       cut-off unless talk-thro'.is de-selected.



       Radio Equipment Supervision



6.27   One    member of Communications Department was

       on     stand-by at the ground from the briefing

       onwards.



6.28   At    the    request       of     the Division the Force

       Communications             caravan         and   Stonefield

       Communications            Vehicle         were   located     at

       Hillfoot             Bridge           on     Penistone       Road   and

       staffed         by        a     further          2 officers from the

       Department.                    A fourth member was on mobile

       patrol to deal with communication demands as

       they arose.



6.29   Activity            on     channel 19 and 25, and channel

       29,      which           was     being      used by West Bar for

       city       centre          football         crowd     policing      was

       monitored            in        the    communications caravan.

       Channel             25     was       monitored       in     the   Force

       Operations               Room by using a portable UHF set

       in         a        vehicle           adaptor,        without       any

       difficulty.



6.30   The      following             contingency          plans    were    in

       place in the event of equipment failure:-



            A     stand-by            base    station was located in

            the control room.                 This was in fact taken

             into use.



            The        mobile           Stonefield          Communications

            Vehicle             was     on    stand-by        at    Hillfoot

            Bridge.             If both base stations or aerial

            installation               at the ground fail then the

            vehicle         could take over.                It is equipped

            with       a    pump-up          aerial and base station

            and       would          restore communications on the



                                                  104
           same    UHF        channel        (25).         It would take

          about     10 minutes to bring into operation

          plus     the journey time to the ground.                    In

          the     pre-match           planning this year, as in

          previous        years,           decisions were made not

          to park the vehicle at the ground, whilst

          on stand-by, because of congestion.



          The     third        option available is to change

          the     ground        operation from channel 25 to

          channel        19     by        using the communications

          caravan     which           was     located       at Hillfoot

          Bridge.             This        would    mean that control

          could     either           be     from     the    caravan, or

          using      the           talk-thro'        by     the   police

          control     room           using a portable UHF set.

          The      difficulty               with   this      option   is

          informing patrols of the channel change.

          The     caravan          would      not have to be moved

          because     the          base station/aerial site at

          Shirecliffe gives cover at the ground.



       VHF Cover



6.31   Force    channel        1     was     dedicated to patrols

       operating    on route supervision prior to the

       match.      This        channel        is     controlled from

       Force Operations Room.




                                            105
6.32    A     portable       VHF    set was used in the ground

        control       room     to   monitor        activity    on the

        Force         channel        one,      and        provide   a

        communication link if required.

                            15 APRIL 1989



7.1   Weather



      7.1.1     The     weather on Saturday 15 April 1989

                was      extremely          good.    Indeed, it was

                probably        one     of     the     first 'Spring

                days'      of    1989,        with     a total of 11

                hours     sunshine           out    of a maximum of

                13-14     hours        available.         The air was

                dry,    humidity was low and the maximum

                temperature           recorded       at     the     Leeds

                Weather Centre was 13°C (55°F).



7.2   Stadium



      7.2.1     The    North     Stand is normally accessed

              by       turnstiles            numbers        77-88     on

              Penistone         Road        and turnstiles 1-8 on

              Leppings         Lane     but, on this occasion,

              to       ensure     segregation          of    opposing

              fans, the turnstiles on Penistone Road

              were      closed        and     the    turnstiles       on

              Leppings      Lane        were increased by two,

              turnstiles         1-10       now accommodated all

              spectators entering the North Stand.



                                        113
 7.2.2    The     West           Stand          is accessed via the

          same        bank        of turnstiles in Leppings

          Lane        at        turnstiles         9-16,     but     the

          actions of the club in increasing the

          North            Stand           allocation        by     two,

          effectively                reduced       the     West Stand

          number to 6, with only turnstiles 11-

          16 admitting fans into the West Stand

          seating area. The 7 turnstiles giving

          admittance                 to    spectators       for      the

         West     Stand,              Leppings       Lane terraces

         are     also           situated in Leppings Lane,

         they     are           letterered A-G and this is

         the     normal           turnstile allocation for

         the terrace area.



Terraces

7.3.1    The     'pens',              into which the terraces

         in      front           of       the     West   Stand      are

         divided,                are            served     by      five

         connecting gates, located at the rear

         of     the        dividing          barriers,      in order

         that         spectators             may    move     between

         'pens'.



7.3.2    Inspector              H.        White (the officer in

         charge            of        Serials        14     and     15) ,

         ensured       that           these       5 terrace 'pen'

         gates     were          padlocked          in the 'open'

         position.
7•4   Police Deployment



      7.4.1    The    overall           policing             operation     was

               commanded          by     Chief          Superintendent D.

               the South West corner of the ground.



      7.4.2   The     F   Divisional                Operational           Order

               (SYP Document 14) provides full details

              of the police deployment.



7•5   Events to 12 noon



      7.5.1   At     10.00    am        on        15 April 1989 police

              officers       attended              at the Hillsborough

              Ground, where the pre-match briefing was

              conducted           by         Chief           Superintendent

              communications and emergency evacuation

              procedures. The Divisional Intelligence

              Officer, Sergeant Charlesworth,                         informed

              officers       of        the        latest        intelligence

              regarding           Liverpool               and      Nottingham

              Forest Supporters. Inspector Sewell went

                                                  115
         on to give details relating to the issue

         of radios, meals, transport arrangements

         and other logistical matters.



7.5.2   On     the     15   April       1989, a total of 376

         stewards       were     on duty at the ground in

        connection          with       the    Semi-Final,   and

        these        were briefed by Inspectors having

        responsibility           for various parts of the

        ground        before     the      commencement of the

        match.



7.5.3   In      the      case     of    the     west stand, at

        11.25 am, Inspector White called all the

        relevant       stewards to the stand and they

        were     briefed in respect of the entry of

        spectators,         evacuation         procedures   and

        general conduct.

        to    separate        parts     of    the ground with

        officers       under      their command,      in order

        to brief them on matters appertaining to

        their particular serials.



7.5.5   At     11.00        am    officers engaged in the

        Leppings       Lane      detail      were   briefed by

                                 116
  up     duties on the concourse area outside

  the turnstiles. At around 12 mid-day the

. With      a      view        to          avoiding comment

 prejudicial              to        the      Enquiry         this

 background          material         does      not    seek to

 cover      the      tragic events which followed

 thereafter.




 The     entire South Yorkshire Police force

 has been deeply involved with the tragic

 events     which      occurred            on   Saturday 15

 April     1989.      Police          officers,        special

 constables-          and           civilian        personnel

 involved       in    the       operation          have      been

 much       grieved            by     the       death         and

 suffering        which        they       witnessed       on an

 occasion         which        should       have      been    an

enjoyable         sporting event. Many have had

to seek professional counselling.



For      those involved, memories and a deep

sense      of     sorrow       will remain with them
for    the      rest         of      their    lives,

particularly those officers who tried so

desperately    to     save        the lives of men,

women and children.



The    Force         extends          its    sincere

condolences    to     the relatives and loved

ones of those who died.

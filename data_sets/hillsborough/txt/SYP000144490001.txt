                  JUDICIAL INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER ON SATURDAY

                  15042989.
G1.   HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN EMPLOYED AS A TURNSTILE OPERATOR AT

      HILLSBOROUGH?



           9 years



Q2.   WERE YOU PRESENT IN THIS CAPACITY AT THE LIVERPOOL/

      NOTTINGHAM FOREST MATCH ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 19S9?




           Yss



03.   DESCRIBE YOUR ACTUAL JOB BRIEFLY.



           Tunstile Attendant at Turnstile

           Leppings Ln - receiving and checking tickets




Q4»   HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY TRAINING?     (Briefly describe)



           9 years ago when first employed I was doubled up

           with someone who showed me what to do.

           Also at beginning of every season there is a

           meeting of all persons who will be involved

           with matches including police,    fire, ambulance

           people.
                                                                        F'AQE


Q5.    HAVE YOU ANY EXPERIENCE OF TURNSTILE OPERATIONS AT

       OTHER FOOTBALL GROUNDS?       IF SO, HOW DO THEY COMPARE

       WITH HILLSBOROUGH?



               Yes, as a supporter of Sheffield Wednesday I have

               visited lots of grounds both as a paying supporter

               on the day and on all ticket occasions.     The only-

               one thats possibly better   is Old Trafford because

               they have more   room outside,   the ground for crowds

               to queue.   Generally though Hillsborough has well

               above average.




G6 .   DURING THE PRESENT SEASON HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED ANY

       MECHANICAL/ELECTRICAL OR OTHER OPERATING PROBLEMS

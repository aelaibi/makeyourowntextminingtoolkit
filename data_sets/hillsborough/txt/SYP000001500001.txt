from memory                 of    the        previous             times        at    Sheffield,                Police          or     stewards

n ave      directed              people           away       from     the       middle            section           because           of

Admittedly                on     previous              occasions           in       the     l e a g u e , Liverpool                   have       only

been       given          half       of      the       away       end,     therefore                Police          were       there         in a n y

case       to     stop         f an s     going          into      the     cordoned               off     areas.

the     far       right„             On      t hi s      occasion          I found myself                      carried           towards           the

middle          section .               I r a p i d l y we n t f r o rn n e a r t h e t op                          o f t h e s e c t io n

through           to      almost          half         way     when       I found           I could            go    no     further.

Gradually              I was         moved          towards          the       righthand             si de      of     the       goal        and

ended        up      in     f r o nt      of      a barrier,,              People           were        screaming              at     this       time

to    push        back         but      no     one       could       go    back          because          of    the       pressure            from

behind.              As     I came           to     the      b a r , having              had      experience              of     being

crushed           on a bar              in the           past,       I ducked             und e r .        I had          to     struggle            to

get     up      on     the       other         side,         it wa s       then          t hat      I knew          t his      wa s    not       like

other        crughes.                The       pressure            downwards              became          worse        and worse,

people          we/re s c r e a m i n g             at      the    police           and     asking         them        to      open        the     gate

or    to     help         people          out,         to    do    something              anyway.

ALL-SEATER STADIUMS NOT THE PANACEA
FOR FOOTBALL’S PROBLEMS
   The fundamental purpose of a successful supporters club must be to represent the
views of its members and this fact is central to the comments behind the Taylor Report.

The main theme which runs through the whole report is that there should be greater
consultation between clubs and its supporters to ascertain what they want in terms of                                               mEHlUSBOROUGH

on the Coventry City all-seater experience (1984) and the views of members of the
Football Supporters Association (Nov 1989) is that a large proportion of fans do not

The problems on that tragic day at Sheffield were
caused by problems of crowd control, penning and

   Most supporters of 2nd. 3rd and 4th Division
Clubs and indeed some 1st Division Clubs, would
wonder why extra seats are needed when many are
empty for the majority of games at present? The
costs of providing seats must inevitably be passed
onto the fan thus pricing out many loyal supporters,
those with children and families being the most
likely to suffer. However, these are the fans who will

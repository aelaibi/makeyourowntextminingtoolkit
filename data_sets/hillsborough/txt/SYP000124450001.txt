 wfti I FEEL THEY COULJ3J3F BEEN HELPING OUT WITH THE INJURED AND DEAD , BUT I

 THINK THAT THESE POL I C E M E N W t ^ N O T AWARE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING,

2) THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION BY W A ^ Q t k O U D SPEAKER TO INFORM THE CROWD AND

THE POLICE OFFICERS OF THIS SITUATION AND ALSO A LACK OF COMMUNICATION

BETWEEN SENIOR POLICE OFFICERS & OFFICERS ON THE PITCH,

G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 '1) THAT WHEN LIVERPOOL PLAY A MATCH LIKE iHiS WAS (SEMI FINAL)         i i-fa,fc.L iHA S

P^CE     FROM THE HOME TOWN SHOULD ALSO BE PRESENT.

2) THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS ARE WRONG, AS THE AMOUNTS OF FOLLOWERS FOR THIS

PARTICULAR MATCH ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT, LIVERPOOL WERE ALLOCATED LESS TICKETS,

ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE A LARGER FOLLOWING, THIS CAUSING FANS TO COME ALONG WHEN

 THEY HAVEN•T GOT TICKETS.

 3) ALSO PENNING PEOPLE IN IS TOTALLY WRONG.        THIS WAS THE CAUSE OF PEOPLE

 NOT BEING ABLE TO GET OUT, THEY COULDN'T MOVE TO THE SIDES BECAUSE THERE WERE

 BRICK WALLS THERE.

SOMEBODY WHO WAS STANDING BY US SAID THERE'S THOUSANDS OUTSIDE,   IT LOOKS AS

 THOUGH THE GATES ARE GOING TO GO.

Q12



 DID YOU WITNESS ANY DISORDER OR OTHER INCIDENTS BETWEEN YOUR ENTRY POINT AND

 MATCH VIEWING POINT? (BRIEFLY DESCRIBE)

 NO I WENT TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE OJ^ THE TUNNEL EXIT AND WORKED MY WAY THROUGH

 THE CROWD TO ABOUT HALF WAY ACROSS AND A THIRD OF THE WAY DOWN.                IT WAS

 CHOCKER SO I DECIDED THAT IT/WAS TOO FULL TO STAND THERE AND WATCH THE MATCH.

 IT WAS ONLY 2.20 (1420) QR VsO AND IT WAS JUST TOO FULL TO ENJOY WATCHING

 THE MATCH AND PEOPLE WERE STILL ARRIVING ALL THE TIME.             WE PUSHED OUR WAY

 BACK TO THE TUNNEL, WHICH WAS GUIET DIFFICULT AND MADE OUR WAY BACK ALONG

 THE TUNNEL.     I HAD SEEN THAT THE CORNER SECTIONS OF THE TERRACES WERE EMPTY
                                                                                 PAGE    6

 S O ’WE WANDERED AROUND TO THE LEFT AS WE CAME OUT OF THE TUNNEL.        THERE WAS

 A BRIGK WALL TO OUR RIGHT SO THAT/?IS PROBABLY WHY WE WENT LEFT.         I DID NOT

 SEE ANY SIGNS BUT WHEN WE GOT     j6   THE END I COULD SEE THAT THE CORNER TERRACES




                              7
 WERE LESS THAN HALF FULL SO WE TOOK UP A POSITION NEXT TO THE FENCE

 IN BETWEEN PENS 2 AND 3,
                                    "

 WERE YOU SUBJECTED TO ANY EXCESSIVE CROWD CRUSH AT THIS TIME,      IF YES,

 BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NOT IN PEN 2 BUT IN THE FEW MINUTES I SPENT IN PEN 3, IT WAS UNCOMFORTABLE

 WHICH IS WHY I MOVED.

 Q41

 WHO WERE YOU STOOD OR SAT WITH?

 THE PEOPLE WHO HAD COME WITH ME.

 G42

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCE OR UNUSUAL INCIDENT AT THE TIME

 OF TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 ( ^ E X C E P T FOR THE FACT THAT THE PENS BEHIND THE GOAL WERE CHOCKER AND THE END

 ONES WERE PRETTY EMPTY.


Q15

 <543

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD CRUSH?

 YES AT ABOUT TEN TO THREE (1450)   I SAW THAT IT WAS PRETTY PACKED IN PEN 3

 AND PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE SIDE FENCE INTO PEN 2 TO GET OUT OF IT.

 I WAS SURPRISED BECAUSE SOME OF THEM WERE BIG LADS.

 Q44

 W^p~ YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,    IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 HAPPENED?

 NO AT FIVE TO THREE (1455) I REMEMBER WONDERING WHERE EVERYONE WAS

 BECAUSE THE END TERRACES WERE STILL PRETTY EMPTY.

 <345

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY CROWD SURGE,   IF SO, DO YOU KNOW WHAT CAUSED IT? (BRIEFLY)

 I COULD HEAR A LOT OF SHOUTING AT THE FRONT BUT I COULDN’T MAKE OUT THE WORDS.

 I DIDNT SEE ANY ACTUAL SURGES BUT IT WAS PACKED IN THERE AND I SAW PEOPLE

 TRYING TO CLIMB OUT ONTO THE PITCH.

  DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED, IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

; no




  <349

  DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS, OR

  THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?                         /
  ONLY THAT WHEN I CAME BACK OUT OF THE TUNNEL BECAUSE IT WAS TOO PACKED IN THE

  PENS BEHIND THE GOAL THERE WERE STILL LOADS OF ^EOPLE COMING DOWN THE

  TUNNEL INTO THOSE PENS.   THE POLICE OFFICERS / h AT WERE BY THE TURNSTILES

  SHOULD HAVE BEEN BY THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE DIVERTING PEOPLE TO THE ENDS OF THE

  TERRACES BECAUSE AT 2.25 <1425) THOSE PENS|/WERE ALREADY TOO FULL.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 JUST BEFORE THE GAME WAS        STOPPED SOME FANS CLIMBED OVER THE PERIMETER FENCE

 ONTO THE PITCH AND SPOKE        TO SOME POLICE OFFICERS BY THE GOAL-    THEY THEN

 STARTED TO HELP THE FANS TO GET OUT (THE FANS) AND AT ONE STAGE THERE MUST

 HAVE BEEN A DOZEN FANS HELPING.        THEN SOME POLICE CAME OVER AND THEY BEGAN TO

 HELP AS WELL.  THE MATCH WAS STOPPED AND MORE/POLICE OFFICERS CAME OVER BUT

                                               -----------------
 WHILST A NUMBER WERE DOING THEIR BEST THE RE&T JUST SEEMED TO STAND THERE AND

              I THINK THAT THEV'WERE WATCHING THE FANS GOING UP INTO THE WEST

         WHERE PEOPLE WERS' PULLING THEM OUT OF THE CRUSH.      THE POLICE SEEMED

 TO HAVE NO ORGANISATION.         IT WAS THE FANS THAT LEAD THE WAY, THEY HELPED TO

 PULL PEOPLE OVER THE FENCE FIRST       AND THEY USED THE ADVERTISING HOARDINGS AS

 STRETCHERS FIRST.       THROUGHOUT THE POLICE SEEMED TO SLOWLY FOLLOW THEIR

 LEAD.       I D O N ’T KNOW WHETHER IT WAS BECAUSE THE FANS HAD BEEN IN THE CRUSH

 AND KNEW THE SCALE OF THE MATTER OR NOT BUT THE POLICE OFFICERS IN GENERAL

; SEEMED TO TAKE A LONG TIME REALISING WHAT HAD OCCURRED.

 Q54

  IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO AJBfD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

       CI AL INQUIRY?
                                 / o q i w St^Ap^orrBS   erV
 THE SEARCHING OF PEOPLE JUST BEFORE THEY ENTERED THE TURNSTILES CAUSED DELAYS

 BECAUSE AS YOU ONLY HAD TO HAND A TICKET IN, YOU WERE THROUGH THE TURNSTILE

 QUIET QUICKLY.       THIS LEFT THE TURNSTILE EMPTY FOR 10 SECONDS OR SO WHILE THE

 OFFICER SEARCHED THE NEXT PERSON.        IF THEY HAD CONCENTRATED ON SEARCHING

: PEOPLE INSIDE OR FURTHER AWAY FROM THE TURNSTILES THEN THE CROWD OUTSIDE

 WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO BUILD UP SO MUCH.         CONSIDERING THAT LAST YEAR

 AT THE SAME VENUE IT WAS QUITE PACKED BEHIND THE GOAL THEN LIVERPOOL SHOULD

  HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE KOP END OF THE GROUND. LIVERPOOL HAS FAR GREATER SUPPORT

  THAN NOTTS FOREST SO THE FANS SHOULD HAVE BEEN GIVEN THE LARGER TERRACE AREA.
                                                                                 PAGE  10
                                                                                 QSL1928

  THAT WAS OBVIOUS LAST YEAR TOO AND THEY DIDNT LEARN FOR THIS YEAR.       IF THAT

  COULDN’T HAVE BEEN ARRANGED THEN THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN AT OLD TRAFFORD

  OR SOME WHERE SIMILAR.

  ALSO LAST YEAR THE POLICE ON THE WAY TO THE GROUND SEEMED TO BE MORE

  INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY WERE DOING AND WERE APPROACHING PEOPLE AND KEEPING

  THEM MOVING ON AND SPEAKING TO THEM.       THIS YEAR THEY WERE JUST STANDING

  AROUND AND DIDNT SEEM TO WANT TO GET INVOLVED AS MUCH.

  ALSO,    IT IS THE FANS WHO SHOULD BE OF PRIME IMPORTANCE AT THESE GAMES, THEY

  FOLLOW AND SUPPORT THEIR CLUB FOR A YEAR AND SPEND A LOT OF MONEY IN ORDER TO

  DO SO.    IT IS NOT CHEAP BEING A SEASON TICKET HOLDER AND A LOT OF ORDINARY

 LIVERPOOL FANS ARE SEASON TICKET HOLDERS.       VERY LITTLE CONCERN OR THOUGHT

  SEEMS TO BE SPENT ON    THE NEEDS OF THE ORDINARY FANS.    WITH REGARDS TO THIS

  TAKING THE CUP FINAL    AT WEMBLEY AS AN   EXAMPLE, ONLY HALF OF THE TICKETS

  OR THERE ABOUTS ARE ALLOCATED TO THE CLUBS INITIALLY AND MOST OF THE REST ARE

i ALLOCATED TO CLUBS THAT DIDNT MAKE IT THROUGH AND DIRECTORS OF BUSINESS,

  ETC.  IT IS THOSE TICKETS THAT MAKE THEIR WAY O N ] / T H E BLACK MARKET.  IF THE
                     F-/Y-           CiS^S’      /                          -------
! MAJORITY OF TICKETS WERE ALLOCATED TO THE TWO /TEAMS PLAYING THEN EVERYONE

: WHO WANTED A TICKET WOULD GET ONE AND IT wWl_D STOP THE TOUTS AND STOP

| PEOPLE COMING WITHOUT TICKETS.     LETS FACE IT THE MAIN DEMAND FOR TICKETS

  IS BY SUPPORTERS OF THE CLUBS PLAYING.

  I ® * N T TO ADD THAT WHEN I MADE MY   WAY TO THE GROUND I ONLY SAW TWO COACHES

  PARKED UP ON THE A61    ON THE HILL,   BUT THAT WHEN I CAME OUT, THERE WERE

  DOZENS ALL THE WAY DOWN.     TO ME THAT INDICATES THAT A LOT OF THE COACHES

  ARRIVED LATE, WELL AFTER 2 PM (1400) POSSIBLY DUE TO THE ROAD WORKS ON THE

  MOTORWAY.

  I DONT SEE WHY THE POLICE OFFICER WHO OPENED THE GATES DIDNT SEND SOME

  OFFICERS TO STOP THEM GOING INTO THE TUNNEL.       IF HE HAD DONE THAT THEN THE

  SCALE OF THE DISASTER WOULD HAVE BEEN REDUCED CONSIDERABLY EVEN AT THAT

  STAGE.    THE PENS WERE UNBELIEVEABLY FULL FROM ABOUT HALF PAST TWO <1430)

  THE POLICE MUST HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT SO IT MUST COME DOWN TO BAD

 WRONG. OLD TRAFFORD IS A MUCH MORE SUITABLE GROUND,

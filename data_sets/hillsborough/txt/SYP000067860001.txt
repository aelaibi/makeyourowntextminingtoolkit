              On S at u r d a y   15th A p r i 1 198?       I attended           the F A Cup semi      final     football

              m a t c h between Liverpool            and N o t t i n g h a m Forest at Sheffield-               I had

              purchased a £14„00            stand ticket          for the N o r t h S tand from A n f i e l d about

              2 or 3 weeks         prior    to the game.           I t r a velled to the game w i t h my wife

              leaving       home at about         10.30 am,         I t r avelled along        the M62,       and the

              M 57 and      I missed the        turn off       the A57 for          the ground and      I come off

              the HI       entering S h e f f i e l d from the end where               the N ot t i n g h a m Forest

              Fo r e s t   supporters      were    entering.          My wife and       I started to walk

              towards the ground we wa l k e d down a hill towards P e nistone Road and
                                      h
              all along the route to the ground standing at the entrances to the

              side     streets     I saw a lot of           policemen shutting           them off.           I also   saw a

      lot of     policemsn as           I wal k e d around the ground from the Pen i s t o n e                      Road

      end along      the back        of the 'North stand towards Leppings Lane at the

      entrances      to the side          streets,

      By the time we e nt ered L e p p i n g s Lana                    I would estimate          it w o u l d be

      about 2,25       pm.      There were a number                   of people milling a r o u nd outside

      the   outer    iron gates and            I saw between 6 and                   12 foot    police    officers

      standing      outside      these     outer       iron gates and about 3 o f fi ce r s on horse

      back.     These were all            outside       the outer            iron gates    in the     street,

      We were able        to walk       straight        through the outer               iron gates       but    upon

      entering      this outer y a rd area              it was         very full      and there w ere no

      queues as such.            We waited           in this     crowd for at           least    twenty minutes

      before we finally got               thr ough the turnstiles and during                       this time        it

      g r adually got more and more                   packed until            it   star t e d to become

      frightening.           E ve n t u a l l y my    wife was         pushed      through one of the

      turnstiles and          I managed        to     get through a couple               of minutes      later and

      I s u b s e q u e n t l y found    out   that my wife             still      had her full     ticket,       the

      stubb not having           been     removed.        At     no time had           I seen any other           gates

      other    than the       turnstiles        open,      1 saw no one               climbing    over    the     top of

      the turnstiles          and    I saw no one behaving                   d isorderly apart        from just

      before we got thro u g h the               turnstiles            I could hear       people     chanting

      " h e a v e ” and the     crush was       getting more and more.

      Having     entered the         ground we made            our way         to the N orth stand w here

      we were     to sit.         1 saw no one at t h i ^ time either                     drinking alchol           or

      behaving      in a d i s o r d e r l y manner.           Jn b    sat    down    in our    seats at abou*

      before kick        off.       We were      seated     in gangway R row 39,                  The game

      started and wi t h i n a couple                 of minutes         I lookep towards          the West        stand

      and   1 could see         people      climbing      over         the frynt       perimeter     fence      from

      the   centre section and              I saw      po lie eme n puffh i ng them ba c.k in.                 I did

      not take any        particular           notice    of this yat first              but as    time went        by I

            This was at about         the   time       the    game/was                 stopped.                  I then saw the

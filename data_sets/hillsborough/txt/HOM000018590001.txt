       Dear Sir,

       Our apologies for not replying to your letters earlier but enclosedyou will
       find a drawing of Ewood Park marked as requested.
       You will note that the lateral divisions are in red, these have been in place
       for over fifteen years in their current positions and are used only to divide
       the ground into manageable areas as far as entry, exit and policing etc.
       There are no subdivision lateral fences within these areas as at Hillsborough
       so the number of people entering one of these areas are known from the electric
       turnstile counter - they have no further choice of penned area after passing
       through the counters.
       The pitch perimeter fence is shown green and has been in place for over ten
       years. The exit gates onto the pitch have also been in existence for several
       years. These gates are in two, opening outwards, approx 1800 mm wide and have
       a step on the terrace side to assist usage. The gates are manned by apolice­
       man and have a quick release mechanism, they are never locked.
       In addition to the gates you will note that three of the main areas have a
       permanent small 5&0 mm wide opening in the fencing, again manned by a police­
       man, which enables police, stewards etc. easy access from the track without
       having to open the larger gates.
       The gates in front of the two enclosures are closer togetherbecause the
       alternative exit for the stand is by means of small staircases into the
       enclosure areas and the gates are designed to cater for both enclosure and
       stand evacuation.
       The other main difference at Ewood from Hillsborough is that the majority of
       the entrances are in such a position that the terraces are ’’side loading"
       rather than "back loading".

                                                                                              cont *d....

We believe our licensing authority to be one of the most practical and thorough
in the country in that when we visit other grounds we see conditions and features
which would not be allowed to exist on a Lancashire ground e.g.

1.    The front evacuation gates procedures were appreciated and instigated some
      years ago.

2.    Where maximum density is approached the feeling in Lancashire is that
      continuous lines of barriers are essential even if crowds have to duck under
      them in places. We believe that the situation of photograph marked A
      where a straight line "thrust" could result would not have been allowed,
      the gaps would have been "staggered" more so that no two gaps were in a
      straight line.

We trust that this letter answered your enquiry and would be pleased to supply
any further information you require.


Yours faithfully,
Blackburn Rovers F. & A. PI£.,

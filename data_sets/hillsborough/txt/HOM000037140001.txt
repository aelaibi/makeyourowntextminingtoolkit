     Derek Twigg writes in support of a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

     The Home Secretary is currently considering whether there are sufficient grounds to
     order a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster in view of the issues raised in the
     Granada television drama “Hillsborough” last year, and the subsequent campaign by the
     Hillsborough Family Support Group.

Thank you for your letter of 23 May to Jack Straw, in support of recent calls for
a new inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering whether there is a case
for a further public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many
representations which have been received. Concerns that a number of issues
relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed attention following
the Granada television documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December.

After fully considering the material which has been put forward, he has decided,
in all the circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure
that no matter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. To
this end, as'you will know, he announced in the House.on 30 June that he had
invited Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the Court of Appeal
to conduct the scrutiny. I enclose for your information a copy of the
Home Secretary's statement to the House, which includes Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's terms of reference. You will see that he has undertaken to make public
the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-Smith gives him.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has indicated that anyone who, after consideration of
his terms of reference, wishes to make representations to him should contact his
Secretariat via Room 5 2 8 , 50 Queen Anne's Gate, London SW1H 9AT. It is our
earnest hope that this independent scrutiny will finally bring an end to the
uncertainty over the events of that terrible afternoon.

The Home Secretary is currently considering the representations which have been

closely and has also had thp^pportunity to meet some of the members of the
Hillsborough Family Support Group since the broadcast of the Granada television
drama last December. He is very aware of the strength of feeling on this issue and will
reach a decision as soon as possible.

RF,: HII.I.SBOROUGH JUSTICE CAMPAIGN

I am writing to fully support the campaign of the Hillsborough families for
justice.

I would urge you, in light of the new evidence which has recently emerged
about the disaster, to do all in your power to ensure that a fresh inquiry and/or
inquest is established as soon as possible.

I have been a Liverpool supporter all my life and also hold a season ticket at
Anfield. I was at Hillsborough on the day of the disaster and saw clearly what
happened. I am certain in my own mind that justice has not been done.

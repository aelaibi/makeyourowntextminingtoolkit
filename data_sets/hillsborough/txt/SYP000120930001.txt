              PC 2 8 9 5         Thomas.

              After           briefing       at       Hillsborough Stadium                       I commenced           duty       in       company

              Road        preventing             vehicles          and     unauthorised              people         from     entering              the

              N i a g a r a S p o r t -s a r e a .

              We    were         s t ill    in     t his      position when                shortly after              3pm    (1500)           a    call

              for        assistance          was       overheard           on a      personal           radio       which        was       b e ing

              carried            by    a Special            Constable,

              At    this         t ime w e       left       the    area     along          with     other       officers          and made           our

              the        entrance           I saw        two a m b u l a n c e s       inside        the       gates       and    a    number        of

              injured            people      on       the     floor      receiving              treatment.            Whilst          we    were

              there           which    was       only       a matter         of a f e w          seconds       we w e r e        instructed              by

              a    uniform            Inspector          to    form a        cordon         to     prevent       supporters                entering

              the        ground       and    to       clear       an access          for        emergency        service          vehicles           to

              enter           t h e g ro u n d .

              Whilst           standing          outside          the    ground        a    large       num b e r     of    vehicles              began
                                                                                                                                           PAGE

             to    arrive       including          Fire     and A mb u la nce           Services         and       then     we    were

             approached          fay a y o u n g        b oy appro;;.           8 years         old w h o        was   in t e a r s        and

             was     obviously            frightened.            By    t hi s    time     a number           of    supporters              were

             leaving       the       ground       and    the y o u n g      boy       asked      if we       could      take      h i m home.

             We    then    set       off    back    along Leppings                Lane     amongst           a    l a rge   number          of

             Liverpool          supporters          a n d we      eventually            resumed         at       a static        point and

             directed       supporters             back     to    the i r c o a c h e s         and   to a r e a s      where         public

             telephones          could       be    found.

             We    remained          in    this    position           until      3.30pm         (1750)       w h e n we     were       stood

             down     as   the       majority       of     supporters            by    t h is    time    had       returned           to    their

             coaches.           We    returned          to C l a y w h e e 1 s L a n e      a n d at     7pm       (1900)        we    w ere

             allowed       to    return       to    our     own Division.

                          MEETING WITH HILLSBOROUGH FAMILIES 2.15PM



Points to make



The Speaker has given special agreement for this meeting to take place before the

oral statement and publication of the report.        But it is very important that families

respect that confidence.



2.         Speculation in the press over the weekend about the content of the report

Assure families categorically that none of that came from Home Office.



3.         No point in a long preamble. Make clear at the outset that the outcome of the

scrutiny will be disappointing and painful for the families.



4.          Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has looked in great detail at all the material which

has been put to him. He has treated equally rigorously all the information, whether

that came from individuals or official bodies. His conclusions are clear that there is

no basis for a further public inquiry, or any chance of success in a renewed

application to the High Court to quash the verdict of the inquest, nor any material

which might give rise to criminal or disciplinary proceedings.



5.          He says in his report:



            “I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to [the

            families] especially since they have had their hopes raised that something

            more can be done. But I cannot allow compassion to cloud my judgement. I

            have had to look dispassionately and objectively at what is said to be fresh

            evidence, in the light o f the evidence which had previously been considered.”

6.         I, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions have

considered the report very carefully.                   W e have decided that Lord Justice Stuart-

Smith’s conclusions are right and should be accepted.



7.         Realise that the families will find it very difficult and painful to accept those

conclusions. Urge you to read the report very carefully before you react. The report

is very long because it is very detailed and very thorough.                      The reasons for the

conclusions are all out in the open. If you read the report in all its detail, I hope you

will accept in your heart of hearts that it is right and that it puts an end to speculation

about conspiracy, cover-up or re-opening of the previous inquiries or proceedings.



8.         Recognise              that families   had   doubts   about   Lord   Justice   Stuart-Smith

personally. His comments in Liverpool were insensitive.                    But his report shows that

he has been totally fair and absolutely thorough, and he has done his best to answer

fully all the concerns which the support group and individual families have put to him.



9.         Happy to go through the detailed reasoning on the particular issues raised by

the support group - for example, video evidence, medical evidence or other issues.

But it may be better for you to read the report. [Hope that there will be a chance to

debate it more fully in the House of Commons when everyone has had the time to

read it properly].



If raised


10.        A possible private prosecution is a matter for the families.              But urge you to

consider very carefully.                 A senior Lord Justice of Appeal has considered all the

relevant submissions and is absolutely clear that there are no grounds for instigating

criminal proceedings.                 Be wary of those who will take your money and delude you

into thinking that there are real prospects of success by starting new proceedings.

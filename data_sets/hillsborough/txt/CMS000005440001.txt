QUESTIONNAIRE ON TAYLOR IMPLEMENTATIONâ€™
Thank you for your letter of 28 December.  I am glad that you have
been able to cooperate closely with the Football Licensing
Authority and the Football Trust in drawing up your draft
questionnaire on the implementation of the Taylor recommendations.

When we met on 1 November, you said you thought it would be
possible to obtain monitoring information on the ground capacity
and the number of seats at each ground on a six-monthly basis -
for 1 April and 1 October each year. It still seems to me that it
would be an advantage to obtain information on this basis. Would
it be possible to amend questions 1 and 2 accordingly? I would
not insist on the April and September monitoring dates if that
would not suit; an alternative would be 1 January and 1 July. I
am content, however, for questions 3 to 5 to be drawn up on a
12 month basis.
My only other point is that I would like to see in question 7 a
table showing plans for capacity and seating at each monitoring
date over, say, the next 5 years. It seems to me that this would
represent the simplest and clearest summary of how each club is
planning to implement the Taylor recommendations over the years
ahead. It may also be helpful in focusing the attention of the
clubs themselves on what needs to be done.

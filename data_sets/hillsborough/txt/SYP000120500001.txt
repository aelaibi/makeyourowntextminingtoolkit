Ex Sergeant HIGGINS was the officer who at the 1988 Semi-Final arranged for

the closure of the tunnel leading to pens 3 & 4.                        He has supplied three

statements in C.J.A. form, but there are several points which have not

been asked of him and which he may well be able to assist the presentation

with.

I am Trevor Higgins, 44 years                                                 Of

Rotherham.



Until July 1988 I was a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police

stationed at Wombwell, of Barnsley Division.



On Saturday 9 April 1 9 8 8 , I was detailed to supervise a serial of constables

performing duty at Hillsborough Football Stadium.                                          The two football teams

taking part were Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



The serial was delegated duty at the rear of the West Stand and in particular

to control fans entering pens 3 and 4, that is the centre pens of the stand.



During the game and because of the amount of fans within pens 3 and 4, I

receive® irtstruction t.o pIorp t.he pates to the entrance and thereafter direct

        fans to the two outer pens of the stand.                  I cannot recall where the

        instruction came from.           Under normal circumstances instruction came from a

        Serial Inspector or via radio from control.                    I cannot say from which the

        instruction came.


 C
        Bearing in mind the time lapse and having attended several matches at

        Hillsborough, it is difficult to relate detail regarding this particular

        match.

 I am Trevor Higgins, 44 years

 Rotherham.




 Until July 1988 I was a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police

 stationed at Wombwell, of Barnsley Division.



On Saturday 9 April 1988, I was detailed to supervise a serial of constables

performing duty at Hillsborough Football Stadium.                                         The two football teams

taking part were Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.



The serial was delegated duty at the rear of the West Stand and in particular

to control fans entering pens 3 and 4, that is the centre pens of the stand.



During the game and because of the amount of fans within pens 3 and 4, I

receive^ instruction to nln^e the gates to the entrance and thereafter direct

        fans to the two outer pens of the stand.                    I cannot recall where the

        instruction came from.           Under normal circumstances instruction came from a

        Serial Inspector or via radio from control.                      I cannot say from which the

        instruction came.



        Bearing in mind the time lapse and having attended several matches at

        Hillsborough, it is difficult to relate detail regarding this particular

        match.

I am Trevor Higgins, 46 years               of

           Rotherham.

Until July 1988 I was a Police Sergeant in the South Yorkshire

Police stationed at Wombwell of Barnsley Division.

On Saturday 9 April 1988, I was detailed to supervise a serial of

constables performing duty at Hillsborough Football Stadium.      The

two football teams taking part were Liverpool and Nottingham

Forest.

The serial was delegated duty at the rear of the West Stand and

in particular to control fans entering pens 3 and 4 *(explain

further with reference to order), that is the centre pens of the

stand.

During the game and because of the amount of fans within peris 3

and 4 I received instruction to close the gates to the entrance

and thereafter direct fans to the two outer pens of the stand.      I

cannot recall where the instruction came from.     Under normal

circumstances instruction came from a Serial Inspector or via

radio from control.     I cannot say from which the instruction

came.

Bearing in mind the time lapse and having attended several

matches at Hillsborough, it is difficult to relate detail

regarding this particular match.

On that day I was directly responsible to Chief Inspector Creaser

and then Superintendent Marshall who was the Commander inside the

ground.

Inspectors on concourse?

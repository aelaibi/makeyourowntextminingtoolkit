Dear

     Thank you for your letter of the 3rd May following our recent telephone
conversation, in which you state clearly the role of the Association.

     I will ensure that a copy of your letter is circulated to all
Departments making them aware of the role of the association, via the Inter
Agency Meeting to be held on Friday, 12th May.

                                 Yours sincerely.




                                 Director of Social Services.

Dear Mr Mason

Thank you for your letter dated April 27 1989.1^1 appreciate that at the
moment you are very busy dealing with offers concerning the Hillsborough
disaster, and I would have no wish to involve«>you in anything that would
take up more of your time, however I think that you may have misunderstood
my original intention for telephoning you so I will explain exactly what
I meant on the telephone.    On the day that I called I had received a ~
telephone call from a colleague of yours from Ellesmere Port Social Services
and he explained to me that two people had been to him for Counselling,
he explained to me that after their initial sadness had eased they began
to feel a need to pass their statements on to somebody else who might be
able to help get their side of the story over at any official or public
Inquiry, he further explained that he had heard of our organisation
but had no idea''how to   contact us inorder to get any statements from the
two people concerened.     He suggested that I get in touch with yourselves
and explain what we are doing which is collecting as many statements as
possible from anybody at all who was there and who feels that they
m Jht have relevant information.

The reason we are doing this is because we are now legally representing
the supporters at the official Inquiry which will be headed by Lord Justice
Taylor.   It was not   our intention to set ourselves up as some kind of
ooposing agency to yourselves as we have neither the resources or the
m anpower available for such an operation.  So once again  just to make our
own position very clear, all we were trying to do was to pass on    our
address so that if^ any of your clients wanted to make a statement to
someone who they felt could possibly represent them you could make them aware
of our existance.    If however this would be felt unsuitable then
please accept my apologies.


Yours sincerely

Lane    end of the ground due to a report                        of    crowd problems.               Along with

other      o fficers    in our serial           we    left the        gymnasiurn i mmediately and

made    our way ar ou nd the touchline                  towards        the Leppi ngs La»e            end.          As

we n eared the L ep pings Lane              e n d , I saw several              fa^^/ipinq               fencing

dealing w ith the matter and                I went        in company with PC 1399 jMOpfPl

went    into the       stand.        I saw a youth            laid on the seating whg^Kat

apparently         f allen from the fencing.                   After attem pt in g          to move        the
            /
y o u t h h£ s tated he was alright.                    We then went           to the      front     of
       /
the^yStand to        inform a St J o h n ’s personnel                  that    someone      in the stand

m^fy need their a ssistance.                    U pon   reaching        the    touchl ine     I saw

several      s p ec ta to rs   on the track and e ncroaching                    on the      playing area.

1 then saw applice             of f'i cer /ufho was at         least          the rank of     Inspector

running      onto      the     pitch W a r d \       the / e f e r e e .      At this moment , I

thought a pitch          invasion was o c&wr i n g .                  On nearing      the fence           behind

the goa lp os ts       I r ealised that          people were           d es pe ra te ly    crushed up to

the    fencing.          So m uch so,      that they were              unable to move.               The      people

on the front           rows were seriously trapped and could not move                              di

the weight         of the      crowd behind them.                The    exit gate         behirur the

goalpost was         opened and PC T HO MP SO N and a few other                       of^jj/ye/s w e r e

trying      to pull     people     from the          crush.        I c 1 imbe d ontb/t hp fjpfvci ng a nd

tried to help          people     climb over.             This was         difficult as the height

was    so great and the           prongs at the top of the fence w er e / s t i c k i n g                          into

the    people and getting            caught      in their        clothing and         a a r t s of tJpeir

bodies.      Several     times     I carried          injured      people      ont/i t h y pij/chN-and

en su re d their       safety.          Going    back     towards       the-^Fence,( j p e d i e s      who    I

a s s u me d were    unconscious,         could be seen s qu ashed up to the                       fence,

by police        officers        fram the gate onto               the    pitch w hich       carried bodies

out.         It was during           this      that    I a t t e m p t e d to    resuscita/p       three of the

bodi e s .       Two were youths               of about SOyrs and one a y o / n j                 iy6yj o f about

J6yrs.        I gave      the kiss           of life to the         first one               came     ouna and

a l j / ( longer and          I was      helped       by another        female officer.            During me

giving     the kiss        of    life?        the y outh v om itted as he came               to,    the vomit

a ct u a l l y going      into my mouth.                He e ve nt u a l l y     regained full

c on sc io usness and           I left him with the female officer.                              The young     boy

I tried to        revive was           totally        lifeljfss./ /His eyes              staring and sunken

and his body totally                 limp.           I returned tlo assist with the                 bodies

coming     from the gate.                    Most    of these were        lifeless,        however     police

people     that were          still      i<L-the stand were             jeering,        shouting and

swearing at the officers.                           On one occ ca si on m oney was           being     thrown at

the officers,           several        of them being           hit and      it could be heard           "You

               gate once on the pitch I assist        in carrying him,         this lad I worked on

               performing mouth to mouth resuscitation,             together with another

               Policewoman.       I remember the green top. / I       have been shown the

               clothing photos and the facial        photo         the deceased for body no^ Iff,

               Colin WAFER.

               I am unable to confirm if this is the person I dealt with.

               At 15.33.25.00 on the same film I am seen picking a body up together

               with other Police Officers and placing it onto a hoarding and

               carrying him away from the area of the pitch.                 Just outside the gate,
                                                                                 PAGE   2

         in pen 3.     The same person is shown on photo PR7/12,       I am at the front

         of the hoarding.      I have been.shown the photos of the clothing and

         facial    photo of Body no 4 0 / e t e r MCDONNELL.   I am unable to recognise

         this person as the body on the hoarding.

               Fu rt he r       to my      recollection,         date 23 October            1989    (231089),      that

               r ec ol l ec t io n       is true and        I am    content that           it be used     in any

               proceedings.

               I make this              statement       on the u n de rs ta nd in g        that    I can take a

               O n 15 April             1989     (150489)      I was    posted to football           duty on the Cup

               Semi Final              at Hillsborough.            This was my first football               mat c h „and
                                                                                                                             r^poa^
               was          to a tt end and       perform duty with PC              1399 T H OMPSON                         n my

               tutor Cons table                 since   I started operational               duties    in M ar ch     1989

               (000389)           having        completed      initial     training.

               At about 3.00               pm    (1500)   together w ith PC T H O M P S O N and other                officers

               of my serial              I left the gym na si um           to make my way towards             the Leppi ng s

               Lane          terraces where         crowd      problems were          reported to be       in progress.
                                                                                                       PAGE   2
                                                                                                       S3520B

I followed PC T HO M P S O N along           the     perimeter       track    in front         of the North

S tand towards       th ° >             — i■nvw.—       „    My a t t e n t i o n was    drawn by PC

T H O M P S O N to an o                             1 1 icer,     on RTs own    in the North S ta nd who

be s ur ro u nd ed by supporters.             There must           have been eight            or ten    people

standing a round the          officer,       who m     I did not      know,    in the seated area.

As we a p pr o a c h e d   it was    obvious        this    officer    needed some a s si st a nc e

as the     crowd ar ou nd him grew.

P rior   to this,      I had seen s upporters               climbing     on top of the fence

w h ic h divides     the seating       of the N or th S tand and the standing are a of

the N or th West Terracing.              I remember          seeing    defin at el y two         people      on

the fence and others            trying      or about        to    climb up onto         it.

As PC T H OM PS ON and       I approached           fans    others    got down or moved away

from the fence.            We made our way           into the N orth Stand              itself    closer      to

the group of supporters              gathe re d a ro u n d the        officer.          PC T HO MP S O N and

I made    slightly different           routes        through the seating and PC THOMPSON

got to the        officer and       crowd first.

I s topped just short           of the area w here an               incident was         taking    place

and    I stood a distance of a row of seats                        down the stand.            There were a

number    of supporters        all    about me.            Some    standing    on seats and            in

front and at the side              of me.     After        a short while       I could see a youth

lying on his        back    between two       rows of seating.               I saw that PC T H O MPSON

was    talking     to him asking       him    i.f he was alright.              The      original       officer

who m we had gone          to assist was with PC T H O M P S O N             in a g ro up ar ou nd          the

y o ut h on the floor.

The y ou th s tarted to         recover and star te d to sit up,                  assisted        by PC

T HO M P S O N and the     other    officer.         He said he was          okay and         I could hear

some     people with the        crowd around us saying                he should be            left where

he was whilst        others wan te d him a s s i s t e d up off the floor.

From my        position    I could not smell            drink      on the youth on the floor

a lt ho ug h    I did notice       the smell        of drink       on a number       of the      crowd who
     •                                                                          P AGE
                                                                                                             S3320B

               were a round us.            The youth on the floor was              groggy and he may have

               been so from the fall,              but rny impression was             that he too    had been

               dr inki n g .

               A l t h o u g h the youth said he was            okay    it was   clear     to me that my

               colleague and the first                 officer we had gone         to assist w ai t e d    to make

               sure    he was      not    injured by getting a St Johns a mbulance Officer                     to

               have a look at him.

              Some     of the group,         who a p p e a r e d sensible and         in control    of themselves

               said they would            look after      the youth and       1 followed PC T H O M P S O N down

               onto    the      perimeter    track      to obtain a ss is t a n c e     from a St Johns.

              However,          as we did get      onto the track         the s it uation from the terraces

               behind the goal            unfol de d    into a full     scale    disaster.      PC T H O M P S O N and

               I then      immediately        became     involved      in duties      to save   life and

               therefore         gave    no further      thought    to this youth.

                                                                                      M Y GILL PC 3 138 S IG NE D

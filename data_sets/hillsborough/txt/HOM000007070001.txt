INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

You will have seen a copy of my letter of 21 April to Bob Whalley on the
investigation being carried out by the West Midlands Police on behalf of Lord
Justice Taylor.

The purpose of this letter is to confirm my understanding of how the costs of
the Public Inquiry itself are to be split.  From soundings I have taken in this
Office, it appears that the Treasury Solicitor will pay the fees of Counsel to
the Inquiry but that all the other costs of the Inquiry (including, for
example, the cost of reimbursing witnesses) will be borne by the Department
which set up the Inquiry.

I should therefore be grateful for your confirmation that you agree that the
costs of this Inquiry should be apportioned on the basis outlined above, with
the Home Office bearing all the costs of the Inquiry with the exception of
Counsel's fees, which we will pay.

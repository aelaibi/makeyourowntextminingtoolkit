HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE


I attach a copy of Mr Johnston's letter of 21 August to Mr
Addison together with a draft reply which I propose to send as
soon as possible.  I would appreciate your comments.

2.   Now that South Yorkshire are   minded to accept our offer of a
special payment I think we should   be in a position to make
financial assistance available to   them as soon as possible. It
is at least one incentive to them   to take it now even if it does
not offer them all they want.

3.   Following discussion between our staff it has been suggested
that we should write to HM Treasury seeking their agreement to a
call on the reserve. We have drafted the attached letter for
your consideration which attempts to persuade Treasury to use the
"urgent" procedure for drawing on the reserve.  I do think this
is important.  Perhaps you will wish to discuss this with me
before I go on leave tomorrow evening.

               HILLSBOROUGH: COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE


               Following the Chief Secretary's letter of 19 June to the
               Home    Secretary       in    which          he       supported    our    aim     of
               persuading the South Yorkshire Police Authority that the
               additional      costs        of   the        investigation         should       fall
               initially to be met by them,                  Lord Ferrers wrote to the
               Chairman     of the    Police Authority on 27 June making an
               offer of a special payment.                   The South Yorkshire Police
               Authority     remitted       this       to        a    full    meeting    of    the
               Authority.     They have now replied stating that they will
               reimburse the West Midlands police direct and accept the
               special payment        subject       to       clarification         of    certain
               points raised.


               2.     In their letter they sought special payment on any
               interest    payments     incurred        by       South       Yorkshire   arising
               from any delay between the rendering of accounts by it
              and receipt     of payments          from the Home Office.                 We are
replying,     refusing this request under the long-standing
procedure     that police                specific grant               and special grant
cannot be paid on interest payments incurred.


3.     To    assist           us        in     our       negotiations             with       South
Yorkshire, it is imperative that we can provide financial
assistance quickly.                 We shall wish to forward an advance
payment to them to assist them in meeting the first West
Midlands     invoice which                   amounts to          £1.677m.          If we can
make an      early payment this will                           help us to resist any
political pressure from MPs and local councillors on the
interest point.              The sooner South Yorkshire pays the West
Midlands     and we          reimburse             them,       the    less      any    interest
incurred      by       them        can       be     attributed             to   Government's
failure      to     act.           Moreover,             as     you        appreciate,         the
Hillsborough disaster is a very sensitive issue and any
delay on the Government's part in providing funding to
assist South Yorkshire meet the costs would be given wide
publicity.


4.     The    Chief           Secretary's             letter           states         that     the
expenditure            which        the       special           payments          cover      will
represent     a        claim       on    the       Reserve.               There    are       three
options open to us for making arrangements for payments.


       a.         A supplementary bid in October.


       b.         An    arranged             PQ    and     a    call       on    the    reserve
                   (again in October).


       c.         An    arrangement               agreed        between         officials,      a
                  call on the reserve and a bid in due course
                  in the supplementary.


As   Parliament         is     in        summer       recess          I    consider       that,
exceptionally,          we     should use            option          (c)     because      a six
week    delay          in    making            finance          available          would       be
politically        sensitive            and       encourage          South      Yorkshire to
pursue the interest question.         I hope that you can agree
to this.


5.   The    first   invoice received by the South Yorkshire
Police Authority from the West Midlands Police Authority
is for £1,677,402 for the additional costs up to 30 June.
The special     payment would    commence for costs above the
produce of a penny rate (ie around £1.3 million).               so in
respect of the first invoice the Home Office will have to
meet 51% of some £1.3m and 90% of the remaining £377,402.
Further invoices are likely to be less as the manpower
requirement diminished in July and August.               I should be
grateful therefore if we can discuss this as a matter of
urgency    on   receipt   of   this   letter   so   as   to   make   an
arrangement to assist South Yorkshire quickly.

              HILLSBOROUGH:      COST   OF    INVESTIGATION          BY     WEST    MIDLANDS
              POLICE


              Thank you     for your    letters of         21 August       to Mr Addison
                                                            A
               informing us that South Yorkshire Police Authority is now
              prepared to     agree that      it will reimburse West Midlands
               Police     Authority         the     additional            costs     of     the
               investigation     by   the    West    Midlands       Police     subject      to
              clarification of some matters.                    I   am    replying       in Mr
              Addison's absence on leave.


              It   is a matter of long-standing Government policy that
              Central Government grant should not be paid on interest
              costs.     We cannot therefore consider paying special grant
              or indeed ordinary police grant on any interest charged
              by   the    West   Midlands         Police    Authority.             For    your
              information we are not aware of any instance where one
              police authority has          agreed to pay another interest on
              the costs of an investigation.
With regard to whether the special payment will cover the
cost    of     the    criminal       investigation       announced         recently,
this was not included in the original offer of a special
payment.       Moreover, investigation of criminal offences is
part    of     the    force's      normal     function.         However,         as Mr
Addison's       letter       of    9 August      indicated,         we    anticipate
that    much     of    the      work     already    completed        by    the    West
Midlands police as part of their original investigation
should prove helpful               to the new criminal              investigation
and will still qualify for the special payment.


If     South     Yorkshire         Police     Authority        wish       to    pursue
special      payment       for     new    work     related     to    the       criminal
investigation we will                need to consider this                separately
with    details       of     costs     and   reasons     why    your       authority
considers these costs should qualify for special payment.


Mr Walker        in his      recent telephone conversation with us
asked for clarification of the penultimate paragraph of
Mr Addison's letter of 9 August and whether the special
payment      will     apply       to the     costs of work undertaken by
West     Midlands          Police        connected      with     the       Coroner's
inquest, discipline and complaints investigation.                                As Mr
Addison      stated     in his         letter much of the work already
undertaken       will      be     relevant     to   these      areas      with    some
presentational adjustment.                   However,       I can confirm that
the additional costs of such further work carried out on
behalf of the South Yorkshire Police by the West Midlands
Police in these areas will qualify for special payment.


As Mr Addison's letter made clear any work which is being
undertaken by forces other than West Midlands in relation
to   disciplinary          investigations           would    not     qualify       for
special payment and as stated above we will require more
information about the major criminal investigation costs
before making a decision on whether to include these in
the special payment arrangements.
In conclusion, we suggest that your authority should make
arrangements for paying the outstanding amounts to avoid
further delay.   We are    in contact with HM Treasury to
organise the method of making special payments to you to
assist with meeting the costs and our Finance Division
will be in contact with your Finance Department as soon
as possible to   discuss   and   arrange   the mechanism   for
reimbursement.

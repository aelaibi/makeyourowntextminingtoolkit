FOOTBALL FIXTURES


I have received a cordial invitation on behalf of the Chief
Constable from John Dickson, ACC (Ops) of Strathclyde Police to
attend:


     i.    On Saturday 20 May, the Scottish FA Cup Final.     After
     Glasgow Rangers beat St Johnson 4-0 in the re-play last
     night the final will be a local derby between Celtic and
     Rangers.     That is of a particular significance because that
     will be the first time the two teams have contested the
     Final since 1980 when opposing supporters rioted on the
     pitch.     That in turn led to the Criminal Justice (Scotland)
     Act 1980 which introduced alcohol controls similar to our
     Sporting Events (Controls of Alcohol etc) Act 1985.


     ii.    On Saturday 27 May, for the Scotland v England
     international. Both games will be played at Hamden Park which
     has substantial amounts of perimeter fencing.


I had already also mentioned to TO 20 Department (Public Order)
of the Metropolitan Police the possibility of attending the
English FA Cup Final at Wembly - now subject to confirmation - on
Saturday 20 May.


I think it would be worthwhile for us to consider attending some
of these matches: I will willingly co-ordinate bids.  Come
forward, please.

            “It was agreed, however, that it would be sensible f o r me to see these

          s a matter o f additional personal comment, it seem s to m e that the W est Midlands Police
         ad little practical choice, because o f the constraint imposed by the political requirement that
        the Taylor Enquiry should produce an interim report before the com m encem ent o f the next
        football season. T o conduct the enquiry on the basis o f W est Midlands officers taking CJA
        statements from individual South Yorkshire P olice officers w ould probably have rendered
        that goal im possible to achieve.


5.      I do not k n o w precisely what procedure was adopted after I had provided faxed comment on
        statements presented to me. I am not in a position to say whether any officer refused to sign
        an amended statement and indeed I am not aware as to w hether officers w ere presented with
        amended statements as op posed to reviewing their o w n statements in the light o f the
        com ments I had made. It may be that the former w as the practice adopted because o f the
        time pressure. Whether or not that was the case I cannot recall any instance when the matter
       w as referred back to m e and I must assume either that the officers signed amended
       statements, or that if they did not, the statements went to W est Midlands in their original
       form.


I hope this is helpful. Please let me know if I can be o f any further assistance.

Yours sincerely

        Dear Sirs,


        THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBAI.T. TPACTinv


        Further to my letter of 14 February 1995, the Attorney General
        has now had the opportunity fully to consider the points you made
        in your letter of 7 February about the news coverage and
        editorial in the Daily Telegraph relating to this issue.   He has
        also received explanation and comment from the Daily Telegraph.


        The Attorney General has concluded that the material does not
        justify proceedings for contempt.


        Yours faithfully,




        S . J . WOOLER

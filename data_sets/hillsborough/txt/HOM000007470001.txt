^HILLSBOROUGH: USE OF CONTINGENCIES FUND


  1.   Provision for Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry has been
  included in a Revised Estimate for the non-Prisons Vote which
  should receive Parliamentary approval towards the end of July.
  As expenditure on the Inquiry will be incurred before then the
  Treasury has approved a repayable advance from the Contingencies
  Fund to meet the Inquiry's initial costs.

  2. We are required to announce this to Parliament by means of an
  arranged Parliamentary Question. The attached draft Question and
  Answer (which are in a standard form) have been agreed with the
  Treasury. If the Home Secretary is content, I should be grateful
  if this could be tabled for written answer as soon as possible.

DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY QUESTION AND WRITTEN REPLY



To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, what
arrangements are being made to finance the cost of Lord Justice
Taylor's Inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.




DRAFT REPLY



Parliamentary approval to the expenditure on this Inquiry will be
sought in a Revised Estimate for the Home Office Vote for

administration etc. (Class XI, Vote 3).   Pending that approval,
urgent expenditure estimated at £100,000 is being met by a
repayable advance from the Contingencies Fund.

I am writing to thank you for last night's stimulating and
enjoyable visit to Tottenham Hotspur. It was an engrossing
evening; needless to say, Victoria in particular was delighted
with the final score!

I do appreciate the additional burden we must have imposed on
what was an already hectic evening, and I should be extremely
grateful if you would pass on my thanks to Irving Scholar, Paul
Braboff and in particular Peter Barnes for taking the time to
talk to us and show us round. From the Inquiry's point of view
it was, as I think you realised, a valuable and informative
visit.

Of course, the evening would have been impossible without your
assistance and I am extremely grateful to you for smoothing our
path and escorting us throughout. I realise what a sacrifice it
must have been to miss so much of the game - and all of the
goals! You kindly agreed to let me have some thoughts on the
financing of football, and if you send the papers direct to me at
the above address (Room 448), I shall ensure that they are drawn
to Lord Justice Taylor's attention.

Many thanks once again for all your help.

            I report                 that      I am            currently          engaged       in    the    role       of    Custody       Officer

            being         to         supervise                 the    pedestrians          and       coaches       at    the    roundabout          at

            morning,                 supporters                 began       to    arrive    in       the    area,       all    appeared       good

humoured           and      there        were     no    particular                 problems.

By    1 pm       the       pedestrian            traffic          had        built       up    and    it       was    noticeable

that    some          of    the     supporters              were        in    possession             of    cans       of    alcohol.

Two    of     my      serial        were       placed        in     Leppings             Lane    and       these       officers             were

preventing              supporters             continuing               any    further          down       Leppings             Lane

whilst        in      possession            of    cans       of     alcohol.              The    fact          that    the       supporter

in    possession              of    alcohol          were     stopped              fay t h e    police,          created          no

problems           and      the     supporters              were        quite       content          to    remain          in    the     area

to    consume           their       alcohol          prior        to     continuing             towards          the       football

stadium.              At    this        time     the    weather              was    fine       and    dry,       it    was       sunny       and

at    any     one       time       there       may     have       been        up    to    130    supporters                at    the     mouth

of    Leppings             Lane,        sitting        on    walls           and    standing          in       groups       drinking

The    pedes t r ian             t r a f f i c: i n c r e a s e d       and    at       just    a f te r 2       pm    t he r e w a s        a

surge       of     supporters             who     were       accompanied                 by    both       officers          on    foot       and

members          of     the      mounted         section          who        had    just       arrived          by    train       at     the

W a d s ley      Bridge          Railway         Station.               Again       there       was       no    problem          with       the

supporters              and      they,      in    the       main,        went       clown L e p p i n g s        Lane       towards          the

Stadiurn.

By    about        2.55       pm    it    was     noticeable                 that       the    pedestrian             traffic:         was

easing        down         considerably              and     at     two       or    three       minutes          past       three,

went    down          Leppings           Lane     towards           the       football          stadium          where          our    next

scheduled             duty       was     for     standby          duties           in    one    of    the       Force       coaches,

Leppings           Lane       by    this       time     was       virtually              clear       of    all       pedestrians             avid

upon    arrival             at     Leppings          Lane     there           were       approximately                200       police

officers           on      duty     outside          the     gate.            There       were       very       few    supporters                in

the    area        at      this     time       and     after        a    few       minutes       at       this       location          we

were    instructed                 to    form    a     cordon           across          the    mouth       of    the       Leppings

Lane    entrance.                  Information              was     then       received          that          the    football           match
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    RI39

had    been       stopped       and       X    immediately                farmed       the       opinion          that    there          was

mass    fighting          within          the       ground          amongst       the       supporters.              Supporters

then    began          leaving       the       stadium             via    the    Leppings             Lane    entrance          and          it

was    obvious          from    many          of    their          faces       that    they       had       been    in    some       form

of    distress.           Many       of       the       supporters             began       heckling          the    police          line,

shouting          that    we    should             be    in    the       ground       to    assist          the    disorder          and

not    be    stood       in    the       position             we    occupied.              The    exit       by    the    supporters

began       to    increase          and       after       a    few       minutes       I saw          a male       being       carried

out    of    the       Leppings          Lane       gate       by    police       officers.                 This    person          was

being       carried       face       d o w n w a r d s , his             body    limp       and       X could       see    a    liquid

constantly             running       from          his    mouth.           To    my    horror          I realised          that          the

man    was       dead.        The    body          was    placed          on    the    concrete             driveway       on       the

right       hand       side    as    one       enters          the       stadium       from       Leppings          Lane.           By

this    time       there       was       a mass          exodus          from    the       stadium          and    supporters

were    chanting          at    the       police,             " m u r d e r e r s , you      bastards,             i t ’s a l l      your

fault."          and    similar          obscenities.                    Further       bodies          were       then    carried

frorrt t h e      stadium       and       were          placed       on    the    right          hand       side    of    the

driveway.              Injured       persons             were       placed       on    the       left       hand    side       of    the

driveway          and    these       were          being       attended          to    by    police          officers          and

civilians.              Further          bodies          were       brought       from       the       stadium       and       placed

together          along       with       injured          persons.              The    scene          at    this    time       could

only    be       described          as    horrific.                 Acting       under       the       instructions             of

Inspector          Sykes,       my       serial          along       with       other       officers,             then    formed             a

cordon       in    front       of    the       bodies          to    screen       the       bodies          from    the    view          of

the    supporters             who    were          leaving          the    stadium.              In    total       1 believe

there       were       twelve       bodies          in    this       location          and       at    one    stage       I saw          a

lady    aged       approximately                   30    years,          she    was    walking             among    the    bodies

and    was       obviously          looking             for    a    particular             person.           She    was    quite

composed          in    view    of       the       horrific          circumstances                that       surrounded             her

and    after       a    few    minutes             she    left       the       area.        The       supporters          continued
                                                                                                                                 PAGE           4



to    shout       obscenities             at    the    police          lines       and    after          about          half    an    hour

barricades             were    placed          in    front       of    the       bodies    and       these          wre    draped          in

tarpauling             sheeting       therefore             screening             the    bodies          from       members          of

the    public.

The    Fire       Service       and       Ambulance          Service            were     both       in a t t e n d a n c e       and

they    were       experiencing                great       difficulty,             particularly                   the    Ambulance

Service       in       getting       into       the    stadium          via       the    Leppings             Lane       entrance

due    to    the       supporters          leaving.

Part    of    my       serial       were       then    directed             elsewhere          and       I    remained          in    this

area    until          most    of    the       bodies       and       the       injured    had       been          removed.           At

one    stage       at    the    height          of    the    incident,             whilst       forming             the    barricade

in    front       of    the    bodies,          near       Leppings             Lane    gate,       I was          approached             by

an    off    duty       fireman       who       offered          his    assistance.                 It       was    obvious          from

his    appearance             that    he       was    under       the       influence          of    a 1c o h o 1 and           I was

under       the    opinion          that       he    was    not       in a n y     fit    state          to       assist       anyone

and    I requested             him    to       leave       the    area.           This    man       I later             noticed

talking       to       other    police          officers,             presumably          offering                his    assistance

and    after       about       quarter          of    an    hour       he       came    back    to       me       and    I escorted

him    from       the    ground.

The    crowd       were       extremely             hostile       towards          the    police             and    on    two    occasion



I found       myself          isolated          and    it    became             apparent       to    me       the       dangers       in

such    a    situation          of    being          isolated.              1    remained       in       the       area    until

approximately             S    pm    at    which       time       all       the    supporters,                the       injured

persons       and       the    bodies          had    been       removed          from    the       area.

I    later    returned          to    the       Hillsborough                Ground       and    joined             other       members

of    the    detail.

I found       the       whole       incident          horrific          and       left    me    with          a    stunned       feeling.

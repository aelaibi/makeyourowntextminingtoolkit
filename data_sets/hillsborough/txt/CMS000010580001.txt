Dear Peter

I am sure you will recall our meeting and correspondence just over a year ago in
the light of the Taylor Report on the Hillsborough disaster. We have made pretty
good progress in our conversion of Twickenham to an all seated stadium. In fact
our standing or terraced capacity is reduced to 5,000 out of 60,000, compared
with 18,000 out of 65,000 a few years ago.

In conversation with Tom Pendry MP, who visited us recently, I am sure he said
that the requirements of the Taylor Report no longer applied to grounds other than
football stadia. I would be most grateful if you could confirm whether or not this
is the case.

It is still our intention to make Twickenham an all seated stadium but the 5,000
standing places are located in the West Stand which will almost certainly be the
last of our stands to be rebuilt. You would understand that we would prefer not
to go to the expense of installing seats in the standing places in a stand which we
are proposing to demolish in a few years time.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,




Secretary

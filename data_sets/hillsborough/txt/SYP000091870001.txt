We    left N o t t i n g h a m at about   11.30 am      (1130)    and drove d irept         to     .

Sheffi e 1 d , we had an uneventful              j ou rn ey and a rrive           about     12.30pm-

1.00 pm (1230           300)



We    parked the      car    in a side    road a b ou t    five m i nu t e s walk      from the

g round and t hen went          off   together     to   look for a pub.           We    could not

find one near the g ro un d but found one a bout 20 m i nu t es walk a w a y »                               I

can't      tell you the name of„, the           pub or w here     it was.        The    pub>wgs full

of L iverpool        supporters.



I did not see any trouble               b etween fans or w i t h      police     or others       then

in the      pub.      I did not see any fans            drinking.          We had two      pints    in

the    pub and      I also   bought     some food from a n earby shop.



At no time         on my way to the g round was            I checked by the Police,

although      I did see quite a lot of P o li c e             in the area.



Me and             , to ge th er w i th some ot>ef        lads from N o t t i n g h a m had met up

and we all went         down to t h^ tj r o u n d t og et he r at a bout 2 . 2Qjmr^(1420) ,

whi ch is the t ime we^Sfr^rTved outs id e              the turnst i 1 ^ g ^and^the L ep p in g s

Lane    end of the^/fround,



W h en we a r r i v e d t t y r a nly P olice    I saw/fJutside the g ro un d were a couple

t ryi ng       get to the turnstiles                I j oi ne d the mass <5f fans.



It took a long time            for us to get to the t ur ns t il e s          it was     quite a

crush,      in fact    it was so bad that at one time               I was     f r i g h t e n e d that   I

was going      to get hurt,       but     I could not get out         so    I just went on w it h
                                                                                                             PAGE         :

      the    crush slowly towards                    the turnstiles,          Whi 1 e L w r S     in this

      p osition       I did,„see some               fans up on the                the wall a bo ve         the

      turnstij^s         but    I d o n ’t know how they got there.                      I e v e n t u a l l y got to

      orj^of      the    t urnstile           I d o n ’t know w h i c h one and        I got    into the ground.

      I h anded my ticket              in to the t urnsti le           operator.



      At no time did            I see any gates             other    than the     turnstiles,         either      being

      o p en ed or standing            open.



      When     I got th ro ug h the t urnsti le s                I did not see a ny P ol ic e          or stewards

      telling       the fans w here             to go.         I thou gh t    it w o u ld be very full           right

      b eh in d the      goal     so me and                 went        the    right    of the     stand    into

      what     I now know to be P en no                            the terrace,



      I did not at          that      stage         take m uc h notice       of what was       h ap pe n in g a part

      from what was            going on on the             pitch.      The     game    started,     and a short

      time     later     I saw fans            from the     pen onp»y'''left hand side             trying    to

      climb over         the front        fence ontq^'tThe          pitch .      The P o li c e O f f i c e r s on

      the    pitch we re pushing                t       back    into the terraces,



^   *jJAt that' stage          I ^Kad not got a clue what was going                      on a pa rt    from the

      fact    that the         pens    behi nd the goal we re v e r y ^ f u l 1.            I then saw a

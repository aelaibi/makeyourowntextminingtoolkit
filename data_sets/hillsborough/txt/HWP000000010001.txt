         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
         F.A. LETTER TO CLUBS, DATED 17TH APRIL,   1989

         (CBS/159/89)

         REPORT OF THE CITY BUILDING SURVEYOR
         (Officer Contact : L.N. Bush - Tel. 225 3395)

         1.   The agenda for the meeting of the Working Party on the 12th May 1989
              included a copy of a letter dated 17th April 1989, from the Football
              Association, to all member clubs.   It was headed 'Ground Safety' and
              the Working Party has asked the City Building Surveyor to report upon
              its terms.

         2.   Immediately following Hillsborough, the relevant letter asked clubs
              to review their ground safety in the light of that disaster.      It
              picked out three obvious possible defects, which were so clearly the
              cause,   or   contributed to,  such   extensive  loss  of  life,  at
              Hillsborough.

              (1)   Overcrowding -   'the agreed capacity levels of all standing
                    areas ' .

              (2)   Access, direction and control of spectators - 'the routes
                    to and from the ground'.

              (3)   Spectator penning - 'pitch perimeter fencing installed'.

         3.   These matters are set out in order of their importance in relation to
              the causes of the high life loss, in the opinion of the City Building
              Surveyor.   One must endorse the object of the letter, to avoid a
              repeat of the Hillsborough tragedy, but regret its need, when the
              safety of spectators at football grounds has been the subject of
              specific enforceable legislation for over 13 years.   Not all grounds
              have been required to hold a 'General Safety Certificate', issued by
              a Local Authority, .for that time.   International and first division
              grounds were the first to be designated for that need, on 1st January
              1977.   Others, subject to them having a capacity exceeding 10,000,
              have followed, with all league clubs included following the Bradford
              disaster.   The Hillsborough ground has required such a Certificate
              since 1st January 1979.

         4.   The legislation which gives the Secretary of State power to designate
              fcoLball  (and other) grounds,     followed a report- by T <->rd Justice
              Wheatley, of 1972, in the wake of the I b r o x 'Park disaster.    At that
              time, it was thought that the work of Building Control Surveyors was
              to move to County level on the reorganisation of local government,
              due in 1974.   Lord Wheatley therefore recommended-- that, because that
              was  the predominant   resource and expertise needed,        the duty be
              allocated to County Councils.       In the event, Building Control was
              left at District Council level, in the course of the relevant Bill
              passing  through Parliament.       Consequently   the  Safety   of  Sports
              Grounds Act 1975 had to bring in the required expertise by giving the
              Building   Control   Authority    (District   Councils)    a   status   of
              "interested party".     This   gave   them a right of appeal against

              anything provided in, or not provided in, any Safety Certificate
              issued by a County Council.   They were expected to be included in any
              group at County level dealing with such matters.

         5.   Most Counties honoured that need, although some did not and tried to
               manage the job on their own.       That was illustrated dramatically in
               the Bradford Disaster, where the County, including its Fire Brigade,
               acted with such an apalling lack of responsibility in allowing a
               known dangerous condition to continue and cause the death of 56
               people   on 11th    May 1985.   The Chief Building     Surveyor for the
               District      Council of Bradford had never been consulted about the
               Valley Parade ground prior to that event.       His normal professional
               role and expertise in the enforcement of Building Control, which
               includes fire safety, if it had been used, would have prevented that
               disaster. Mr. Justice Popplewell picked       up this omission, in his
               investigation of the Bradford disaster, and made     the future need to
               avoid it part of his recommendations for safety.     (Cmnd. 9710, paras.
               3.77 to 3.80.)

         6.   This   distant    relationship   between the  County    function   and  the
               principal expertise needed, should have been removed for Metropolitan
               authorities when the Metropolitan District Counties were dismantled
               in 1986.    It had never been a problem here in Liverpool, because the
               City Building Surveyor had controlled both the designated grounds of
               Liverpool and Everton-, by other legislation covering places of public
               resort and with good voluntary co-operation from both clubs, since
               1970.    The Merseyside County valued that experience and the other
               controls     operated by him, over buildings      and building work. The
               situation was assisted by the fact that it only had the two grounds
               in the City to certify, so that only two (Local Authority) parties
               had to agree how the work would be done.             Therefore, the City
               Building    Surveyor   maintained   the principal    role   on  behalf   of
               Liverpool Council in the period from 1977 to 19S6.        This facilitated
               the efficient transfer of the certification duty, with no indecision
               and with no break in continuity.

         7.   The   same   happy   position did   not  necessarily    apply  in  other
              Metropolitan Districts in 1986.    Having had little, if any, dealings
              with the matter during the County regime,        a quick and effective
              resolution of the best system to adopt, when the work came to
              District level, was not immediately achieved everywhere.         In some
              cases, like Sheffield, there appears to have followed a division of
              the   function   between  a number   of  officers,   and no   delegation
              whatsoever.    It remains to be determined if and to what extent that
              contributed to the Hillsborough disaster, but it is not a system,
              which automatically produces consistent,      responsible and positive
              attention to safety in the use of any premises.

         8.   In   those  circumstances,  the   role  of  the  Police  becomes  more
              problematic also.   Whilst they have the predominant authority outside
              football grounds in relation to traffic and the behaviour of people,
              they are not the sole arbiters of safety inside the grounds.      This
              means that they ought to adapt their control outside to suit the
              situation at and in the ground itself.      However, the problem that
              arises for them, in many situations, is that in an emergency or any

NBBAAY
                                            - 3 -


               exceptional circumstances they may become responsible for the general
               safety of persons and property, even on private property, within the
               ground.    Experience in public gatherings, crowd control and football
               ground work has     indicated, that if there    is a responsible and
               positive approach to these matters by the Local Authority, the Police
               will respond readily to that and adjust their own expertise to
               fit in with that.       Where the Local Authority lacks firmness or
               direction, the Police tend to take over that responsibility as a
               matter of necessity, bearing in mind their possible ultimate role in
               emergency.     In doing that,   they may not    only usurp  the Local
               Authority Officers' role, but also that of the property owner (the
               football club), who carries basic legal liability for the safety of
               persons using the premises.

         9.    It is in the above circumstances, which were possibly illustrated by
               the Hillsborough disaster, that football clubs have been asked by the
               F.A. to review if they and the Local (Certifying) Authority are
               taking their responsibilities seriously enough.  It is hoped that all
               the clubs and the Local Authorities will carry out that review
               urgently and thoroughly.

         10.   Locally, such a review has been undertaken by me with the Boards and
               Executives of both Liverpool and Everton Clubs, and was completed
               before the F.A. letter was received by them.       Overcrowding is not
               possible in the majority of enclosures at these grounds, because the
               numbers  entering  such enclosures   are counted    and controlled by
               turnstiles exclusive to those enclosures.   No person is allowed into
               either ground without passing through a turnstile,        or holding a
               ticket/invitation  for the   press  or directors'    box,   or for  the
               sponsors' areas, or for a rented box.     Visitors' standing areas at
               Anfield are similarly controlled, whilst the same for Goodison Park
               (the Park End) has reasonably balanced turnstile access coupled with
               specified steward monitoring and Police assistance whilst it is being
               filled.

         11.   Pitch perimeter fencing, at both grounds has been removed, subject to
               detailed agreement, for the remainder of this season and for the next
               season,  on the alternate provisions     to prevent pitch invasions,
               coupled with positive monitoring and the establishment of further
               measures  for this purpose    if that should be anticipated    to be
               necessary.

         12.   Routes to and from the ground for visitors are constantly dealt with
               by a full-time (Football) Police Inspector.      He liaises with the
               clubs concerned for every match, and of course the experience of the
               Police here, where good capacity crowds are a regular feature, is
               very good.   With that, and the layout of turnstile entrances to both
               grounds here, orderly queueing and crowd control outside the grounds,
               precludes a Hillsborough, Leppings Lane entrance situation being a
               possibility.

Mr Storr

You asked for advice on the attached letter of 6 D e c e m b e r                     from
Sheffield City Council about the p r o vision of ambulance
services at football matches.                                          ^




The interim report of Lord Justice Taylor into the
H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster recommends that "at least one fully
e quipped ambulance from the appropriatfe ambulance a u t hority
 should be in a ttendance at all matches wit h an expected crowd
of 5,000 or more".           W h a t constitutes "fully equipped"                is a
m a t t e r for the a m bulance authority.            But if the authority
 p r o v i d e d an army or police ambulance that would.we b e l i e v e , .
 fulfil the Taylor r e c o m m e n d a t i o n p r o vided that they were
 sat i s f i e d that the a m b ulance was fully equipped.


 In Sheffield this is all rather hypothetical since I
 un d e r s t a n d from the D e p a r t m e n t of He a l t h that the amb u l a n c e
 service has g u a r a n t e e d to provide qu a l i f i e d NHS ambulance
 p e r s o n n e l and vehicles at the City's Football League G r o u n d s
 using those staff w h o are working n o r mally during the-dispute.
 So far cover has appar e n t l y been p r o v i d e d as guaranteed.

For Signature by PS to S of S



The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter
of   6 December about the provision of ambulance services at
football matches.


The terms and conditions contained in a safety certificate are
a m a t t e r for the issuing authority.            Recommendation 42 of the
H i l l s b o r o u g h Inquiry Interim report has the effect of drawing
the a ppropriate amb u l a n c e authority         into the consideration and
p r o v i s i o n of ambulance cover if a crowd of at least 5000 is
e x p e c t e d at a football m a t c h . O u r   view is that an ambulance
p r o v i d e d by or on be h a l f of the ambulance authority would
fulfil the objective of that recommendation.


We hav e consulted the D e partment of Health about the provision
of cover during the ambulance dispute.                 We understand that on
19 September the Chief Ambulance Offi c e r of South Yorkshire
A m b u l a n c e Service w r o t e to Mr Bouesels of your Administrative
a nd Legal D epartment guaranteeing cover by qualified NHS
a m b u l a n c e personnel at all the City's Football League G r o u n d s .
Since then apparently all football matches w hich have required
c over have been p r o vided w ith it.            We u n derstand that the
A m b u l a n c e Service wil l continue to provide cover and that the
C h i e f Ambulance Officer would be happy to confirm this with
the C o u n c i l .   <*

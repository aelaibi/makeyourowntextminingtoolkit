          was     dead          and       I    c o u l d n ’t              help          him.When                I fell           over           t he      fao d y s o m e o n e

          stood        on       my    chest          and           my       h a n d s , I d o n ’t                     know       if     I blacked                        out            for        a

          couple        of       seconds             but           the          next          thing          I    remember               was          two           lads             picking

          me     up    and       asking             me     if        I was               alright.                 I wiped              my       face         and               started                  to

          shout        ’o p e n       the         gates.’                      I was          shouting                 with       this          man        to           open             the        back

          but     people             were         pushing                  as       they          came        out       of       the      tunnel                i nt o              t h e pe n .

I e v e n t u a 11y           got       out       through                the       tunnel.              1    c o u l d n *t b r e a t h            b e ca u s e

my    cheat         was       hurting             me.              I was          crawling             out       and    a    policeman              just

stood         and       watched           me.             A    man       dragged             me    out       and       said,       ‘G o      on     mate        get-

out      t h e r e 5 When            I got            out          of    the       stand          I just          broke       down          and      cried.

Eventually                I got         myself                pulled          together             and       I    ran       back       into        the    tunnel

and      into       the       stand          to       look             for                       Ian    and       Phil,.       There             was     so     much

panic         in    the       tunnel          and             there          was       bodies          lying       everywhere.                     I managed

to    get      back        onto         the       terracing                   I    could          not       see    anyone          of       my     mates.          I

started            to    help        people               carry          the       injured             and       dead       bodies          o ut    of    t he

tunnel         and        put      them       out             of       the    way.           The       next       thing       was       some         police

shhoOuUl d     be       giving          it    to          us       free       what          we    had       just       been    through.                  He

replied            that       we     were         hooligans.                       Two       other          men    heard       what          he     said        and

threatened                him.          He    apologised                      and       the       fans       walked          away.           I stood

drinking            my     drink          arid w a t c h i n g                the       police          carry          bodies          out.          I saw        one

body      w h i ch        iiad t h e         same             clothes             on    as       Jason       was       wearing          1    ran       over       to

it    but      it       w a s n ’t                    .        1 then             saw                   and       we    ran    towards              each

other         and       put     our       arms            around             each       other.              By    this       time       it       was     about         3,

45pm      ( 1 5 4 5)       and       we      made             our       way       back       to    the       coach.           At    about           6.15pm

(1800)         we       were       on     the         coach             and     we      set       back       off       for    Liverpool.                  I

never         saw       Phil       after          I       lost          sight          of    him       and       when       I went




                                                               I also             learnt          that       Philip          HAMMOND             had     been

one      of    the       lads        who      was             killed.

             1    sustained       bruising            to      my       right       shoulder          and       chest.        My    ribs       were

             also    sore     and       bruised.

             On    Monday     17th       April        (170489)               I went        into      work       because          I was       anxious

             to    ensure     that       my    work        colleagues                knew      that       I    was    all    right.           1 did

             not    want    them        telephoning                my    parents, upsetting                      them.           1 did       not    do

             much    wark.

I went          to the m a t c h wit h my friend

Widnes          and t r av el le d          down    in my     car.
                                                                           \        /

(1130 hrs),                 w h i c h was    early enough          to arrive                in good time       for       the

match.



The       route we           took, was a lo ng         the    M62 and then onto                     the M1   just        past    the

turn off for                 Leeds. We       e x p er ie nc ed       quite      bad hold ups             on the H62

around          the M a n c h es te r        area    due     to the sheer               vo 1 u m e ^ y f ^ t r a f f i c and also

a number             of     road works,          1 w ould estimate             that          ti># hold ups      resulted           in

as being             delayed       for about         1 hour a r r i v i n g at               the outskirts          of

As we          left       the m ot o r w a y     there were        signs       di r e c t i n g      us to the ground.

I d i d n ’t see             a lot of ^Police           on the way,            but          there were some who were

checking             coaches.          On the way           1 saw S u p p o r t e r s         drinking       from beer

cans,          the    crowds were            in high spirits            but     I d i d n ’t really notice any

e x c es s i v e d ru n k e n e s s         on the way,          1 c a n ’t remember                seeing any       pubs       open,



I parked my car                   in a side         street about          twenty minutes walk                   from

of supp o r t e r s            parking       their    cars ar o u n d      there.



O n the way to the                   ground        1 d o n ’t remember          seeing many Police Officers,

I saw a few standing about                           we d i d n ’t receive any d i rections                         to the

We got          to the L e p p in gs Ln end of the                     ground at /about 2 .30                  pm    (1430

outside               were                getting        impatient             after a time                 the    crowd just         surged at

in front                      of the             turnstiles.



T here was                     no Police                d i r e c t i o n and a tot^sl                 lack or o r g a n i s a t i o n , by

this     point                     it was          too    late to stair W o rgani s i ng and the                                crowd were         just

mo v i n g as one for                              the    turnstiles-                     I have       been to m a n y football

matc h e s            but have                    never     been         in a crowd              like that           it was        u n bearable and

very fr ightening.                                     I believe             that    people would have                    been killed

outside                in the                crush       it was          that       bad.         Me and                      tried to get.

into a queue                              for     the    t u r nstile          but there were                 none,       I had no control

over where                         I was          going     just         being       carried along w i t h the                      crowd,     I

can't        recall                       seeing any               stewards at all                outside           the ground.



After about 30 m in ut es                                   in the            crush we rnan^fged to get                      in through a

and w a l k ed                     into          the    ground,          the f ir st / t h i n g            I did was        tie my shoe

the area to the                                  left    of the          turnstiles,              the       time must have            been about

Me and                                   n o r mally      stand          to the side              of the goals as                  the area

to the     right      of the       large       tunnel      thinking         t h at/uiis w o u l d      lead to the

side    terracing          in fact       it    led to the          s e a t j / so we w a l k e d back      into

the    '•courtyard'        area,        I c o u l d n ’t see a/fy sig n p o s t s            or d i rections      to

the    side     terracing and            thought-, thaj/if            we went        down the      centre    tunnel

w e ’d be able        to spr e a d out          to rffe side at this                 time we d i d n ’t realise

that    there was          side    fencing w h i c h stop p e d             that.



As we were          standing       trying       to find our way               to the t e r racing        I saw a

Pol i c e Offi c e r       open a       large       blue    conce r t i n a gate       to the      left of the

t urnstiles,         as this       h a p p en ed a l^rge           crowd of       peo p]<^f passed through

the gate and headed                straight          for    the    t u n n e l , mey a n d             had started

to walk along          the     tunnel         b ut were      hit    by this / m a s s i v e     wave    of people

from the        back and       carried along               towards      t\ye terracing.            It was    our

i n t entio n      to go to the          right,       but due       t y the mass        of poeple        it was

impossible.           When we hit             the    t e r r a c i n y from the       tunnel      it was    just

like hitting a wail                of    p e o p l e , the yime was            now just after 3 o'c'iock

.( 15Q 0 hrs),       the teams were             j ustVaifout        to kick-off.



I was     stuck at the            back    of the        t e rracing      unable       to move w hen there was

a ,surqe from the            back,       I ’m s u r e from the           tunne 1s w hich forced             us about

half w a y down the            terracing.             My feet were            o/T the floor,           my arms     were

pinned agai n s t          my body and          I was       not abler to move at all,                  shortly

after     this      there was a second surge ajra the                          crush then became

unbearable.           I was       squashed          b e t w e e / a number      of    people,     the sweat was

pouring       out of me and             I was       havimg    difficulty         breathing all           I was

doing was          concent rating\ on wa%               breathing        as    I ’ve said the          crush was

un b e a ra bl e    people were          panicking.           I remember         the bloke        next     to me was

s c r eaming       I was    f ri gh te ne d     for my       life,     at     this    time     I had been

I saw a gate at           the    front       open and thought               that was       the way out,           I was

trying     to get f or w a r d        taut it was        impossible,,          I suppose          I must       have

been     in the    crush for about             10 minutes,            at this       time my b r e athing was

gett i n g a     lot worse.           I was making          g u r gling      noises,       I must admit           1

thought my time was              up.      I have        been shown a grid map of the L e p p i n g s

Ln end by PC                     of the W M i d l a n d s Po l i c e           on w hich         I have marked

w here    I entered the t e rracing               with the         figure       1, and my final                position

as 2,     I produce       this    as exhibit                 1 (Pol Ref No.                               ).

After     more    crushing       I was       tota l l y exhausted,            my    legs were weak

a l t h o u g h my feet w er en 't        on the        floor,     my      chest was       hurting        I must

have     passed out,       but    I didn't         collapse,          the    crowd was           holding me up.

I clash ed heads wit h            the     bloke        next to me who also               passed out,            I don't

know how        long    I was    out,     the next         thing      I remember w as             that    I had

f a l le n back and was          s.lumped on the floor.                     I remember a lad standing

over me        slapping    my face w hi c h was             bringing me            round,        somehow the

stood     up and       looked towards          the      front    of the        terracing          just    in front

of me,     about       half way down          I saw a pile            of    people     on the floor one                   of

weak and groggy           I g ra bb ed       hold of                       arm and tried to              pull    him

just     to the    left of the .tunnel , where                   I got                  into the         recovery

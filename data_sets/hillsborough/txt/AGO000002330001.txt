       Hillsborough


       I mentioned the other day that the Home Secretary had received
       a petition from the Hillsborough Family Support Group calling
       for the Director to reconsider his decision not to prosecute
       individuals or organisations in the light of their role in the
       Hillsborough stadium disaster.  It also requests an
       investigation of that decision.

       The Attorney General has replied setting out the        manner     in
       which the case was approached   and saying that he      is in
S'     agreement with the decision.   I enclose herewith       a copy      ofhis
       letter.   I am also forwarding  (in two Rank Xerox      boxes) the
       petition.

The Home Secretary has passed to me the petition delivered to him
about the decision taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions
not to institute any criminal proceedings against arising out of
the Hillsborough disaster.                  I recognise the strength of feeling
which      remains     following      the    tragic      events      at Hillsborough       as
evidenced by the many signatures on the petition.


The decision taken by the Director followed a careful analysis
of all the evidence assembled by the West Midlands police in what
was      by    any     standards       a     thorough         and    detailed     criminal
 investigation.        That investigation had the benefit of the equally
 thorough report submitted to the Home Secretary by Lord Justice
Taylor following his public inquiry.                     The inquiry had identified
many factors leading to the disaster,                         ranging from the purely
historical       (e.g.      the    layout         of    the   stadium),       through     the
 assessment          and    supervision           of     safety       requirements,        to
 shortcomings in the policing arrangements on the day.                           These had
 all combined in differing proportions to produce the disaster.


The     question      of   criminal        liability      fell      to be    determined by
 reference not to the overall picture which had been established
by the evidence, but to an analysis of the individual conduct of
 each     potential        defendant        and    to    whether       his    conduct     was
 sufficiently proximate to the disaster to constitute what the law
describes as a "substantial operating cause".
To    establish     liability    for   manslaughter      in    respect     of   any
individual the prosecution would have had to establish beyond
reasonable doubt the following:


(a)   that   he   had    done   something,   or   omitted      to do     something
        which it was his duty to do, being in either case reckless
        as to whether death or serious injury would result; and


(b)   that such an      act or omission had been a substantial cause
        of a death.


Careful consideration was given by the Director to the position
of all those whose conduct could be regarded as having a bearing
on the tragedy.         This included the football club itself,              those
responsible for the design and safety aspects of the stadium, and
those    responsible      for    enforcement      of   the     relevant     safety
legislation       together   with   the police.        The    Director    had   the
benefit of advice from two very experienced leading counsel.                     He
came to the       conclusion that      the evidence     was    insufficient      to
create                   a realistic prospect of securing a conviction
of any person for manslaughter or any other criminal offence.
I concur with his decision.


You will be aware that the Divisional Court has recently declined
to grant leave for judicial review of that decision.                     There can
therefore be no question of criminal proceedings at this stage
but I can however assure you and all those who have signed the
petitionytne case has been considered with great care                      and no
little Sympathy.

SOLICITOR GENERAL
DRAFT LETTER FOR SIGNATURE OF ATTORNEY GENERAL TO:




Philip Hammond Esq
Hillsborough Family Support Group




The Home Secretary has passed to me the petition delivered to him
about the decision taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions
not to institute any criminal proceedings against arising out of
                                                                                              Q.
the Hillsborough disaster.                   I recognise the strength of feeling
which remains         following     the          tragic    events       at Hillsborough as
evidenced by the many signatures on the petition.


The decision taken by the Director followed a careful analysis
of all the evidence assembled by the West Midlands police in what
was   by      any     standards         a     thorough           and    detailed        criminal
investigation.           That investigation had the benefit of the equally
thorough report submitted to the Home Secretary by Lord Justice
Taylor following his public inquiry.                        The inquiry had identified
many factors leading to the disaster,                           ranging from the purely
historical      (e.g.       the    layout          of     the    stadium),        through          the
assessment          and    supervision             of      safety        requirements,              to
shortcomings in the policing arrangements on the day.                                   These had
all combined in differing proportions to produce the disaster.


The question         of    criminal         liability       fell       to be    determined by
reference not to the overall picture which had emerged, but on
the   basis    of    an    analysis         of    the     individual          conduct    of    each
potential      defendant          and       whether        his     or    her     conduct           was
sufficiently proximate to the disaster to constitute what the law
describes      as    a    "substantial           operating        cause".        To     establish
liability      for manslaughter              in    respect        of    any    individual          the
prosecution would have had to establish beyond reasonable doubt
that he or she (a) had intentionally done an act, or omitted to
do   an   act whether   there   was     a duty     to do    so,   being grossly
negligent whether death or serious injury would result; and (b)
such as act or omission had been a substantial operating cause
of the deaths.


Careful consideration was given by the Director to the position
of all those whose conduct could be regarded as having a bearing
on the tragedy.     This included the football club itself, those
responsible for the design and safety aspects of the stadium as
well as those responsible for enforcement of the relevant safety
legislation    together with         the police.      The   Director    had    the
benefit of advice from two very experienced leading counsel.                      He
came to the conclusion that the evidence was insufficient for
there to be a realistic prospect of securing a conviction of any
person    for manslaughter      or    any other     criminal      offence   and    I
concur with his decision.


You will be aware that the Divisional Court has recently declined
to grant leave for judicial review of that decision.                   There can
therefore be no question of criminal proceedings at this stage
but I can however assure you and all those who have signed the
petition the case has been considered with great care                       and no
little sympathy.

     On Friday, 16 November I received, on the Home
Secretary's behalf, a petition from the Hillsborough
Family Support Group.

     The petition calls for the Director of Public
Prosecutions to reconsider his decision not to
prosecute individuals or organisations in the light of
their role in the Hillsborough Stadium disaster; the
petition   also  requests   the   Home   Secretary  to
investigate this decision.     These are, of course,
matters for your office and I agreed with one of your
Private Office colleagues this morning that I would
transfer   the  petition   to   your   Department  for
consideration. I have informed the Hillsborough Family
Support Group of the transfer.

     The petition papers are rather bulky, and I am
sending them separately from this letter.

Prosecutions to reconsider his decision not to

their roles in the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. This

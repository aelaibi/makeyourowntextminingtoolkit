Dated                 030389                                                              Signed


           I am Police Constable 1105 Hurman of the South Yorkshire Police

           presently employed as a Mounted Officer at the NIAGARA stables,

          Sheffield.

          At Sam on Saturday 15th April           1989,   I commenced duty Niagara stables

           for the occasion of the SEMI-FINAL of the football              league taking

           place at Hillsborough football ground between LIVERPOOL and

          NOTTINGHAM FOREST.          K.O.   time 3pm.    My breifing for the day in

           company with PC S550 Gillott was to receive the Notting Forest

           supports    (travelling by coach) at the South Yorkshire Transport

          Depot, Merries Rd and subsequently to direct them up Herries Rd

           towards Herries Rd South.          A further 2 mounted officers were deployed

           at Herries Rd South directing the same supporters to the turnstiles

           in PENISTONE RD.         I commenced duty at this location at 11.30am and

          was under the direct         command of Insp Charles.

          The mood of the Nottingham Forest supporters was that of a *CARNIVAL

          NATURE*, a large majority consisting of families and friends all                  in

           good humour.        They were general I all well     behaved, marred by one

           isolated incident when a group of approximately 15“20 supporters

           tried to make their way towards the LIVERPOOL end that is towards

          Leppings Lane.         They were very quickly      'POINTED*   in the right
                                                                          PAGE
                                                                          R 3 In­

direct ion b y myself and PC GILLOTT.

At 2.40pm,    I heard a transmission over personal      radio    (which was on

’talk thro ug h’ ) by PS 1764 THOMAS   (MOUNTED)   requesting addition

horses at LEPPINGS LANE end of the ground.         I did not hear PS 1764

THOMAS ’S request answered by control .     During the briefing,, myself

and PC 2550 Gillott were    instructed to standdowri for meal at 2.4 5 p m .

I informed Insp Charles of this fact and at 2.50pm,         in view of the

fact that all the coaches had arived and the majority of the

Nottinghafii Forest supporters were    in the ground;   he instructed us to

return to the stables.     I must stress and be most emphatic about this

point,    that at this moment   in time both ourselves and Insp Charles

were not aware of the situation already developing at LEPPINGS LANE.

Whilst entering the junction of Leppi ngs Lane/Penistone Rd North,

there was a large crowd of LIVERPOOL supporters making their way down

Penistone Rd towards Leppings Lane.      They were in a rowdy mood, and a

hurry,    because there was only a few minutes to K.O.          There was a

strong smell of alcohol    eminating from the large crowd, many fans

were carrying cans of beer/lager,      and due to the vast amount of

people it was impossible to arrest any one person.

At 3pm,    I was entering the Niagara complex when I heard a radio

transmission to the effect that a serious situation was developing at

Leppings Lane turnstiles    involving persons being crushed,         and that

immediate assistance was required.       In view of this PC Gillott went

directly to Leppings Lane turnstiles.

I remained at Niagara due to the fact      I was riding a young horse.

The horse was involved in only i t ’s 2nd football match, and 1 felt

that under the circumstances and the seriousness of the situation it

would be unwise not to involve her.       I remained at Niagara stables

throughout the incident, and was in no way involved or attended at

Leppings L a n e .

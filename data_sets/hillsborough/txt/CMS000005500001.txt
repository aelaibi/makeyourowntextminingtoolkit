Thank you for your further letter of 3 January about the
development and re-development of football s t a d i a . h a v e taken
advice from the Treasury on your suggestion that the same
industrial buildings relief should be available for the
construction costs of the development of a new stadium or the
redevelopment of an existing stadium irrespective of location
is currently allowed in development areas.  The Treasury assume
that you are referring to the relief available in enterprise
zones and it may be helpful therefore if I say something about
the enterprise zone scheme.

The Scheme was introduced in 1980 on an experimental basis, with
a view to seeding how far industrial and commercial activity
could be encouraged in areas of physical and economic decay.   The
aim was to reduce or remove certain tax burdens and relax or
speed up the application of certain statutory or administrative
controls.  Each zone l^ts for 10 years and the main tax incentive
is a special 100% initial allowance for capital expenditure on
industrial and commercial buildings.^However, the early zones
are now coming to the end of their 10 year lives and you may be
interested to know that in December 1987 the Government announced
that a general extension of the enterprise zone scheme was not
desirable.  As a result, no_jiew zones or extensions of existing
zones will be created,         in exceptional circumstances.  The
Treasury have noted your proposal and it will be carefully
considered in the run up to the Budget.    In the circumstances I
hope you will appreciate that it would be inappropriate to
comment further at this time.

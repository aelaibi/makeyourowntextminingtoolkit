SHEFFIELD HILLSBOROUGH ^ISASTER


I enclose a photo-copy of my report on the above disaster
which was sent to Lord Justice Taylor and to the then
Chief Constable of West Midlands Police.

I am concerned that some of the points raised in my report
have been raised by other sections of the Sheffield
community involved at the time of the disaster and I inquire
if it would be possible to place before you some of these
details?

I am aware that West Midlands Police have not yet completed
their inquiries, but purely place before you my offer.

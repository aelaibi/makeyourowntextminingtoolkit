Following our meeting yesterday, I have got a fix on three things -

        a)      the provenance of the ‘ten unanswered questions’;
        b)      the videos referred to by Alun Jones QC; and
        C)      transcripts of the Taylor Inquiry.

2.      The clear recollection in the Home Office, though it is not explicitly borne out by file
records, is that the ‘ten unanswered questions’ first surfaced when Granada TV wrote to
David Maclean MP, then a Home Office Minister, in November last year about their
forthcoming programme (shown on 5 December). The TV company’s letter said they had
made the programme with the co-operation of the Hillsborough families.

3.     Peter Kilfoyle MP (Labour, Liverpool Walton) then itemised these questions in the
House of Commons Adjournment debate on the tragedy on 17 December 1996. It seems to
me that they are the result of a number of people putting their heads together - the Family
Support Group, the Granada TV people and possibly Mr Houldsworth.

4.      You asked if we had the videos referred to by Alun Jones QC at paragraph 6 of his
advice of 3 March. I think we do - they are the tapes marked ‘ 1 P Hammond’ and ‘2 P
Hammond’ which I have today given to Mr Catherall. Phil Hammond (vice-chairman of the
Families Support Group) has also provided, presumably by way of contrast, an ‘edited copy
of tape TB2 shown to (the Inquest) jury. I have given that to Graham also. Please note that
we have no spare copies o f these three tapes.

5.     The main item which I have given to Graham today is a set of five files from the
Public Record Office in Kew containing parts of the parts of the transcript of the oral hearings
at Lord Taylor’s Inquiry which you asked to see. The file numbers are HO/397/44, 49, 50,
52 and 53. You asked me to pick out the transcripts for some particular witnesses and I have
done that, attaching flags which I hope will help.

 6.     The attached note gives details.
7.      Finally, I have been in touch with the BBC Legal Department about their tapes of
Hillsborough. They did of course release copies (or the originals) to the Taylor Inquiry, and
since then they have made copies available to various personal injury litigants. They are
currently tracking the originals down and I expect there will be some news on this soon.

Transcript details

NOTE       - each file is put together back to front - for example, file HO/397/52 has the
transcript for the afternoon of 7 June at the back and the morning of )k8 June at the front.
Some of the files have pouches (brown paper envelopes) attached to them. Where that
happens, they contain the nest set of proceedings - the pouch at the back of HO/397/52
contains the afternoon of 8 June and the morning of 9 June.

This all makes steering one’s way through the papers a little difficult. But there is some logic
to it.

List of the transcripts you asked to see follows, with where they are found -

Duckenfield - file 48, Wednesday 24 May 1989 - Duckenfield starts -
              continues through Thursday 25 May (all on 48) -
              file 48 pouch, Friday 26 May, Duckenfield stops.

Tackson        - file 48 pouch, Friday 26 May, Jackson starts (right after Duckenfield) -
                 no session on Monday 29 May (Bank Holiday I suppose) - file 49, Tuesday
                 30 May p.m., Jackson stops.

Marshall       - starts right after Jackson (file 49, Tuesday 30 May p.m.) - stops file 49,
                 Wednesday 31 May 1989 p.m.

Murray         - starts where Marshall stops (file 49, Wednesday 31 May 1989 p.m.) - stops
                 file 50, Thursday 1 June 1989 a.m.

Greenwood      - starts where Murray stops (file 50, Thursday 1 June 1989 a.m.) - stops file
                 50, Thursday 1 June p.m.

Crawford         starts file 52, Wednesday 7 June p.m. - stops later in that session.

Bichard        - starts file 53, Monday 12 June a.m. - stops file 50 Monday 12 June p.m.

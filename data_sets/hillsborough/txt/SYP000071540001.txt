                    Once inside the gr o u n d I was s e a rched by a Police     j:e r  There were

                    others       standing about            but    the only stewards                I saw was       the    ones

                    sell i n g    programmes.             I did     not see anyone            climbing       over    the    turnstile:

                    while      I was     in that area.              I saw no other            gates    open at all.

                    Whe n   I got      in t h r o u g h    the    turnstiles         I saw the        tunnel       entrance

                    straight       in front         of me.        I didn't        see any signs            directing me          to the

                    st a nding area.           1 far as          1 was aware         the     tunnel    was       entracs    '8* was

                    easily       and went      to    the     left      of   the   dividing         fence    and    into    what    1 know

             myself           be comming weak.                     I was aware             of    passing         out and then of my

             a y o u n g i s h girl             lying         on the floor whose                    face was           blue,      I cannot

A factor         of the    incident w ou l d be the                 presence            of the fencing ar o u n d

wi t h    their      causing   trouble.

As     to the way        it was    hand l e d    the     fans a p p e a r e d            to grasp the              s i tuation

They a p p ea re d to be more             i nterested             in was       crowd         control.

     We t r a v e 11eci to S h e f fi el d          in             car.       We all    left

     iso m e t irne between        nine thirty and nine                forty five       (Q93Q and 0945)             on

     the morning           of S a t u r d a y    15 April     19S9     (150489).       We didn't        really

     know the way to Sheffield.                          I went   to the L iv er p o o l - N o t t i n g h a m Forest

     Semi        Final    at H i l l s bo ro ug h    last year,        but    I didn't     know the way to

     the        ground.       None of the           other three      lads had been         to    the ground

     before.           we were e x pecting           to see other Liverpool               supporters      on the

     m o t o rw ay and we were            going      to follow them,           but we ended up going mile

     out        of our way.        At one       time we ended u.p following                the E v e r t o n

     supporters           who were heading               for the other Semi          Final at V i l l a Park.

     We e ve n t u a l l y stopped at some services                     somewhere and got directions

     for Sheffield.               I d o n ’t know where           these      services were,       we hadn't          got

     a c 3.ue where we we r e .



     I d o n ’t remember           there        being any traffic            hold ups on the way.              We

     e v e n t u a 11y arri v e d     in S h ef fi el d between half              past one and quarter               to

     two.         We    parked the       car     in a side street            off a m ain    road,      only about

     hundred yards away from the ground.



     Having        left    the    car,    we all walked towards                the ground,       looking       for a

     pub to have a drink.                   We d i d n ’t see any         pubs    open.     We   carried on

*2   walk i n g        beyond the ground and event u a l l y                 came to a g a t e w a y
                                                                                                              P AG E          3
                                                                                                              S 3396

Supe rmarket -        We went        in there and each bought                    four tins         of Jbeer and

then sat on the grass                verge      outside       the supermarket and drank                     them.



i X was myself                       a nd            wh o    airtight    the    cans

d o e s n ’t drink.       Whilst we were walking                   in the vicinity of the

ground,      there were       other         supporters        drinking         from    cans     in the

Street.,     but there w a s n ’t any drunkenness.                          I d i d n ’t see anyb o d y

fighting       or any sort       of disorder.



As we were walking            back towards            the ground,            I was     still      drinking my

last    can,     when a'Pol iceman stopped me and told me to drink                                    the     rest       of

the    can or     leave    it behind.            I finished the              can avid we        carried on

towards      the ground w hi c h was only about                     two hundred yards away.                        I

r e member     t hi nki n g at   that        t im e , i t was about            twenty five         to three,

that    there     seemed     to be thousands                of supporters          heading        for the

ground,      lots more       than normal.             Because       of this we decided to get

straight       to the ground and try and get                      in.



It only took us a couple                    of minutes        ta get        to the turnstile area.

W hen we got       tKere,     there were           peoaie      everywhere.             The yard        in between

the    t u r ns t i y e s and t he    1ar ge bLoe gates was                  packed with people.                   The

crowd also        s t retched beyond the              iron gates and             into a road itself.

There w e r e n ’l^/any queues,              just a mass of             people.        There was        one

moun t e d P p y i c e m a n who was         just p u t s l d e   the       iron g a t e s .     He was       trying

to get the        crowd to move             back and trying             to get     them organised,             but

was    very tight        in the turnstile area,                but    it w a s n ’t that       bad that       it

made me      panic.       Triers was a lot of              pushing -and shoving             in the      crowd

and    I was      still able      to move.          All    four    of us were        still     together       in

the    crowd.      We had decide d to try and get to the turnstile                                 in the     left

hand     corner.       It took us about             ten minutes        to get from the             iron gates

to the turnstile            in the     left hand          corner.      I remember          there    being     one

P o 1i ceman wh o was        standing        up against        the wall         to our     left,    about     five

feet away from the             turnstile       block.        He was        shouting       to the    people        to

move     back but nobody          could move           b a c I       e v entually     reached the           left

some     fans as they got           into     the ground.          I wasn't       searched.         We got     into

the    ground at about           ten to three           (1450).       I d o n ’t remember any of the

o t h e r s b e i n g s ea r c h e d e it h e r .



Whilst     outside      the turnstiles,             I did not see any gates                 open other        than

the    turnstiles,        neither      did    I see any gates              being    opened.        I diu not

see any stewards            o u t s ide the turnstiles.



Once     inside     the ground,        I did not see any signs telling                        us w h i c h way

to go to the terraces.                 All    I saw was the tunnel                 that    runs u n d e r n e a t h

 There was a crowd of                   people at the entrance                    to         tunnel      wait i n g     to

 go     into      it.    We just w a n te d to get to the                    terraces         so we     pushed        our

 way through this                crowd and walked along the                       tunnel.        It was      fairly

 packed        inside      the tunnel,       but we were able                 to walk along             it without

 too much trouble.                 I did n o ^ see a n y P o l i c e m e n or stewards                     either at

 the entrance             to the tunnel          or a n y w h e r e    inside          it.



 Whe n we got to the end of the tunnel,                               the    central         area behind the             goal

 was     packed.          We    could see the         pitch from the end of the tunnel,                               and

 there were             players    on the    p i t c h . The game            h a d n ’t started at this                 time.

 We were all             still    together       as we got to the                 end of the tuMlel             and      it

 was     our      intention to try and watch the m a t c h from bejaand the goal                                         or

\ as    near as we         could get       to the goal.               We went          tq/Che    r 1 ght hand s .i.de

 of     the goal        and     into what    I now know to b«^                          number    three.        We were

 able     to push our way thro u g h the                   crowd without                too muc h trouble.               It

 was     packed,         but you    could    push through the                 crowd w h i chever way you

 w a n te d to go



 We went          forwards       down the    terraces and s l i ghtly down to the                            right.           We

 went     down about            ten feet w hen suddenly we                   couldn't         go any further.                It

 was     not      possible to go an y further                  because        the       people    in front        of us

 were     packed         in solid.        We had to stop where we were                          because      of this.

 I have ma r k e d this            first    position on the separate                         grid plan using             the

 figure        one.      We d i d n ’t have a view of the                    pitch from          position one

 because          of the       people    in front        of us.        Because          of this,       we w a n t e d    to

 try and find somewhere                   else    to w atch the m a t c h from,                  but    c o u l d n ’t move

 a n y w h er e    else.        It was    packed,        but   not a crush at that time.                        We were

 still     all      together       in position o n e j                      was    on my r ight and

 an d              «ere the other          side     of                I w o u l d estimate         the time at
this     point      to be about            five    to three        (1435).          Whilst       standing    in

posi t ion one at this                 t ime , something made rne 1 o0 t-: behi nd over my                        left

s h o u l d e r . I looked behind and saw Gylry CHURffn, a lad who                                  I knew well

•Fr o rri a r o u n d t h e                   area.       I think G ary CH U R C H had tapped somebody

on the back of the head.                         All    four of us knew him.                All    four    of us

said     something            like,    "Alright Gary,            how's      it g o i n g . ”



Gary said something                   like,      ”How     long have you been h e r e 1', and               then    I

think     he asked had we                 seen his friend,                                      , who    he had

Gary.       One     of the others             said that w e / s h o u l d all            stick    together    in

the    crowd.        I c a n ’t rememher' who                yd .id i t .    Gar y CHURCH decided to

stay with us.                 There was       no o t h e r    real    con v e r s a t i o n between any of us

and Gary after                that.       Gary    remained on my            left hand shoulder

was    fit and w e l l          w h en we     s/aw him,       there were          no undue       problems at

that     time.       We had b e e n / i n         position one for only about a minute                        when

the ,p r essure        from I m n y '<d m oved us a l l              forwards about             two feet.     At

the time        of us being m ove d forwards                     by this       pressure         from behind,       Gary

had beejt si i g h 1 1y behind rny left hand shou 1 der and whi 1e we were

being moved forwards,                     I remember hearing Gar y shout                       something.     He

only     shouted once and                 1 am almost         certain that          it was a name that             he

shouted.          I c a n ’t remember what the                   name was.          It was a normal          snout,

not a scream or a shout                     of    panic or distress.                I think that Gary

shouted out one of our                     names        probably so that we              could see wherea b o u t s

he was      following           the    push from behind.



As a result          of this          push from/behind,              Gary    bec a me s e p a r a ted troni us

and    I think he was              pus hejd^T o rwards          down the terracing               in a.

straight        line,         w h e r e a / we were       pushed towards           the    right.        I did not

see Gary CHURCH a g ^ i n                 after    that,      neither       did    I hear a n y thing       further
I w ou l d estimate              that G ary CHURCH was            in our     c o m p a n y for a_bout two

!jsi viu t e s from a^bo u t f ive to t h r e e until about                  thr&e minutes         to three

(1455 to           1457).       During     that time G ary C H U R C H jgyypeared fit and well

a nd wa s in no obv i o us d i s t r e s s .



Following            this      push forwards,       1 ended up a couple             of feet       further      down

the         terraces and more           to the    right hand side.             I have marked         this

second         position on the separate                  grid plan using          the figure       iA„     Whilst

in position              1A,    I became aware          of a man    in front       of me,    s l i ghtly    to my

left.          The fjian was       sluinped      forwards and            I could see        that he was pinned

up against a crush barrier                       and was       slumped over that.           The man

appeared           unconscious.          I could feel myself              being    pushed slowly towards

the man.             I d i d n ’t want     to    be pushed up against him                   as he    looked         in a

bad way.             I put rny arms        staight       out   in front me        and       grabbed the crush

barrier           to keep myself         from pushing          up against      him.     I tapped him on

the shoulder and a sk e d him                   if he was alright,            but got    no response           at

 j. <L ■<




The man had been wearing                    glasses and shortly after                 I had tapped his

 houlder,            his glasses        fell    off and dropped onto              the ground,

            and                were   still     on my     right hand side.                        bent   down

and         picked the glasses           up.     He was able       to do this         because my arms

were         still      o ut st r e t c h e d against    the   crush barrier,         creating a little

space.         Almost as soon as                         had   picked the      glasses      up,    there was

another           biq    push from behind and             I was    pushed     right up against           the
                                                                         /
barrier,           slightly more         to the     right than       f    had been just before             the

push.          I did not see that man again aftyr
                                                                   / the      push.     The man who was

the man's          face and          remember       that he was           very       pale,    no real       colour at

all.      I thought at t4"-ve' time                 that the man may have been drunk.                              I do

F ol lo wi ng      the      push that         pinned me up against                   the   crush barrier,           there

was    continual            pressure        on my     left side w h i c h was              g r adually      pushing me

across       the barrier.                        was still         on my    right during             the    push to the

right.          I was       pushed slowly across               the     crush barrier            for between two

an d three minutes,                  during w hich time             I heard a lot of noise                      from the

crowd,       shouting,           whistling,         etc,    w hich     I believe was            the    crowd's

reaction to the game                    kicking       o f f , A.    only heard this             reaction,          I could

not    see anything              on the       pitch. / M y     next       r e c o l lection     is

trapped behind the                   staxition and the end of the horizontal                               bar was

pressed         rit&'it into/nis            stomach.        I tried to           pull      him back        from the

bar,     but     couithr*'! help him from where                       I was as         I d i d n ’t have         room to

and as soon as                          ad moved,        I was      forced       round against             the end of

the    bar

pushed us both forwards,                        further     down the terraces.                  We ended up four

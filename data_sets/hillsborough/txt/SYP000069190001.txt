We all      travelled          from Liverpool               in three         cars    in convoy,,       except           for my

sister      who met       us at the ground after                      trave l l i n g    from M a n c h e s t e r        by

’S p e c i a l ’ train,,        we    dxd not        stop en route             from Liverpool             to S h e f f i e l d

because we did not               have       time     because      of     t                    y s in H a n ch e s t s r

and    outside Sheffi eld.

We    left at      11am     (110Q)         thinking         there was         plenty of time           but      there

were    delays      because          of    roadworks and an accident.                        1 don't         know where

it was      but    1 heard       it on the           radio      round        the Manch e s t e r     area.

En    route    to the      game       I saw no        c o n s u m p t i o n gf ~ajL c o h o l .

I would        describe         the    lad as      ur\>±gr    ;i7 years,       mousey       brown hair,

sligh t l y built,           white maj.e> j / i t h          blue    eyes.      I ca n n o t de s c ribs             h is

The man who was a d m i n i s t e r i n g             heart mass a g e         I cannot       descr itoe other

than he was           early forties white male and he had a cut                                   to one        side        of

his     forehead,,          I c a n ’t say w h i c h and he had alot                      of blood on his              face

3y this        time      there a p p e a r e d     someone wit h all            of the       dead or           injured

anc     things a p p e a r e d        to be starting           to get       under     control.               I therefore

decided        I w ould      be more       of a hindrance             than a help and               so       returned to

stand with my mates,,                   I was      helped      back     over    the       fence and Jo i ned my

b r o t h e r and his mate ____ | who               had a l r e a d y    got    back.

1 thought          there was about             30 or 40 dead at              this     time,       but        1 told     them

only about         8.       I don't       know whet h e r          this was     because       I did not want                     to

upset     the      others       or because         1 c o u l d n ’t admit       it to myself,,

Whe n    p e o p 1e had      initially        star t e d      to    climb out        of    pens 3 and 4 and a

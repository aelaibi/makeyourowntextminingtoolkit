Dear Sister

      Thank you for your letter dated 20th April, 1989.

     Your kind thoughts and support are appreciated at
this sad time.

     As you are probably aware, Lord Justice Taylor is
conducting a detailed enquiry into the Hillsborough
Tragedy and I am sure his report will take account of
all the surrounding circumstances.

                     Yours sincerely,




                        J. COLLEDGE

     Dear Sister

     1 am grateful for you advising me of your information about the tragic events
     at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989. I have noted the information which has also
     been made available to Secretary of the Inquiry as well as the Treasury
     Solicitor, who is instructing Counsel to the Inquiry at the oral hearings.

     Having considered your contribution I do not intend to arrange a personal visit
     to obtain any further statement. However, if you have any additional
     information since you last contacted my investigation team or you feel that a
     personal visit is essential please do not hesitate to make contact at any of my
     offices listed above. Alternatively you can write to the Secretary of the
     Inquiry as below:-

     Mr R M Whalley
     Secretary to The Inquiry
     50 Queen Anne’s Gate
     London SW1H 9AT

     Lord Justice Taylor has asked me to convey his personal thanks for your taking
     the trouble to make contact and for the contribution you have made to his
     Inquiry.

     Yours sincerely




    IJ M JONES
i    ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE

                     from the uniform, and the rest from the C.I.D. who had volunteered to

                     work at the football match on a weekly leave day.           There was Another

                     Inspector Steve Ellis,         He has been recently promoted from th*

                     Traffic Division.       We were bused to Hillsborough onto Ptniston® Road*

                     near to the entrance of the gymnasium.          We went into th® tn^in stapd

                     where briefing was held by several officers who had dra^n up the

                     plans for the match including C.I.D.        officers in relation to crime

                     and we were finally briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield from

                     "F' Division.

                     I had attended the previous match in 1988, at this ground in similar

                     circumstances and at that time I was in fact at the Leppingf Lane end

                     controlling the crowds and on the commencement of the match,            I was in

                     the main stand with the Liverpool supporters.           On that occasion there
was no trouble whatsoever,         I believe there were one or two arrests,

but no disturbances or crowd trouble whatsoever.

After the briefing we proceeded to our duty which was at Wardsend

Road North,    that's on the junction with Halifax Road and directly

opposite the British Rail Station at Wads 1ey B r i d g e .         Our duties were

to park mini buses arriving down Halifax Road from the motorway and

advise supporters generally the direction of the ground.

Located at the junction of Wardsend Road and Halifax Road,                 is

licensed premises called the Railway Inn, when I worked in Sheffield,

I recall visiting these premises,         but it is some years ago,         but when

we arrived at Wardsend R o a d , I recall Police Constable Butler

informing me that the licensee of the premises would like to see me,

I met the licensee, a tall chap with a beard. He informed me that he

was not opening the front doors and that the windows had been boarded

but he intended to open via the rear door in a small               courtyard at tlt|

back and allow certain supporters and obviously his regular,

customers,    into the premises.      He stated that he had a p e n e d r y r f ^ 8 3

far the semi-final     and that damage had been caused to           th«^ toilets,

although there had     not been any seriotii trouble.         He asked     that we

direct any ’older end* supporters,         not the younger element who way

cause trouble and d a m a g e .   I recall that he was quite friendly, asked

us to keep an eye on the place, and he would probably remain outside

or near to the door and we agreed that we would cover                the premises as

well as our/duties     with the mini buses.

I remember him offe r i ng to provide a pot of tea for the officers and

I agreed that 12.30 would be an ideal          time and that we'd split the

officers up so that they cettiif go to the back of the premises and

have a drink at about 12.30.

Coaches started arriving,         1 thinkvthe'Wire% icoacb                somewhere

in the region of about      11.3(3.   ThlNf>               Transit van                  *&
improvised and placed some seats of their own in the v a n , the lads in

it were all       in their twenties?    that age group,      they were   in a good

mood,    these did not appear to be drinking at all,            they were joking

with the officers,          there was no trouble.       They parked where we told

them to park and I recall that this first bus load made their way

directly to the ground.

Buses arrived afterwards but there was not a great number of these

mini    co aches.    We parked them on the side of the road and although

the majority of the occupants were obviously excited about the

prospects of the m a t c h , they were generally we 11 behaved and good

humoured.       We joked with them,     talked about the match, and they were

generally in high spirits and there was no problem w h a t s o e v e r .

The coaches that were          proper mini   coaches,    the drivers were generally

remaining with the coach and we did not see evidence of a great deal

of drink on this type of mini          coach.    Others which we re consisting of

company vehicles, w o r k s ’ vans,     that had obviously been borrowfd had a

considerable number of cans of drink in them.               But again,   tfie

occupants were no problem whatsoever.             I recall one van load

arriving and asking if they could obtain a drink,               they were mainly in

the 30/35 age group, and actually walked down to the rear entrance of

the Railway Public House.           Told them to go quietly to the back door

and they were in fact admitted by the licensee into the pr em ise s. I

did in fact go into the premises later on through the back door there

was no problem in the public house whatsoever, as I said before they
          / ■                                             ^
seemed to,'be in high spirits and quite good humoured as generally

Liverpool       fans are.

There was a steady flow of spectators walking down Halifax Road,

towards the ground, and as every officer that was on duty in that area

will say,       the majority of these fans,      the younger element      in

particular,       were all    carrying cans of beer or lager and large plastic
                                                                            :/>M- PAGE ), 4
                                                                            '     R3H4"

bottles of drink and openly drinking them as they walked along.                       All

the officers were quite surprised that they w e r e n ’t carrying just one

can, they we re carrying a half dozen cans at a time, and drinking

from them.     As some of the spectators          left the pub again there was no

problem, they even thanked us for informing them and I saw one group

of fans leaving the pub thanking the licensee and shaking hands with

him.

Whilst we were at the location of Wardsend Road and Halifax R o a d , we

were visited by Chief Superintendent Nesbit who was touring the area

in a Range Rover.        He came and spoke to us* X— thi nk— hf* would hrwe

visited by Superintendent Marshall who was on foot, and he was

checking the crowds.         This was early doors,        I would say in the region

of 12 o ’ clock time,     he came and spoke to me.         I do know Superintendent

Marshall although I've never worked with him,                I know him from a

social aspect.      His main concern was that no weapons arrived in these

mini buses and nothing was taken down to the ground which would cause

any injury.      He also requested that we check as many for tickets and

advise those that h a d n ’t got tickets not to make their way down to

the ground.

As the mini buses started to back up Wardsend Road, we had the use of

a company car park, and we did in fact park a number of mini buses on

this car park.       One thing I do recall        is that a mini bus full of

youngsteri 20 years of age pulled onto the car park and when I walked

up to this van t h e y ’d got the sliding door open,             I believe two or three

round public house tables and a half dozen pub stools and number of

cans of beer on the tables.           I asked them in a joking manner what they

were doing and they said that they knew that the pubs would be shut so

t h e y 'd brought their own mini      pub.    Again, they were no trouble I

bottles          of    drink          and      openly       drinking          t h em        as       they      walked          along.            All

the      officers           were       q u it e      surprised          that           t he y    weren't           carrying           j us t      one

can,       they       were       carrying            a half       dozen       cans         at        a time,         and    drinking

f rom      them.           As    s om e     of     the    spectators              l e ft        the     pu b     again      there           was    no

problem,             they       even      thanked         us    for     informing                them        and    I sa w        one       group

of    fans       leaving           the      pu b     thanking          the    licensee                an d     shaking          hands        with

him.

Whilst          we    were       at    the       location         of    Wardsend                Road       and     Halifax         R o ad,        we

were       visited          by    Chief          Superintendent               Nesbit             who       was     touring         the       area

in    a Range          Ro v e r .         He     came     and     spoke       to us.                 We w e r e     also

visited          by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t          Marshall        who       was          on    foot,        and     he was

checking             the    cr o w d s .         This     was     early       do o r s,          I would           say     in     the       region

of    12    o'clock             time,       he     came     and    spoke          to me.              I do k n o w         Superintendent

Marshall             although          I've        never       worked        with        him,         I know        hi m    f ro m      a

social          aspect.           His       main     concern           was    that         no        weapons        arrived           in     these

mini       buses       and n o t h i n g           was    taken        down       to     the         ground        which        would        cau s e

any      in j ur y .        He    a l so       requested          that       we    check             as m a n y     for     tickets              and

advise          those       that       hadn't        got       tickets        not        to m a k e          their       way      down       to

the      ground.

As    the       mini        buses         started         to b a c k     up W a r d s e n d             Roa d ,     we     ha d    the       use       of

a company             car       park,       an d we did in             fact        park          a number           of m i n i        buses        on

this       car       park.        One          thing      I do r e c a l l        is     that         a mini        bus     full        of

youngsters             20       years       of     age    pulled        onto       the          car     park       and w h e n        I walked

up    tothis          van       they'd         got   the       sliding        door         open,           I believe            two     or       three

round           public          house       t a b l e s and a h a l f             dozen          pu b      stools        and      number          of

c a ns     of    beer       on    the       t ab les.          I asked        them         in     a joking           manner         what          they

were       doing       and       t he y     said     that       they     knew           t h at       the     pubs    would         be       shut       so

they'd          brought          their         own   mini       pub.         Again,             they       were     no     trouble           I

       believe Detective Constable Hill just had to warn one of these lads who

       was getting a bit stroppy,    to clam down,    but in general we had no

       problem whatsoever with any of the mini buses that came.

       I counted a total of only 17 mini    b u s e s , I expected that we would be

       inundated with mini buses and in the end would be trying to find

       places to park them on both sides of the road but this wasn't so.

       There were very few and I told the officers in my serial           that if

       there were late arrivals with cars rather than send the cars to the

       ground where they would cause a problem trying to park down there

       that we could start parking a few cars as well on Wardsend Road.                 I
*
       did in fact radio through to the Control Room where I spoke to

       Sergeant Goddard.     1 was in fact in possession of a radio and

       informed him that there were very few cars and buses arriving.               I

       recall the football   special train arriving,        I was stood at the end of

       Wardsend Road,   I saw the train cross the bridge over the road.             I

       would say about 5/6 hundred fans came off the train,          they walked down

       from the station,   two mounted officers were in front of them,           they

       just held them for a short time,    until they were a l t o g e t h e r , then

       they went down Halifax Road towards the ground, again although they

       were in high spirits and were singing,      I did not see any that tried

       to break away,   they followed the officers and went down towards the

       ground.

       Our brief was to remain at Wardsend Road,          until kick off time or

       shortly before if there was no other duty to perform there,            but I do

       recall as late as twenty minutes to three, young men,          I would think

       that they were Liverpool   supporters,   running up Halifax Road away

       from the ground towards a shopping precinct a short distance some 20

       or 30 yards further up, and obviously they were heading for the beer

       off and the supermarket and right up to ten minutes to three or even

       later,   crowds of supporters were still    coming down Halifax Road and
the significant thing was the amount of drink they were carrying,

cans of beer.      Although we didn't have any trouble with them,                   it was

noticeable at the time and I'm not just saying this in the aftermath

of what happened,      it was remarked on that why at this late time were

they going to the ground and having a considerable amount of drink.

I have gone to football matches all my life and big m a t c h e s , I've

always gone early and wouldn't think of going for a drink,                     thinking

of being in the ground and having had          drink,   but this certainly

struck me     and I related to my own two      sons who are in their twenties,

and every time I go to a football match with them we always seem to

meet in a public house,        but probably this is what all the youngsters

do nowadays and it was significant at the time and as I've previously

said,    I'm not stating this in the aftermath of what happened,                    this is

a fact and it was noticed by quite a lot of people.

As we left Wardsend Road we left as a serial,            there were still             people

walking down at approximately three o'clock or just before and 1 am

almost    certain that    I heard over the radio as we got towards

C l ay w h e e 1s Lane the match,   the kick off, had been postponed.               I was

certainly aware of this and another thing I recall shortly before I

recall a radio message and again I know Sergeant Goddard's voice, he

was in the Control Room and I recall a radio message where Sergeant

Goddard in the Control Room was asking other officers if they had

seen the South Yorkshire Transport Liaison Officer                in the vicinity of

the Herries Road garage.            I recall this because he was asking for

that officer to contact or at least           if officers were in contact with

him to inform him they had closed Leppings Lane because of the

volume of      supporters and that the bus     drivers should b e i n f o r m e d of

this.    We    carried on and went and a c t u a l l y turned into ClaywheeIs

Lane, where our brief was to obtain a meal, we had not had a meal at

this time, and as I walked with the serial           into C l a y w h e e l s L a n e ,   I
                                                                        PAGE
                                                                      . R3S4    ■

heard over the radio an appeal    for officers to go to the ground as

there were some people in Leppings Lane,      trying to get to the ground.

X stopped my serial,   told them to turn round and we walked towards

the ground.   I then met Inspector Charles     coming in the opposite

direction away from the ground.       As we met he asked me where I was

going and I told him about the appeal      I'd heard over my radio.      We

had a discussion,   I recal1 John Charles saying no our instructions

are to go to Claywheels Lane and I recall saying to him we'd check

again, you check or I'll check on the ra di o, they want officers at

Leppings Lane.   John Charles did in fact go over the air he was in

possession of his own radio, and he received the same instruction as

me.

John Charles had got the equivalent of about five serials and the

only other officer with him I can recall was Inspector Bob Meek,

there may have been somebody else,      I can't recall.    I c a n ’t recall

any other Sergeant or Inspector Ellis or any other Inspector with us,

I can only recall   Inspector Charles,    Inspector Meek and m y s e 1f , and

we took the serials and I believe we'd got five serials with us up

Leppings Lane, and we could see then the volume of spectator# as we

approached the gates to the ground.      We stopped the serials at the

junction with Vere Road,   th a t ’s the last road on the left before you

come to the ground.    There was a lot of traffic over the radio and

were trying to ask for further instructions.        Bob Meek went on ahead

to try and obtain information as a runner and Inspector Charles and

I then lined up the serials in their serials, and told them not

to move.   I looked after the serials while John Charles was trying to

get over on the radio.     I recall   telling the serials to follow

Inspector Charles and I and not to break rank or move away and to

keep with their individual serials so that we knew where everybody

was.   I remember that we doubled up in military style up to the gates
of the ground, and I recall turning     round to make sure that everybody

was with us, although we were winding our way through the crowds of

people, and as we approached the first set of big gates,     the officers

that were there formed a kind of tunnel for us to go through, and we

momentarily stopped there and then an officer I don't know who it

was,   it was an officer of Inspector or Superintendent   rank,    told us,

"Straight into the ground lads, go straight     into the ground,    they

need some help."     We then went through the concertina gate,     the big

blue concertina gate, as you look at the Leppings Lane entrance it

was to the right hand side.     As w© went into the area immediately

behind the stand I could see the tunnel     in question that goes under

the main stand at Leppings Lane,    there were supporters running

around, milling around and then I saw both officers and supporters

carrying three people from underneath the tunnel from the ground.               I

am certain that all those three people were alive because they were

giving them what first aid they could and I recall forming a circle

with the serials that we had round these people, and saying,        "Look

get these supporters that are getting in the way, get the® behind us

so that they can see to these casualties."      I ’d no idea that there

was anymore,    it looked like a fainting situation and I'm certain that

these people were alive and we d i d n ’t realise the enormity of the

situation in the ground.

Other officers, again with supporters,     came up the tunnel With some

more casualties and I could then see that it was a more serious

situation.     They weren't just needing their ties loosening,     or a i r ,

the normal fainting situations, and three four or more were brought

out as 1 say.     I recall then a young officer running up th # tunnel as

they were bringing some other people and I was stood more or less

just inside the tunnel and he was more or less screaming at me

saying,   "Get some men in here,   come and help us, we need help inside,
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              R3H4

as many as possible."        I just recall shouting to or getting hold of

as many chaps as I knew.        I recall getting ho Id of Steve Co o k who was

with me and John Hill and saying,           "Right,   get them inside the ground

they need us inside the ground," and we went under the tunnel.                 We

pushed our way to the front and as we got to the front we were then

faced with all    I can describe as a pile of bodies that appeared just

stacked on top of one another to the level of the top of the wall and

several feet back from the wall.            Officers and spectators alike were

just pulling at       these bodies.       At this stage I ’m sure that they weren

all dead and we       were just picking a body up,       I can *t recall which

officer, and we ran as best         we could up the tunnel out into the       area

we'd first come into on the         other side of the stand.        I think I did

this something    like eight,    nine,     ten times, with officers and

spectators.    The first body you picked up you ran out with him and

there were officers      carried on giving assistance.         I remember that we

tried kiss of life and heart massage on one chap who we thought was

alive for a considerable length of time and then took him out away as

people were falling over us on the steps of the terrace- and wfr got

him to the    back.    As I said,       this took place carrying bodies out,        as

far as I ’m   concerned ten times,         it may have been more and I c a n ’t

recall which officer I saw,         I    can remember another Sergeant and     I ’ve

just thought of       his name over      the last day, a Sergeant Whit lam,    who

used to be at Rotherham.        I can remember carrying a body with him on

a couple of occasions,      but the others,       I've no idea who they were.            I

remember then that the entrance to the tunnel appeared to become

blocked and I then remember Superintendent Greenwood who was on the

pitch side    of this fence with a megaphone          in his hand organising a

chain, and    the only way to do it was to take the top body first.                 We

appeared to be just snatching at an arm and a leg and              obviously it

was trapped.     I remember at      first I was near the gate      and there was I
almost certain a man fxith his leg trapped behind the gate support,

or his foot, and we were just standing on him and eventually somebody

got him out and that was preventing us getting through the gate.

Officers were trying to carry bodies through the gate and this was

impossible due to the width of the gate.         I remember Superintendent

Greenwood continually telling them,       "Form a chain,     form a chain,       don't

try and come through with the body,       d o n ’t try and come t h ro ug h. ”   We

formed a chain and we got some assemblance of order,             if you can call

it that in this situation,      where we did in fact get a chain going.               I

d o n ’t recall now whether this came to me afterwards or at the time,

but there was a man somewhere along the line screaming about his

daughter.     At first we tried to shove him away and realised that be

had got somebody there and he went through onto the pitch.              One of

the things that struck me was the colour of the faces of the

victims.     These were purple and you could tell that they were dead,

there were blue areas on the body which was obviously pressure and I

recall some were frothing through the nose and m o u t h .        There was

either one,    two or possibly more people there who were obviously

doctors and I remember one of these chaps saying on several

occasions,    "Leave him,   leave him."   Obviously he was de^d,       to look

for someone else.     I recall also at this time the only other officer

that I did see was Chief Superintendent Nesbit and he, with other

officers was tearing at the fence, away from the gate some 10 yards

away from the gate, and they actually broke the mesh near to the top

corner and peeled it back, and thinking about it,          it was like you peel

a sardine tin back, and then he started saying,          "Pass    ’em through."

They ripped the fence out and that fence was ripped out by h a n d , by

brute force of several Police Officers and as many others that

could.     They ripped it out by hand and we started passing bodies two

ways then.     I remember hearing the sound of a n ambulance         coming,

 which seemed ages,      **yd I thought there was a fleet of them and there

'■'was only o n e «

 The orders were being given by Chief Superintendent Nesbit as best he

 could,    trying to organise the men as best he could and certainly by

 Superintendent Greenwood.          My memory of him it was as if h e ’d hung

 himself on the fence near the gate and was just giving the orders to

 the lads to pass these bodies         in the chain.

 The only other Inspector I saw was an Inspector from the Training

 Department,     Rob and I forget his second name.           He was there and I

  believe there was Inspector Sykes there.              I c a n ’t recall now who I

  did see of the officers,      I remember seeing Bob Gutcher and several

  othe r off i cers.

  Eventually we got all the bodies from behind the wall and they were

  on the pitch and were either being tendered to              by officers, St. John's

  Fire Service oh,      I recall as we were       getting a body        out,   I recall

  that there were signs of life in his          chap, a young man and we shouted

  and screamed for oxygen and the Fire Service             came and they got

  cylinders of oxygen and they then treat this chap with the oxygen,

  whether he was dead or not,        I d o n ’t know.    The majority in that pile

  were dead obviously.       When we'd got the bodies out we remained in

  that en cl osu re ,   We hadn't time to think,        I w a s n ’t conscious of the

  spectators around me, and I never gave them a thought,                but after the

  bodies had been removed,      we in that enclosure,        then became very very

  conscious of the spectators in the seating area above us, apd for the

  first time,     I became frightened and I feared that the anger was going

  to be vented on us and I said,         "T he r e’s gonna be trouble,      I can see

  t h e r e ’s gonna be trouble."    They were really angry.           I did in fact

  speak to Chief Superintendent Nesbit            and said, "You        know were gonna

  hav-e trouble here" and then he said,           "Get them out,        get the officers

  out onto the pitch."       I;remember saying to Steve Cook and John Hill,

"Get those girls out,*'            Meaning our Policewomen and I remember in

particular having Policewoman Marsh,                        Has Marsh, Jill Donnelly and

Julie Nesbit who were all extremely upset and in particular Kaz Marsh

who was just shaking and I remember t e 11i ng Steve Cook and John Hill

and Kevin Yarrow not to lose the girls,                            in any event to look after

those girls.         John Nesbit then obviously appreciated the situtation

and saw that those fans,             they were hurling abuse at us.                       I've got to

be honest,        I didn't see anything thrown at us,                       it was the verbal

abuse, and you could feel the anger that was being vented on u s , and

I don't frighten easily.               I've been in one or two situations,                       but I

was frightened and I was wondering what we were going to do, whether

we were going to turn and run,                because there was a crowd behind us.

This was brought home when one of the Police Photographers, Dennis

Bond,     came and he actually spoke to me,                        I never gave it a thought at

that time,        he was dressed in civilian clothes and he carte, and the

next thing he was virtually surrounded by angry supporters who <*tere

milling on the pitch and came away,                       but as I walked over I saw

another crowd further over to the left near to the control box

surrounding another Police Photographer,                             I don't know his n#me.            I

found out later his name was Spike, and officers had to virtually

drag him out.         I— K m e m i b w — fray ing—     —Bwrrrrirs Bond— in ob«cone language

abuse,        and      you     could          feel        the    anger        that       was      being         vented         on us,         and

I don't          frighten            e as i ly .          I've     been       in one        or      two     situations,                but        I

was     frightened             an d      I was        wondering              what     we    w e re       going         to    do,      whether

we     were      going        to     turn      an d       run,     because          there         was      a crowd           behind       us.

This       was    brought            h o me    when        one     of     the    Police           Photographers,                   Dennis

another          crowd        further          over        to    the      left      near       to    the        control         box

surrounding               another          Police          Photographer,                 I don't           know        his     name.          I

Jackson come.       Whether he 'd been there and I hadn't seen him I don't

in my book,       it was down to John Nesbit,   and Superintendent Greenwood

and all those lads who worked just bloody fantastically.

We then eventually got an order from Chief Superintendent Nesbit to

try and get the spectators off the pitch and to try and get them from

the g r ou nd .   O h , I'd previously heard an appeal       by Dalglish which

went down very well, and someone else said that the Notts Forest

Manager,    Clough,   had been on the pitch but we didn't see            him. But

another thing that struck me is that an announcement was made over

the Police tannoy by a Police Officer,          I presume asking the

spectators to leave and when he was making          it I was worried that that's

when w e ’d have some real trouble,       but in actual     fact they just went,

certainly out of the seating area, and it was then that Chief

Superintendent Nesbit said,        "Try and get hold of some blokes and try

and coax them all,        let's try and get   ’em out and off the pitch," and

we did, and they went,        there was no trouble, we didn't have to even

speak to anybody sharply,        they went and I d i d n ’t experience any

trouble until saw one tall Liverpool          supporter in a blue shirt and I

actually heard h«Ti~ say i-ng~r-"We---Oi*ght* to hav©     ^rio-t-i"—     s^i d~ ttr&t a

couple of t i m e s , I   think it would h a v e b e e n foolish to try and

apprehend him or anything,        but when we did g o a n d speak to him, some

of his own supporters got hold of him,          probably he wa^str-upset             *

obviously he was angry and one can understand t h a t , but he did in

fact    listen to his own mates who we spoke to as well, and they went

and I didn't see him again.

I d o n ’t know what time it was but we eventually went and were told to

go back into the stand where the briefing earlier had taken place.                        1

remember asking a Chief Inspector Beal          if anyone had thought to*

 inform the Division that no Police Officers were involved in any

"Injuries or tragedy.          He went     away and cameback and announced tothe

  officers that were there       that this had been           done,   they were doing it

  and that provisions were being made for us to go to Claywheels Lane.

 We were directed to Claywheels Lane where I saw Superintendent

 Brougham of the Traffic Division.             I informed him that the majority

  of Rotherham Officers had been involved in the removal of bodies from

  the terrace and that I thought they ought to be taken back to                          ■

  Rotherham.     Again he     was very good,    I d o n ’t    know where he got the bus

  from or buses but he certainly got some buses.                    He told me that he

  would provide drivers to take any officer home who couldn't drive and

  we were more or less bused away back to Rotherham.

  It's very hard to describe the horrendous scenes,                   i t ’s alright three

  days later being able to talk about            it and I have said t h a t ’s what we

  get paid for but I ’ve seen the effects on the Detectives that I ’ve

  worked with.     1 saw the effect on Kev Yarrow, Steve C o o k ,                 who at work

  can handle any situation but I saw the effect of that.                       I   d i d n ’t see

  John Charles again,       I know he got tied up in the gymnasium,                     it was an

  horrific experience.       In 31 years on the Police I never thought that

  I would witness the horrific scenes that we did meet on entering the

  ground.     I would like to say that every bobby that I worked with gave

  everything h e ’d got,     did everything he had to do, and made me after

  31 years doubly proud that I became a copper and I know that the more

  I think about    it,   I thought of young lads,            probably some with only one

  or two years    in and I looked at them thinking although my sons a r e n ’t

  on the job,    they're my sons* age and what a bloody marvellous job,

  and also the Policewomen.        Those Policewomen were absolutely

  terrific.     Obviously criticisms will be level led at us and I ’m sure we

  can take that and I ’m sure that the majority of officers                        can level

  criticism back but at this stage,            i t ’ll do no igood whatsoever.

        I'fi'C main topic of conversation since Saturday has been that therjr was

         no command structure,           other than Chief Superintendent N e s > n   and

         Superintendent Greenwood, and I think that has got

         and some quest ions'N^sked there,          someone oth     than that,   there should

                                                             at that end and whatever

         senior rank was at the ground               uld have been at that end of the

         ground,    that's where    it wja-s happening'Kit wasn't happening on

         Penistone Road or                                           and that's my main

         feelings and      it i c i sm      Thank God that Nesbit w t w t h e r e and thank

         God in

                  Superintendent Greenwood was there hanging on his fence.

               On Saturday, 9th April,          19S9 (090488)     I was on uniform duty                     the FA

               On that date I was briefed to be in charge of a group of officers to

               At about 11.30am (1130) with the above officers I took up position

               turnstiles,      close to the bridge        in Leppings Lane.

               The turnstiles opened sometime after 12 o ’clock                (1200) and as a group

               we carried out our designated duties of searching arriving fans and

               in general     giving them advice and directing them to the turnstiles to

               which their ticket was allocated.

             As. the afternoon went on it became               clear that some of the fans had
'JS‘
             arrived without tickets and they were instructed to leave the area to

             avoid congestion.

             At no time during this exercise did we form a human barrier in order

             to search every arriving fan,          it was more or less left to each

             individual    team to select at random fans for searching.                                          To cordon

             off the area and search every fan would have been a massive task.                                                                         In

             fact as it got closer to the kick off there was an increase in

             arrivals and §j«i^hing became virtually impossible.

             I can reca|f that £pare tickets were handed to m y s e# # / n i b e r s of
*            my team and they in turn were handed to fans without tickets and I

             might add that these were selective,                   one man with a yo u ng boy comes                                                                 /

             was extremely busy the fans were inside the ground at kick off or

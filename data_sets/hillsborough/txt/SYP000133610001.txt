Dated                   070589


           I am a married man and I reside at the above address with my wife anc

           f am iIy.



           I am employed by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as a Lottery

           Ticket Seller at the Hillsborough Ground.                 I have been employed in

           this capacity for the past two seasons.                 My normal position on

           football league days is in the uncovered terrace in the South Stand

           near to the Spion Hop end of the ground,                but on Saturday 15th April

           •1 9 8 9   (130489 5 I asked to be posted to the uncovered area between the

           turnstiles in Leppings Lane and the rear of the West Stand.                    I had

           that particular position at the equivalent game last year and I sold

           a large amount of tickets.



           On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489),            I arrived at the Hillsborough
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     £•302

g ro u nd at about 12.15pm (1215) and I entered through the main entranc

in Peni stone Road.          I went to the pools off i.ce which is at tne rear o

the Spion Kop and there saw                       |
                                                  , who is my Supervisor.            After

s u p o 1y inq us w it h t i cke t s ,           t o ok a 13. t he 1 i.c ke t tie 3.1a rs , as

a group? to our various positions,             I arrived at my position at about

12.30pm (1230).         I was the only Ticket Seiler in this section.



On my arrival I could see that persons were entering the ground via

the turnstiles in Lappings Lane.             The large gate marked gate *C* on

the plan (Exhibit No               ) (Reference No,            was closed.



At this time I saw that the Liverpool supporters were entering the

ground at a steady flow.             There were about six Police Officers

standing near to the turnstiles marked A—G on the map, which are next

to Gate C.       They were making selective searches of fans as they

entered the ground.           I also saw that there was a Football Club

Steward standing at Gate C.



At about 1.30pm (1330)           I had sold the hundred lottery tickets I had

been given so I returned to the pool’s office in order to collect son

tickets.       I can say that between 12.30pm (1230) and 1.30pm (1330)

that gate ’€* was not opened and none of the fans had gained

unauthorised entry.            I collected my tickets and 3. returned to my

position, after walking around the edge of the football pitch passing

the Spion Kop and the North Stand.              I think it was about 1.40pm

(1340) when I passed the North Stand.              I looked at the West Stand anc

I noticed that the terrace section on the West Stand serviced by the

tunnel from Leppings Lane, which I have highlighted on the map of the

ground (Exhibit No                   ) (Reference No.            was fairly full.            I

arrived back to my position at about 1.45pm (1345) after going
                                                                        P AGE:.


through a gate in the fencing on the       perimeter of the pitch.     i his

gate led onto       theWest Stand terracing and was manned by a Police

Officer,,     He opened the gate for me very quickly and I walked, up the

terracing,.     She gate I used was near to the North stand.



When I did return to my original position?       I noticed that a lot more

people were entering the ground? but as before?       this was being done i

an orderly fashion and as far as I could see no unauthorised entries

were being made.      I carried on selling tickets and spoke to a number

of Liverpool supporters.      Some of these smelt of drink but none

appeared to be drunk.       I did not have any trouble from any Liverpool

supporters all the time I was there.       Between 2.15pm <1413) and

2.30pm (1430).      I can't remember the exact time 1 realised I had run

out of cigarettes.      I decided to go to the sweet shop in Lappings Lar
                                                                                    j
to get some more.      I went up to the Steward who was standing near to

gate C.I asked him if I could        be let   out of the gate so I could       go

and get       some cigarettes from the sweet shop which is only about

thirty yards      from the gate.   Hetold me I must be   joking as there

were so     many people outside and it had    just taken another man thirty

minutes for a       manto get to the shop and back.



At this stageI remember a Pol iceman.having the gates       slightly    open

and shouting at the supporters outside.        I had previously looked

through a small glass panel in the gate and saw a mass of people the

other side of the gate.       I have never seen so many people trying to

get into a football ground in my life.        I decided to carry on se ll m c

the lottery tickets for a while? taut at 2.4Qpm (1440) I decided to

stop as people did not appear interested in buying lottery tickets

and it was getting quite congested where X was standing.
                                                                     KAbfc


I 5poke to a Steward who advised me on a way to get to the other end •

the qround, so I went to the edqe of the South Sitand and a Steward Ie

me through a gate which led me into a passage between the South stand

•and the uncovered seating.    I then walked along in front of the bp ion

Kop, then down the alleyway which leads towards the sports hall.



I spoke to a Steward on a gate which takes you onto Psnistone Road an

he let me out.   I then went out and bought some cigarettes.



I returned to the ground a few minutes later and got back into the

ground via the same gate I had gone out of.      I then went to in

front of the North Stand with the St John’s Ambulance staff near to

the Spion Kop.   I noticed two people operating a video camera on the

track next to the pitch.      I started talking to them, as I thought the

were television cameramen and started hinting that I would like to be

on the film, but they said they didn’t think I would like to be on it

as they were recording, as they said 'naughty boys'.      It was then I

realised they were plain clothes Police Officers.



I started talking to another youth a short time later, who was

standing with the St Joh n’s Ambulance personnel.     He was white in his

mid twenties.    As I talked to him he informed me he was a Liverpool

supporter who had come up from Norfolk to see the game.        He had come

without a ticket so he had bought one outside the ground for thirty

two pound from a tout.     When he had gone to the turnstiles with the

ticket, the turnstile operator had told him it was a forgery and they

had had words, but then a Police Officer had told the Turnstile

0 perator to let him in.



After talking to the youth,     I started watching the game.    The next
                                                                                  PAGE


                                     lice Officer go up to the referee and the game

                 pped.   I then looked at the West Stand and saw people trying t

       qe t o ve r t he f encinq «   My ini 1 1 a 3. thouqht was that it was a c rowd

        nvasion of the pitch



       I realised after a time that the Police were not trying to keep the

       supporters in, but trying to get them out.            I walked down towards the

       West Stand and saw about thirty people on the pitch, some lying down,

       some standing and some knee1ing.



       I then walked back to where I was originally standing.



       The advertising boarding was then moved away from the North Stand

       wall and an ambulance came down the side of the pitch.              fhen a large

       number of Police started arriving and made their way towards the West

       Stand.     I stayed where I was until about three forty-five (1345), but

       I was so shocked and frightened that I decided to go home, which I di



       As I have said before I was on duty at the same game last year and I

       can say that there appeared to be more Liverpool supporters at the

       game this year than last.



       Things I have noticed that were wrong at the ground were, that as far

       as I could see there were no Police Officers or Stewards at the

       entrance to the tunnel, stopping people going through the tunnel when

        it was full, and no one directing fans to other entrances onto the

        terracing.




                                                                                  SIGNED

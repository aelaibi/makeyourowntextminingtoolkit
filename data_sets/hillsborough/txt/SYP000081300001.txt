d o n ’t know what work was                taking       place but the      road was 3 lanes wide

we were walking along w ith the Forest                         supporters.          I saw    lots of them

L i verpoo l       supporters       drinking,        but that was       possibly because we were

close     to the entrance            gates.        At   neither      end of the ground had             I seen

a ny disorder,         d runkeness         or fighting,        everyone     seacffed to be enjoying

w hich     I did and at no time                   did    I see any disorder                 or d runkeness       or

supporters^^rinking                  beer.        I sub se qu en tl y took            up my       position    in the

wearing an orariga/jacket.                        I mana ge d to tadKe up my m atch vi^^Tng                       point

crush.         Whilst       sitting      on my own         I could see           into       the   pens   behiruj^he

Liverpool        goal,       the Leppinqs Ln terraces and the                              crowd was s y r g i n g

forw ar d because             the    pens were          still    filling      up from the            back.     This

happens        sometimes w h e n the game                 is in progress,              but at this        time    there

was   nobody on the              pitch.          The surging       f r a m / % lie    back was       so great     that

those      beneath the West S t an d were                   be i njjf'pul 1 ed up into the               stand^ to

a v oi d   injury.          This was        only    possi.J/ 1 & because             the    crushing at the back

of the terraces was                  o b v i ou sl y not as great as that at the front

There was        no movement at all                 from the front            of the terrace                   ds and

from a c tu a ll y going            onto       the    pitch,    but    people       stopped taking               notice

and were     lying      down oo/*the pitch.                    I then saw 2 fans              b e i n g > ra rr ie d

down the     pitch ory*fiietal stretchtexts by policemen.                                I t^fhk       towards         that

running     track and stopped                   behind t t y s goal.           At this time          I saw 2

stretchers        being       carried along             the    pitch by men           in uniform.            The

bodies on the s tretchers were                         covered up and were a p p a r e n t l y dead.

w he n   I got there          I also       saw that       policemen were              using the hoardings                   to

convey     injured people down the                      pitch.        Whe n    1 was at the entrance

be tw ee n the N or th S tand and the Kop,                       I told a constable who was

standing     there that             I was a nurse and a sk ed                  if I could help.                  He said

"I'm sure you         can,      just       go on and see what you                   can do."         The     injured

were     being    d eposited on the                  pitch in that         corja^r and the first                  person

   saw was a man          m     y brown suit who was                   k#ee 1 ng over a lad who was

a bout    15 or    16 y j / a r s       old.     The man waa^lCo 1 di ng his               head.       The       lad was

barely     conscious.           I formed the opinion that                        the man a pp ea r e d to                   a

doctor and he left me                    looking       after t i n e lad.        The      doctor was /            white

just     been sick," & she w a l k e d away.                 I thum pe d the         lad on the back and

was    shouting       to him to       cough.        He started to get some air                 in but was

still        in d iffi cu lt y & only just about               conscious,       during    this        time a

poli ce ma n a sked       if I needed an amb ul an ce and                   I said,    "Yes    it's     urgent,

mate     turned up to         look after          him    & when     I was    satisfied he was fully

conscious         I left him w ith his friend and                    instructed him what              to do S,

or    c o Tj&ro 1 about what was            happening.         I couldn't tell whether                 the

p e o p le   were just having a go to help or whether                          they had any M'dical

or first aid experience.                    1 saw 2 men trying              cardiac massji^e on a man

i nc or re ct ly and pointed this                 out,    and they asked me to/nelp w h ic h                 I

did,     but whilst       I was      giving       the    heart massage        the man who was doing

the m o u t h - t o - m o u t h kept arguing w ith me and a lot of time was w as t e d

ex pl a in i ng     things.        E ven his mate was          gjp^tfting him to       listen.         The

p a t i e n t was a w hite man aged about j r f l d             2 0 ' s,   straight     dark    brown

hair,        overweight,      about       15 storj^f we ar in g       jeans and a red          'T'     shirt.

He was we ar in g a L iverpool               scarf.        A m an    came to me and said,              "Give

it an ot he r       couple    of minutes          and    if he d o e s n ’t take over         on his own

you'll        have y 6   give      up."     Subsequently        it was apparent          to me that          the

patient w a / o e a d        and    I covered his face w ith his                scarf.        W hen    I stood

up I coua d see others who had been helping                            people,       giving    up their

re su sc i ta t io n a tt em pt s and        covering       up their        faces.     I realised then

that     I d i d n ’t know where my husband was and went                        to    look for him in

the L e pp in gs Ln terraces,               but    couldn't       find him.      Eventually           I made my

way back        through the         line of police still across                 the    pitch and        stayed

I w ^uld think            that one of the main -lectors                in the deaths and^arfTjuries

of these       people was/'cause d by thjar time               it took the           policjr to -realise t»

react to the s i / U i a t i o n , and by not           letting        them ontovChe          pitch as soon

as    poss ly i e . {    There must       certainly have        been sjyrfe sort of

commuj»u cat ion J^feak down between those                     pol>^e outside              the g round and

fans     erijreritig the ground.             I c a n ’t believe        those     police      outside          told

those     inside        that the gates          had been opened.                     the m a t c h was

st op p ed there was a lack of organisatij>rfT                        c ^ Q r d i n a t i o n & l ea de rs hi p

from a ny      party and the          lack of f i f ^ T a i d    equipment m ade the whole

thing      chaotic.         There    should have been an early                 1ouspeaker

a n n o un c em e nt    telling all       the    supporters what was             going on,         this       could

have     saved the extra            crush,      or even held the ig>^ck~off time                   up and

announced        that as well.            If they had done Imere w o u l d n ’t have                     been

that u rgency from the fans                  to get    in.     Jhose      railings         that    divide       the

pens are a waste             of time,      if they w e r e n ’t there          the    crowds       could have

pushed sideways and               lives    could have        been saved.

I d o n ’t see why          it is not      possible     to have a trained team of msdicat

staff     on s tandby in the ground at these football mat cJja'sT other than

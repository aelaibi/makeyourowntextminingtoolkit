H ILL SB O R O U G H IN Q U IR Y - SOUTH YO RK SHIRE POLICE


You will r e c a ll t h a t a t th e pre-inquiry m e e tin g on April 28th Lord Ju stice Taylor
in d icated t h a t any body ag ain st whom any alleg atio n was to be m ad e would be inform ed
of it and th e s u b sta n c e of th e ev id en ce supporting it.

You will a p p r e c ia t e th a t th e ta sk of assem bling th e evidence for th e Inquiry is a
fo rm id ab le one. And s ta t e m e n ts a r e still being taken . However, it seem ed right to let
you have what m ust be a p relim inary indication of c ritic is m s which may be levelled a t
th e South Yorkshire Police as soon as possible b efo re t h e co m m e n c e m e n t of th e
Inquiry.       We su sp e c t th a t you a r e alread y a w are of th e gen eral th ru s t of critic ism s
which h ave been m ad e and t h a t what is s e t out in this l e t t e r will be no surprise to you.

The following a r e th e main g e n e ra l c ritic is m s which so far appear from the evidence
av ailable to us:-

1.      F ailu re to ta k e any a d e q u a te step s to co n tro l su p p o rters so t h a t th e crush, which
        built up from ab o u t 2.20 to 2.30pm outside th e Leppings Lane e n tr a n c e to th e
        ground and which led to th e decision to open 'C' g a te because of a perceived
        danger to life, did n o t o ccu r. In p a rtic u la r, th e r e w ere not proper a rran g e m en ts
        to ch eck su p p o rters a t a far enough d ista n ce from th e grolind and insufficient
        o f f ic e r s w ere availab le to co n tro l th e crowd outside the turn stiles.                Having
        regard to th e lim ited s p a c e available, th e disposition of mounted police may not
        have b een o f any use and may have c o n s titu te d a positive danger. It should
        have been a n tic ip a te d t h a t many supporters would a rriv e shortly before kick-off
        and t h a t some would n o t have tic k e ts. Steps should have been tak en to stop
        n o n - tic k e t holders g e ttin g n ear th e ground and adding to th e congestion.
 2.    F ailure by o ffic e rs o utside to liaise ad eq u a tely with tho se inside the ground and
        vice versa. There w ere in addition problem s with radio co m m unications and th e
        noise of the crowd re n d e re d such tannoy or loudspeaker an nouncem ents (if any)
       as w ere m ade in e f fe c tiv e . When it was decided th a t a g a t e or g a te s m ust be
       opened to reliev e p ressu re o utside (and th e decision to open g a te s may well have
       been a n ece ssary one in th e c ircu m stan c es), th e r e w ere no s tep s ta k e n to ensure
       t h a t th e r e was any police or s tew ard p resen ce to p rev en t those e n te rin g going to
       th e tunnel which led o n to th e a lread y o v ercrow ded Pens 3 and >+. It ought to
       have been realised t h a t w ith o ut such p resen ce all those coming in the g ates
       w ere likely to go down th e tunnel b ecau se of inadequacy of signing and because
       the tunnel was the only visible way to th e te rra c in g .

3.     No s tep s w ere tak en to m onitor properly th e s t a t e of Pens 3 and i+. O fficers
       ought to h ave been s ta tio n e d in th e tunnel a n d /o r a t the rear of th e pens and
       should in co njunction with th o se a t th e fro n t h ave ensured t h a t the pens did not
       b ecom e too full. It was known t h a t th e r e was likely to be a full house and th a t
       it was e s s e n tia l to en su re an ev en distribution of s p e c t a to r s in all th e pens on
       th e te r r a c e s , p a rticu larly as th e decision had been m ad e to give Liverpool th e
       sm aller end o f the ground.

Q-.    When people began to be cru sh ed and to lose th e ir lives, th e o ffic e rs in fro n t of
       Pens 3 and 4 took too long to r e a c t to w hat was happening. They seem ed to be
       thinking in te r m s of p rev en tio n of disorder and p itch invasion ra th e r than s a fe ty .
       There was no proper guidance given to the individual o f f ic e r s because no proper
       plans had b een m ade to deal with overcrow ding in th e pens. The g a te s leading
       on to th e pitch w ere not opened in tim e and, when th ey w ere, o ffice rs were
       initially trying to p rev en t people g e ttin g out. O ffic e rs seem ed not to know what
       they should do and, although many individual o ffic e rs showed g r e a t presen ce of
       mind and devotion to duty, valuable m inutes w ent by b efo re th e n a tu re of what
       was happening was a p p r e c ia te d .

5.     There w ere in ad eq u ate co n tin g en cy plans to d eal with th e so rt of em erg en cy
       which aro se. In p a rtic u la r, th e e m erg en cy serv ices may not have been called as
       expeditiously as they should have been and in su ffic ien t a r r a n g e m e n ts had been
       made to en ab le th em to gain a c c e s s to th e ground. Help for th e injured was not
       co -o rd in a te d and no use was m ade of th e tannoy system to explain to s p e c ta to r s
       w hat had happened or to organise assistan c e.

6.     Since th e r e was no c h a n c e th a t all those try in g to e n t e r the ground would be
       able to do so by 3pm, co n sid eratio n should have been given to d eferrin g th e
       k ick-o ff a t a much e a r l ie r s ta g e . It seem s th a t it was not until about 2 . 5 5 th a t
       this s te p was considered and by then it was th o u g h t to be too la te because th e
       te a m s w ere com ing o u t.              It should have been c le a r much earlie r th a t th e
       k i c k - o f f m u s t b e p o s t p o n e d a n d t h a t a d e q u a t e s t e p s w e r e t a k e n to g iv e
       assu rance to those try in g to g e t in t h a t th e r e was a postp o n em en t. This might
       h a v e r e l i e v e d t h e p r e s s u r e a n d o b v i a t e d t h e n e e d to o p e n t h e g a t e s .
                                                                                           t
Should any f u r th e r specific m a t t e r s which might resu lt in critic ism s co m e to our
a t te n t io n , we shall of course le t you know of them .

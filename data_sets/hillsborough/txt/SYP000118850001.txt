            there        were       a group        of     people         at     t he       public        house       already           for     causing

            trouble.            Public         Order         vehicles           were        deployed.             I again made                 the

            comment          that      it w o u l d       be      nice       if t h e s e        fans     caused any              damage,           it

            would        be to        the    pub.

            Many     fans       were        standing           about         and      it    became        apparant           that        they did

            not    h av e      tickets.            I was          approached               by m a n y y o u t h s      asking            if    I knew

            where        they       could      get      some.           I saw and             heard many             saying.             ’H a v e    you

            got a n y s p a r e s ’            I also          heard         quite         a few      people         sa y    ' C ome      oil w e ' l l

            these        and    similar           comments          I remember                thinking          'You've           got     another

            had    reversed.                Everybody             now was          heading          for    the       ground.             Looking          up

            W a d s ley L a n e        the     pedestrian               traffic            grew and        grew.            At    first        the

            pavement           was     blocked          but       then       h al f    the       r o ad wa s      covered with

            Liverpool           fans.          The      v as t m a j o r i t y         of     these       people       were        th e w o r s e         for

            dr i n k .       Many      s t il l    carried          four        packs         of    b ee r a n d      litger.            I c o u l d n ’t

            imagine          ho w     they were           going         to    consume            such quantities                  before

            entering           th e    ground,          p a r t i c u l a r l y as          ma ny were          unsteady           on their

            feet.         I remember              thinking          quite          naively          'This       lot     has       no     hope       of

            getting          in,      in t h e i r      condition'.

            I positioned myself                      on      the    corner            of W a d s l e y L a n e        and M i d d l e w o o d Rd

            looked        to m y       rear       towards          Leppings            Lane        and    I saw       the        road     completely

            b l o c k e d up w i t h         pedestrians.                    I d e p l o y e d PC         Thornton           to    s t o p all

            speak        to m a n y      people         about       their          foul       language          and     behaviour.  In

particular              I spoke          quite         severely             to    one    y o u t h w ho          was    holding          an

opened        c a r af    of       red C a n a d i a n W i n e              about       his       language            and    behaviour

towards          two     girls        walking           in the          opposite              direction.                Th e

suggestions              made       were       obscene            and       totally          disgusting.                As     he m a d e

me     blaming          the    drink         and       saying          he w o u l d n ’t do             it a g a i n *         Remembering

continue,               I remember             thinking               how    each       p erson 1 spoke                 to a b o u t         their

behaviour           suddenly             became         very a m e a n ab l e            obviously               because          they       did

not w a n t        to    be a r r e s t e d        pr i o r       to    the       game       starting.                The    drunken

pedestrians              continued and                  I even          saw       two y o u t h s        carrying; a t h i r d w i t h

his a r m s        over       their         shoulders.                 He    was       being       h al f     walked and            h a lf

dragged.            I said          to      t h e se    youths          'There's, m o r e               chance         of a srfewball

surviving           in hell           than you              h av e     of    getting          into       the      ground'.              One

youth      replied            *1    k n o w m a te ,         but       you've          got    to    try       it!

All     this       time ma ny            youths         were          asking       the       crowd       'goyany             spares’.

The     reply was             always         no or          there       was       no    reply.           One      reply        I heard

from a group              of       f i ve    walking             to    the       gr ou nd was           'Sorry mate,               we    need

another          two     ourselves'.

As     I looked          down Leppings                  Lane          I could          see    a    l a rg e a m o u n t        of fans

congregating              n ea r      to     the       corner          where       the       turnstiles               were.        It was

obvious          that     the       crowd        sat        on    the       wall       opposite          to      the    turnstiles                di d

not     h av e     tickets.              I saw each               person asking                   for    tickets            go d o w n       to

th e    ground and             I heard           one        say w o r d s         to    the       effect         of    ' c om e    on w e ' l l

Jk*C‘ 2 . 5 5 pm the          pedestrian               traffic          was       still       heavy         but       it w a s     mainly

confined           to    the       pavement.                I all o w e d         PC T h o r n t o n        to    stop       point       duty.

through        safely.              At    so me      stage        I heard a             request           from Supt           Marshall

to    delay     the       kick       off     by      15 m i n s       to -allow fans                 to    get       into     the

About       3.10pm           f an s     started           to     come       out     of        the    ground       very         upset       and

very    hostile              in       particular           to       the P o l i c e .           We w e r e      s w o r n at a n d m a n y

Together          with        other           officers           I entered            the       tarmac         a r e a at       the       rear     of

Leppings          Lane        West       Stand.            This        area       leads         to      the    tunnel          which       in

As    I entered              this       compound           I could           sees         a    l a r ge a m o u n t       of    people

walking       about           apparently                 dazed.         Close         to       the      tunnel       entrance             I sa w

approx       6 bodies                 laid     on the          f lo o r .        Each         body      had    someone          with       it.        I

saw mouth           to m o u t h          resuscitation                 along        with           1st Aid.           Many        people

were    around           these          bodies           and     I decided            to       g iv e     assistance            to    the       root

of    the    p r o b l e m w h i c h wa s                obviously           on     the        other       side      of     the      tunnel.

1 went       through              the    tunnel           and       saw m an y        people            being     carried            through

the    tunnel           by f an s         to       the    terraced           a r ea.           On    reaching          the      pens       I went

         Police.

         I sa w m a n y          Police           Officers             in the       pens      in d e e p       shock.        After           the

         bodies        were          removed         I spoke            to    several         officers          in    partic ula r young

         WPC's       w ho       looked        close          to    cracking          up and         had      tears        running        down

         their       ch e e k s .          All      declined assistance                       or to       le a v e    the a r e a .           I was

         so     impressed             by y o u n g        officers            obviously          in e a r l y        days    of       service           ye t

         wanting           to    do       so m u c h      to      help.

         I became           aware          of a f a n v e r y            upset       who was         looking          for    his       friend.               I

         saw     him       try       to    get      to    the      pitch and a Police Officer                             was      telling           him

         to     go    the       other       way.             Pushing          developed and               I interveened

         immediately                 pulling         the PC            away.        Another         officer          I believe           a Sg t

         spoke        to    the       f a n who-' b r o k e            down    in t e a r s .        He was          taken away.                T h e PC

         was     obviously                Suffering            with      stress       from       the      incident^and                friendly

         advice        only was              given        but      the m o o d       of    the      f an s     pointed       o ut      to h i m a n d

         the     effect          it       could have              on all       of    us.       Whilst          in t he      pe n      I spoke           to

         Sgt Michael                 Roddis         from D2 At tercliffe                      fo r a m a t t e r          of a     few       se c * r » | « ^

ascertained                     where       s om e      of    the       real        emergencies             were       a n d as        s o o n as

diagnosed                  by     one    of      th e    doctors           and       I recognised                it    from         the

was    dressed                  in d e n i m s .         I believe              he      is     the    same       person         to     critisise

the P o l i c e             after        the       e ve n t .       Being           there       I strongly             rebuke          this

critisisiri at                    the    highest             level.

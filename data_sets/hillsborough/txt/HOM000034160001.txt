The Hom e Secretary was extremely grateful for your submission of 19 December. H e has
noted the handling arrangements set out in paragraphs 9 and 10 and the timetable for
action at paragraphs 7 and 8. He has also written as drafted to Bishop Sheppard,
Miss Carlile and Mr Kilfoyle and has commented that they are all very good letters for
which he is extremely grateful.

2      Finally, the Home Secretary is content with the terms of the draft “treat official”

from the families of Hillsborough victims.

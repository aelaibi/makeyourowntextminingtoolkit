Dear Mr Mole

Hillsborough     - Disclosure of Information

T h a n k you for your letter of 6th March 1992, relating to pictures                        from
the Hillsborough disaster.

The two pictures requested by the family are the copyright of the
New of the World.

I have discussed this matter with their piqture editor,                                        who
sees no objection to copies being given to the family.

The negatives are still held by the inquiry team, so it would be appropriate
to send prints yourselves.


Yours sincerely

Dear Inspector Brentnall



Re:    Hillsborough

As I mentioned in our telephone conversations yesterday and this morning,
___________________ has asked me to reply to your letter of 6th March 1992
with which you enclosed a copy of a letter from Messrs Silverman Livermore
dated 25th November 1991.         In their letter they requested copies of
s p e c i f i c still photographs fr o m recordings originally supplied to you by
the BBC.

As I explained, because of the nature of the recorded material,                                  the BBC has
adopted a strict policy of not making it generally available.

However, on the basis that the still photographs are required to enable
Messrs Silverman Livermore properly to advise their clients as to their
legal rights, and in the very specific circumstnaces of their request, the
BBC is prepared to make an exception on this occasion.         I formally confirm,
therefore, t h a t t h e BBC i s agreeable t o your supplying to M e s s r s Silverman
Livermore the still photographs, taken from the recorded material, which
they have requested.                              ~

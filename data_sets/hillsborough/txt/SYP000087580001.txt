ranks s to od at the front               of the ground.         One PC was      leaning a g ai n s t a

barrier,        at the end of one of the side                 roads.

T he re were       numerous me mb er s      of the     public a bout     but no figh ti ng        could

be seen.

I h eard one memb er            of the    public shout,        "You want     to be    in there     not

I made my w ay t hr o ug h the group of offi ce rs and                   towards      the exit gate.

ground,        w i t h other    police officers       or m em b er s   of^The    public w i t h them.

On    looking      down the tunnel         I could see some        lymd of d i s tu r ba n ce     taking

place.         At this time       I had had no i n s t r u c ti o n or i n f o r m a ti o n as

             As    I looked to my          right,      I saw what can onlv/be            d es c ri b ed     as a pile of

             bodi e s .     P ol ic e   officers were        picking        Lfcf^se people      up    and   pass i ng them

             to other officers             on the track aj^grtimd the              pitch.

             I assisted           in pulling     the f>»tfcing down to make a large                   exit.

        T & ^ H-lumerous bodi es ^of        b otj^s ex es were          then   passed to other o ff ic er s on

             the    pitch.

             One m an was          tra pped    by his    legs by ladies            piled a r ou n d him.        A no t he r

             was    t r ap p ed    up a ga i n s t the b o un d r y wall       of the track          pinned down by

             the weig ht          of bodies    on top of him.                All   the offi ce rs and       fans w o rk e d

mm           as q u ic k l y as      possible     to get these two             people out.

             I cannot       describe a n y of them           in detail         I just    know that they were              of

             both sexes.           Once all      the    bodies        had been passed on to the              pitch along

             w i th other officers            I was     i ns tr uc te d to form a c o rd oj /a cr os s          the   pitch

             in a effort           to clear     it and keep the fans apart.                    My serial then

Dear

Through statements made by other people it has come to my notice that you
attended the FA Cup semi-final, Liverpool v Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough
Football Ground on Saturday 15 April 1989.

It was my intention to obtain a statement from you regarding the tragic
events. However, after several attempts, my officers have failed to make
contact with you.

If you have any further information please do not hesitate to contact my
investigation team at Nechells Green Police Station. Alternatively you can
write to the Secretary of the Inquiry below:-

   Mr R M Whalley
   Secretary to the Inquiry
   50 Queens Anne’s Gate
   London SW1H 9AT

Yours sincerely




J M Jones
Assistant Chief Constable

           I am the above said person and I live at the above address together

           with my five children.      They are             (6),           4) ,         (2) ,

                      (9 months),            9 months).

           I am the wife of Patrick John THOMPSON who was born on 4th September

           1953 (04091953)     in Dingle, Liverpool.       We were married on the ______

           ______________________________at the Holy Family Church, Macketts Ln,

           Liverpool 25.      I have known Patrick ten years and we have been living

           together since November 1982.

           Patrick has always been in good health and he has never complained of

           any illness.

           His GP was Dr KEANE,      11A Camber ley Dr, Liverpool 25.
                                                                             PAGE




Patrick wore glasses which were silver metal           rimmed square frames,

with a double bar across the nose.         The lenses were very thick which

were un-breakable.

Patrick was in fact long sighted.         P a t r i c k ’s mother and father are

still alive and they are Mr & Mrs Patrick THOMPSON who live at no. C

             I   Liverpool 25.

Patrick smoked about 1/4 ounce of hand rolled cigarettes a day and

drank beer at the weekends        in moderation.

On Saturday 15th April     19S9 (150489) Patrick got up as usual and had

some Corn Flakes and toast for breakfast.            He then left the house at

0900 am that morning and I knew he was going to Hunts Cross Train

Station where he was meeting his two brothers           1.

                     f               and his other brother Joseph THOMPSON

                 r                 Liverpool

From the Station they were catching the 0920 am (0920)             to Manchester

and from there a connecting train to Sheffield.              They were then going

on foot to the football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest

at the Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield.            Patrick was a season ticket

holder and purchased a         6.00 terrace ticket at Anfield.

They arrived some time before        12.00 am (1200)    that morning at

Sheffield as Patrick phoned        me from the British Rail Club in

Sheffield to inform      me that he got there safely and to see if the

kids were behaving.      He said he was going to have his lunch there as

he had just ordered      it.     He ordered steak and kidney pie,    chips   and

peas.    He also told    me that he was going straight to the ground          from

there.    I understand from Patricks brothers that they arrived at the

ground some time after 1420 pm that day.

I don't know any other relevant information after this stage,              but his
                                                                                            PAGE


         brothers would.          Patricks occupation was as a British R a i 1 Guard and

         he has been working for British Rail                  since 1974.   His main place of

         employment was Garston Freight, Vineyard St, Garston, Liverpool                     19.

         Patrick also used to work in an abatoir                  cutting up cattle meat,     He

         had this job for about 3 years.

         On Thursday 27th April         1989 (270469)          I received the following

                           property from PC

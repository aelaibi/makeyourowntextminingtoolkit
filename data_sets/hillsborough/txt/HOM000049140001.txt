      EVIDENCE OF MR. DONALD DENTON




                    1
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: Are you still a serving Police
2        Officer?
 3   A   No, I am retired, sir;     I retired in 1990.
4    Q   What I wanted to ask you about was the process by which
 5        officers statements were taken and submitted to the West
 6        Midlands Police or Lord Taylor's Inquiry.      As I understand
 7        it, it happened in two stages:    first of all, the senior
 8        officers were asked about their own recollections, and I
 9        think they went through them with the solicitors, and then
10        the statements were sent to the West Midlands Police;         and
11        it was at a slightly later stage that the same thing was
12        applied to more junior officers, particularly those
 B        concerned at the Leppings Lane End.    Is that your
14        recollection?
15   A   It is not my recollection, sir.     I am not too sure that
16        there was an initial phase of senior officers.      I don't
17        think there was an initial phase of senior officers making
18        statements especially.    My recollection was that on the
19        day after - I think it was a Sunday - that everyone there
20        was asked to make a note of their recollections of
21        everything that happened, purely and simply as a matter of
22        record really so that people didn't forget things, I
23        suppose.   I wasn't party to that decision and I wasn't
24        party to the discussion that came out with that decision.
25        That was my impression.
26   Q   At any rate, it looks as though many police officers were
27        asked to write out their recollections?
28   A   They were, yes, sir.
29   Q   In their own words on ordinary paper?
30   A   Yes, sir.
31   Q   There came a time when the West Midlands Police asked for
32        statements from Police Officers?
33   A   They did, yes.
34   Q   And what happened then, as I understand it, was that      the
35        original statements were sent to the solicitors.      Is that
36        right?
37   A   Yes.

                                      2
 1   Q   And they did not alter the statements but they wrote back
 2       with comments and suggestions from time to time?
 3   A   Yes, sir.
 4   Q   I have a number of faxes       from the solicitors dealing with
 5       those matters.      Basically, I think, what they were seeking
 6       to cut out was comments, speculation and bad language?
 7   A   That kind     of thing, yes.
 8   Q   That kind     of thing?
 9   A   Yes, much     of which, of course, was       - as I remember    - the
10       kind of recollections, and       the kinds    of opinions and
11       emotive statements perhaps which the people themselves
12       were very pleased to have taken out once they knew it was
^3       going to go to a Judicial Inquiry anyway.
Ja   Q   I think that may well be       so.   I have had one fairly
15       striking example of that with a man called Frost whose
16       original statement was full of material which obviously
17       was not suitable.         What does concern me is that the
18       statements were then sent back.         Was it you who dealt with
19       them mainly?
20   A   It was.     It was for this    particular reason, sir, I was on
21       the very day appointed (or the day after, sorry) by the
22        Chief Constable as the liaison officer between the force
23        and the West Midlands Police who were initially appointed
24        to review that happening at Hillsborough presumably under
25        the terms of the Police Act.        Almost immediately, that was
26        followed by the appointment of Taylor LJ, and so I was
27        then doubly appointed, if you like, as liaison officer
28        between the forces and the Taylor Inquiry.           In actual
29        fact, it was all the one thing because West Midlands
30        Police immediately commenced to gather the evidence for
31        Taylor LJ and not particularly for their own Inquiry.
32   Q   What was the Inquiry under the Police Act involved with?
33   A   We had a situation where there was obviously going to be
34        immediately enormous criticism of the police, and Mr. Dear
35        was appointed, I believe, before Taylor LJ, to investigate
          the happening at Hillsborough, and presumably with regard



                                          3
 1        to a kind of disciplinary inquiry.      That was my
 2        recollection at the time.
 3    Q   It looks as though     counsel were brought in at an early
 4        stage for the South Yorkshire Police?
 5    A   Yes, they were.
 6    Q   I have a note of ameeting between counsel and South
 7        Yorkshire Police which I don't think you attended.
 8    A   Probably not.     That was Mr. Woodward, was it?
 9    Q   Yes.   Mr. Woodward    says that the purpose of what is to
10        take place is that it will be a gathering of evidence.         He
11        says that in his view
12               "... it is helpful if we look upon ourselves as the
13               accused.   We need now to gather as much information
 i
j.4              as we can in the time that is available.       Therefore,
15               I ask you, gentlemen, to continue from the point you
16               have already reached, which is no mean feat.       I ask
17               you to cast your net as widely as you can, and gather
18               what you think myself and Mr. Metcalfe in our
19               perverse mood may require."
20        He advises that statements obtained in those circumstances
21        would be privileged because it was anticipated that there
22        might well be writs against the police.      I shall obviously
23         have to consider that advice.
24               It seems that is the basis on the statements were
25         first obtained, or at any rate, some of them were first
26         obtained.   As I say, there came a time when the West
27         Midlands Police asked for the statements.     They obviously
28         had not got time to take them themselves?
29    A   No, of course they did not.
30    Q   All the ones that should have been obtained were self­
31         written?
32    A   Self-written and collected, yes, sir.
33    Q   They were all send to Hammonds Suddards      and they returned
34         them with various comments.      I have not been through all
35         these, but one of the things that does strike me is that
36         when the statements are amended - and you might like to
37         look at some of the amendments that we have picked up?


                                        4
 1    A   Yes, if I could, sir;     it is a long time since I have seen
 2        them.
 3    Q   Although I think it is probably fair to say that much of
 4        what has been cut out could be regarded as comment and
 5        opinion, in some cases at least, involved in the statement
 6        of opinion is a factual ingredient.      Can I just give you
 7        an example of that.     Will you look at Mr. Hanson.   Do you
 8        have that at the bottom of the first page?
 9    A   Yes.
10    Q   Deleted:
11                "I would just like to mention two points.   One, why
12                didn't we delay the kick off;    (2) when the crowd was
J-3               let into the rear of Leppings Lane, why weren't their
  i
X4                any officers to guide the fans to the side of the
15                terraces where there was ample room and the middLe
16                section cordoned off."
17        That, of course, is in the form of a question and a
18        comment, but it does rather suggest that there had been,
19        occasions - and we know now that there had - when the
20        terraces had been cordoned off in order to divert the fans
21        to the side.     Do you see the point that I am making?
22    A   Yes, I see the point.    There is an element of fact in
23        that, I suppose, but of course it is not anything that he
24        could give direct evidence of;       that is opinion, isn't it?
25    Q   I don't know.
26    A   He is questioning the actions of senior officers, yes.
27    Q   But it does rather suggest to me that he knew for a fact -
28        may be he didn't - that it had been cordoned off on a
29        previous occasion.      There is another one if you will look
30        further down that page under Bennett.       The original read:
31                "I had my personal radio but very little instruction
32                was coming from the control within the ground."
33        That is amended to:
34             "I had my personal radio but it was difficult to hear
35             transmissions."
36    A   I think, from my recollection there, the preponderance of
37        criticism by people who did have radios was that there was


                                           5
 1       so much noise that they couldn't hear them.           Whether that
 2       was to put it all in one category ---
 3   Q   That may well be so, but this particular officer is saying
 4       that he wasn't getting any instruction.          It may be that
 5       was the reason.         I am a little concerned that some of
 6       these alterations do seem to alter the factual position.
 7       It may be that the officer is wrong about that.
 8   A   It may be.     I think one has to look at the whole context
 9       of his statement.        One doesn't know from that extract
10       where that man was and what he might have been expected to
11       do and what he might have been instructed to          do.
12   Q   I will    look at it.     You see the point I    am making?
43   A   Yes, I see     the point you are making.
 i
14   Q   On the next page we have Kennedy.         This   is a post disaster
15       comment:
16                "Several senior officers were, I am afraid, lacking
17                in directing the officers there on the pitch towards
18                useful purposes."
19       That has a number of factual statements in it, namely,
20       that there were several senior officers there but they
21       were not actually giving any directions to officers.,
22   A   Perhaps not directing him.           I couldn't really say how
23        truthful that was, to be perfectly honest.          It was
24        something that was mentioned by a number of people.           Yet,
25        of course, there were other people who didn't make any
26       mention of it at all.
27   Q   I know, but because it doesn't necessarily agree with
28        other police officers, it is not your function, is it, to
29        change factual matters?
30   A   No, it isn't, and I didn't change that either, sir;            it
31        was Mr. Metcalfe that suggested that.
32   Q   Mr. Metcalfe suggested that, did he?
33   A   Mr. Metcalfe suggested all the changes.          There were   no
34        changes suggested by the police at all.         I think if   you
35        were to look at the ---
36   Q   I have not got all the comments.         I am asking for all the
37        comments made by the solicitors.         Mr. Metcalfe, in his


                                          6
1          letter to me, says that he merely gave advice on these
2          matters.     He did not give an indication that any
 3         particular alteration should be made.
4    A     I don't think I can agree with that from my recollection,
 5         sir;     he was almost suggesting wording.
 6   Q     Perhaps you would like to look at the ones that I have
 7         got.     This is a fax of 15th May.
 8   A     Yes, I see.
 9   Q     Do you the statement that he may wish to reconsider some
10         comment on pages 3 and 4?
11   A     Yes, I see.
12   Q     And this one is actually Mr. Frost.         "This is a personal
a3         graphic account which we suggest is not necessarily
 I
^4         suitable in its present form for submission."
15   A     Which Mr. Frost, sir?
16   Q     That is PC Frost.     I think it is quite right that there
17         was a lot of material that was not suitable.
18   A     May be.     My recollection was that he was suggesting things
19         that came out.       That was not necessarily typical of the
20         kind of comment that came from Mr. Metcalfe from what I
21         remember.
22   Q     I shall have to look at other ones.         Here is another
23          letter.
24   A     He does make a comment, doesn't he?          Hedoesn'tsuggest
25         wording, but he might like to think         aboutwhatever   he said
26          about the fact that there weren1t enough people in a
27          particular place.
28   MR.   BONE:     Could you identify that, please, for the shorthand
29          note?
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       It is 16th May 1989 and it is a
31          reference to PC Wilson.     Most of the rest of these there
32          is no comment on at all.       Woodward.
33   A     There is another one there, yes.
34   Q      There is a comment on the lack of foot officers.           Final
35          sentence of this statement:
36                  "Although probably true, it cannot be within this
37                  officers knowledge."


                                           7
 1       I haven't actually seen that alteration.
 2   A   No.    I think one has to look at the whole statement rather
 3       than just the suggested alterations to get the whole
 4       context of the suggested amendment.
 5   Q   Here is another one.   This is dated 23rd May, a letter
 6       from Hammonds Suddards, and under Edmondson, there is a
 7       reference to CN?
 8   A   That is removing ambiguity, yes.        That is the meaning of
 9       that particular term, yes.        A suggested misprint.   I am
10       not too sure what he means there.        One would have to see
11       it, wouldn't one?
12   Q   I may have to look at some of these.
43   A   I think one has to look at the thing in the context of the
X4       whole statement really.
15   Q   There appear to be suggestions from Hammonds Suddards
16       rather than actual striking things out or amendments.            It
17       seems to be left to you to decide what is to be taken out
18       and what not?
19   A   You mean the actual wording of what goes in.
20   Q   Yes.   A particular example here is from Chief Inspector
21       Waring, isn't it.    His perceptions of the crowd position
22       at page 5 do seem at odds with most other officers, but
23       obviously this would not be altered if it is his clear
24       recollection.    I wondered what other officers he saw on
25       his walk down Leppings Lane and perhaps details could be
26       included if he is wanting a little bit of expansion, if it
27       is possible to do so there.
28   Q   How did the alterations come to be made?       Did you cross
29       out what you thought should not be in and then invite the
30       officers to sign them?
31   A   It was very much a joint affair.       This was a huge task
32       because there were upwards of a thousand statements.          They
33       were being processed at quite a considerable rate daily,
34       and we were urged to treat it in a timely fashion in order
35       not to delay the Taylor Inquiry.        At the time that these
36       were asked for, as I remember, there was a team working in
37       Police Headquarters actually transcribing these versions


                                       8
 1       iof events on to a computer system, the Homes Computer
 2       1System.     That team was supplemented by other officers.
 3       We formed our own Inquiry team.      I didn't;   other people
 4       did, and I was aware that it was there. The things that
 5       came back from Mr. Metcalfe, in a word, went to that team
 6       who suggested amendment and who then went out, people from
 7        the team went out and saw the individual people, and
 8        showed them, or discussed with them their revisions to the
 9        statement, and came back with their signed statement and
10        that was sent to the West Midlands Police.
11   Q   You were in charge of this Inquiry     team?
12   A   I suppose, yes, one must say that.      I was really in charge
13        of the transmission of information to and from Mr.
A         Metcalfe, but I couldn't obviously deal with it.      I saw
15        everything that came back from him, and it went to the
16        team, and it may well have been, certainly on one or two
17        occasions, that the statements he was talking about were
18        in fact reviewed and discussed between myself and members
19        of the team.    There were two Chief Inspectors at that
20        particular time, Detective Chief Inspectors who were
21        looking after this revision of statements:      one Foster and
22        one Philip Jones. I may well have discussed Mr. MetcaLfe's
23       5 comments with either of those, and we may have discussed
24        how his comments might best have been achieved in terms of
25        wording, but it was actually drafted by those people - by
26        that team of people - and finalised by the officer himself
27        who made the statement, in his presence anyway.
28   Q   Did you have any cases where officers refused to sign the
29        statements?
30   A   I do understand that there were one or two officers who
31        were a little bit upset that their statements had been
32        altered.     I am not too sure that I can remember anyone who
33        refused to sign, to be honest.     I imagine that that might
34        well have been the case although I can't bring one to
35        mind.      There weren't many, if there were.




                                       9
 1    Q     There certainly was some concern about signing them
 2          because there is an explanation sent round which was
 3          approved by the solicitors.
 4    A     Oh, an explanation went round as to what the purpose of it
 5          was, yes.    That was because of concern that they didn't
 6          know what was happening.      They had left and been asked to
 7          express themselves and suddenly, of course, these things
 8          were being turned into something which was rather
 9          different.    They knew that there was an Inquiry, and they
10          wondered why and it had to be explained to them.
11    Q     That was explained to them.        Your recollection is that
12          you don't actually remember any individual cases of them
-13         refusing to sign?
■A    A     I don't personally remember any individual cases of
15          refusing to sign although I certainly wouldn't say we
16          never had them.
17    Q     We have not found any    cases.
18    MR.   BONE:    We haven't found any cases, no.
19    A     I do know that    there were people who expressed concern
20          that what they said had been altered, or it was being
21           suggested that   it be altered, but I think the majority of
22           them, when they realised why and what in fact was being
23           done, they certainly signed the statements and agreed with
24           t h e ---
25    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH: One of the         things that strikes me
26           about the alterationsthat I have       looked at - and   I have
27           not looked at all of them - is that there tends          tobe a
28           removal of criticisms of senior officers but no
29           corresponding removal of criticisms of the fans.
30    A     I think one has to look at the light in which this was
31           being done, sir.
32    Q     In what light is that?
33    A     This, as you say, was    in fact being done    in a way which
34           anticipated an Inquiry and anticipated actions against the
35           Club, against the Police, and I think it would be fair to
36           say that throughout the whole of this exercise - whilst
37           there was nothing distinctly deliberate about it - the


                                          10
 1        I South Yorkshire Police at that time had their backs to the
 2         wall a little bit with public opinion against them.         I
 3         think it was absolutely natural for them to concern
 4         themselves with defending themselves.
 5    Q   With what?
 6    A   With defending themselves or their actions, rather than
 7         trying to defend what the fans did.     I don't think it was
 8         in Mr. Metcalfe's interest - "interest" is the wrong word,
 9         whether it was within his remit as he saw it - to make any
10         comment about what in fact the fans had been alleged to be
11         responsible for.     This was a concern about the police
12         action, wasn't it?
43    Q   When it came to statements going to the West Midlands
 Jl        Police for the purpose of Lord Taylor's Inquiry, did you
15         think it was appropriate to cut out criticisms of police
16         officers which were voiced by junior officers?
17    A   It depends on what it was, sir.      I can only say this:
18         that a lot of that was done in very traumatic and
19         emotional circumstances, and I know there were a lot of
20         people who wished they never said certain things and
21         written certain things.      May be that was part of it. It
22         all depends what the criticism was.      There were criticisms
23          like saying, "Well, I wasn't told about what was
24         happening."   May be it was not intended that any
25         particular people were told what was happening or were
26         going to be told what was happening, because there were
27         more pressing things where people who could do something
28         were being told what was happening.       There were a
29          thousand policemen there and a hell of a lot of them were
30          not in the ground, and I know there were criticisms from
 31         the people who were not directly concerned on that pitch
 32         about being kept in the dark, as it were;     there were
 33         obviously more pressing matters.
 34   Q   These criticisms are more in relation to how the police
 35         operation was being done.     For example, look at Mr.
 36         Paterson, about half way down the page.      What has been
 37         deleted there is:


                                         11
 1              "...lack of uniformed officers who were supervising
 2              fans as they made their way to the ground.      In the
 3              past I have seen fans marshalled in groups in a far
 4              more orderly manner."
 5       That was obviously a matter which the Inquiry was going to
 6       be concerned about.
 7   A   I have no doubt at all, sir.
 8   Q   Why should that comment be excluded?
 9   A   I think I should have to see Mr. Metcalfe's comment on
10       that statement before I could say anything about that,
11       sir;    I am not too sure just why.
12   Q   I am not quite sure I have got that.
13   A   Criticising the lack of officers supervising fans on their
 \
Ja       way into the ground - I wouldn't know, sir, and I wouldn't
15       like to comment on that;       on why that was done.
16   Q   There is Birkenshaw a little further up where he says:
17               "Quite often at big games I fly an aircraft, and
18               together with an observer monitor traffic on the
19               approaches to the ground and crowds around the
20               ground.   I was not required for that duty on this
21               occasion."
22   A   True.
23   Q   That is a factual observation, isn't it?
24   A   That is a factual observation.      Birkenshaw, of course, was
25       a private pilot.
26   Q   He is a police officer?
27   A   With a private plan.     Yes, he is a police officer.     I
28       presume that on this occasion it wasn't thought necessary
29       to employ him in a private capacity to do that.        They have
30       in the past used AA spotter planes and things.         In the
31       main, it was for traffic control, the aircraft, and I am
32       not aware whether or not they did use the AA on this
33       particular occasion.      Bob Birkenshaw, whom I know, and I
34       know personally, felt aggrieved that he had to work on the
35       ground around the match and not in an aeroplane up above
36       the ground, sir.



                                        12
 1   Q   I cannot remember now whether there were aircraft
2        monitoring.
 3   A   I cannot remember.        I know that we have used the AA in the
4        past.     I didn't know, actually, that Birkenshaw had been
 5       used before.       Quite often at big games it is a little bit
 6       expensive because I don't think we often do it.
 7   Q   It is not really for you to say whether or not the officer
 8       is telling the truth about it?
 9   A   No, of course not.        I think one has to question, sir,      how
10       many times he had been required for duty in the past, and
11       I don't think it was many at all.         I think most of it was
12       done in his own time off his own volition.
13   Q   In that case, I should have thought the question you might
Ja       have asked was: "How often?"
15   A   Yes, may be.
16   Q   You see, one of the problems, as        you know, is there has
17       been a great deal of feeling and        suspicion that      the South
18       Yorkshire Police were covering up the omissions of senior
19       police officers.         That started off with Mr. Duckenfield
20       not telling the truth when he was asked about it.             Some
21       police officers, at any rate, were responsible for
22        spreading disinformation to the police about the conduct
23        of some of the fans.        I think you probably know about
24        that?
25   A    I don't know about that at all, sir.
26   Q   There were allegations in T h e S u n that the     fans     had been
27        urinating on dead bodies and stealing from them, and
28        matters of that sort.
29   A    In T h e S u n , sir?
30   Q    In T h e S u n newspaper, yes.    It was said   that the
31        inspiration for that came from police officers.
32        Obviously, you were not responsible for that.
33   A    I wasn't responsible for it, no, and I would - well,            I
34        would hesitate to comment on that, sir.
35   Q    The problem is, you see, when one finds         this sort    of thing
36        happening, when I find that criticisms of senior officers
37        are by and large taken out of these statements and


                                           13
 1        criticisms of the fans are not taken out, it suggests -
 2        you put it clearly yourself:       South Yorkshire Police felt
 3        they were in a defensive position with their backs against
 4        the wall.
 5    A   They certainly were, sir.
 6    Q   But the question that I haveto consider is whether or not
 7        a fair picture was being put forward by these officers.
 8    A   I think a fair picture was put forward.         I don't think
 9        that any of these - I wouldn't like to think any of these
10        extractions from their versions of events had affected
11        anything.
12    Q   In the result, I don't think       they did.   Lord Taylor made
4,3       very stringent criticisms of the police on all the matters
A         where these comments are excluded.       I think that is
15        probably right.     Do you see the problem?
16    A   I see the problem, sir, yes.       I see the   problem in these -
17         it is a question of scale, isn't it, and I'm not too sure
18         just how many of these are critical of senior officers to
19        be honest.      I take that the point that there are
20         criticisms perhaps being removed of the police operation.
21         It may have been - I know on some occasions - people
22        perhaps were not aware of what was happening elsewhere,
23         and weren't aware of the actions of other people.
24    Q   Does that matter?
25    A   I think in terms of trying to put the most factual account
26         before an Inquiry which could be justified and absolutely
27         sworn to, I think many of these extractions were
28         necessary, sir, to remove ambiguity.      That was the way we
29         started off.
30    Q   To remove ambiguity?
31    A    Lots of things that couldn't be justified - that were
32         ambiguous.     I know for a fact that there was certainly no
33         concerted effort or not conspiratorial effort, shall I
34         say, with the people involved to specifically remove
35         criticisms of senior officers.      That was certainly not
36         anything that was within my knowledge anyway.        Much of the
37         stuff is hearsay.     There were people who were making


                                        14
 1       comments who could not have seen and were not in a
 2       position to have seen what they said - inconsistencies in
 3       the statements like that, and the original statements were
 4       all made in rather difficult circumstances.
 5   Q   In what way?
 6   A   Quite emotional circumstances and traumatic circumstances.
 7       There were people who left accounts of what happened there
 8       who didn't come back to work for weeks or months;           there
 9       were people who were so affected that they were
10       discharged, if you like, or retired;        people were affected
11       emotionally.      I don't know what happened to their
12       statements, to be perfectly honest, and whether or not
43       they were altered, but it was in those circumstances that
 i
14       this was being done and amendments were suggested to
15       people.       Perhaps in some cases it was to better protect
16       them:      they had said things which they could have been,
17       tripped up on or taken up on which they could not
18       justified;      that kind of thing.    That was the kind of
19       exercise that we were going through in the main.
20   Q   In what better way to protect them?      From criticisms
21       within the force or what?
22   A    No.
23   Q   If it was thought to be an unjustified criticism of senior
24        officers, would that be a matter for concern?
25   A   No, that wasn't of any concern at all.       There was
26        absolutely no concern about how anything that anyone had
27        said would be viewed within the force.       That, to my
28        distinct recollection, was never ever a part of it.          It
29        was never a concern.     There were criticisms made of this
30        nature:     "Why didn't someone do this?    I was there and
31        nobody did it."      Why didn't they do it, sir?    That was
32        the question put to them, and they said:       "I had better
33        not say that then, sir, had I?"       That was the kind of
34        thing that I was referring to.       That was not unique where
35        people were saying in the furore afterwards,       "I knew
36        better. I would have done better had I been there.           I
37        would have done it this way.      I would have done it that


                                       15
  1        way."      In actual fact, when they realised what the
  2        circumstances were, they probably would not have said
  3        that.
  4    Q   That sort of question may well be a matter of comment or
  5        opinion.    One has to be careful though ---
  6    A   It is difficult, I must confess.
  7    Q   Sometimes a comment like that has concealed within it a
  8        factual statement which might be relevant?
  9    A   Yes, but unless someone was actually there and was well
10         aware of the actual circumstances which were at that time
11         prevailing on a particular officer, seniorofficer        or
12         otherwise, it would be difficult for them to saythey were
.J.3       standing there doing nothing, if in fact they were not
           exactly standing there doing nothing and someone was
15         viewing him from the time of the Spein Kop when he was at
16         the other end of the ground and seemingly doing nothing.
17     Q   There came a time when the Treasury Solicitors wrote.
18         There was a problem because some of these unaltered
19         statements had been sent to the parties to the Inquiry,
20         and one particular officer was cross-examined about his
21         original statement.     In fact, it is Police Constable
22         Huxted.     You will see what has been taken out.
 23    A   I cannot remember that happening, sir.
 24    Q   You probably weren't at the Inquiry, were      you?
 25    A   No, I wasn't at the Inquiry.
 26    Q   Do you see what has been deleted there?
 27    A   Yes.
 28    Q   His unamended statement was given out and he was cross-
 29        examined about this.
 30    A   Yes.
 31    Q   He says that it was his own opinion and that was so.          At
 32        any rate, this particular incident gave rise to an
 33        exchange of correspondence between Mr. Mervyn Jones and
 34        Mr. Wright, your Chief Constable, and the Treasury
 35        Solicitor.     On 7th June 198 9 the Treasury Solicitor says
 36        this:



                                        16
 1                   "The main difference between the initial and the
 2               final versions of the South Yorkshire police
 3               statements is that any expressions of opinion were,
 4               as I understand it, on the advice of Mr. Woodward,
 5               removed from the final version.        As I understand it,
 6               Mr. Andrew      Collins' view was that there was
 7               absolutely no reason for excluding such expressions
 8               of opinion when they touch on matters relevant to the
 9                   Public Inquiry, and that in the circumstances there
10                   is no objection in principle to written statements
11                   containing such opinions being submitted to the
12                   Inquiry."
.13         That was on 7th June.      Did you know about that?
Ja    A     I can't remember it, sir.      I can't really remember that
15          being said.       There was, of course, a contrary view which
16          was the view of counsel acting for the Police Authority,
17          wasn't there?
18    Q     I suspect by then most of the statements had been altered,
19          had they, by 7th June?
20    A     No, sir;     I very much doubt that.     I think they    were still
21          asking for statements to be produced well into the back
22          end of the year.
23    Q     Really.     This was on 15th June that this was referred to.
24           I am sorry, the 15th day of the Inquiry.
25    A     We were still trying to rush around with amendments whilst
26          the Inquiry was going on, sir.
27    Q     I see.     You were not aware of that?
28    A     I might have been at the time, sir, but       I cannot
29           immediately recollect that at all.
30    Q     Have we any means of telling when these statements were
31           altered?
32    MR.   BONE:   Only by Mr. Metcalfe's letter, sir, and possibly in
33           some cases the dates on which they are said to have been
34           signed.
35    A     It was difficult with some of them to get them signed
36           afterwards, to actually discuss them with the people
37           concerned because quite a number of people were off sick,


                                          17
1        you see.    It did take quite a while.   On odd occasions it
2        wasn't substantial anyway.    It wasn't significant, I don't
3        think, that people didn't sign straightaway, but that was
4        the case.   The Inquiry team was still working during the
 5       time that the Inquiry was working - going around trying to
 6       get these things signed.
 7   Q   You didn't see anything improper in removing criticisms by
 8       junior officers of senior officers?
 9   A   I didn't see anything improper in removing some of the
10       opinions that were passed, sir.      I didn't at the time.    I
11       can see your point, and I can see the concern, and I can
12       see the concern that went all the way through the Inquiry,
13       but it was not as clear cut as that.      It was not a fact
Ja       that the police were trying to cover up.      They weren't
15       trying to cover up at all.    That was never the idea at all
16       in any of these statements and alterations.
17   Q   You know, I am sure, that Lord Taylor was very critical of
18       the way the police was presented to the Inquiry?
19   A   Yes.
20   Q   I will just remind you of what he said:
21              "It is a matter of regret that at the hearing and in
22              their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were
23              not prepared to concede they were in any respect at
24              fault in what occurred. Mr. Duckenfield, under
25              pressure in cross-examination, apologised for blaming
26              the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths, but that
27              apart the police case was to blame the fans for being
28              late and drunk and to blame the club for failing to
29              monitor the pens.   It was argued that the fatal crush
30              was not caused by the influx through gate C but was
31              due to barrier 124 being defective.    Such an
32              unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as
33              whether lessons have been learned.    It would have
34              been more seemly and encouraging for the future if
35              responsibility had been faced."
36        That is a pretty stinging rebuke.
37   A    It is, sir, and it is an opinion, if I might say that.


                                      18
 1    Q   Well, it is an opinion from a very experienced judge who
 2        had heard the way in which the case was presented on
 3        behalf of the police.     I am just a little troubled that
 4        what was happening with these statements may have been, as
 5        it were, part and parcel of that presentation.
 6    A   Not at all;     not within my knowledge anyway.    It's - my
 7        opinion doesn't count, sir;        that is not part of the
 8        inquiry.
 9    Q   You didn't think you were, as it were, not putting a fair
10         case forward?
11    A   No, I thought we were putting an eminently fair case
12        forward.      There was a good deal of evidence put forward
-13       about fan behaviour that was completely sanitised by the
Ja        Inquiry, sir - not even accepted;        not even heard.     That
15        is not for me to say, but I must confess that when I hear,
16        and when I heard Taylor LJ (I am not being critical here,
17        sir), but you hear so much about the case of the Liverpool
18        fans.   I wasn't there.     I have no axe to grind here.       They
19        were all angels.      They were all going to a match in a
20        perfectly normal way, and the police were wrong in causing
21        this to happen.      It was not that case at all, sir.
22    Q   That is not what Lord Taylor said.
23    A   No, it is not.
24    Q   He says the problem was exacerbated by a minority of
25         drunken fans.
26    A   One does not necessarily agree with the outcome of the
27         Taylor Inquiry, sir.
28    Q   No, I follow that.      I have to be guided by what Lord
29         Taylor said.     I have to assume that his conclusions were
30         well founded unless I have evidence which suggests they
31         are not.     At the moment there is certainly no further
32         evidence as to the conduct of the fans outside      the
33         Leppings Lane terraces.     I am not looking into   that.     I
34         know there was a divergence of opinion about that, and I
35         know that the police have never accepted Lord Taylor's
36         criticisms in that respect.



                                        19
 1   A   In so far as any comment that was removed was relating to
 2       things like that, perhaps the things that happened
 3       outside, can I assure you, sir, that there was no attempt
 4       by anyone in so far as anyone was associated with me, in
 5       trying to mislead the Inquiry by removing any comments.
 6       That was never ever a possibility.
 7   Q   You saw your function, as I understand it, to make sure
 8       that material that was put before the Inquiry was purely
 9       factual and did not have any comment or opinion?
10   A   Factual and relevant, yes;    and could be supported.     It is
11       difficult to define "opinion", sir.
12   Q   I think you accept that sometimes there is sometimes
13       factual matter concealed within an opinion?
Ja   A   One could say that, sir.     One wonders whether one would
15       have wanted to hear a number of people saying that the
16       match should have been delayed, a number of policemen,
17       when I am sure that whole business was covered by the
18       people who were in a position to delay it.
19   Q   I thin that was merely their own feeling of the matter,
20       and Lord Taylor came to the same conclusion.
21   A   We have got comments like the lack of uniformed officers
22       supervising fans on the way to the ground.     There is
23       another one somewhere, too, which says something like
24       that, about the number of people concerned with this, that
25       and the other.    It may be they were not aware of the
26       number of people in the particular places were the same as
27       they always had been.   There are things like that that
28       these people here were not aware o f .   They could only
29       comment on what they particularly saw.     To have left some
30       of these comments in would have been somewhat divergent, I
31       think, so far as the Inquiry was concerned;     it would have
32       created avenues to go down which were seen to be not
33       exactly true.    One would have had the opinion of a
34       policeman saying, "I think that could have been done
35       better" having to be negated by a senior officer
36        explaining why he did what he did, and the policeman
37        afterwards during the Inquiry saying, "I am awfully sorry,


                                      20
 1       but I wasn't aware of that."        That is the kind of thing
 2       that was taken out.     That is the kind of thinking behind
 3       what was removed.
 4   Q   I see.   So far as the alteration of the statements is
 5       concerned, you were the senior officer concerned?
 6   A   Yes.
 7   Q   Am I going to get any help by asking these two Inspectors
 8       who were in charge of the team?
 9   A   I don't know, sir, to be honest.       I very much doubt
10       whether they will be able to say any more than what I have
11       said.    We were all of a mind.      We all knew what we were
12       doing.      We all knew why we were doing certain things.
13   Q   You thought you were giving the advice given by Mr.
■A       Metcalfe?
15   A   Yes, we were all following the advice given by Mr.
16       Metcalfe, and we thought we were properly following that.
17       I must confess, looking through the things as they were
18       changed, and there were certain deletions made - and
19       looking through them again, as       one did, and one saw not
20       all of them but a    hell of alot of     them - I was quite
21       satisfied that Chief Inspector Forester, Inspector Jones
22       and I were all thinking along the same lines and all doing
23       the same thing.     I doubt very much whether they would say
24       anything more than what I have said.
25   Q   They were the two officers under your command?
26   A   As far as I remember, there were those two.       There was an
27       Inspector Gunn as    well, but he    wasin charge of   the
28       computer team and    I am not toosure that he     was terribly
29       involved - not too involved in this statement alteration.
30       Anyway, there were these two people, an Inspector and a
31       Chief Inspector, and there were a number of other
32        Inspectors who were going around as well, and who were
33        involved in this, who actually went out to see the people
34       on the ground.     Of course, they didn't see them all, and a
35        lot of the statements, when they had been amended, were in
36        fact left with the officers' own divisional supervisory
37       people to give to them and let them see, and then sign and


                                      21
 1       send them back.    They were not all seen personally and
 2       individually;     it would not have really been a possible
 3       task.
 4   Q   When you learned that a number of officers were concerned
 5       about this business of alterations of statements, did that
 6       cause you any anxiety?
 7   A   No, sir, it did not.     It did not happen that there was
 8       suddenly a crisis.     There were rumblings from people
 9       occasionally that it happened in this kind of way.
10       Perhaps one of the fellows who had been out and fetched
11       the statement back or whatever, had said:        "He wasn't too
12       happy about signing that."        Then there was probably a
13       discussion then:     "Why not?"    You know, that kind of
-A       thing.     It didn't cause me concern because it didn't all
15       happen at once; there wasn't a great bit sort of anti
16       statement altering cause.         During the course of 12 or 15
17       weeks there might have been one or two people who said,
18       "I'm not too sure that you should be taking that out of
19       there."    That was my recollection of what happened.         I
20       don't think there were many more, and that was dealt with
21       at the time on an individual basis, and everyone signed as
22       far as I was concerned.
23   Q   I am going to look at the statements which have been
24       altered in more detail.     My impression at the moment is
25       that a good deal of criticism of senior officers was taken
26       out.     You say that is a matter of opinion and comment and
27       not necessarily a factual     matter.
28   A   I don't think they would have been taken out, sir, had
29       they been regarded as significant or factual.
30   Q   The criticisms of senior officers would be significant,
31       wouldn't they, if they were well justified?
32   A   Not necessarily, sir, no.    As I mentioned before, it is
33       easy to stand some distance away and say, "He was doing
34       nothing" when you don't even know what he was doing.              That
35       is the kind of criticism that I mean where I say it really
36       needed clarifying and where from other evidence you knew
37       what was happening, you were aware of what was happening.


                                      22
1        When it was explained to the people, they would probably
2        say, "Oh, yes, well, I didn't know that" and they would
3        sign the amended statement.        OK, there were one or two
4        occasions, sir, when there were criticisms made of the
5        abilities of officers who were actually there.        That I
 6        suggest is pure opinion, and unless someone saw a senior
 7       officer doing something which was not helping the
 8        situation, that might have been relevant.
 9   Q   I think the problem was that a lot of people thought        the
10        senior officers were not doing anything at all.
11   A   I think that was the case, sir, but I think that was        a
12        rather mistaken view.
     LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:   There we are.     I may want to    come
1
15
          back to you on this, Mr. Denton.      We will send you a
          of the transcript of what you have said.
                                                                      copy
                                                         If you want to
16        correct or alter anything, or if you want to add anything
17        to that which you have said, please feel free to do so.
18        As I say, when I have looked a bit more at the individual
19        statements, I may have to come back to you, and we may
20        have to take it up with some of the more junior people in
21        your team.   Thank you very much indeed for coming.

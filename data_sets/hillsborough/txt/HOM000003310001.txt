I trust that these arrangements are satisfactory. You will note that
all accommodation, transport and messing facilities have been catered
for. You will also    see that I have included certain telephone numbers
where you can becontacted during the course    of your visit.

I know you are aware that the Belfry is in fact in the Warwickshire
Police area. I have provisionally warned Mr P D Joslin, the Chief
Constable, of your visit which I have advised is of a discreet nature
without publicity.

I am most sorry that I will not be able to join you on the day of the
visit, but I will be on leave walking in Borrowdale in the Lake District.
It is the first proper leave that I will have been able to enjoy this
year and the visit occurs right in the middle of the two week break. I
would appreciate it if Sir Peter would excuse me on this particular
occasion. In any case, the visit to Nechells is a day for our staff who
really are the work horses who have made this Inquiry a success. I would
not wish to detract from the recognition of their splendid efforts. I
would be grateful if you would pass on my apologies for absence to Sir
Peter. Best wishes for an interesting visit.

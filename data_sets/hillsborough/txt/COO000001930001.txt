Rt Hon Douglas Hurd CBE, MP.,
Secretary of State for the Home Department
The Home Office
Queen Anne's Gate
London S.W.I.

Dear Home Secretary,

You will no doubt recall that I raised the issue of
the problems experienced using the emergency telephone
service last Saturday.

I enclose a copy of "Civil Protection", issue number
10, which on page 24 gives information on Comtest
*89 which was the exercise I referred to.

I hope this will be of assistance to you.

Mr*. P.*J* Garrett,
National Secretary,
â– The Football Supporters Association,




Dear Mr. Garrett,
     Thank you for your letter dated 7th September 1987.

     It is true to say that discussions have been taking place
for some time that could ultimately result in a reduction in
the overall capacity of Wembley Stadium to meet certain local
Authority proposals and requirements allied to the issue of
a Safety Certificate to the Stadium under the Safety of Sports
Grounds Act. Nothing has yet been agreed or decided but if
and when it should become necessary to reduce the capacity
of the Stadium and it be deemed appropriate to achieve this
by increasing the number of seats then the ticket requirements
of Clubs will not be overlooked.
      The various allegations and points referred to in your
previous communication on the question of Cup tickets and other
items have already been noted and quite a number fall within
matters we are already looking into and dealing with. I can
assume"'you that contrary to what you suggest, any constructive
suggestion put forward to the Association in a reasonable manner
is never ignored and always receives consideration although it
is not always possible for various reasons to comply with wishes
aade.
                         yours sincerely.




                            E.A. Croker
                         General Slcretary

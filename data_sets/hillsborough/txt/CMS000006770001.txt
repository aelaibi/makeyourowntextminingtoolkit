NOTE OF MAIN POINTS OF MEETING HELD ON 8 MAY 1992 TO DISCUSS THE
OPTIONS FOR A POSSIBLE REVIEW OF ALL SEATING


Those present:            Miss A Stewart - DNH
                          Mr T Baden - DNH
                          Mr T Ellingford - DNH
                          Mr J De Quidt - FLA
                          Mr D Webb - HO
                          Mr S Bilbe - HO


1.    The following four options were discussed:-


(i)     No change to current policy


This was the favoured option of the FLA.                 It is the view of the
FLA that seating is safer than standing although they accept that
some standing areas can be made safe. In the light of statements
attributed to the Prime Minister and the known views of Ministers
it was accepted that this was unlikely to be the favoured option.


(ii) Extension of deadlines


The     FLA   felt    there    was    no   justification        for   extending    the
deadline      for    Premier    League     clubs   unless   there     were   special
circumstances.       If a club had firm plans to relocate and the FLA
were convinced that this would be completed within a reasonable
period after the August 1994 deadline then they might be prepared
to allow an extension.


The FLA also felt there was no case for a general extension for
Division 2 clubs.        These clubs have generally made less progress
than those in Division 1 and they did have a problem of finance.
It    was,    however,   open    to   Division     2   clubs,    as   with   the   new
Premier League,        to make a case to the FLA for an extension of
time.    It was      agreed that there should be no suggestion in any
announcement of an extension for Division 2 clubs.
(iii) Allow more standing at Division 3 and 4 clubs


The     FLA,    and    its     Inspectors,           felt     that       the    most    logical       and
straightforward approach was to distinguish between the Premier
League/Division 2 and Divisions                           3 and 4. Clubs would be                in no
doubt as to whether the all-seating requirement applied to them
or     not.    However       there    were          inconsistencies            of   attendances       at
clubs and the sizes of their grounds in different divisions ie
some lower division clubs attracted more spectators or had larger
grounds than those in higher divisions.                              It was also noted that
the constitution of each division                             would       change       every    season
because of promotion and relegation.


(iv) Allow standing on capacities below a specified threshold


While any figure for a maximum capacity would be arbitrary the
FLA     thought       10,000    to    be        a    reasonable          maximum.      The     average
attendances         of most clubs           in Divisions 3 and 4 would be below
this figure and they would thus be exempted from the all-seater
requirement.          Also    clubs       in    higher       Divisions         with     low    average
attendances would also be able to opt for a maximum capacity and
thus be exempted. However this option would result in different
treatment for clubs in the same division.


To implement this option the FLA licence for a ground would limit
its capacity and require certain terraces to be closed.                                        In any
option which allowed for the retention of standing areas it would
be necessary to ensure that those areas were safe.


2.     The meeting also discussed the limitations of the Football
Spectators Act 1989 and the Safety of Sports Grounds legislation
in enforcing          the    all-seating            requirement.          Under     S10(5)     of   the
1989    Act the       FLA are unable                to     include       seating    conditions        in
their     licences       unless       the       Secretary          of     State     has   issued       a
direction       under       section       11.       Home    Office       lawyers       felt    that    a
blanket direction under section 11 applying to all clubs could be
subject        to   challenge        in     the          courts.     A    direction       would       be


                                                                                                       2
necessary      for each case        in which the FLA wished to            include a
seating requirement in a licence.


3.     The licence cannot be used for safety matters. However, the
FLA could take action in respect of terraces under S. 13 of the
1989    Act.   Under   this    they    can    require    a    local   authority    to
include a condition in a safety certificate. However if a terrace
where unsafe the certificate could only prevent spectators from
using that terrace. It could not require any work to be done. The
FLA has no power to require a local authority to enforce a safety
certificate.     If    the    FLA   were     to   take   on   a   more   direct   and
effective safety role the current legislation would need to be
amended.


4.     A safety certificate cannot be used to enforce all-seating.
In Scotland ACPOS had suggested that the legislation should be
amended to make this possible.

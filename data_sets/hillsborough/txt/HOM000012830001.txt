Dear Sir

RECOMMENDATION 215 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S REPORT
FOOTBALL COMMANDERS COURSE

You will be aware that Lord Justice Taylor, when reporting on the
events at Hillsborough, addressed the question of training for
Police Commanders.    He identified the need for adequate training
in the basic strategy of policing football matches together with
the opportunity for pooling experiences and the solution of common
problems.

To this end the ACPO Personnel and Training Committee at its
meeting on Tuesday 10 July 90 formally agreed the core elements of
a Football Commanders course as recommended by a Working Group of
the ACPO    Committee, following closely the requirements       of
Recommendation 215 of the Taylor Report.

Although two seminars for     Football Commanders based on best
practice have been programmed by the Police Staff College for
August this year the ACPO Committee recognised the immediate needs
of the service and the urgency of responding quickly to the
recommendations of the Taylor Report.    A number of courses for
Football Commanders have therefore been arranged, at the following
Centres, specially selected to provide a training facility within
a reasonable travelling distance of Forces within England and
Wales:

Greater Manchester Police   - Sedgley Park Training School

West Midlands Police        - Tally Ho Training Centre

Metropolitan Police         - Hendon Training Centre

It is also acknowledged that the Kent Police are able to provide a
Football Commanders course, again following the core elements as
recommended by the Working Group.       This additional Training
establishment may assist nearby Forces.


TO ALL CHIEF CONSTABLES ENGLAND AND WALES
COMMISSIONER METROPOLITAN POLICE
COMMISSIONER CITY OF LONDON POLICE


 /ft
Appendix 1 contains full details of the centres, liaison   officers
and dates of future courses and costs, where known.

The courses are intended primarily for Chief Superintendents,
Superintendents and Chief Inspectors but are available for those
other ranks within the service with a command role at football
events.

In the fullness of time, it is intended that the Central Planning
Unit devise a standard course, but in the interim it is essential
that all football commanders have the benefit of such training as
the forthcoming football season approaches, rather than await the
approval of the Central Planning Unit course format.

As Chairman of the Working Sub Group tasked by the ACPO Personnel
and Training Committee to identify training centres able to
provide an early facility, I am pleased to circulate this
information to Chief Officers and in so doing draw attention to
the advice of the ACPO Committee.

Individual Forces are asked to contact the Training Centre Liaison
Officers, as specified, to satisfy their own Force training needs.

Yours faithfully




Acting Deputy Chief Constable

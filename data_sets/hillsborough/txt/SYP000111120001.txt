            At 8 , 0 0 a m        on S a t u r d a y ,     15 A                 o           I had        comm e n c e d     duties        at

            Hillsborough              Football           Ground       for       the     semi       final       match       between

            Liverpool            and Nottingham                Forest.              I was     part       of S e r i a l     13 u n d e r       the

            command         of    Inspector           BULLAS.             By     1-1.15 a m        1 had       taken       up m y

            designated            position          in the        West         S t a n d w h i c h w as        at    the    bottom        of    the

            steps      on    the      sta nd,       on    the w a l k w a y          in f r o n t       of    row    number       one,,       a n d at

            a   position above                and     slightly            to    the     left       of    the L e p p i n g s      Lane

            entrance         tun n e l .

            Having         worked        at   t his      location          on       numerous        occasions             in the       past     my

            ini t i a l     thoughts          were       t hat    the      terracing           had       begun       to    fill     up

            extremely            quickly.           I had        been      infarmed           that       the    gates       would        be

            o p e n e d at       12 n o o n     and      the     first         trickle        of    supporters             came     into       the

            stand and            o nto    the    terracing            shortly          after        12 noon.              Most    of     the

            supporters            coming        onto      the     terracing             stayed          on    the    central        portion

            leaving         ample        room    on      the     fla n k s .         With     up    to an       hour       before        the

            start      of    the      match      the      middle          section        of    the       terracing          was

            considerably              full,      however,           I would           not     consider          anything          wrong        with

            this      or    be    in a n y w a y         unusual.              The    crowd was              quite    noisy       but

            generally            in a g o o d m o od.             With         fifteen        minutes          before       the     start       of
the    gam e      the    central          area       had     become         quite          compact            but y e t           again

there       was    still       l arge         areas       unused, on          the       fl anks.              By    t hi s        t ime      I

hajj/been s t a n d i n g           with       I n s p e c t o r BUL-LAS for                  quite       some          time.

I ha d      b een a p p r o a c h e d         by m e m b e r s      of    the        Liverpool            crowd who                had       t old

me    on    two    separate             occasions          that       there          was      a build          up       of    people             at

the L e p p i n g s      Lane       entrance           and     that       the        turnstile            operators                were

taking       ten     pounds         in the          hand     for      people who               had a r r i v e d             without

tickets.           On    one       occasion          I had       seen       a supporter                  who       was       in    the       stand

who    I had       earlier          seen       in the        terracing               and      had    gained             entrance             to

the    stand       fay c l i m b i n g        up    the    barrier          wall.             He was          taken          out       of    the

stand       and    placed          back       in the       terracing             where         he    took          up    p o s i t i o n at

the    front.           He   was        not    drunk       but      had     obviously               been       drinking.

    t approximately                2,53       pm f r o m my         position            looking           o nt o        the       terracing

I sensed and             could          see a n      increased            agitation                in the          crowd.              The

supporters           were      being       i n c r e a s i n g l y c r u s h e d a n d w e r e c o m p a c t rig ht                                  to

the    terraces          and       see    what       the     p r o b l e m was.               At    t his      poi nt         the       gates

o n the      track       were       not       open     but     people         were         attempting               to       climb          the

perimeter          fence       and also             trying       to      climb        the w all           in f r o n t            of me          to

the    West       Stand.           My    ini t i a l      reaction was                to      prevent          this          but       as    I

looked       down       towards          the       entrance         tunnel           I could         see a          l a rge        number                of

fans       pouring       in f r o m       the       back.        By      t his       t im e    I could             see       the       body          of

a    person       being       passed          overhead         towards           the       front         of    the       crowd and                   1

was    being       inundated with                   cr ies     from       distressed                people          in the

terracing          and       in the       stand        appealing            for       me      to    help       them.              At    this

p o int     I radioed          to       control        saying         t hat      a    large         number          of p e o p l e           were,

down       and    in j u r e d ,        1 heard        ov er     the      air        that      the       match          had       been

delayed and             very       shortly          after      t h at     the        players         emerged.                 Lots          of

people       were       climbing          and       being      assisted              in to         the    West          Stand          and       I

assisted          in this.              1' took      hold      of     one     man       that        was       particularly

    seriously            injured                around          the       pelvic            region,          together         with     another

    supporter            we    took             him' out         of       the     stand           to    the       reception          area       at    the

    back      of    the       Lappings                Lane       entrances.                      After       leaving         the     injured          man          I

    immediately               returned                to    the       stand            and       found       it    impossible          to m a k e          my

    way    to      the    fr o n t .             As     I tried            to     force           past       I was       receiving          lots          of

    threats         to m y         person and                   being       called               a murderer.                Because        of    t hi s        I

    thought         it    prudent                to     stay         at    the         back       of    the       stand      in the        bar are a .

    In the         bar a r e a at                the       back       of    the         stand          I saw two            injured        people

    b e ing     tended         by P o l i c e              Officers.                   After       consultation with                   these          1

    went      to    the       reception area                         in an a t t e m p t               to    seek      medical        help.           This

    was    not      f o r t h c o m i n g , ' so            I returned                  to       the    bar a r e a         and with

    PC    1 423 N e w b o u l d             carried             an    injured               woman       to       the   reception           area.

    Whilst         in the          bar          area       we    received               several             calls      of    ’m u r d e r e r s ’ .

    The    f i rs t      trip          to       the     reception area                       I saw          three      bodies        laid       out w i t h

    blankets          o ver        them and                two       other        people           who       were      obviously           badly

    i n j u r e d who         had       blue          coloured             faces            and were             being      artificially

    resuscitated               by.ambulance                      c rew a n d            police          officers.             I returned              to

    the    bar a r e a         for          a    third          t ime a n d            assisted             PC 9 2 8 P a r k i n      in    carrying

    a third         injured             person             to    the       rear.

    At    t hi s    point          a    call          went       out       t hat        a man was                going      berserk        in the

    West      Stand       I went                b ack      up the          steps            to    be me t         in the      bar     area       by four

    incident.             Their             manner          was       such        that           I was       beginning          to    fear       for my

the pelvic region, together with another supporter we took him out of the stand
to the reception area eit the b .cl: of the Leppings Lane entrances.     After leaving
the injured man I immediately returned to the stand an        found it impossible
to make my way to the front*       As I tried to force past I was receiving lots of
threats to my person and b ing called a murderer.        Because of this I thought it
prudent to stay at the back of the stand in the bar area.        In the bar area at the
back of the stand I sav; two injured people being tended by Police Of icers.
After consulation with these I went to he reception a ea in an attempt to seek
medical help.       This was not forthcoming, so I returned to he bar area and with
P.C. 1423 NEWBOULD carried an injured woman to the reception area.           Whilst in the
bar area we received severed, cals.- of 'murderers*.
     The first trip to the reception area I saw three bodies laid out with
blanketsover them and two other people who were obviously badly injured, who had
blue coloured faces and were being artificially rescucitated by Ambulance crew and
Police officers.       I returned to the bar area Jbr a t! ird time and assisted P.C.
928 PARKIN in carrying a third injured person to the rear.
     At this point a call went out that a man was going berserk in the West Stand
I went back up the step to be met in the bar area by four men.        They confronted me
shouting in a hysterical marmerat me call/ng me a murderer and saying that I was
to blame for the incident.       Their manner was such that I was begining to fear for
my safety, but it had so maddened me that I shouted back at the men telling them
to make themselves usefull and to stop hanging around.        This seajned    to work and
they left to go down the stairs.
     Once in the stand again with Inspector GRACE and part of his serial we went
to a youiig man by the stairway who was in a very distressed, irate, emsotional
mood, by the look on his face he was no longer in control of himself and from
what people around him later said he had been lashing out and hitting everyone
and anyone in sight.      He was eventually   convinced he should leave the ground
and was escorted out by his friends.
     At this point I could see the mayhem on the pitch, people around me were
showing mixed emotions, some crying openly and other shouting and abusing the
Police or stewards or anyone in authority.       I stayed in and around he back of the
West Stand until it cleared and returned to the de-'briefing point in the North
         1

Stand.       Although I was aware that in the region of ten people had died, I hedrd of
countless numbers of bodies being taken accross the pitch and did not learn of the
true severity until later.
     My designated position is marked with an X on the attached map.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY:       HOME OFFICE EVIDENCE
Further to my note of 9 June, the Home Secretary asked that the
passage in the evidence on Restriction Orders be reduced to one
paragraph. I suggest the following:
        â€œMatches Overseas    -   Restriction Orders
        121 In response to disorder and violence involving
        supporters at matches abroad the Government have included in
        Part II of The Football Spectators Bill now before
        Parliament a power that would enable the courts to prevent a
        convicted football hooligan from travelling to key matches
        abroad in the future. The court would impose a 2 or 5 year
        'restriction order1 on the offender, who would then be
        required to report to an agency in England or Wales when a
        relevant match was taking place outside those countries.
        Failure to report as directed would be a criminal offence.
        The Government and police already maintain effective liaison
        with other countries especially in Europe to counter
        football hooliganism.11

2.   Is the Home Secretary content?

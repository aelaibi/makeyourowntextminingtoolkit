Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH PROSECUTIONS

Further to our letter of 21 July 1998 we can confirm that we have had requests from Messrs Watts
Leather and Ms Keva Coombes, former and current legal advisors to the Hillsborough Family
Support Group respectively and also Messrs Walker Morris, advisors to Bernard Murray, relating to
documents, witness statements and access to witnesses.

Following your advice we have informed those parties that no further action will be taken until your
review is complete.

Yours faithfully




HAMMOND SUDDARDS

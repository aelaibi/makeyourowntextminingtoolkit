             On S a t u r d a y , 15 April,           1989    (130489)         I was   on duty giving          mutual        aid

              to the S o u t h Y o r k s h i r e      Police       at    the FA Cup S e mi-Final          being        played

              football       club,     Sheff i e l d .

              After    r e f r e s h m e n t s and a briefing             by   Inspector     Hand-Davies,           we were

              eventually         d e p l o y e d at   1130 hours.

              1 was    detailed         in company w ith            Inspector       Wilkinson,         Inspector

             Hand-Davies           an d other M o u n t e d officers             of the M e r s e y s i d e   Police.

             We were       d ep l o y e d   to escort        the    special      football      train,     w h i c h was      due

              to arrive       at    1400 hours.

              After a brief           f a m i l i a r i s a t i o n of the     football     ground     Inspector

             Hand-Davies           led our      prty towards            the    railway station.           Whilst

             awaiting       the     train,      C o n s t a b l e 5 0 4 3 Fry and      I made a patrol           of the

             H a I ifa x R o a d a re a ,

             A    large    number      of early a r r ivals             on Hali f a x Road were Liverpool

              supporters.           Man y   of these were a l r e a d y           drinking alcohol            from tin

              cans and were           carrying        unopened          cans of beer.        As C o n s t a b l e Fry and           I

              passed a G a t e w a y S u p e r m a r k e t     on Hali f a x      Road,     I could see        people

A public        house        on H a l i f a x Road         near        to the    s u p e r market was        closed

howe v e r     on the        for e c o u r t and         car    park were m a n y          people     drinking        from

tincans         of beer.

Approximately. 1355 hours                         that a f t e r n o o n the         special     football         train

air rived.           After       they alighted,            I assisted           to escort        the Liverpool

su p p o r t e r s    to the        football        ground via L e p p i n g s Lane.                Without        incident.

I was      then       i ns t r u c t e d    to    patrol       the L e p p i n g s    Lane     end of the         ground

by    Inspector           Hand-Davies,             as there         seemed to be more              suppo r t e r s

arriving        behind           the    suppo r t e r s    e s c o r t e d off the train.

Constable            5 0 4 3 an d      1 began e n c o u r a g i n g      people       to go     into the         ground

to prevent            c on g e s t i o n    of the       roadway and footpath.

I positioned myself                     a p p r o x i m a t e l y 30 yards       away from the           turnstiles

along L e p p i n g s Lane              in an atte m p t          to    funnel       s u pporters     towards        the

gr o u n d along           the    f o o t p a t h and keeping            them out of the             roadway.

L e p p i n g s Lane was            still        quite    busy of        local       buses and general             traffic.

M y a11 e nt i o n was            then      d rawn to t he t ur ns t i 1e s at Leppi ng s L a n e .

Constable            Fry and        I went        to assist         other M o u n t e d officers.                I could

see    that      there was a               large     number       of s u pporters          in the     compound

betw e e n the            turnstiles          and the      perimeter         gates.          Supporters          at the

rear were            pushing,          in order       to force          their way        closer     to the

turnstiles.

I moved        into        the    crowd       rear to the           perimeter         gates     in an attempt            to

relieve        pressure           at    the      front.        I was     c ontinually          calling     to     people

to stop        pushing           w h i c h was     obviously           ignored.        The     pressure      of the

crowd was            so    intense         that    on several           o c casions my horse was                 pushed

off    balance.

I then saw the               perimeter            gates    being        closed,       with a s s i s t a n c e    from

Constable            1300 Grunnill.                I then saw a foot                 officer     placed on the

gates,

I continued to ask                     suppo r t e r s    to stop        pushing,        but    pressure         was still
                                                                                                          PAGE.
  '                                                                        R471

  being exerted,           this   time     on the    perimeter        gates.       Many    s u pporters

 were     shouting        for   the gates to be opened.                Some were        being aggressive.

  I then n o t i c e d the        perimeter      gates were       opened,       and the      crowd        ran to

  the    back of the        supporters       inside      the    compound and i m m e d i a t e l y         forced

  more    pressure        on the turnstiles.

  E v e n t u a l l y a cor d o n was     formed beyond         the   perimeter        gates       by the

  Police     horses,       in a nose       to tail      formation,      across       the    entrances

  using    a controlled           entry    into the      compound,^       At    this    point       supporters

  were    forcing     their way         between and u n d e r n e a t h    the horses          i n an

  at tempt    to gain access            to the compound,.

  Eventually        the    pressure       eased,    and most      people       had e n t e r e d    the

  ground.        Before     the    kick    off   I noti c e d the      turnstiles          had been

  closed.        Together       w ith other M o u n t e d      officers    I began to disperse

  su pporters       from a r o u n d    the turn s t i l e s    and the    compound.

  I was    then     instructed         to take a pos i t ion on the             o ppos i te s i de of the

  ground     near    to the main          exit   gate    on P e n i s t o n e Road.        I remained

  there    until     the m a t c h was a b a n d o n e d and then         patrolled the Halifax

  R o a d area    in company wit h C o n s t a b l e 3 9 2 0 Evans,             until      being     stood

  down at a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1820 hours.

     Subject:-
                                   SATURDAY.             15th APRIL,              1989.




               On Saturday,               15th April,               1SS9,      I was on duty giving
     mutual'aid to the South Yorkshire Police at the F.A. Cup
     semi-final being played between Liverpool                                                F-C. and
     Nottingham Forest F.C.                          at Hillsborough football club.




               After refreshments and a briefing by Inspector Hana-
     Devies.              We were eventually deployed at                                    11.30 hours.


               I was detailed                  in company with Inspector Wilkinson.
      Inspector Hand-davies and other mounted officers a t                                                               the
      Merseyside Police.                      We were deployed to escort                                    the specie
      football            train, which was due to arrive at                                       1400 hours.


               After a brief familiarisation of the football ground
      Inspector Hand-Davies                        led our party towards the railway
      station.             Whilst awaiting the train, Constable 5043 Fry
      and I made a patrol                      of the Halifax Road area.


                A large number of early arrivals on Halifax Road
      Liverpool            supporters.               Many of these wer e already drinkj
      alcohol         from tins cans, and were carrying unopened
      beer.         As Constable Fry and I passed a gateway superm$||
      on Halifax Road,                   I could see people leaving the shop
      carrying tin cans of beer.


                A public house on Halifax Road near to the                                                                     -
       supermarket was closed however on the forecourt and car^
      park were many people drinking from.tin cans of beer.
        Approximately         1355 hours that afternoon the special
football         train arrived.     After they alighted,              I assisted
to escort         the Liverpool    supporters to .the football                ground
via Leppings Lane.            Without    incident.


        I was then      instructed to patrol         the Leppings Lane er.c
of the ground by Inspector Hand-Davies,                  as there seemed t-
be more supporters arriving behind the supporters escortec
off the train.


        Constable 5043 and I began encouraging people to go
into the ground         to prevent      congestion of the roadway and
footpath.


        I positioned myself approximately 30 yards away froir.
the turnstiles along Lfeppings Lane in an attempt                        to funne.
supporters         towards    the ground along the footpath,                 and
keeping them out of the roadway.                Leppings Lane was still
quite i i u s y of    local    buses,   and general    traffic.
                                                           <»

        My attention was then drawn to the turnstiles at
Leppings Lane.          Constable Fry and I went          to assist other
mounted officers.             I could see that there w a s a large
                                                                                   '   - .

number of supporters            in the compound between the
turnstiles and the perimeter gates.                  Supporters at the
rear were pushing,            in order to force there w a y closer
the turnstiles.


        I moved into the crowd rear to the perimeter
an attempt to relieve pressure at the front.                          I was
continually calling to people to stop p u s h i n g w h i c h w,
obviously ignored.            The pressure of the c r ow d was so
intense that on several occasions my horse was pushed
b a 1a n c e .


        I then saw the perimeter gates being closed,                      with
assistance from Constable               1300 Grunnill.     I then saw a v|||
foot officer placed on the gates.                                                  S
                                                                      F onn 104A

        I continued     to ask supporters to stop pushing,                but
pressure was still        being exerted,      this time on the
perimeter gates.         Many supporters were shouting for the
g a z e s to be opened.     Some were being aggressive.


        I then noticed     the perimeter gates were opened.                 <=na
the crowd ran to the back of the supporters                    inside the          ^
compound and        immediately forced more pressure on tne                        ^
turnstiles.


        Eventually a cordon was formed beyond the p e r i m e t e ^
 gates by the pol ice horses,         in a nose to tail          format i ? ^
 across the entrances using a controlled entry into the |f
 compound.     At this point     supporters                 *ww*..v
 tetwfeen,   and un d e rneath the horses in an attempt to gain
 access     to the compound.


         Eventually the pressure eased,           and most people had
  entered    the ground.     Before the kick-off            I noticed tne

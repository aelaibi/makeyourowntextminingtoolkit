Mr. Justice Taylor,
Government Enquiry into Hillsborough Disaster,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club,
Hillsborough,
Sheffield.


Dear Mr. Taylor,

     I was present at the disaster on Saturday 15th April
and was situated in the Leppings Lane end of the ground,
and as a S. P. tried to provide resuscitation to the
casualties. I would be willing to give evidence in the
enquiry which you are heading, if it would be of any
benefit.

                            Tours sincerely,



                            Colin K. Plenley




                                                                2

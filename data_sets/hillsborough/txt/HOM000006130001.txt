         Hillsborough Disaster - Compensation Payments

         Thank you for your letter of 26 January in which you asked
         whether this Department has any views on the funding of
         settlements above the statutory bereavement provision.
         As you know, the Lord Chancellor is conducting a review of the
         level of bereavement damages and he will be issuing a
         consultation paper shortly which will invite views on whether the
         present level should be raised and, if so, what new level would
         now be appropriate.
         I am aware that in some recent cases settlements have been made
         for sums above the present statutory level. However, I do not
         think it would be proper for me or anyone else in this Department
         to comment on whether a higher sum would be appropriate in any
         particular case, since settlements must always be a matter for
         the parties.
         I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful.

HILLSBOROUGH: INTERIM ADVICE TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES

As requested I attach a hastily assembled first draft of a
circular and, (even more hastily assembled) a draft submission
along the lines discussed.

I understand incidentally the Football Association has issued
some advice to clubs.  (I have still to confirm this).

Whatever we propose we should keep colleagues in Scotland
informed because they too will have to follow suit if we issue.
(It would also be as well to keep DOS informed).

some kind of interim guidance to cover the period until the
Taylor Inquiry reports. The attached draft circular is a first

     Ministers are already aware of the difficulties in issuing
any sort of guidance which is liable to trespass into the
territory of the Inquiry and might be seen to prejudge the
Inquiry's findings. Equally, because-fcho football season is~ii&w

     We have not thought it right to suggest restrictions on the
numbers permitted to occupy the football terraces^\Q Not only
would this prejudge the Inquiry but our published guidance
already quotes such figures; restrictions might be regarded as
'unreasonable' and subjected to legal challenge; and it is the
distribution as well as the number of spectators which is
integral to their safety.

        195(a)(c));

    SAFETY OF SPORT GROUNDS ACT 1975 - HILLSBOROUGH


    Introduction


    1.   As—you-lorow phe Home Secretary announced in the House of
    Commons on 17 April that he had set up an Inquiry under Lord
    Justice Taylor to look into the tragic events which occurred at
    Hillsborough on 15th April. ■fftr~copy~6f the Udme^Secretary's
    statement- setti-ng out— the terms &£ roforonca of the Inquiry are
    attached for pass n-f r a fa ranr^j-'


    The Inquiry


    2.    It is not known at this stage whether it will be possible
    for Lord Justice Taylor to produce                  report with
    recommendations which can be implemented in the short term before
    the next football season. If such a report is produced fefee Home
    Q#f-ice will-; of x:oure e / -circulate details of the recommendations.

    3.   Given the wide remit of the Inquiry it would be clearly
                                                     / /vor
    wrong to pre-determine its findings (whether or[_ produced in the
    form of interim measures) including any recommendations on the
    'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds'. Even so, local authorities
    will pao—deubt]7^fprobably)/ have already begun reviewing terms and
    conditions at designated ^fsports/ fcsoecea^ grounds in conjunction
    with the police, fire authority and ground operators.      he-’

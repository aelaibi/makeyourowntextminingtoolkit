Serial     Sergeant was PS            1080 Hoyland,        The    Inspector i^as in charge of

my serial        was    Inspector Booth.



The_br iefing          began at a p pr o xi m a t e l y 9. 45 am p d    was    conducted by C h i e f

Supt Duck.enfield and             concluded at about            10.35pm on conclusi/bn my

serial     was    informed that we should at te nd the S pion Kop where a second

informal      briefing        took    place.      This   briefing    took     place/at       11.00am and

was   conducted by Supt Greenwood,                    who/was    the officer     ip       charge    of

the section of the ground                   I was Vo be working.



At a p p r ox i ma t el y    11.1 Sam    ti^is day I was stood         in P en ni st on s Road

outside T ur nstile 58,



I had been        informed       that    the vast m a j o r i ot y of supporters            entering          the

turnstiles        in P en ni st on e R oad would be N o tt i ng h am Forest               s upporters          I

was aware        however      that    it was     likely that      some w ou ld be su pp or te rt s             of

Liverpool        and that       these    supporters      should be directed to a stffile

section of the           ’K o p ’ a dj ac en t   to the N orth Stand.



The   turnstiles were            opened to the         public at    11.30am ajyfd there wa'/ a

steady number           of s upporters        passing    throught my turnstile              frorrs/E.OOpm

onwards     most       of the    crowds      passing along P en ni st on e Road wen£               in good

humour     but    some      could be seen to be drinking alcohol                 from/tans.              No

supporter was a ll o we d            into    the ground w ith a can of any kind,- and many

cans were        c onfiscated from the            people   in Penni st on e Road.



It was also apparent              that      several    people had    come to the s.yadiurn

without a t i c k e t , and          I saw two or three          "ticket    t o u t s ’ selling

tickets     near to rny 1 o cat ion.             These   people were spoken yo by Police

The                        1rs my serial      in possession of a personal             radio was Sgt

Hoy land., and he’ was         standing       near to my      location.      At about 2. 3 0 p m

this    day I asked him          if there was any trouble anywhere,                 and he said

that    the    radio      reception was       poor.



At about Z .45 pm he p i nf o rined me that they were trying to delay the

k i c k --off due to t h e 1a r g e c rowds        in L e ppings L/rte^ still        trying   to get

It was shortly after             the game      had star teja that Sgt Hoyl an a said there

was    ’trouble'       inside,      and   that we w e r K t o    shut all   the     turnstiles and

go    inside and onto         the    pitch.



I ran    into      the stadium and          into/the   side     "Spion Hop / .      I ran through

the    5K o p ” and onto      the    pitch



On    looking across         towards      the Lapping Lane        t e r y a c e s I saw several

police officers           stood on the a dv er tising           boards against      the   perimeter

fencing.



I. also saw a few           people    sat    on the edge      of the     pitch near to the goal

mouth.        My   immediate     impressions was that            there   had been a pitch

invasion of some kind and that                  1 w ould   be    required    to clear     tj^e pitch

and    prevent any outbreaks              of disorder.



On    reaching      the    perimeter      fencing at L ep pings Lane         1 w=     hor ri fi ed   to

see    several      people s qu as he d up against         the    inside    of t/he fencing



I quicklv joined the officers                  stood on the boards and began shouting

      at, the       crowd to move         back.      I looked down at the/"peopie being                 crushed

      beneath me and saw that                  the   crush of bodies w/nt             back from the fencing

      to a depth of several                  feet.   A lt ho ug h    I wa^shouting        no-one    seemed to

      be        responding,



      N o - o n e m oved backwards a l t ho u gh I cou/d see gaps in the crowd at the

      back        of the      terracing      into w hich the        people    could move back       into



      I then jumped off                the boards and saw a small              crowd of Police O f f i c e r s

      standing around a g a t e , tjaat had been opened,                        behind the goa.

                                                                                                   them

                                                                                      in such a way that

      arms and           legs were     stuck     fast.    The    bodies were      like spaggetti,          and

      i nse p p e r a b l e .



      I pushed through the Police Officers and began to assist P c / W r i g h t in

      pulling           the   people   from the back through the gate many of the                       people

      who        climbed      through were       in a state of shock and              panic.



      I looked across at               the    perimeter    fencing and saw the            people   b ehind       it

      were        packed together         so tightly that there were              no spaces      bet ween them.



      I saw the faces             of many were       blue,      thy were      foaming    from the m ou th and

      some        were    bleeding      from the nose.



      It was only at this                stage    that   I realised that         people were a ct ua ll y

      dying.            I turned to a nearby          Inspector and said to him                ’Good God
there's    people dying       here.5



I then saw a p'ieta.1 pole being            thrown at    the -fencing I saw         LC hit    the

top of the fencing          to my    left and    it fell      back onto the       c/owd below.



I then saw a young          boy with his arms         raised above       his head.     He was

t rapped from the waist             down by the crowd below the fencing.



A Police Officer       had a        hold of his arms and was           t rying /aesperately to

pull    over   the fencing and to safety and             it was at

rushed forward and shouted at Pc Wright to climb
                               “ 1--------------------
and to pull the people a way from the fencing.



Pc Wright      did climb over        the bodies and      into the terrace.           A Police

officer with a beard took             his   place   in the     gap and    I   stood behind him.

I was urging      him to go         through and into the        terrace.



He was    reluctant    to    climb over      the bodies       of the    people    trapped    below

so    I shouted at him to get          "Lnrough and     pushed him       in I then followed

and    climbed   into the terraee.



On    coming   into   contact with the        crowd I saw many          people were    in a a

state    of shock,    they were       screaming and shouting at me saying               it was

my fault and some were          just wandering about            crying.



I began    pulling    the    people    from the      crush of bodies          near to the

fencing.       It was almost        impossible      to free    people,    they were    stuck

together,      with arms and        legs trapped      inbetween bodies.



There were m any bodies         strewn about         the terracing and many were

uncoricious.            It was almost          impossible to a vo id standing               on people.         It

soon     became obvious            that      several    people were     dead or dying.



I soon became exh au st ed                pulling      people from the fencing area and                 I

began      running back towards                the   crowd behind me       I shouted at them ti

come forward and help me                     pull the    people away from the           fencing       so that

they     could be free,of              the    pressures.



Several       fans did come            forward but some were           to upset,       or just    to drunk

to help anyone.



I remember          pulling one man free and together with two members                            of the

public      carried him out             of the stadium         I do not think      this man was             dead

so    I placed him            in the    recovery       position.



There were          so many      people      unconcious       that   I began   placing        people    in

the    recovery position,               I noticed that         some of the unconcious            had

vomit t e d and         I    was a f f ra id they w ould      choke to death.



I instructed the               people who were          coming forward to help me              that    they

s hould     place       everyone       in the    recovery      position until      medical       help

arrived.                                                                                /



I also       saw O f f icers        giving      heart massage and moutty to mouth

At one       point      I was     so e xh austed       that   I had to lean on one            of the

barriers and            I    realised at that          a tragedy had o c c u r e d .



I saw that the               fencing    had been       pulled awa y and several             officers were
                                                                                                          PAGE

            climbing      in.



            I saw ri)e m b e rs of the      p u b l i c were   runn/ng about with boards           pulled from

            the side      of the      pitch.     They were ferrying          people from the       pitch to

            the exit.



            I then heard the sound of shouting                  from   the    opposite sdde       of the

            ground and         I began walking      towards     the noises w ith/other          Officers.          I

            was   under       the   impression    that there     had been a n/ ou tb re ak      of fighting.

            However      it    tran sp ir ed that there was       no d is-eVder and I was          then

            instructed to stand on the              halfway     line ory     the   pit ch until after       the

            s t a d i urn had e m p tied.



            1 then returned to the N or th Stand where                  I    remained until      f innish j/nq

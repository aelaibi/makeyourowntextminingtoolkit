I    am   a Police              Constable                 in    the   South        Yorkshire           Police           with       12i

years          service           and       stationed             at    Doncaster,              now    serving           as    Community

Constable                at    Intake,           Doncaster.

On     Saturday               15 A p r i l       1989,          I commenced              d u t y at    Doncaster              Police

Station             at    8.30        am.        I was          detached           to w o r k on       Serial           25    along       with

other          Officers              and    th e      Serial          Sergeant           was    PS    2640        Perry.           We

awaited             transportation                    to       Hillsborough              Football           Ground.

On     arrival            at     Hillsborough                   Football          Ground        a briefing               took      place          in

th e      North          Stand,        after          which       a meal          wa s    taken       at     the        ground.

Approximately                    11.15          am,       I,    along       with      other offi cer s              on       Serial          25

and       PS    Perry,           made       our       way       along       Middlewood Road                 to     the

Hillsborough                   shopping              precinct          where        I commenced              patrol          in    company

with       PC       2800       Simms.            Our       main       area       of p a t r o l      was     around          the    shop

known          as    Woolworths                 on    Hiddlewood             Road.

During          th e      course           of    the       duty       and    prior        to    3-00        pm,    numerous             groups

of     both         Liverpool              and       Nottingham             Forest        supporters              were       seen       on

Hiddlewood                Road,        most          were       quiet       but     quite       a     few    were        noisy      and

shouting.

In     Middlewood                Road       there          is    an O f f        Licence.             I was       standing          in

company             with        PC    Simms          outside          this       shop.         About        1.00        pm   a large

number          of       Liverpool              supporters             started           going        into       th e    shop.          These

supporters                were        quiet          at    this       t i me ,    but     were        buying        4 and         6 packs

of     beer         and       also     large          bottles          of A s t i        Spumante           wine.

                                                                                                                               QOR 82


These       fans   were         immediately                 opening       these       bottles          and        commencing               to

drink       the    contents             and    then         make    their      way      along         Middlewood               Road        in

the    direction             of H i l l s b o r o u g h       Football         Ground.               These        persons           were

not    drunk       at       this     time,         bu t     were    talking          with        slurred          speech.

I    continued          patrol          on M i d d l e w o o d      Road      area,        patrolling                 inside         and

outside       shops          and     supermarkets                because        of    the        number          of    fans         trying

to    purchase          alcohol.

Approximately                3-10       Pm     1 could        hear       on    the    Police           personal              radio        an

Officer       requesting                permission            for    a gate          in L e p p i n g s          L an e      to be

opened.           Another          Officer           wa s    also    on       the    radio           stating,          'persons

being       crushed'           and      requesting            bolt       croppers.               A    sound       of u r g e n c y

was    in    the    voice          of     this       Officer.            These       radio           messages          were         broken

and    intermittent.                    I,     along        with    Officers          on S e r i a l         25       an d     PS

Perry,       then made             our       way     on     foot    towards          the       Hillsborough                  Football

Ground.

On    arrival       at       the     Leppings             Lane     entrance          to     the       ground          I was         told

by    a Senior          Officer           to    assist        in    keeping          the       crowd        back       from         the

gates/entrance.

I    could    see       a    large        group       of     people       standing             near        the     entrance           an d

with     other      Officers              these       were       moved        away     from          the    entrance.                At

this     time      I had         become         detached           from       Serial        25       and    PS     Perry.

Fans     were      now       starting           to    leave        the    ground          by     the       Leppings            Lane

entrance.           I then           went       inside        the    gates          along        with       other         Officers

and     formed      a line           allowing             a sterile           area     to      be     kept       along         the

fence       which       runs       parallel           to     the    River       Don.           Emergency              vehicles

were    now       arriving           and       injured        persons          were       being        treated            in    this

sterile       area.

As    fans    were          leaving          the     ground,        some       were       abusive           towards            all

Officers          and       shouting,           "YOU        BASTARDS          ARE    TO     BLAME".

Some     fans      who       were       leaving           were     becoming          violent           towards            Senior
                                                                                                                 PAGE      3
                                                                                                                 QOR 82


Officers       who       were       standing       nearby,           These        fans    were      escorted       out    of

the    ground     by      other       Officers          in    an   orderly         manner.

Some    fans     who      had       already       left       the   ground        were     trying         to   re-enter

th e   ground      which           caused    minor       problems            to e m e r g e n c y   vehicles       which

were    a r r i v in g    continually,

I   remained       on     duty       near    the    main       gates         until     the    crowds          outside    the

ground     had     dispersed.               I then       made      my    way      to   the    North       Stand    of    the

ground     for     debriefing              with    other       Officers,

I was    j o i n ed      by    the    rest    of S e r i a l       25    at     the    debriefing,              After

debr iefing        we     made       our    way    to    Claywheels             Lane     where      we    got

transport        back         to    Doncaster.

I   terminated           my    tour    of    duty       at    7.45      pm    that     date.

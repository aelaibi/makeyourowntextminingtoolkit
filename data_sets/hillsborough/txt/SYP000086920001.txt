             trying          to get     people      into queues           but    there were        too many        people.            1

            L ater in the gym I came to and was lying                             on      w / o d e n hoarding board

            and    there were          people    lying all      around,       some       injured and some a p p e a r e d

            dead.     The       next thing       I remember       is a ma n giving rne some water                    but     he

            told me       that    I should       not   swallow        it.    My     right      shoulder was aching

            and    I was     shocked.

                  In rny opinion the       problem at   the Grgrund was    caused by bad t i cket

              20      in the S outh S ta nd Open Terrace area.                     My job was to         check      tickets

              an d to direct            the   people   to the s e a t s .       O n this     particular       Saturday

              there were 3 other               stewards     working w i t h me a l t h o u g h        I only know         the

              other      regular        steward,                                     The other        two were

              t e mp or ar y stewards.

              I have      been a stew a r d at         the ground for a bout              the   last    16 years,         and

              for most         of that time        I have been on g an g w a y 20.              I a t t e n d the      pre

              people and various               things.      It is at this meeting we are                   i n f ormed       if
                                                                                                                         PAGE

          we hear       the    name       Hr M UR R A Y     is wan t e d at the reception that                    something

          is wrong-           1 have      no first       training and              have     received no training               from

          the    club.

          The    normal       hours      of work as a steward are                    from       1.30 pm    <1330)       to 3 pm

          <1700)       on normal         matches     and from       11 am to 5 pm on big                   crowd matches.

          I am     paid by the           club to     be a steward.

          On S a t ur da y     15th       April      1989    <150489),            1 was late     leaving        home and       left

          about     12 mid day           (1200),                                         m e t rne outside       the house

          an d we w a l k ed down                            then o nto                                   and    into    the

          H i l l s b o r o u g h Pk.     We    did not see many s u p p o r t e r s              in the    park until we

          got    onto P e nistone Rd N or th where we                        saw quite a number of s upporters

          about.        From the time we             came out of the                park and get          into

UfVtCs    the    ground       is no more         than    five minutes             and     in that    time we were asked,
 TO
TTQiC^T   b e t w e e n 5Q--6Q times           if we had any        ’s p a r e s ’ .       I took this          to m e a n spare
TOUT      tickets,       I am not         sure w hi ch      team the fans were                  supporting

          We    reached the ground about                  12.15 pm           (1215),       we signed the          book

          col l e c t e d our s t e w a r cis Jackets and went                    s t ra i g h t onto o u r p o s t s .

          On entry       into the g r o u nd and whe n I got                       onto my       post there was          not

          many    supporters            of either       team.

          F r o m about       12.45      pm    <1245)    the N o t t i n g h a m fans were           filling       up and       by

          2.30    pm    <1430)      I w ou l d e s t i m a t e    that       the N o t t i n g h a m Forest       ends were

          f ul l . T h i s was not        the    case wit h the L i verpool                 fans,    they were          later

          getting       into the West Stand.                 Pen 3 was             pretty full       by    1.30 - 1 . 4 5      pm

       SUBJECT:    INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION FOR THE FA CUP SEMI FINAL BETWEEN
          NOTTINGHAM FOREST AND LIVERPOOL TO BE PLAYED AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL
          GROUND SHEFFIELD ON SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989


         [<ith reference to the above FA Cup Semi Final,     I have     to report as
         follows:

         Intelligence enquiries have been made and reports received in respect
         of both Nottingham Forest and Liverpool supporters which I will deal
        with separately.

         CLUB COLOURS

         Both clubs co!ours are red and white and therefore clash on the above
         date.   Liverpool will on the day wear a!! red and Nottingham,. Forest

0        will wear all white.

         LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS

        The behaviour of the Liverpool fans this year has been quite good,
        although there have been a number of arrests which have been mainly for
        drink related offences.

        However in a recent visit to London to play against Queens Park Rangers
        quite a number of Stanley knives and other metal weapons were found
        discarded a short distance from the turnstiles when it was seen that
        Police Officers on search/reception parties were using hand operated
        equipment to search fans for weapons.

        In their game against Derby Count.v at Derby small metal discs were
        thrown at Police Officers insiae the ground and the.v had obviousl.v been
        carried into the ground in the fans pockets together with coins.


0       There was also an incident in a game against Manchester United, fire
        crackers were thrown and on exploding these gave off a loud bang
        followed by dense smoke. Also at the end of this game as the Liverpool
        fans were leaving the ground under Police escort about 40 fans broke
        away and tried to cause trouble.       This was only prevented by the
        presence of the ~;ounted Section who ’rounded’ them up.

        Last Tuesday II April !9~9, Liverpool visited Millwall and their
        conduct was very good.     However, after the game, and whilst being
        escorted back tc their transport, one of them released a flare onto the
        main road.  Luckily, although the roadway was crowded, no one was hurt.
        Prior to the game al! the Liverpool fans were thoroughly searched and
        officers at the scene believe that the person responsible secreted the
        flare outside the ground prior to entering the ground.

        There are seven (7) Exclusion Orders for Liverpool fans and details of
        these will be placed on the briefing board at the ground.

    It is a "~ell kzewn fact that at all the big games that Merseyslde Clubs are in,
    teams of rlck-rcckets and travelling thieves will be in attendance.       Recent
    photograrhs of these are attached to this report and copies will also be
    available to surerviscry officers in charge of each Serial.      The photographs
    will alsc be dls~iayed on the briefing board at the ground.


@   Albums an~ details of other pick-pockets will be available in the Poi=ce Room.

    There is one s~ecial train arriving at ~adsley Bridge Station at i$.02 hours
    and depar:ing s~ 17.05 hours or as soon as practicable afterwards.    Although
    there are a number of service trains the main contingent ~ill travel in
    coaches, mini buses, vans and other types of private vehicles.         (On one
    occasion, fans =ravelled here in an articulated trailer van) and it is
    anticipated as on previous occasions these will be carrying alcohol.      It is
    well known to visiting fans that they will not be allowed into local pubs near
    the ground so they therefore stock up from supermarkets and consume it whilst
    travelling to the game.    Details of known coaches will be available for the
    briefing.

    On the ! April 1989, when Liverpool played Norwich, a coach from I
    checked at Norwich after information had been received that the passengers had
    been causing trouble at a service area and that the coach was carrying alcohol.
    It was s:c~ped by Police but the driver had by this time confiscated the drink
    and dispesed of it.    This coach, registered number,I           ]was not on the
    list supplied by ~ierseyside Police and could well attend this Saturday.
@   NOTTINGHAM FOREST SUPPORTERS

    The conduct of the Nottingham supporters varies from game to game away from
    home.   Ehen they played Liverpool at Hillsborough last year t~ere were 2~ of
    their fans arrested. These were for offences of public order, obstruct Police,
    wounding and drink related offences.     The wounding was after the game in
    Hillsborcugh Park and I                                         I was arrested
    for this offence.    He is still on ball to        Court awaiting trial and a
    photograph of him is displayed on the briefing board, together ~ith the others
    arrested at las= years game.

    Last Sunday during the game at ~embley against Luton Town there         were   22
    Nottinghmt fans arrested for drink related/public order offences.

    However, the majority are well behaved but they do have their travelling
    hooligan elements who tend to seek out opposing fans prior t© the game and
    cause disorder or seek confrontation after matches if not firmly supervised.
    The hooligans are known to carry Stanley knives, JIF lemons containing bleach
    and pencil flares.    One such pencil flare was recovered at the Nottingham

    Photographs of these and the targets will be displayed on the briefing boards,
    together with three photographs showing these targets at last years game.


    The mode of travel by the Forest fans is by train, coach, mini buses, vans and
    private cars.   One one occasion this season mini buses were turned back when
    alcohol was f=und and the passengers were under the influence.

    There are four special trains into the Sheffield Midland Station arriving at
O   12.31, 12.46, 13.02 and 13.12 and departing at 19.05, 19.15, 19.23 and 19.33
    respectively. Each train has a passenger capacity of 500.   In addition there
    are numerous service trains.

    D Division are aware of all the trains arrival and departure times.

    FURTHER INFORP_~TION
    Personal visits or contact has been made with licensees and managers of
    licensed premises and off licences and they have been advised accordingly.
    Those   premises  visited~contacted   in  FI/F2  by myself and in Deepcar,
    Stocksbridge and Oughtibridge by Police Sergeant ~

    All accepted the advice given with the exception of the Royal Hotel, Penistone
    Road, Hillsbcr=ugh and the Cock Inn at Oughtibridge.   Both will open as normal
    and are not taking any precautions whatsoever, i.e. doormen.      They will be
    allowing anyone in and it could well be that there could be a confrontation of
    fans at the Rcyal with it being near to the ground. Patrolling officers in the
    vicinity of these premises will be well advised to monitor the situation.

    Three   spotters     from    the     Nottinghamshire     Constabulary,      Police      Sergeant      Adrian
    Brazener, F~ice Censtab!es Brian Walton and Nick                        Hoad.   will     be ~:rk~ng the
    match to ass=st in identifying trouble makers.

    There   is   nc   5nteiiigence       at   this   stage   to   suggest   that    there    are    any     forged
    tickets in circulation.    However, at the game against );iil~,all this week, a
    number of fcrged tickets from the Liverpool end of the ground were recovered.
    These had been coTied from original tickets on a Rank Zerox copying rachine.

    At the previeus cup match with LiverTool at Xillwall this year identical
    forgeries wer~ recovered.   The recent game was not an all ticket match and if
    the persons respcnsible can take the time tc forge tickets for such a game they
    could well attemTt tc do the same for the semi final. There    are   three  (5)
e   different  cclcurs   of tickets,   Spion Kcp,   South Stand and S=uth Stand
    (uncovered) fer Fcrest fans and three (5) for the North Stand, West Stand and
    Leppings Lane terraces for Liverpool fans. Copies of these tickets showing the
    proper colour for each respective section will be dis[iayed on the briefing
    boards.

    Attention of all officers working inside the ground is drawn to offences that
    are becoming far to prevalent i.e. theft of the cash takings from kiosks and
    snack bars.    One identical offence was committed during the semi final at
    Hillsborough last year.

    Displayed or, -he briefing boards for those who have not worked at "~:’isborough
    recently are photographs of weapons and gas canisters recovered frcm football
    fans.

    The new treni by supporters               carrying inflatable       mascots     has     been adopted by
    both sets of supporters.

    Banana’s, flamingos (2’ high) and miniature lilo’s with a palm tree by the
e   Liverpool su77Drters and a small oak tree (20" high from the emblem cf the club
    badge) plus a smattering of bananas by Nottingham Forest fans.

    Court dates for prisoners arrested at the game have been                                     obtained     from
    Inspector Liniley, Prosecutions Department, and are as follows:

    Dear Sir

               RE - VISITS BY MERSEYSIDE FOOTBALL CLUBS TO WEMBLEY STADIUM

    Further to my letter of 16th June 1989 dealing with visits to London football
    clubs by Liverpool Football Club supporters, i am now able to provide you with
    some information relating to visits by Merseyside football clubs to Wembley
    Stadium.

    Between May 1985 and 15th April 1989, Merseyside football clubs played at
    Wembley Stadium on i0 occasions as shown below:

    i .    18th May 1985 F.A. Cup Final             Everton -v- Manchester Utd

    2.     20th August 1985 F.A. Cup Final          Everton -v- Manchester Utd

    3.     lOth May 1986 F.A. Cup Final             Everton -v- Liverpool

    4.     16th August 1986 F.A. Charity Shield     Everton -v- Liverpool

    5.     5th April 1987 Littlewoods Cup           Liverpool -v- Arsenal

@   %.     1st August 1987 F.A. Charity Shield      Everton -v- Coventry City

    7.     16th April 1988 Football League Centenary Festival

    8.     14th May 1988 F.A. Cup Final             Liverpool -v- Wimbledon

    9.     20th August 1988 F.A. Charity Shield     Liverpool -v- Wimbledon

    i0.    30th April 1989 Simod Cup Final          Everton -v- Nottingham Forest

    On only two occasions were there incidents of concern.

           (a)      On lOth May 1986 the F.A. Cup Final - Everton -v- Liverpool.

                    A capacity crowd of 98,000 attended, there were 51 arrests, the
                    majority of which were for crime related offences.

                    inside the stadium, 6 Everton and i0 Liverpool supporters were
                    arrested.   Outside the stadium 7 Everton and 21 Liverpool
@                   supporters were arrested.

                    Over 1,000 fans were ejected, many without tickets or in
                    possession of forged tickets. Twenty five police officers were
                    injured.                                                               874
O          (b)     On 14th May 1988 the F.A. Cup Final - Liverpool -v- Wimbledon.

                   A capacity crowd of 98,000 attended; 92 fans were arrested, 85
                   from Liverpool and 7 from Wimbledon. Over 3.000 persons were
                   ejected from the stadium for possession of either forged
                   tickets or no ticket at all. The stadium authorities recovered
                   478 forged tickets.   Seven police officers were injured.


    I hope that the brief summaries of the above matches, in addition to that
    already furnished in respect of the I989 F.A. Cup Final held on the 20th May
    1989, will be of assistance.
    Please contact me if you think I can help further in this matter.

    Dear Sir

    I am writins in confirmation of recent telephone conversations with Detective
    Inspector King concerning your request for information about the behaviour
    of Liverpool Football Club supporters attending London.

    I am pleased to inform you that foi~owing consultation with the Hillsborough
    Enquiry Team, I am now in a position to forward to you relevant Football
    Match Summary returns for your information.

    The relevant returns,which are attached, are for the following matches:

         Saturday 28th November 1987 Tottenham Hotspur -v- Liverpool
         Tuesday   9th November I988 Arsenal           -v- Liverpool
         Sunday   29th January 1989 Millwall           -v- Liverpool
         Saturday 13th May      1989 Wimbledon         -v- Liverpool

    The Football Match Summaries consist of information, intelligence and assessments
    provided by police officers for internal use only. They have no evidential
O   ~alue. I would point out that Liverpool played London Clubs in the Metropolitan
    Police District on 17 occasions during the last two seasons. Other than
    the matches referred to in the attached summaries, little or no policing
    difficulties were reported when Liverpool visited London.

    As discussed with Detective Inspector King, reports concerning the F.A. Cup
    Finals on lOth May I986 between Everton and Liverpool and i4th May 1988 between
    Wimbledon and Liverpool are not immediately available. As soon as they become
    available I will so advise your office and forward copies.

          7.   POLICING PROBLEMS AND CROWD BEHAVIOUR

               (a) In transit:       The low ndmber of coaches attending this match underlines the
                                     residual support for Liverpool in London and the South East.
                                     Crowds started to build up outside the Stadium at 6pm and
                                     increased to beyond capacity by 7.30pm. Start of game delayed
                                     by 15 minutes to allow fans to enter.


               (b) Inside Ground: Capacity crowd with approximately 6.000 fans locked outside
                                  the stadium. The South Bank is at present being built on
                                  and a constant stream of locked out fans were ejected from
                                  the building site area who were trying to gain entry without
                                  payment. No serious disorder in the ground. Some 40 fans
                                  were ejected from the building site area during the match and
@                                 it was impractical to take all their names ar decide which
                                   club they followed.
               (c) lmmediate vicinityof Ground:
                                                  Constant attempts by locked out fans to scale
                                    ¯ the ground from all directions made it necessary to call
                                      on Central London Reserve Serials fo~ assistance.




               (d) Other Locations:     None as yet reported.

    Late arrival of fans "estimated 30 to 40 thousand arrived after 7pm.


O   Radio reception on Force radios intermittent.

    Intelligence from TO 20 Arsenal FC and Liverpool FC indicated a crowd
    of 45,000 to 50,000.                                  -"

    A crowd of 54,000 inside the ground and approximately 6000 locked out
    was beyond the police resources employed as per grade ’B’ matches.

    The presence in Gillespie Road of a considerable number of fans before
    the turnstiles opened prevented police removal vehicles operating and
    therefore parked cars added to the obstruction.

    Turnstiles at Gillespie Road ran out of change causing delay and further
    congestion in Gillespie Road.

    Fans ignored Police instruction to form queues not enough Police present
    to enforce instructions.

    Kick Off delayed by me until 8pm but many of the locked out fans attempted
    to climb or break into the stadium.

    The only police available to police outside the ground after kick off
    were Mounted Section and Dog Section until reinforcements arrived from
    West Ham FC match and Commissioner’s reserve.

    While Mounted Branch, Dog Section and local officers were splendid ’Aid
    serials’ generally seemed overwhelmed by the situation and were not as active
    as one would hope.

    Searching at turnstiles had to be abandoned because of crush.

    There were few problems inside the stadium during the match.

    Due to late kick off and extra time match finished at lO.20pm in nil nil draw,
    therefore fans only interested in getting home and the dispersal prsented
    no problems.

O   Future Plans

    Due to Arsenal’s successful season and Tottenham’s failures crowds are larger
    than expected at Highbury therefore policing levels are to be reviewed.

    For evening matches Commissioner’s regulations will have to be 3 hours before
    kick off instead of 2 hours to enable vehicles to be removed before crowds
    arrive.

    Turnstiles will be opened earlier and Arsenal are to supply a PA System into
    Gillespie Road to assist in directing fans to correct queues.

    More Barriers will be used in Gillespie Road to operate queues.

        All the Liverpool Coaches attended the meeting point at Tower Bridge as arranged. They
        were escorted to the ground without any incidents. Several hundred Liverpool Supporters
        from the London Area attended without tickets. An unknown male obviouslj ~rom Liverpool
        was selling forged tickets in the car park for £15. Several persons obtained entry to
        the ground with these tickets but several were noticed at the turnstiles and the holders
        refused entry. The seller was not located. Apart from the supporters who attended by
        Coach, the rest arrived via service trains and by their own means. In the main, they
        were well behaved. Because of the position of the Turnstiles i.e. only at each end of the
        ground, the main problems were getting all the Millwall supporters into the ground before
        the start. ~:any arrived late the worse for drink. The game took place with only minor
        incidents. Considering Millwall were well beaten, not too much was thrown onto the pitch.
        Some damage was caused inside the ground when Millwall supporters forced their way out
        into the car park. Lack of lighting in the Car Park was again the main problem together
        with all the debris lying about. The Liverpool Supporters who had attended by train
        were escorted to the railway station and seen off to London without any problems. To look
        back on the day, a total of 32 persons were injured. The Dog Section suffered the most,
        with Seven Officers injured One with serious back injuries. Following many games without
        any disorder, this one game showed that the Hooligan element is still present waiting to
        strike. The main targers being visiting supporters, their coaches and Police Officers.
        The Chief Superintendent from Liverpool attended the fixture                 as an observer together
        with Inspector CLCW the F.L.~. And a Sergeant. We were unable to offer them any decent
        hospitality but they seemed to understand. I think they also appreciated the problems in
        Policeing First Division fixtures with a Third Division ground surrounded by waste lando

            Information received fronl           ]TO 20 was correct. Most of Liverpools
            support came from the London area " 4,500 plus whatever was in the home end.




    7       POLICING PROBLEMS AND CROWD BEHAVIOUR

            (a) In transit:Most of the Liverpool supporters came early and queued in an orderly
               fashion until the turnstiles opened at 1315hrs. Not much drumkness was in
               evidence. The local public houses were quite empty.




            (b) Inside Ground: Both sets of Fans were very well behaved. One arrest for criminal 0~7,
               of the toilet window by the C.C.T.V. but on the rerun of the video after the
               match it was not clear that the arrested person ( though clearly involved in the
               damage with another person ) committed the offence. He was released without
               charge. Two other arrests in the home end one for threatening behaviour and
               one for drunk and disorderly a Chelsea supporter.

            (c) Immediate vicinity of Ground:   Very quiet no" problems.




             (d) Other Locations: Very quiet no problems.

            of the toilet window by the C.C.T.V. but on the reran of the video after the
            match it was not clear that the arrested person ( though clearly involved in the
            damage with another person ) committed the offence. He was released without
             charge. Two other arrests in the home end one for threatening behaviour and

    8   C       ~IMENTS ON POLICING TACTICS

@       i       Escorts, Turnstile Searches, Control of Licensing Laws, etc:


        Turnstile serial were using metal detectors               on all supporters for the match. Nothing
        untoward was found. Although this game was billed as all ticket, due to the very low
        before match sales it was agreed by-polioe~and the club to open four turnstiles at
        each end of the ground _for ticket sales only. The match went very quiet without any
        serious problems. During the game there were three arrests and two ejections. - See
        appendex "A" for details. The game ended’without incident and’both sets of~fanS went
        to there re~ective homes without incident.

        The Commissioner of Police, Sir Peter Imbert was present at the ground for this game.
                                                                               q~     ¯         .....
             This game was made all-ticket at the request Of Wimbledon P~liog..::L~verpoql
             F.C. was allocated 6,500 tickets which were sent with a request for supporters
             to be advised by means of local radio and press that the fixture was an all-
             ticket one. Some 4,000 unsold tickets were returned to Wimbledon F.C; despite
             this, policing arrangements were based on intelligence reports that 4,500
             or more Liverpool supporters could be expected. On the day nearly 6,500
             Liverpool supporters attended the.game, ¯excluding ~ number who entered the
             home supporters parts of the stadium. It was clear that a large number of
             Liverpool supporters attended without tickets) despite publicity that the     ..
             game was an all-ticket one and adequate tickets wer~ available for salein
             Liverpool.                                                   ~

O                I was the cfficer in charge of the policing of the Norwich City
            Football Club versus Liverpool Football Club football match at Carrow
            Road, Norwich on Saturday, ~st April, 1989.

                 It is usual procedure to categorise football ,arches as of high,
            medium or low priority in our pre-season plalming. This match had been
            categorised as high priority even before the result became of greater
            s~gnificance in the Division One Championship Competition. ~he Carrow
            Road ground capacity is 26,812 and for this reason it was also decided
            that the match would have to be all ticket, a fact which would be well
            publicised in advance.
                 Carrow Road offers limited options for the accommodation of
            visiting suppurters ~nd the total available space, taking into account
            the need for segregation and accommodating home club members, is 5,000.
                There is terracing behind both goals at the football ground. ~he
           River Ehd terracing is part of a 51% membership scheme and, therefore,
O          always occupied by home fans. The Barclay Stand terracing is d~vided
           into 4 ~nclosures to limit lateral and forward movement and segregate
           opposing factions. The pens are numbered i to 4, pens 1 and 2 are
           always occupied by home fans, pen 3 at medium and low priority matches
           remains empty and pen 4 is for visiting supporters. In addition there
           is another area of terracing, the Triangle, which facas obliquely across
           the pitch and is adjacent to pen 4 and seating in blocks F, G and H
           normally taken up by visiting supporters. Pens 3, 4, the Triangle and
           blocks F, G and H were allocated to Liverpool supporters for this match.
           4,800 tickets were sent to Liverpool for sale in advance.

                 Access to the visitors enclosures is through turnstiles at the
            rear of the Barclay Stand which are completely independent of t~e
            access points available for home supporters. The rear of the Barclay
            Stand borders the main A.47 Norwich to Great Yarmouth trunk road.
                                                                                 Cont’d ..... [

          It was obvious, owing :0 Liverpool’s [ecent success that there
    wo£~id be a large, if not capacity, crowd for this match. Local interest
    ~:as also very high and policing arrangements ~ncluded the highest level
    of policing for any match during the season, l~%is level was 313 officers
    including Special Constables.
          On Thursday, 30th March, 1989, I saw the Norwich City Football
    Club Chairman, Mr. Robert CHASE, at the football ground. He told me
     ~hac c~cke~e~emfor the match were not selling as well as expected in
    Liverpool. He had been told that 1,272 tickets would be returned and
    would be brought to Norwich on the club coach on Saturday. Mr. CHASB
    suggested that pen 3 now be allocated to home fans as pen &, the Triangle
    and the seating could accommodate the reduced away support. I told him
    it would be imprudent to take that decision in the light of experience
    which showed that Liverpool always attracted considerable natiotml
0   support. The probability being t}mtmanypeople would attend who elther
    could not obtain tickets because they were only on sale at Liverpool or
    unaware that the match was ~n fact designated as all ticket. I
    suggested that the decision be delayed until themo,~Ing of the match
    and I would then consider the situation with regard topen 3, although
    because of access and egress to t|us enclosure for home fans it was
    most likely that the space would still be allocated to Liverpool
    supporters.
         On Saturday, Ist April, 1989, there was a significant crowd
    assembling outside the Carrow Road Pootball Ground by midday. Almost
    all were Liverpool supporters and the majority had tickets. By 1300
    hours there was a considerable crowd gathered, e number of whom did not
    have tickets. Many said they were not aware it was an all ticket match
    and others that they could not obtain tickets becauaa they came from
    ~reas distant from Liverpool. I decided, therefore, to open 2
    turnstiles and sell the returned tickets, after agreement with the Club
    ~mirman, to Liverpool supporters for access to pen 3. All the
    tickets were sold in this fashion and there is no doubt that some home
    supporters benefitted in this way. They were, however, met by officers
    juat inside the ground who directed them to accommodation reserved for
    home supporters. The vislting fans were quite well behaved and formed
    orderly and quiet queues outside the ground, lhey did not arrive isto
    and all supporters were in the ground by 1500 hours.

         The visiting fans were quite boisterous, generally good humoured
    and totally partisan in their support for their team to the exclusim]
    of all else. I attach a copy of the match su,umry which was forwarded
    to the Merseyside Police on the 3rd April, 1989, and indicates the
    problems that we had faced. A video tape of this match is available
    if required. I attach a copy of the Carrow Road ground plan.

         May I request that the report and enclosures be forwarded to the
    Assistant ~lief Constable J. Marvyn Jones, ~iil~borough Enquiry Team.

    F.A. CUP S~I-FINAL POOTBALL MATCH

    EVERTON v NORWICH

    VILLA PARK STADIUM, BIRMINGHAM

    SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989-



    I am currently the officer in charge of the Complaints and Discipline

    Department of the West Midlands Police, stationed at Force Headquarters in

    Birmingham. ~ However, for the period from 31 March 1986 to 21 May 1989, I

@   was the Divisional Commander of ’D’ Division of the West Midlands Police,

    an area which encompasses the Villa Park Football Stadium, the home of

    Aston Villa Football Club, and one of my responsibilities was to make the

    necessary policing arrangements in connection with the Foot~all Stadium.



    The Stadium is equipped with a dedicated Police Control Box, and

    facilities include comprehensive closed circuit television equipment to

    enable monitoring both inside and the immediate outside of the ground.

    A recent addition is a visual display unit from the Club’s computerised

    electronic turnstile counting facility from which it is possible to

     monitor the total number of persons entering the Stadium, and the numbers

     in any particular section of the ground.



    7illa Park was chosen as the venue for the semi-final of the F.A. Cup

    between Everton and Norwich on Saturday 15 April 1989.           Such games have beer

    a regular feature at Villa Park for many years, and I personally had been

    responsible for the policing of two previous semi-final games and in

    addition a number of comparable matches.     I am therefore used to dealing

0   with football supporters, and was well aware of potential difficulties, and

    planned accordingly.     A detailed police operation involving some 680 police

    officers and also Traffic Wardens, Special Constables and civilian staff

    was prepared, to deal with all facets of the event.



    The Stadium capacity currently stands at 46,500.           A capacity crowd was

    expected and it was declared an all-ticket game.           All tickets were sold

    well before the event.     In accordance with a well established plan it was

    possible to segregate the two sets of supporters in the manner shown on the

0   plan of the ground marked "R.J.M. I"      The effect of this was that the

    Everton supporters arriving from the North West were situated in the North

    part of the ground and used the Witton Lane turnstiles and Norwich

    supporters arriving from the East took the South part of the ground, using

    the Trinity Road turnstiles.    This arrangement, combined with the use of

    separate railway stations, coach and car parks and motorway exits, enabled

    complete segregation of opposing supporters on the approach to and

    departure from the Stadium.    These arrangements are illustrated in the

     ~ians marked "R.J.M. 2" iEvertoni "R.J.M. 3" ~Norwich).     The final official

     attendance figure was 46,553, comprising 24,515 Everton supporters and

     22,038 Norwich supporters.



     On the day of the game, supporters from both Everton and Norwich began

    arriving in the vicinity of Villa Park from approximately 11am.      From 12

    noon onwards, I took up position in the Police Control Box within the

    Stadium.   The turnstiles were opened at 12.30pm and from that time onwards

    there was a reasonably steady flow of spectators into the Stadium.
0   Generally speaking the Norwich supporters were well behaved and in good

    humour, arrived in the locality early and queued in an orderly fashion.         By

    2.35pm, the vast majority of Norwich supporters were in the Stadium and

    settled.   However, it was most noticeable at that time that there was a

    comparative lack of Everton supporters in the Stadium.     Such was the

    disparity that I instructed Police Constable I                  ], one of the

    staff in the Police Control Box, to check with the Police Motorway Control

    Centre, Perry Barr, as to whether there was a problem causing any delay on

    the motorway system.   The reply was that although traffic was heavy, there

0   was no specific reason, such as road works or an accident.     At that time -

    2.35pm - all the coaches which were expected from Liverpool had arrived,

    all special trains had unloaded, and a large number of cars were in the

    appointed car parking area.    My conclusion was that a substantial number of

    Everton supporters were in the vicinity of the stadium, but were not in or

    near the stadium.   I was informed that many of the local public houses were

    crowded, but I had no detailed information as to who was in them, other

    than that many were making their way to the football match.

     The game kicked off at the scheduled time of 3pm.     At that moment, the

     turnstile monitor in the Police Control Box was registering a total of

     42,523 spectators in the Stadium.   I instructed Police ConstableI

     to make a written record of this figure, which he did.     At that time, the

    Norwich sections of the Stadium were full to capacity, whereas the Everton

    sections were not.   The closed circuit TV cameras showed substantial crowds

    in Witton Lane, particularly in the vicinity of the ’L’ block turnstiles,

    of Everton supporters.   They were not queuing in an orderly fashion, and I
0   instructed that the mounted and foot officers in that vicinity should be

    augmented by mounted and foot officers from Trinity Road (the Norwich

    turnstiles) where there was no queuing or crowds.      The crowd in Witton Lane

    was boisterous and noisy, unco-operative and there was evidence of many of

    them being under the influence of drink.   Although there were no major

    problems, it was necessary to arrest 25 Everton supporters before they

    arrived in the Stadium for drink related offences.



    At this stage of the proceedings a series of problems emerged.      There were a

0   number of incidents of Everton supporters jumping the turnstiles, in order

    to gain entrance, presumably because they had no tickets.      Furthermore, a

    number of Everton supporters gained entrance in this manner by way of the

    Trinity Road turnstiles, into the Norwich section of the crowd.      Also, it

    was brought to police attention that a number of Everton supporters were

    making threats to turnstile attendants in order to gain entrance without

    tickets and some were offering cash as alternative to tickets.      There was

    also an incident requiring police attention in the Stadium ticket office in

    Trinity Road when two persons in possession of tickets for the Liverpool ~

     v ~ottingham Forest semi-final at Hillsborough caused trouble when their

    request for the tickets to be exchanged were refused.     There was one arrest

    of an Everton supporter for the robbery of tickets from a Norwich

    supporter.   There was no evidence of forged tickets in circulation, which

    had been a feature of previous similar games, and this was attributed to a

    new process of computerised printing of tickets on heat sensitive paper,

    which makes forgery much more difficult.



0   At 3.15pm all supporters were in the Stadium.     It was at this point that

    the official final attendance figure of 46, 553 was registered on the

    turnstile monitor.   This meant that 4030 persons - all of them Everton

    supporters - entered the Stadium after the game had kicked-off.



    Throughout the game, the Everton supporters behaviour was poor and they

    required constant police attention.   By comparison the Norwich section of

    the crowd was reasonably well behaved.     It was necessary to eject 16

    persons from the game for breaches of ground rules, comprising 12 Everton

0   and 4 Norwich supporters.   After the game was over, there were sporadic

    outbursts of disorder, all as the Everton supporters made their way back to

    their coach and car parks, and the railway station, necessitating 25

    arrests for public order and drink related offences.    There were no such

    arrests of Norwich supporters.   The total number of arrests in connection

    with the football match was 109, broken down, as follows:-

          SU£JECT:        F.A. Cup Final - 20 MAY, 1989.


            ,
                         Iama Chief Inspector in the MetropolitanPolice, attached
                         to Wembley Division. My duties include the Policing of
                         events at WembleyStadium and I have ~cn doing this in
                         my present rank since January, 1987.


            ,
                         The Hillsborough tragedy, after the initial stock, gave me
                         hope for the future.    This hope was that the behaviour of
                         fans in Leppings Ln, which I recognise as a not unknown
                         tactic at Wembley, would now cease - the danger being
                         acknowledged by those who indulge in such acts.


            o            On the 20thMay I was in charge of the concourse at Wembley
                         Stadium frcm the Royal Tunnel round Westwards to Turnstile
                         ’K’.    This area has two groups of turnstiles, ’F’ and ’G’,
                          which are approached by flights of steps and are relatively
                          safe from crushing.    It also has three groups of
                          turnsitles, ’H’, ’J’ and ’K’ approached by level ground and
                          which are liable to crushing problems.    The Stadium offices

                                                                                          923
                                                                          2


          are close to ’H’, ’J’ and ’K’ and likewise on level ground.



     .
         I saw the first Liverpool supporters on myway into W~ley
         at Stonemore Broadway, scme six miles from the Stadium, where
         a number were sitting in thepavementdrinking cans of bcc~r
         or lager, at about 9.30am. (0930).


So       The closer to Wembley, them.re fans I saw whoweredrinking
         in the street, often carrying more cans with them.



 .
         I arrived at Wembley Stadium at about 10.30 a.m. (1030) and
         saw that a large number of fans were already on the ccn~lex,
         perhaps as many as i0,000.   ’Again, many of than had cans of
         drink, i.e. bcc~r or lager with them.   I was dismayed to find
         that many of those present did not have tickets for the
         game.   My advice to them to leave the area went for them.st
         part,inh~--cd~ed.


 .
         On inspecting the area I found that at Turnstile ’H’ a small
         section of fencing, secured by scaffold clips, had been
         slackened so that a significant breach of the fence could be
         made, giving access to the circulating corridor.     Frcm the
         enquiries I made it appeared that this had been done by fans
         during the night, no doubt intending to apply pressure at
         the right moment to gain entry to the Stadium.



 .
         Information was passed to officers under my command by an
         unidentified Liverpool Rolice Officer, that he had heard
         fans planning to rush the ’H’, ’J’ and ’K’ turnstiles.    This
         confirmed byown view that these were them.st vulnerable


                                                                              924

      areas and therefore the most likely tobe attacked.
                                                                I     R95




 .
      As time progressed, I noticed that there were more poeple in
      that area suffering the ill effects of alcohol and tension
      was beginning to increase.       This culminated in a number of
      fights at the ’pinch point’, the D~r~st point of the
      concourse, outside the Stadium Offices.          The fights were
      caused apparently by the sale of tickets by ’touts’.
      Although well known touts were not evident, there seemed to
      be a number of people selling one or two tickets.             The fans
      were keen to attack such people and yet also to buy the
      tickets at inflated prices.


i0.   By 12.30~m (1230), the crowd was building up generally, but
      especially so outside turnstiles ’H’, ’J’ and ’K’.             Because
      this area is confined, I had to put in a cordon of
      police horses and foot police bet~.~cn the T.V. cc~ound
      and turnstile ’H’ to prevent the danger of crushing.


ii.   Outside of the cordon, There were more outbreaks of disorder
      among fans who had ~-cn drinking and I personally received a
      blow to the head whilst assisting one of my officers in
      making an arrest.


12.   The turnstiles were late in opening because a lorry was
      still carrying out some work in the circulating corridor.
      This lorry could only make an exit through a gate at the
      side of turnstile ’K’. It did this just before 1.15~, (1315)
      but caused quite severe problems with crc~ds waiting for the
      turnstiles to oepn. The gate stuck when it was only half


                                                                                   925
                                                                          4

          open and a lot of effort was required to prevent a large

O         n~nber of illegal entries to the Stadium.


    13.   Once the turnstiles opened, I expected the crowd to ease
          considerably and to reduce the ccnplaints of crushing I was
          getting from people in the ci-owd.   That people were
          obviously pressing forward and causing a crush in these
          circumstances, in the wake of Hillsborough, amazed me. I was
          more amazed, however, to find that the crush was not
          diminishing as I expected it to at turnstile ’H’.    This was
          because of ticketless fans forcing their way through the
O         turnstiles with ticket-holders and having to be r~noved
          through exit gates, slowing down the whole of the operation.


    14.   Whilst a lot of illegal entrants were removed, I believe an
          appreciable n~nber were not.   The most intense crush was at
          turnstile ’H’, which had had a fence weakened during the
          night, and in my mind must have beckon pre-planned by a large
          number of fans hoping to breach the securty of fence, if
          they were uanble to get in through the turnstiles.
O
    15.   By 2.30~m (1430), the number of people going in through
          turnstiles ’H’, ’J’ and ’K’ had reduced greatly. This has
          been achieved by having tickets for turnstile ’H’ accepted
          at ’J’ and ’K’ turnstiles and filtering people at the cordon
          and allowing only those with tickets through.    Many people
          were reluctant to produce tickets, fearing that they might
          be snatched from them.   They took the trouble to secrete
          them in shoes, socks and other places, which made it
          difficult when production was demanded.     The number of

          street robberies for this event are much higher than for

O         similar events.



    16    There were now some 300 people on the outside of the cordon
          who did not have tickets but were still anxious to find a
          way into the Stadium.    Rather than leaving the cordon as a
          fixed target, I decided to co~ence a s~cp of the
          concourse, pushing these fans towards the Royal Tunnel and
          away frcm the vulnerable area.


    17.   When the s~cp frcm the outside, turnstiles ’A’ to ’E’,
O         reached the Royal Tunnel, the crowd which numbered about
          500 began throwing bottles and cans at police.   A number
          of arrests were made during the completion of the
          sweep.


    18.   Despite the swccp, small pockets of ticketless fans returned
          to the concourse during the progress of the game.      At about
          half time, there was a determined attempt by about 200 to
          gain entry throguh gates and windows at the Stadium Offices
          and turnstile ’H’.   This was successfully repelled.


    19.   Just before the end of the ga~e, all gates to the Stadium
          were opened in preparation for the exodus.    At this stage,
          Liverpool were in the lead and fans were starting to leave.
          However, the equalising goal was then scored by Everton.
          This resulted in an influx of fans who had ~ leaving and
          also those still around the ground without tickets.      All
          managed to get into bays around the Stadium to wach extra
          time.

         20.    The number of arrests, 76 on the outside of the Stadium,
                does not fully reflect the magnitude of misbehaviour by
                drunken fans.   Rather a balance is struck in deciding
                whether arrest can be made without seriously reducing the
                number of police left to control the crowd.


         21.    On this occasion, there was a rapport between the Liverpool
                and Everton supporters. Had this not ~n the case, I
                believe much greater disorder would have emanated frcm the
                section of fans determined to gain entrance to the Stadium,
@               regardless of the cost of any terms, to others.


         22.    Having described a lot of bad behaviour on the part of scme
                fans, I should say that the majority were well behaved and
                concerned for the safety of themselves and others.

I       i.   PLANNING

             i.i   In 1987 a meeting took place between the then Divisional
I                  Commander, Chief Superintendent LEY, Superintendent
                   NICHOLAS and senior officer’s of the South Yorkshire
                   Police regarding the reception and disposal of football
                   supporters arriving and departing from Sheffield Midland and
                   Wadsley Bridge Station, particularly with regard to the regular
                   football semi finals being held in Sheffield. . The existing
                   arrangements were discussed, refined and agreed without
I                  major changes.
             1.2   The procedure at Wadsley Bridge Station is that supporters
                   arriving by special train are passed from the British
                   Transport Police to the South Yorkshire Police and walked along
                   Penistone Road to Hillsbrough, a distance of about half a
                   mile.
I            1.3   Supporters arriving at Sheffield Midland Station are placed on
                   South Yorkshire Transport buses and taken to Hillsbrough by
I                  road.

             1.4   The procedure for returning fans is as at paras. 1.2 and 1.3 but
                   in reverse.
I            1.5   On the build up to 15th April, 1989, the District Inspector at
                   Sheffield, Inspector MABBOTT, liaised with his counterparts at
                   Liverpool and Nottingham, British Rail and officers of the South
                   Yorkshire Police in addition to discussions with his own local
                   senior officers.
I            1.6   A short order was issued and circulated (copy attached)
                   (Appendix A).
I            1.7   In the planning stages the only problem which was envisaged
                   was that of conveying a large number of supporters by rail.

               of fans who had no affiliation but only came to watch the
               match.
        2.3    Four special trains from Nottingham conveyed 1241 supporters
               into Sheffield Midland Station.
        2.4    One special train from Liverpool conveyed 430 supporters to
               Wadsley Bridge Station.

               supporters to Sheffield Midland Station.
        2.6    All other supporters arrived at Sheffield Midland Station by

        2.7    On arrival at Sheffield Midland Station, all supporters were

               directly to the ground.
        2.8    Liverpool Supporters left the Station via the South Luggage
               Entrance where they also boarded buses and were conveyed to the
               ground.
        2.9    The 430 Liverpool Supporters arriving at Wadsley Bridge by
               Special train were walked from the Station to the ground. This
               journey takes about 15 minutes.
        2.10   The Special Train arrived at 13.55hours, about 5 minutes early
               and after the fans had detrained they were handed to an escort
               of South Yorkshire Police who immediately escorted them to the
               Hillsbrough football ground.
        2.11   For all train arrival times see Appendix B
        2.12   No problems were encountered with the fans travelling on
               the inward journeys and on the whole they were happy, good
               natured and looking forward to an exciting days football.
               Very few arriving supporters showed signs of intoxication.

     2.13   A Yorkshire Television programme about the "disaster’
             suggested that one of the factors contributing to the
            excessive build up of fans outside the ground was the fact
            that fans arriving by Special trains at Wadsley Bridge
            Station had been held there for an excessive length of
            time before being walked to Hillsbrough. This is a
            complete fabrication. Estimates from B.T.P. Officers at
            Wadsley Bridge indicates that from detraining to moving
            the fans off under escort by South Yorkshire Police took a
            maximum of i0 minutes, see reports from Sergeant
            (Appendix E) and enclosed statements from Officers at
            Wadsley Bridge.
    INVOLVEMENT AT MATCH
    3.1     Following arrival of the train at Wadsley Bridge and
            consequent of messing facilities having been arranged for
            the B.T.P. Police Officers in the Gymnasium at the Football
            Ground the following Officers made their way there in full
            uniform.

    3.2     After they had dined Sergeant~and P.C. ~left
            the ground to return to Wadsley Bridge. The other
O           Officers were standing in the tunnel entrance to the
            Gymnasium when the emergency occurred. They were asked by
            a South Yorkshire Superintendent to assist with crowd
            control. At the time Sergeantl__ land P.C. ~heard of
            the problems at Hillsbrough and they returned tc the
            ground to assist. At the request of Senior Officers of
            the South Yorkshire Police British Transport Police were
            involved in crowd control, public order situations, the
            administration of first aid and the removal of bodies to
            the temporary mortuary in the gymnasium.
    3.3     P.C. MASON was asked to assist in the removal of a body to
            the mortuary and on arrival there he was directed to
            remain with it until it was identified. This
            occurred at 04.30 hours Sunday, 16th when PC MASON stood
            down, travelled back to Leeds. He signed off duty at
            0630hrs after working for 20 hours.

         BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE REACTION TO EMERGENCY
.l 4.
         4.1    As soon as it became apparent that an emergency had
                occurred and the game was about to be abandoned, Acting
 I              Chief Inspector CRAGGS who was in overall command of the
                B.T. Police operation immediately took charge and
                co-ordinated the urgently needed reorganisation of the

 I       4.2
                return arrangements for the travelling supporters.

                Arrangements were made for the Special train to return to
                Wadsley Bridge Station, which it did, arriving at 16.00
ii              hours.  This train departed at 17.15 hours, i0 minutes
                later than scheduled, with 450 passengers.

         4.3    The Nottingham Specials were brought to Sheffield Midland
                Station and the first one placed at Platform 1 prior to
                fans arriving.  This train and the following trains
!               departed as follows when laden:-

                i)   17.25   hours ................... 500   passengers.
                2)   18.05   hours ................... 600   passengers.
i               3)
                4)
                     18.34
                     19.04
                             hours ................... 550
                             hours ................... 150
                                                             passengers.
                                                             passengers.

I        4.4.   All Service trains to Nottingham and Liverpool were
                monitored and policed where necessary up to 20.30 hours.


I        4.5    In all, a total of 18 trains conveyed an estimated 3,600
                Football Supporters to their various destinations.

                In all i0 trains were policed by 41 Officers.
I               For all train departures see appendix C

         CONCLUSIONS

         5.1    The conveying of Supporters to and from Sheffield by
I        5.2
                British Rail was carried out swiftly and without problem.
                There was no build up caused by fans arriving at the
                Ground after travelling to Sheffield by train.
I        5.3    British Rail reacted with speed and efficiency when faced
                with the emergency.
!        5.4    The attitude of Supporters returning from Hillsbrough was
                that of shock and, in many cases, disbelief. A number of
I               them were blaming the Police for the disaster and because
                of this showered abuse on any Officer they saw.

I
 I   5.5.   Only one B.T. Police Officer highlights any aspects of the
            operation that could be construed as a ’criticism’ and
            these are contained in the last paragraph at page 2 of
.l          SergeantsI
     Details are :-
                             ]report. (Appendix E).


1           5.5.1 Communications - he adversely comments on radio
            communication between Wadsley Bridge and Sheffield Midland
            Station.
l           Comment - This is not disputed and the problem which has
            been reported on previously is highly prevelant in the

It          North East of England. However, communications were not
            such that they in any way hampered the transmission of
            messages through to Wadsley Bridge as is evident by the
            fact that it was possible to redeploy additional Officers
!           from Sheffield Midland Station to Wadsley Bridge to assist
            in the returning operation as a direct radio request from
            a Sergeant at that location.
I           5.5.2 Sergeant~      Icomments that whilst his Officers
            were to all intents and purposes ’missing’ for some 2 hours
!           at the ground no Senior Officers of this Force visited the
            scene to find them.
            Comment - It was known and pre planned that Officers
!           arriving at Wadsley Bridge Station would be authorised to
            attend at Hillsbrough to take refreshments under South
            Yorkshire Police arrangements and they were not under
!           instructions to return to Wadsley Bridge other than to be
            in good time for the returning special train. Hence it
            would be quite normal for them to remain at Hillsbrough
            for up to 2 hours. Additionally once the scale of the
            disaster began to unfold Senior Officers quite rightly
            concluded that our Officers would use their initiative and
            give all possible assistance to the South Yorkshire Police
]           at the ground hence there was no reason at that point in
            time to be unduly concerned over their whereabouts.

]           5.5.3. Sergeant[      j finally makes adverse comment as to
            the fact that when he eventually returned to Wadsley Bridge
            to all intents and purposes P.C.I       ]was still
            ’missing’

O
      Comment - The previous comments made in 5.5.2 in this
      apply up until the time that the special train departed
      from Wadsley Bridge Station. What Sergeant ~.would
      not know was that after that departure Acting Chief
      Inspector CRAGGS made arrangements for checks to be made
      with the local hospitals and the South Yorkshire
      Police Control in order to ascertain if P.C. ~lhad
      come under notice as being an injured Officer in any way.
      These enquiries proved negative and it was rightly
      concluded that he was still assisting at Hillsbrough. This
      assumption proved correct as illustrated in paragraph 3.6.
      No senior Officer of this Force was able to attend at
      the ground because o£ :-
        a) They were totally engaged in commanding and
        co-ordinating the urgently needed return arrangements,
0       and
        b) It was not physically possible due to traffic and
        pedestrian conjestion to make any practical effort to
        attend at the ground. Indeed to have done so would have
        been unwise taking into account the needs at Sheffield
        Midland Station at that time.

5.6   The British Transport Police Officers should be praised
      for their cheerful forebearance in the face of extreme
      difficulty when dealing with this type of situation.

     FA CUP - SEMI FINAL

     Liverpool FC v Nottlnqham Forrest at HillsborouQh,         Sheffield.

     On Saturday 15th April 1989 the Semi Final of the FA Cup will
     be played between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forrest. The
     klck-off time is 1500 hours and a capacity crowd of 54,000 is
     expected.

     In the event of a draw at the end of full time,        thirty

I    minutes of extra time will be played.

     A number of BR sponsored tralns have been arranged and it is
     expected that they will be full. It is anticipated that
     supporters will also travel by service trains into Midland
     Station, Sheffield.

     On both the inward and outward movements the special train
!    from Liverpool will use Wadsley Bridge Station and the trains
     from Nottingham will use Midland Station. The Liverpool
     supporters at Wadsley Bridge will be walked to and from the
     ground by the South Yorkshire Police.

     Nottingham supporters and Liverpool supporters at Midland
     Station will be segregated and bused to and from the ground
     under the supervision of South Yorkshire Police.


I   Platform I at Midland Station will be used to deal with the
    special trains from Nottingham and the supporters will leave
    by the North gate to buses which will be standlng in Sheaf

I   Street. The entrance/exit ticket barrier will be cordoned off
    and Liverpool supporters will be channelled via the South
    Luggage entrance to buses which will be standing on the
    Station approach road and leave via Cross Turner Street.
i   It is the intention of this operation to convey a large
    number of football supporters to and from Sheffield as
I   quickly and efficiently as possible and to ensure that public
    order is maintained.

     [)ON                    At iii0 hours c,n Saturday 15th April 1989, the Mobile
                             Support Unit (I        IPC’s I     I ~       I and
                                   worked the 1Z29 Football Special Liverpool
                             Lime Street to Wadsley Bridge in connection with the
                             F.A. Cup Semi Final match.

                             The train departed with some four hundred fans c,n
                             board.  The journey to Sheffield was uneventful
                             arriving at about 1400 hours, minutes prior to the
                             actual booked time.

                             Upon arrival the fans were marshalled and handed to
                             the South Yorkshire Police within minutes the fans
                             were marched by that force to the ground.   The Unit
                             Officers and a PC MASON from BFF’ at Leeds then went to
                             the ground where a meal was provided by the South
                             Yorkshire Police.

                            We arrived at the ground at 1425 hours and we were
                            fed and refreshed.  At 1500 hours a Chief Inspector
                            came into the feeding area mustering a number of
                            serials.  I was aware that a Public Order situation
                            had arisen somewhere in the ground.

                            Once out of the rnessing area life seemed "norrnal"
                            Serials were stood about in apparent "stand down".

                    SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL, 1989 AT HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD.

                    hours on Saturday IS April 1989 I trawelled together
    Anglia          with PCI                 ]in Police Vehicle Charlie 62.
I   Diwision
                    Upon our approach to Wadsley Bridge Station as we
                    turned onto the Barnsley Road which leads to
                    Hillsborough Football Ground, I could see about 200 to

J                   250 football supporters gathered outside and around an
                    O~-Licence which was on a parade o~ shops a short
                    distance ~rom Wadsley Bridge Station.   They were wery
!                   boisterous and shouting loudly.   Nearly all o~ them
                    were drinking ~rom cans o~ beer that they had in their
                    possession.   At approximately 1150 hours the vehicle

!                   was parked by Wadsley Bridge Station and I met
                    PS ~ from British Transport Police, Sheffield.
                    then awaited the arriwal o£ the Football Special ~rom
                                                                          We

                    Liwerpool.   As it got closer to the expected arriwal
I                   time o~ the train I went onto the railway track and
                    ¯ rom the position I took up I could clearly see the
                    supporters on the grassy slopes leading to the
!                   shopping parade, they had grown a lot louder than when
                    I had ~irst seen them, they were singing and shouting
                    and you could clearly hear them abowe the noise o~ the

!                   wehicles passing underneath the Railway.

                   The special train then arriwed at Wadsley at
q                  approximately &355 hours and the supporters
                   disembarked and made their way towards the Bridge Inn
                   Public House where the South Yorkshire Police Escort
                   was waiting.  The supporters numbered 430 in all and

i                  they were held there until the last o~ the supporters
                   ~rom the train had Joined them, the escort then made
                   its way towards the ground.   I then, together with

I                  ~our o~icers ~rom Liwerpool BTP, walked down to the
                   ground in order to get a pre-arranged meal.

 I        As I walked down to the ground I could see large
          groups of supporters drinking beer and generally
 I        waving their arms about and shouting.  Upon arrival at
          the ground I was directed to the gymnasium where I was
          provided vlth a meal.  After having been suitably
 I        refreshed I, together vlth two of the Liverpool
          Officers, made my way towards the Splon Kop, I stood by
          the Corner Flag near to the entrance/exlt which leads
          to the gymnasium, the match was in progress at this
 I        time and after a few minutes a Senior Officer of the
          South Yorkshire Police requested us to take up the
          positions of his contingent in front of the Nottingham
          Forest Supporters as he wished to take his contingent

JI        to the Lepplng Lane end of the ground.

         Upon looking towards the Lepplng Lane end I could see
         people climbing over the fencing and Jumping down
         onto the perimeter track behind the Liverpool
         goalmouth.   At this time it appeared to be a pitch

         supporters.
                     I then turned back towards the Forest
                       The players then vent off the pitch and
         the Forest supporters were becoming incensed towards
 I       the Liverpool supporters.   I then turned to look at the
         Lepplng Lane end and I saw that people were being
         lald on the ground and assistance was being given by
 I       Police Officers, St 3ohn’s Ambulance Personnel and
         supporters alike.   People were nov beginning to tear
         advertising hoardings down and started using them as
         stretchers to ferry the Injured and dead.   As the
 i       First Aid Post was positioned in the gymnasium the
         supporters had to run past the Splon Kop.   As the
         injured and dead passed the Splon Kop, a small section
         of the Notts Forest supporters were spitting at the
         helpers and bodies as they passed, then one Forest fan
         in particular kept shouting, tANOTHER FAT BASTARD
 I       SCOUSE IS DEADm, and laughing.   This incensed the
         Liverpool supporters who were carrying the dead and
         injured to the gymnaslum and every time the helpers
         came back the were treated to a torrent of abuse and
 i       spat upon by the Forest fans so much so that a few of
         the Liverpool supporters had to be dragged away from
         the Splon Kop fencing.

 I       As the situation worsened and more and more people
         were lying down on the pitch, I saw that towards the
 I       mlddie of the pitch supporters were running towards
         the Splon Kop end of the ground and the South
         Yorkshire Police were trying to hold them back.  I ran

I        across to assist and we managed to turn the supporters
         back towards the Lepping Lane end.  I returned to my
         original position in from of the Spion Kop and a short

I        while later I was approached by s South Yorkshire
         Police Officer andupon request assisted with the
         removal of a youth’s dead body.

I        Whilst attempting to get to the youth’s body I had to
         push a photographer out of the way.   Upon arrival at
         the gymnasium the youth ’s body was placed in the
I        temporary mortuary and I was approached by a South
         Yorkshire Superintendent and asked to stay with the
         youth’s body, which I did.

         At 1606 hours this day life was pronounced extinct by


f        Dr REDGRAVE.  All officers who were in the temporary
         mortuary were then instructed to remain with their
         bodies until they had been Identified by the next of
         kin.

I        At 0430 hours on Sunday 16 April 1989, the youth s body
         was identified as a Keith McGRATH, age 17 years,~
        ~Liverpoo~
I       Details   were then   taken   of   the youth   and   at   0445 hours
        I went with the body of Keith McGRATH to the Medico
        Legal Centre, Sheffield where the body of Keith
I       McGRATH was handed over to DC WIGOLD of the South
        Yorkshire Police. I then returned to Leeds by Police
        vehicle and signed off duty at 0630 hours this day.

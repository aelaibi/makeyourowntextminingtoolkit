              On     the    above          date       I commenced                   duty       at    8.00       am    at       F.E.

              Following           the       morning          briefing                I    cleared          my    desk          then       accompanied

              Superintendent                    Chapman          to    the          Sheffield          Wednesday                Football             club

              ground,           for    the       briefing             at    10.00             am.

              I was        to    work       with       Superintendent                         Chapman       on       Sector          3    (Nottingham

              Forest),           being          in    charge          of    Sector             3 A , Serials              52    to       56    inclusive.

              Following            the      briefing             I had          a    discussion             with          Superintendent

              Chapman,           then       spoke       to       several             officers          in       the       Serials             and,    shortly

              before        11.00          am    went       to    my       area          of    responsibility.                       This       area

              included           Herries             Road    S o u t h , Herries                    Road    and       that          stretch          of

              Penistone           Road          joining          those          two       roads.           There          is    a    traffic          island

              situated           in    Penistone             Road          at       its       junction          with       Herries             Road.           The

              other        road       leading          to    this          island             opposite          Herries             Road       is    Leppings

              Lane,        which       is       the    road       where             the       West    Stand          of    the       ground          is

              situated           and       also       where       entrance                to    the    North          Stand          is       gained.           Botl

              these        stands          being       for       the       Liverpool                supporters.

              Looking           along       Leppings             Lane       from          Penistone             Road/Herries                   Road       it    is

              not        possible          to    see    the       North             ana       west    Stands          or       the       entrances             to

    same       because          of    the       turns          in    Leppings          Lane.

    I was       on    the       side       of       the    ground          where       the    Nottingham                supporters             were

    expected          to    arrive.                 In    fact       the    majority          of    coaches,             over       eighty,

    carrying          these          fans       parked          in    the       Sheffield          Transport             Department             Bus

Depot,           which          is    situated             in       Herries          Road    near       to    Penistone             Road.           One

    task       for    the       Serials             employed          in    this       area       was    to       direct       the

Nottingham                 fans       along          Herries          Road,          away    from       Penistone             Road.        These

fans           were    then          directed             by    other       officers          to    turn          right       down    Herries

Road           South,       towards             that       pari       of    the       ground       that       had       been       allocated

to        them.        That          is    the       Kop       and    the       South       Stand.

The        idea,       of       course,             was    to       direct       the    Nottingham                fans    away       from       the

Liverpool              fans,          many          of    whom       would       approach          the       ground       from       the

W a d s ley          Bridge          side,          that       is    down       Penistone          Road       and       right       along

Leppings              Lane.           The       Liverpool             fans       using       the    special             train       stopping

at        Wadsley          Bridge          Station,             would       also       use    that       route.           This       was       the

same           plan    as       the       previous             year.

The        Nottingham                coaches             started       to       arrive       around          noon.        The       system          was

working              well       with       the       odd       hic-up,          in    that    a    few       coaches          had    unloaded

    prior       to    arriving             at       the    bus       depot       but    steps       were          taken       to    put    a    stop

to        this.

    It    is    true       to    say       the       majority          of       the    fans       were       in    a    buoyant       mood          and

    complied          with       police             requests          as    to       their    approach             to    the       ground.

    In    addition          to       the    Serials             at    this       point,       there          were       two    Police

    horses       these          played          a    most       useful          part    by    pointing             the    fans       in    the

    right       direction.                 One       of    tneir       tasks          was    to    ensure          the    Liverpool             fans

    did    not       encroach             onto       this       area       but       this    never       occurred.

Many           private          vehicles             carrying          Nottingham             fans       were          also    parked          in

    this       area.

As        the    build          up    continued                it    was    obvious          many       supporters             had    been

    drinking          as    dozens          were          obliged          to    relieve          themselves             in    a    small
                                                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                                                R 130

woodland             area       opposite             the    bus       depot.           I gave          instructions                   that        this

was    to       be    permitted             as       there       was    no       public          toilet          in    that          area.            I

wish       to    emphasise                that       even    at       this       stage       the       mood       was       still

generally             buoyant             and    a    word       from       a    Police          Officer          to       the       occasional

transgressor                   had    the       desired          effect.

I    had    walked             around       my       area    and       spoken          to    many          officers,             there          were

no    serious             problems          and       the    atmosphere                was       as    one       would          expect           on

such       an    occasion.

I    saw    there          were       no    problems             at    the       turnstiles                on    Penistone             Road,

which       gives          access          to    the       Kop    and       everything                seemed          to    be       proceeding

to    plan.

1    remember             about       E .00      pm    hearing          on       my    personal             radio          that       the       Special

Train       from          Liverpool             had    arrived          at       Wadsley          Bridge          Station.                 1'

believe          this          had    arrived          early.

As    the       fans       from       the       Special          Train          would       be    escorted             along          Penistone

Road,       past          the    junction             with       Herries          Road,          I made          my    way       to    that

junction             to    await          their       arrival.              So    far       as    I    re-call             it    was       around

this       time,          or    shortly          after,          there          were    radio          messages             directing

Transit          mobiles             to    areas       where          fans       were       causing             trouble.              These

included             Kilner          way,       just       above       Wads ley         Station,                the    Horse          and       Jockey

on    Wadsley             Lane       and    the       Royal       on    Penistone                Road.

The    Liverpool                fans,       with       police          escort,          came          from       the       Station          and

turned          right          into       Leppings          Lane.           They       were       boisterous,                   as    one       would

expect,          but       there          was    no    cause          for       concern          so    far       as    could          be        seen       at

that       time.

I    remained             in    the       vicinity          of    the       bus       depot       and       Penistone                Road        as       the

pedestrian                build       up    down       Penistone                Road    and       along          Leppings             Lane        was

very       heavy.              Tnese       fans       were       prevented             from       continuing                along

Penistone             Road       or       turning          into       Herries          Road,          as    they       were          Liverpool

supporters.

I recall that about 2.20 pm an order came over the Personal radio for

Leppings Lane to be closed to vehicular traffic because of the build

up of pedestrians.   I particularly re-call this because I was

instructed to inform a Sheffield Transport Department officer (Mr

Middleton) of this and inform him that service buses would have to

be diverted.   I delivered this message within two minutes and

informed control.    I returned to the Traffic Island at the Penistone

Road end of Leppings Lane. There was no congestion of Leppings Lane

by pedestrians at that end but I did notice there were a large number

and many of these seemed the worse for drink.

I would like to emphasise these fans were not fighting drunk or in an

ugly mood,   they were just what I would describe as being stupidly

drunk, in fact many were still actually drinking.    I clearly remember

thinking I had never seen so many in such a state before.

The police officers on Leppings Lane and Penistone Road at this time,

were coping adequately and, after speaking with the officers on duty

at the bus depot, I walked along Penistone Road towards the ground.

I had occasion to speak to two young fans outside an off licence near

the ground, who apologised as some drunks do for their behaviour.         I

then entered the ground via the gate leading to the Sports Hall.

It was at this time I heard radio messages about gates being opened

at Leppings Lane.    I am sure this was after I had heard the roar of

the crowd signalling that the teams had come onto the playing area.

I distinctly remember there was an extreme urgency in the voice

or voices passing the messages.

I definitely heard 'Gate C' and either   'a Gate' or'Gate A'.    My first

thought was they were to open the gate or gates to allow people out

because of the crushing, but I quickly realised this was not the case.

Before I actually reached the playing area, I heard a message

instructing all available officers onto this area.    Knowing there

and    then       ran       to       the        playing       area.

I saw       the       teams          just        disappearing                back           into       the       players             tunnel      andon|

playing          area.           I also          saw    some        climbing                or    attempting                to       climb       the

perimeter             fence          onto        the    playing             area       and        some       scrambling                from      the

Terrace          up    into          the     Stand.            i took             this       in       as    I was         running           across

the    p it ch .

On    reaching          this          fence       I assisted                 a    youth          over,       this          youth          was    in    a

very       distressed                state.        It    was        then          I    noticed             the       faces       of       the    people:

pressed          against             the    fence.           I quickly                 helped             another          youth          from    the

top    of    the       fence          and       then    ran     to          the       emergency             exit          gate       in    this                  '

enough.           I actually                remember           pushing                one    officer             aside          and       shouting           j

words       to    the       effect          "get       them     out.'                 The    officer             replied             they       were         J
trying       but       were          unable       to    do     so.           There          was       a    tremendous                crush       of          j


people       at       that       gate.           One    reason              for       this       was       the       drop       of    about       two        j


feet       from       the    perimeter             track        to          the       floor       of       the       Terrace.              People            j

were       actually          bent          over     this       in       a    pile.

then       realised          what          the    officer           had          meant.            I found            it    impossible                to

move       him,       I then          realised          he     was          dead.

I    then    took       hold          of    the     arms       of       another             young          man       and    tried          to    pull

him    out       but    1    felt          him    slip       away           and       could        not      maintain             my       hold    on

him.        The       crush          seemed       to    increase.                     We    managed          to       assist          a    few    out

over       the    others             and    I then        saw       a       man       in    absolute              p a n i c , he      was

literally             throwing             himself        on    the          backs          of     other          people andI shoute

rear    of       this    crush.              Theseofficers                 were           attempting           to    pull       people

from    the       Terrace.              Many       were          dead     or    seriously               injured.

 To    ensure     there       were       a       sufficient             number          of    police       officers             outside

 line     across       the     pitch.

 I    entered     the       Sports       Hall.              By    this       time       the    injured       had       been       removed

 and     I saw    many        bodies         on       the       floor       of    the    Hall.        A    line       of    Police

Dear Stefan
Kevin Williams (deceased)
I refer to our recent telephone conversations and have now had a chance to peruse the
papers on this matter once again.
I enclose a copy of my reply to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, which was sent today together
with a copy letter from Dr Slater and the post-mortem report. You will note that this
contains very specific reference to damage to the neck structures.
Kind regards




u v uorries

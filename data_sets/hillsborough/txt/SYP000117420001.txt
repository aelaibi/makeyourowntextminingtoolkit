             the     ones      I spoke         to    it was evident              that     they were under             the       influence

             of alcohol.               Owing        to the distance              from the          ground,     the    number        of

             fans     involved,            and the d e p le ti o n         in m a n p o w e r       that w o u l d have          resulted

trans m i s s i o n .         T hen d i r e c t e d   into     ground,        to what was          b e l i e v e d to be

a public         d i s order        situation.

Arrived         into g r o un d at           ’S pi on Hop*       end.      There was obvious                disr u p t i o n

at    the L iv er p o o l        supporter s end ■-* *West                Stand’.         On near i n g      t he

stand,         I n ot ic ed an officer a p p a r e n t l y                struggling wit h a middle                    aged

gent.          Believing         that      the officer         was a t t e m p t i n g    to effect         an

arrest,          1 went         to assist          him.      I took      hold of the man's              right arm

and the other                officer        (not known to me)             told me that            "It was a l r i g h t ,

h e ’d just          had a rough time               coming      out of there"            (referirig to the

m i d d l e - a g e d ma n an d        the West Stand).                 I a sked    if the        officer        was

a lr i g h t    and    I then         rejoined PC 660 Dexter.                    Still        t h i nking   that       it

was a        ’pitch      invasion''.           We a p p r o a c h e d    the West Stand.                I saw

offic e r s       climbing          onto the fence,             but     1 could not make             out what          they

were     doing.          1    was     i n structed        by a S e r g e a n t    (not known to me)               to form

a cordon across                 the    pitch.         I saw a Liverpool             s u p porter        run the full

length of the                pitch and stand              in the goal m o u t h at the               *S p i o n H o p ’

end,     mak i n g      *V*     sig n gesture          to the Notts.             Forest       supporters.

Myself and PC De x t e r                   and other       o f f icers    formed, a passive              cordon

ac r o s s     the    pitch.          At    this    time     I had not        seen any bodies,              or other

persons         other        than     ’walk i n g wounded*.

It was         only w h e n stret c h e r s           passed m e , carrying              corpses,        that     1

r ealised         the s ev e r i t y of the            situation.

On    realising          this,        and after        having      suffer red c o n s i derable             verbal

abuse from distressed and into k icated Liverpool supporters, 1 decided

that     I was        serving         no useful        purpose        in my      position at         that     time.

Myself and PC De x t e r m ov ed                    forward       towards        the West S t a n d to assist

the     injured.

We a s si st ed a ma n              lying on the           floor,       having     spasms.         We    stayed with

him and then             lifted the man onto a str e t c h e r w h e r e b y he was                           carried
                                                                                                                       PAGE

away.

By    the time we          reac h e d the         perimeter           fence,         people were fil t e r i n g              out

of the gates.              Our       concern was         to the N o r t h            side      of the West Stand.

I did not see any                corpses        carried fro m that                   side      of the stand.

I a t t e m pt ed to       clear       the gr o u n d      in order            to    give      access to the

A m b u la n ce Service,             who   had not a r r i v e d until                that time.

Many    fans were          eager       to help but were                  not    sure what          to do.       Man y were

w a n d e ri ng aimle s s l y ,        and others were                looking         for     lost    relatives and

friends.

A    large    number       of the w o od en a d v e r t i s i n g              boards        had been      col l e c t e d by

the    fans and they were                  s tr e w e d a r o u n d      the goal          m o u t h area.

1 d i r e c t e d a number            of the      fans     to clear            them out of the way,                 to

place    them near            the      g o a l s , and then to stand to one side                          to await            a

call    for a ss is t a n c e          from us,        should we need               it,    at the      same    time,

thanking them for                their       help,      already          given.

Ambulances          s ta r t e d to arrive.

I can remember             a fight          starting        in the        corner          of the S o u t h / W e s t

Stands,       apparently             betw e e n memb e r s       of the Liverpool                  supporters,.           I

ran towards          this,       but       before     I arrived           the       sit u a t i o n had been

c o n tr olled      by o t h e r       o f f i.c e r s p r e s e n t .

I was    i ns t r u c t e d    by      Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Nesbit                to form a cordon on

the    centre       line,      in      order     to    clear      the pitch and              restore      order.

At    no time,       did      I have        contact wit h          corpses.

Even a t      the    time      of being a s k e d by C hief Supe r i r i t e rule n t                    Nesbi t to

form a cordon,             I had no idea of the extent                              of the      injuries/

fatalities,          or the          reasons      behind       them.           1 had seen about               six   corpses

being    carried,          I had not seen man y                  badly         injured        persons,        the   ones          I

had seen a p p e a r e d         to be d i s t r e s s e d       rather         than phys i c.a11 y i n j u r e d .

1 felt       ill-informed,             unable       to get       involved            because       of the mass           of

people       present:,        an d    in the early stages                  g e n u i n e l y f r i g h t e n e d as      the

potential for a full scale riot was clearly evident.

After    it was announced that the game had been called off,      and having

cleared most of the pitch,      we returned   to Rawson   Spring Road at the

junction with Penistone     Road.   Myself and other officers    assisted    in

clearing traffic.

Even    at   this stage a fight broke out between rival supporters and PS

Taylor calmed the situation as I ran to assist him, (in company with DC

Hubbard) the van full of believed Liverpool supporters, were reluctant to

move on.      Yet again under normal circumstances, arrests would have been

made except for the impracticalities of the situation.       We went off duty

at 1930 hours.

            potential        for a full        scale    rn-Tt was     clearly     evident.

           A fter      it was a n n o u n c e d   that the game had been                  called off,        and having

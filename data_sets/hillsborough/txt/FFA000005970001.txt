       Please find attached two letters from ai|___________ which are
       self-explanatory. They were handed to
       yesterday. Please can you check whether the FA ever received the
       letters, if not could you please ask Ted Crocker whether he ever
       recalls seeing them.
       I understand that           _                has just started to
       give his evidence. ' Sheffield Wednesday have now completed their
       statements and have agreed to let us have copies on the basis

0      that they have copies of ours. It seems to me sensible to agree
       to this exchange.         _    is bringing back with him copies of
       Sheffield Wednesday's statements so that they will be available
       tomorrow.
       I confirm that we will not be attending the Council meeting
       tomorrow morning but we will be meeting at the FA at 3pm on
       Friday.

       Best regards

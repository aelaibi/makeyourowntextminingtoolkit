                 At 9.00 a.m.      on Saturday 15 April           1989,, J. came on duty at Barnsley

                 transported to Hillsborough Football Ground for a briefing at

                 I was on serial No.         14,   the Inspector       in charge of this serial was

At 11.00 a*m.    or possibly a little before that; time, Serial                  14, :

together with another serial                consisting of ' *B2* Sub-Division Officers

attended at the rear of the terraces on the West Stand, where

Inspector White explained what we were                required to do that day.



          was d e p L o y e ^ U r s ^ d e    the ground at the Uspjj^                     of

the ground.     We were to search supporters entering the ground at

turnstiles A-G.       I was working           in the company of Police Constable

2806 Butler and our attention was mainly focused on turnstile C.



Shortly after    11.00 a.m. Serial             1.4, took up positions at the

turnstiles and at about          11,15 a.m.       turnstiles A-B were open.        Through

the turnstile you could see that                 there was    another serial   deployed

outside the     ground who were also there to search supporters.



By 12 noon all the turnstiles                (A-G) were open,    but supporters were

only coming     through in dribs and drabs and                the serial outside the

ground were     able to search those persons. However,               Inspector     White

insisted that, such persons be searched a second time by Serial                     14.

The supporters feelings about this were mixed,                   some did not mind

others found this offensive.



E3y approximately 2.20 p.m. supporters were                  coming through the

turnstiles quickly and there were not enough officers                   present to

search ey,ery person entering the ground.



Through the turnstile you could see that people were being                     pushed
right up to them,, but I could not see past the first three or four

people outside the, ground to see how big the crowd was.               People were

coming through and we were still trying to search them.                However,

some ^people were s.,ayjurfig M a t    would be better off dealing with the

crowd outside     rath/r than searching them.



By about 2.30 p.m.      supporters    were beginning to

t-the twnnsl^i^s,   these   persons   apparently had        tickets and were

^Trow^ngthemimto        the crowd outside the ground.



A short time after this I                that Gate C was open and a

number of supporters        came flooding into the ground.         I do not know

how the gates had become opened.



I cannot give a number of how many persons            came into the ground but

it was a terrific amount.



The mood of these      persons was    that they wre    either angry    or

triumphant.     I will explain this as follows.         Some   people entering fay

gate C had tickets and some had not.          Because of the enormity of the

crowd it was impossible for any of us to control them,                to check to

see if they had tickets or to search them as we had been deployed to

do   „




After a short time a matter of about one minute Police Officers,                  I

recall Police Sergeant Crawford, Police Constable McManus and Police

Constable Grant were able to close Gate         *C*.           *



the crowd that had rushed through gate seemed to congregate around

the area between gate C and. the West Stand congesting the area
totally.    I was       continually asking      people to move back or to go to

the area they were supposed to be in and this was replied by them

either saying they were waiting for friends or afcuse or people being

both abusive -and angry, '



The supporters wj^e angry because there was apparently an enormous

crowd outride / h e       ground and they were insisting that we do something

about it.   Jffnfortunately we could not do anything,            we had no radios

f or commjfhi cat i on and I had not seen Inspector White since about

1.00 p.m / As a m a t ter of fact I                               that day.



Supporters were saying ,

being crushed to death out there.               I noticed that there was some sort

of message being         passed'           ground* s tannoy but the noise of the

crowd was so loud that no-one was able to hear.



As all this had been happening,           people had still be coming through

the turnstiles.         However,   the   condition of some of these was very

bad,   especially the women and          children.     The people were pale and you

could see that they were sweating and having difficulty breathing.                    1

tried to help those people as            best   T. could.



The next thing      I    remember was

through gate C ■        I lokoed over    in the direction of the gate and saw

that   it was open again and officers were attempting to close it.                  The

state of the crowd was the same as I had described before.                 It was

also obvious that friany of the persons had been drinking,              however,    it

was impossible to do anything about these people.



Needless to * m y .«t this stage it had alVfeady become impossible to
                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                           R 162

              continue searching jeople.        There was nothing whatsoever that we

              could do to m-i^i the situations any better.



              I   remembe'r hearing; a: loud cheer from the area inside the stand and

              the crowd that had                               West Stand ^ n d Gafte^C^

              suddenly all      ran towards the central' tunnel which leads onto the

                                     of the West Stand and the area behind the stand

              became v                       However,    people were still    coming through

              the turnstiles.       The time was about 3.00 p.m.



              I must admit      it, the last 30 minutes     I was the most worried I had been

              in my entire      life because there were only 11 Police Officers and god

              knows how many fans and we were powerless to do anything.



              I rememberj/a next an Inspector,      whose name I do not know,       come

              running /rom behind the West Stand from the area marked             ’S ’ on the

              plan, / a us and telling us to go onto the pitch.           The whole of Serial

              14 fifllowed the Inspector      round behind the Police Control and onto

              t h J pitch from the South Stand.



             At this stage we did not know why we were going onto the pitch.                 As

             we reached the pitch I. could not see any players.              1 could see fans,

              running out on the pitch and it appeared at that stage that they were

0 P s M f > t r' invading the   ptich.   There were also other officers       coming onto the

              pitch and they appeared to be forming a cordon along the 18 yard line

              in front of the West Stand.



              I was facing the West Stand and saw fans pushing towards the front,

             some being     lifted into the stand from the terraces.          As I looked at

             ttte tefraces .’'I can only remember       looking at parts CS and CN marked on*
                                                                           ■ PAGE ...
                                                             '   " V        . R 162 •

the plan.     However,   1 remember seeing a fan at the top of the West

Stand swinging along the rafters by his arms.         I. remember also seeing

one fan being lifted from the terraces       into the West Stand.      He was

almost    in the West Stand but fell to the floor.     At this point it

still appeared as though what I could see were just acts of

hooliganism.



The next thing was that Police Officers        ran from the 18 yard line to

the wire    fence at the Centre South and Centre North areas.          I

followed    suit but did not realise that it was anything more         than bad

behaviour from jUhe crowd.      1 can recall Police Sergeant Crawford

telling our sjrria.1 to try and stay together.



When I_y^?achad t he fencing I could see that persons were being

crushed against the fencing.       However   it still did not seem as

serious as it, apparently was.      I could not understand from being

stood further back on the pitch why persons did not move further back

as there appeared to have been room.



Other officials had begun opening gates and lifting people over the

fences.     I/stood to the left of gate C as you look from the         pitch and

remember    /art of a blue barrier being thrown at us Police Officers.



A Policewoman who    I do not know came to me and said,     t h e r V ^ ***»»?

kids dying.     I looked at the fence again and saw that people were

pushed up to the fence with so much pressure that their faces were

being pushed almost through the fence and some poeple were turning

blue,    others were being sick and it was    instantly obvious that some,

were already dead.
                                                                              PAGE
                                                                              R162

      I remember speaking to one woman and trying to encourage her to

      attempt to climb up,   but the pressure was so great behind her that

      she was unable to.     I then tried to help people climb ovter the fence

      to get onto: the pitch.



      When a few peo/fe had got out I went to check that they were okay.

      After I ha^rdone that, with two people,    I returned to the fence but

      was unable to get near enough to help and realised I would be better

      helping the ones as other officers were getting them out.



      Together with Police Constable 3232 Burton,       I. went to one Liverpool

      fan and saw that his friends had brought an advertising hoarding to

      put him on.    This man was alive,   however,   he was far from well.     We

      helped ithe fans place him on the board then we placed him in the

      reco^Cry position and 1 placed something soft under his head.           Then
 Ky
      to/ether with Police Constable Burton and his friends we carried the

      fen to the area between the North Stand and the Spion Kop.         When we

      reached this part of the pi tch I returned to the Le ppi ngs Lane

      terrace where I saw that now there was danger a push and a crush of

      people,   there was merely a pile of dead bodies which the rest of the

      crowd had obviously been stood on.      There were approximately 15 to 20

      bodies of people who had obviously been dead for a long time.           On the

      top of the pile I remember seeing a young woman only a little younger

      than myself.
ft




      I realised there was nothing    I could do for the people remaining, on

      the terrade,   so returned to the pitch were I saw a mass of people.           I

      did not perform,mouth to mouth or heart massage on any persons as the

      ones I went to had been dead a long time or Police Officers had
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                               .   R 162   "

         already just been attempting to revive them or they did not require

         such help.     I put people in the recovery position if they needed it

         and just stayed with them for a little while to make sure they were

         alright.;                                      ,                                  "



         While officers were trying to help people, abuse w a s :being received

         from f^ns,   some of the fans, although I believe the majority of them

         genuinely wanted to help.     Others      were trying to help their friends

         and would not allow officers to show them the correct         ways.



         I do not recall while     I. was on the pitch seeing anyone above the rank

         of Sergeant.



         Eventually everyone began leaving the ground.         All bodies were

         removed and our serial Was then instructed to escort Liverpool            fans

         from Leppings Lane to Penistone Road roundabout.          At this stage our

         serial had the addition of Police Constable 2083 Parker,          but was

         minus Police Constable     2819 McManus    and Police Constable   2887 Grant,

         who were still dealing     with bodies.    At this time we did    not know how

         many people had die.



         We returned to the ground where we sat        in the North Stand awaiting

         any jobs that may need     doing.



         Further to this I have     only worked one previous semi-final match at

         Hillsborough and that, was last year when Liverpool were playing Notts

         Forest,   as this year.   However,   I    was deployed at the rear of the

         North stand and did not encounter any problems.

      attach a copy of his letter. As you will see he has reminded me Of ) a 0
      that any call on the contingency fund - however organised - has I •Cr^r^
      to be justified against the criterion of urgency in the public       I
      interest.   Bearing in mind that for the moment we are talking      I I
      about a sum of only £120,000 or thereabouts for South Yorkshire,    *
      the delayed payment of which is unlikely to be crucial to their
      finances, I cannot see that we could justify immediate payment
      against *the criterion    for securing    an advance    from the
      Contingencies Fund. I am not therefore minded to go back to the
      Treasury on this point, at least at this stage. We also have to
      bear in mind that we do not yet know what the full cost of the
      special grant will be.   We cannot keep raiding the Contingency
      Fund as and when the bills come in.

      3.    What I propose is that once we have received South
      Yorkshire's assurance that they are going to pay the present
      invoice from West Midlands, we in FD2 will inform them of what
      we propose to do and make arrangements with Accounts Branch to
      pay to them the 51% specific grant element of the sum (totalling
      £855,475). We would explain to South Yorkshire that the special
      grant element would be paid as soon as we have the necessary
      Supplementary Estimate approved by Parliament.

      4.    I cannot see that South Yorkshire would have legitimate
      grounds for complaint about this basis for proceeding.       They
      cannot expect us to pay out special grant in advance of
      Parliamentary approval.   If however South Yorkshire make a fuss
      about being kept waiting for the balance of £120,000, I would be
      prepared to consider the possibility of advancing payment of the
      normal monthly grant advance (something over £3.5M) by a couple
      of days. This would enable South Yorkshire to offset any interest
      incurred on the £120,000 by allowing them to earn a bit more than
      usual   on  the  grant   payment.    However   I would welcome
      Mr Mullarky's views on the practicality of such a step. We also
      have to be careful that we do not appear to be trying to pay
      special grant by the back door without informing Parliament.

HILLSBOROUGH : COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

Thank you for your letter of 25 August about which we have spoken.

We agreed that given the small amount of special grant involved it
might be reasonable to expect South Yorkshire to wait until normal
Parliamentary approval for the expenditure can be obtained.   This
would be by way of a Winter Supplementary Estimate which would
probably be voted by Parliament towards the end of December.

Section B 108-110^sets out the procedures for seeking an advance
from the Contingencies Fund.  You will see that the only criterion
for adopting this course is "urgency in the public interest."   If
exceptionally you decide that you feel it necessary to adopt this
course you will have to justify it on these grounds.

Before agreeing to the special grant I would be grateful to know
where you will be surrendering equivalent offsetting savings as
requested by the Chief Secretary's letter of 19 June.

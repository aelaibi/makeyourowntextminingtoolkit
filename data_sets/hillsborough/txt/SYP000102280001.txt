At ^.’SOarc Snturday 15th April 1989 I w&b on duty nt Sheffield Wednesday Football Club for the
FA Cup Semi final tie betwr-en Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC.
At 10u - that rooming I &'tended at the main briefing after which    3 receivedaserial briefing,
(serial 12).
Kyself with FC 255^ Hague were briefed to observe turnstyles 73-88 ( North Stand, Fenistone
Ro&d). Due to these turnstyles being closed myself and PC Hague assisted other officers at gate
0.
During the afternoon several attempts were made by Liverpool fans to gain entry through this
gate without tickets, especially as kick off time approached. The majority of these fans
attempting to gain entry lid smell of intoxicants.
While patroling near to gate 0 I saw fans standing in the very far cornerofthe   Kop nearest
to the orth stand urinating onto the roof of am Ambulance parked directly underneath the stand

At about       to 3»15pw I became aware of some sort of incident when fans from the Kop started tj
leave the ground.                                                           I
I only became aware of the seritwusness of the incident when several Ambulances were driven
throttgJ* gate C and to the rear of the Hotth Stand, as well as other police serials.

Myself and PC Hague remained at gate 0 and assisted in the arrival and departure of the
Ambulance service.

Later on in the afternoon/ early evening I combined with other officers to form a transit patro!
(P*^^reenway driving) in the Hillsborough area.

The transit patrcl then returned to the North Stand of the ground where, along with other
officers formed a corden outside the gymnasium area.

At 7W- that day I was released from duty and took no further part in the matter.

              everyone present in the canteen were called to Hi 11 sbdtju/^igh as there

              were reports of trouble at the/ground.

              At approximately 3,20pm,                      together with other officers from about six

              transits from Brightside Uk n                                     went on to the foot ba11 p i t ch itself

              from the Penistone Road end, the iNottingham supporters stand.                                                                    We wers

    .      at first told to form a line in front of Jk/s ifle stand containing what

            appeared to be Liverpool supporters.                   ty        t ime later we were told

            t o form a line .in the middle of t^ie jyftdbXP a c I'ntf"towards L e p p in g s

           Lane, which contained the Liverpool supporters.                       I could see that

            there were hundreds of people comprising stewards,                     supporters,    police

           and others on the pitch in front of me.                      Many lay on the pitch itself

           a n d were n o t rno v in g .

            I approached people on the floor and realising that many people were

            injured I attempted to help with many others.                     After a while it

           appeared that most people who             M/ e r e   still alive had been removed.          1

           outside the ground to help ease the congestion outside.                         I do not

            recall who I was with,         later on I was joined by PC.24 Earnshaw.                   We

           were asked by an Inspector to accompany a cajfc/ taking relatives of

           the deceased to Hamrnerton Road Police S t a ^ i After this I

           eventually made my way to West Bar with other officers arriving there

           at 6.30prn«      Following a meal here I arrived back, at Attercliffe where

            I finished duty at 7.30pm.

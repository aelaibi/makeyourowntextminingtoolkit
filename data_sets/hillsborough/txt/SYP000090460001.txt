                At S.30am 0S30 on Saturday 15th April                    19S9 150489 I commenced duty at

                Main Street Police St/at ion being directed to work on Serial 41 at the

                Nottingham Forest amd Liverpool football Match at Hillsborough

                Football Ground i/n Sheffield.                Serial 41 was under the command of

                arrival at approkimately 9.25am 0925 we went directly to the b r i e i j / n q ^

                which was to be held in the seated area of the ground.                            Upon

                conclusion of the briefing             phase one came into operation.                      This

                directed officers of serial 41 to work in pairs and Police Halifa>
                                                                          ^"73 k T
                Road.  I began patrolling Halifax Road in Company with PC1779 Wi^TSON.

                During this patrol          period no real        public order      incidents occurred that

                came to my attention.              However,    myself and PC WATSON did pay
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S3472

particular a t tention to the Whitehorse    public house which is situated

on Halifax Road.     A number of thy'fans had gathered inside and out of

these premises,    drinking alcol-ysl and they appeared to be in high

spirits,   some of which were shouting and swearing.           Advice was given

to them but no further action was taken.

Also attention was given to an off licence which was situated in a row

of shops across from the Whitehorse      public house.       A large number of

fans had gathered inside these premises      in order to purchase drink.

Due to the large number    inside the premises congestion occurred.              This

was rectified by the shop owner allowing only a small number             inside

the shop at any one time.     No further   problems o c c u r r e d y

A large percentage of the fans which were walking dow/i Halifax Road

towrds the football ground were drinking from beer yeans a nd generally

they were in high spirits.     Some of those fans h atu to be advised with

regards urinating    in public places.

Advice was also given regarding littering as empty beer cans littered

Halifax Road from top to bottom.

At about 2.45 1445 myself and PC WATSON began to make our way to the

football ground along with the other members of serial 41.              We had

almost   reached the ground when we were informed by Insp BROOMHEAD that

a call for assistance had been received from inside the ground.                 Our

serial was to make our way directly to the ground,           entering at the

Nottigham Forest end.     Upon entering I saw a large number of people on

the football   pitch.   A number of these were lying on the ground as if

they had been injured.Myself and PC WATSON were directeci/by Inspector

BROOMHEAD to stand at the North Stand facing the Nottingham For^-it

Fans.    Our job was to watch for any public order         incrdents. M o n g    with

the other members of serial 41 I did as instructed and s t o j / d       facing

the North Stand.

Minor fights did break out amongst the Nottingham Forest fans as
                                                                                        PAGE    3
                                                                                        S3472
         tempers rose due to the match having been stopped.                These soon

       ' subsided and order was retained.              Some of the fans in the North Stand

         did try to climb over the protective fencing which separated them from

         the pitch.     They w s r e a d v i s e d .

         As I stood facing the North Stand I saw a number of people being

         carried off the pitch on makeshift stretchers,             with coats and jumpers

         covering their faces.

         It was only then that I realised that people had died and that many

         were injured.      I still did not know what had caused the deaths and

         injuries.

         The match was eventually cancelled and fans were informed to make

         their way home.       This was achieved by using the internal          loud speaker

         system.

         When the fans began to leave the football ground Inspector BROOMHEAD

         directed us to follow them up Halifax Road and to escort them to their

         coaches.     This was done without incident,          however,   some abuse was

         given by fans as they made their way home.

         At approximately 8pm 2000 that same day I concluded my tour of duty

         after being de-briefed at Rotherham Police Station.

                                                                          M SOUTHALL SIGNED

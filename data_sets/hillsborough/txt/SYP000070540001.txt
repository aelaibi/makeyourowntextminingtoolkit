directed            me    towards          the' goal          mouth,          I looked          towards           the       goal         mouth,,

be a      pie,,          I found          the      whole      situation            very       incongruous              and       difficult

to a s s e s s .          1 formed             the    opinion        that        what     1 ha d       envisaged

earlier         had       in f act         occurred,           i e , there          had       been     an       outbreak           of

fighting            on    the       terraces,          which        ha d     resulted          in a     number             of    people

sustaining               injuries,,             The    fence        was      very       crowded        behind          the       goal .

I watched            the       crowd       for       a short        time      to    try       and    assess           the       situation;,

a n d sa w no            r eason         at that stage to go any                         nearer        the       f en c e „        I     moved
to    the     penalty              area    and       again     tried         to m o v e       encroaching              spectators

back      to     the       terracing            but       had       no    success          whatsoever.                  Other       Officers

also      were      trying             to m o v e       them,        but       mors       and    more      were         coming       onto       the

pitch       and     it was             obviously a wasted                       effort.            I was       approached             by a

Police         Constable               whose      identity               I do       not    know,,        He    wa s      distressed             ana

f a t a 1 i I i e s , on       the       terracing,,                 I found          what       he    said        difficult          to

believe,,
I went         towards         the        fencing           but      due       to    the       numbers        of    fan s      and

around         m e , in tne             vicinity            of      the    goal       mouth,,         There         were       casualties

everywhere.                 Th e       situation            with         each       one    seemed        to me          tne    same,       they

obviously            extremely               distressed,                looking             for    friends           arm    relatives                from

whom       they      had        become           separated.                 Others          were     abusive,           insulting               and

just       unwilling             to    co operate.                 I considered                   myself        in a       situation             whers

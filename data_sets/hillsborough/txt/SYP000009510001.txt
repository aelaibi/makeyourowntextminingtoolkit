                Qn the above date I was on supposed.week ly leave, but had been

                previously          wa.rned   to   cornmeritse^duty at             Hackenthorpe P o l i c e S t a t i o n a t

                6.15am that <tay« This I subsequeiHjy did, along with a good number of

                other officers.               was assigned duties^ as part of serial                           13 which was

                to the-N^round via poliee t ra^Syt^r^eg no A602 WHby ^ar r iv inq there at

                approximately 8.45am . we then went straight to the North Stand where

                we occupied our specified seats in serials as previously directed.

We   r emained seated until               the ar ief 1 ng t^sok pla\.e at                 IQ.OQam

 I mmediately after           brief irvg, we had a packed lunch,                       again    in the North

stand,     to be on our          points           11.15am for the gates                   opening at          12 noon.



My specific: dut i e ^ r e 1at e d to the Leppinas Lane Stand, being in
             —   — X j        w a i n   --------------------------
company with Police Con s t a b l e 928 Parkin, also of H a c k e n t h o r p e Police

Stat i o n , 'ah»^ before        the m a t c h started,           to patrol         the    concourse area

at the     rear   of the       ups tai rs s t a n d . Thi s i s the area where                     the    to i lets

are,    the tops of both stairways                   and the        buffet        bar area.     This was         to

be   continued until           kick     off,     when we were             to be    relieved by another

serial,     for a hot mea 1 , Fans               f rorn L.i ver pool        started arrivi ng and

e ntering     the stand, at about               12.15pm but very few had entered up to

about    1 . 3 0 pm. Betw e e n       1.30pm and        2. 1 5 p m a great          deal more a r r i v e d      and

          ind b e g a n H o     f ill    up,    both     downstairs          and upstairs. Quite a               lot

of these      f ans    h a d b e e n d r i n k i n g , and one       in particular           had    consumed

a lot,     but was       not a problem.           Shor t l y after          this,     I was aware         that

there was a large amount                  of fans waiting            outside        the ground,          in

Leppmgs      Lane,not making any attempt                      to enter           the ground,       but m e r e l y

standing around           or sitting           on grass      banks        opposite     the entrances            in

Leppmgs      Lane.       At ^5r<^rnd^about this             tirivs*, messages          began to be

broadcast      over      t h ^ ts^nnoy system to fans outside                       the ground,          to the

effect     that   the     crowd               u s h i n g towards     the turnstiles,           and w ould

they    stop doing        so - they would all               get     through.          It would appear            this

had no effect          on the        crowd,    as mss-5agsX^continued to be                    passed over            the

^ a l m o ^ s ^ s t e m . I could       in fact    see fans         pushi ng^towar ds the             turnstiles

and the side          g a t e . As    this was happening,                 fans    begatv to climb over

the wa 11                i\ th e t u.r n s 1 1 1 e s and were met           by officer^        inside.         After

a short w hTTeT^St-R^J n s p e c t o r ( I do not know his                         name),    climbed          up on

top of a turnstile              building and           1e a M ^ o y e r    the    top of the wall, where

they were      climbing         up,     and    began    helping       some       over. There was
                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                     £>855

    obv i o u s l y a large amount              of    people at the             front,        near to the

    turnst iles          being    crushed up aga i ns                        wa 11 s , a l t h o u g h    I c o u l d n ’t

    see them       becaui^^of my              position.       What    I could see was               thro u g h a small

    crack     in the       corrugated sheet i'Hg^at the                      top of the s t a i r s and            through

    windows at           the back       of the       buffet    bar.



    I began to get             some     idea of what was             happening           outside,        when,      it

    must    have     been towards about 2 . 5 0 pm fans                       began      coming      in saying,           "It’

    Fuck i n g    Hell     out there,          y o u ’ll have    to do something                 people are

    getting       crushed." At this              time     the gate           in question was still                 closed.

    I believe        the gate must             have    been opened            shortly after              this and        the

    crowd swelled             in through the opening.                 People           began    running through
h
    a nd p u s h i n g    everyone       in front       of them towards                 the    stand.      The y then

    ran up the           stairs      towards     us,    a lot of them               in a very angry state,

    shouting       and swearing           because       they h a d n ’t been             let    in earlier.

    S h o r t l y after       this    I saw that        the gate had been shut a gain and                            fans

    were    again being           let    in more       gradually and              certainly under              control.

    I also       saw that        the gate at          the bo11om of the stairs                     on that        side of

    the    stand where           the gate was          being m o n i t o r e d         by ground stewards                and

    I think a Police              officer.', It was           in fact         shut about         this time,

    effectivley           leaving       only myself and Police C o nstable P a r k i n                          in the

    concourse area,              though t hersKwere            other         of/fcers at the              front    of
                                               X.
    the    upstairs        stand.       The    general     Reeling           of the most of the fans at

    this    sstage was           pretty ugly and angry.                 Staff,          mostly young          girls,

    b ehind the          counter      of the     buffVt bar e x p ressed the feeling that

    they>-«u^re very f r i g h t e n e d bv what, they                  could see happening                   below

    them    outside        the ground,          and were       scaredV tVr             their    safety.        J. went       up

    to the       top of the entranee/gateto^y about -ST.QOprn to 'see that                                      quite a

    number       of / a n s    had by now        in fact got                   o t h e p i t c h , presumably
                                                                      s'.'
    over    the fencing,             and officers were           trying
                                                                  fy              to    control      the\matter. I
           veral      fans    lying       on    the    grass      arhd e v e n    so,    the   match     had    kicked

 off.    Shortly after             this an officer went                  onto     the    pit>ch and held his

 hand up towards             the    players          in an obvious          effort       to stop the m a t c h ,

 ihis was met          by loud boos and general                      rowdy disapproval             by the

 majority       of spectators,             certainly          in the L e p pings Lane             stand.       At    this

 time    I saw officers and St.                      John A m bulance         people      gesturing at          the

 fans    in the standing area                   below us to move              back and         relieve    pressure

 on those at          the front.          Their actions            were     those       of being desperate.

 I was     not aware         of any dead at this                  stage.     However,          I did see some

 p e o p 1 e b e i n g car r i e d off         the    pitch with obvious                vUeg injuries?         their

 legs    being       strapped together with bandages.

 About     this      time,    two     people were            carried back          to the       concourse       area

 from the       front    of the up stairs.                   I do not know             if they had been handed

 up from downstairs                or not.       The     upstairs area was               pa\ked solid,          people

 sitting      on the steps           between s's^ats^ and along                    the    front,    in front          of

^the    seats.      Being'"©»qe of the F o r c e ’s First Aid Team and a qua! if ied

 I n s t r u c t o r , I went      to T h e ,two p e o p l e who          had been brought             out,     to help

  hem    in any way          I could.          Both of them were              unconscious,         but

 breathing.         They wexe        initially           placed      in the       recovery       position.          I then

 was    joined       by Police C o n stable £167 Frost and                         together with this

 officer,       carried the          female,          now se m i - c o n s c i o u s    person,    outside          the

 ground beside          the gate          in question.            I was     still       unaware    that any          person

 had been killed,            but there were a p p r o x i m a t e l y a dozen bodies                       laid out

 beside     the gate,         but    leaving          room for       vehicles,          ambulances       to just

 get    through.      These        bodies were           covered over with               coats,    blankets

 etc.,    But       initially,       it still          d i d n ’t hit me         they were      dead.     I passed

about      in between about               two dozen other              people who were            laid out,          but

 o b v i o u s l y alive,     placing          one    female who was             o b v iously having       great

 diff i c u l t y   breathing and who was                   laid down.           I raised her up and                got a

 civilian to support                her    in this         position.        It was       obvious    she had          ribs
                                                                                                    P A tat.
                                                                                                    S S35

broken,     but      in that       position her breathing              became    easier.    The    female

I had helped to carry out                   I found to be an asthmatic              and also       had

rib fractures,             still    unconscious        but s t i 11 b r e a t h i n g . Several    more

were    unconscious and             I placed     in the     recoveryNpsition.            One thing           was

apparent,       I    saw no one with open wounds,                 mai n l y   crush type     injuries.

/Vriburances        then started to arrive,               very s t e a d i l y and access was           not

made    easy by fans          now starting        to    leave    the stand.       Quite a few more

injured were          now being       brought     out and       it was       then that    I went    to the

bod i e s t hat      we re covere d o ver,          epe c t i ng t o be ab 1 e t o he Ip t hem ,

check    their       breathing, turn them into the                 recovery      position etc.,              but

I then saw that at that                   point we had about a dozen dead bodies                    there.

Other    people such as             nurses and      in particular            a doctor    then g r adually

arrived.      The     doctor       took   overall      charge    of the s i tuation        in w h i c h

casualties          were    t r a n s p o r t e d by ambulances,       the dead being       left    till

last.    Fans       leaving       the stand were        gen e r a l l y abusive,    shouting

obscene      comment        towards       officers,     even those       engaged    in tending          to

casualties,          laying       the blame at our dcvo r . At this              point    I was

involved with          resus c i t a t i o n of three        casualties        together wit h      cardiac

massage.      This was a s s i s t e d       initially by Police C o n stable 316{? Pears,                         1

El'    then by a para-medic                type a m b u l an c e m a n and a doctor,       until    he was

then^taT?r&jpu to h o s p i t a l X b y ^ a m b u I a n c a . I was    then directed       by an

Inspector       to take a group of doctors who                     had just arrived,            to the

gyinnasiurn. T h is 1 did,            and on arrival          there saw that        it was       full     of

bodies,      some dead some alive.               A m bulance     personnel       were    busy    carrying

in more     casualties,            and taking     other     ones      out.    Various    doctors,

nurses were          busy treating          those alive.        Gradually       the exchange       of

those    dead,       those alive ar.fj*sssreated was             completed,       until    I believe

94\ bodies were laid out in the      <;~a11 ,with a Police Officer.                                 I

            brought        in and wheels were       being       put    in motion.     In the      property

            brought        in, were    some   identifying       the owners,        and a p p r o x i m a t e l y

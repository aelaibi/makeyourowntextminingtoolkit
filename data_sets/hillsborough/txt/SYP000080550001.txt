            At 3.15 pm (0315)        on Saturday,   15th April    1989 (150489), I was on

            motor   patrol duty,      covering the A1 main trunk         road, working 8.00 x 8.

            00 pm (0800)     x (2000) when I received a radio message to attend

            immediately at the Hillsborough football             stadium and report at the

            main gate on Penistone Rd.           I arrived at 3.30       (1530) and was

            instructed to cover the traffic lights on Penistone Rd,                the City

            Centre side of the football stadium.              This duty involved clearing

            vehicles away from the roads next to the ground and allowing                  room for

            the emergency services          to get through.

            After a short while the football          crowds were       let out of the ground.

            There attitude was very aggressive,             from both lots of supporters.

            1 was there about 2 hours before          resuming normal duty.

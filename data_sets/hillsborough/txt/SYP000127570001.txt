            On Saturday 15 April          1989 (150489)    I went to the Hillsborough

            Football    ground for the match between Liverpool             and Nottingham

            Forest,      I am a Liverpool      supporter and travelled to the ground

            in my own car.        I am a     season ticket holder and obtained my

            ticket from Anfield-           I paid   6 for a standing area in Leppings

            Lane.      I travelled with my son                 who is 16 years old.

                                                          Walton,   Liverpool and

            who can be contacted at the same address.

            I travelled directly to the g a m e , not stopping for any

            purpose.        As we left the end of the M602 at Manchester to join

            the A57 we were caught          in heavy traffic due to road works.          We

            were     caught in this jam for approximately twenty minutes.               We

            were then subject to further delays to the ground due to the

            heavy volume of traffic*          prior to arriving at the ground-          I
                                                                                    PAGE


d i d n ’t see any supporter consuming alcohol.

I arrived in Sheffield at about 2.25 pm.              I parked my car on

the entrance drive to Gallaghers Tabacco Factory,                  I don't know

the name of the road which this is on.             I did not receive or

see any Police direction or escort from any Police officers

from my arrival     point to the ground.        There seemed to be a big

Police presence away from the ground standing by shops and pubs,

  On route to the ground I saw no disorder,               fighting or

drunkeness «

We arrived at the ground at about 2.40 pm (1440).                  As soon as

we arrived at     the ground we immediately came involved in a mass

of people,     not an organised queue,       who were all stood still.          I

asked one Policewoman on horseback the direction to B turnstile

and she just pointed to the mass and said             ’over t h e r e ’.   I saw

no stewards at all near the turnstiles due to the mass of

people some three to four thousand,           I was not able to find our

official entry point.        We entered through a main gate,             not

through a turnstile and were just carried through with the mass

of the crowd,     As I say we did not go through a turnstile we

entered through a main folding gate which led directly to a

tunnel   I d i d n ’t see the turnstile gates open the only gate I

saw open was the gate        I entered through I did not see this gate

or any other gates being opened at all,            I didn't witness any

unauthorised entry into the ground all           I saw was people

climbing up over the fences and walls at the sides to avoid

the crush outside the ground.         No person asked for my ticket,

and I have two tickets       in my possession that of my sons and

my own ticket,     numbers            ( E x h i b i t _______Ref           ),

and ticket number                 (Exhibit          Ref              )

Once   inside the ground I did not see any signs directing me to my
                                                                                         PAGE


match veM/ i ng       point.   I   M/asnot   able to find     my v i e w i n g point,   due to

the mass   crowd,        due to    the crowd Iwas carried through            into the

tunnel with my son which led down to the stand directly behind the

goal on the Leppings Lane End.                 In the tunnel     I became separated from

my two friends and remaind just with my son.                     There was free passage

along the tunnel,          there was no Police         control   evident at this point

in the ground at all.              I did not see any stewards whatsoever as we

entered or exited from             the tunnel.        Between the time     I entered the

tunnel and to the time             I got to my position that         I was forced to take

on the stand I did not witness any disorder or any other incidents.

In the ground I saw no person consuming alcohol,                    it M/as physically

imposs ible for people to dr i nk be cause as soon as we entered the

stand we became hemmed in immediately.                   As soon as I entered the

stand I took up the position which I would roughly say would be on

your grid in the area of G4.                 I was stood with my son who was about

two foot away from me just separated by one person between us.

         /as stood at the end of a barrier.                 Due to the confusion of

the whole crowd I did not see a barrier break.                     I became     concerned

for           and turned to make sure he M/as alright.                   I w a s n ’t able to

fully turn around but I was able to see that                             was facing

towards the tunnel.            He was in some distress and up against a barrier

All   I know is that ________thought h e ’d broken his leg on the support

of the barrier a s he M/as pushed around.                 I would have got into the

stand at about 2.55 pm (1455) as soon as we got into the stand and

became   involved in an excessive crush.                 It M/as too late to get out of

the crush.        I     became frightened as I was unable to move at all                  I was

trapped there.           I M/as stood as I say M/ith my son, at no point M/hilst

I was in the stand did I witness any fighting or disturbance.                            I was

just aM/are of people shouting and screaming in distress.                       I M/as

directly in the middle of the                 large   crush which started as soon as
                                                                               PAGE

c

    we    entered the stand,   within minutes of this people were      climbing

    over the fence trying to get out of the crush.           There was one

    Policeman stood at the gate at the front by the pitch,           by his actions

    he appeared to be looking in to the crowd and waving to the people to

    get away from the fence.       I could see that people at the front were

    being crushed up to the fence and were in great distress.

    Although people were able to climb over the fence these were not

    people against the fence as it was physically impossible for them to

    climb out it was people who were behind them who were climbing over

    the people at the front.       The people who climbed over the fence went

    to the gate where the Policeman was stood and although I d i d n ’t see I

    believe    it was them that was responsible for the gate being opened*

    All    I can say about the Policeman is that his head was completely

    bald as I saw when his hat was knocked off later.

    When the gate was eventually opened a few people who were directly by

    it managed to get out but the rest getting out seemed to be a very

    slow process.     The w h o l e mass of people   in the stand seemed to surge

    forward towards the gate.       We only moved only about a foot.         At that

            H managed to get himself away from the barrier and I was able

    to take hold of him.       By this time a lot of people were climbing

    over the fence.     There was about 200 on the pitch and I think at

    this time the game itself came to a halt.          Behind me people from

    the stand were being lifted up into the seated stand behind.

    There was two Police officers stood at the front of the seating

    stand they were certainly doing nothing.          They d i d n ’t appear to be

    using any radios or helping anybody in any way.           As a result of

    being involved in a crush I received bruising to my groin and

    thighs,    my son also received torn thigh and groin muscles.         I d i d n ’t

    receive hospital treatment      in Sheffield nor did my son.       The

    next day my son
Liverpool.       I did not directly witness      that    I was aware of

although    I didn't assist I was aware of a body of a man wearing

black pants      in his tM/enties being passed over peoples heads

towards the pitch.         The only reason for the deaths of people          in

the stand was      pushing from behind and the restrictions of the

tunnel so they couldn’t go back.         I left the ground at about 3.25

pm . (1525)*     This was after seeing the body of a small            boy wearing

a red shirt being lifted from the ground immediately by the small

gate leading      into the pitch.    When we did leave it was not on the

direction of a Police officer or Steward.               It was my own decision.

 I was assisted by an unknown man and we just followed him out.

I d i d n ’t witness anything that I consider to be a criminal

offence.       The whole   incident seemed to be handled in total utter

confusion.       I saw no Stewards trying to assist as we were            leaving

through the tunnel.         1 saw three Police officers       one a

Policewoman just stood taking no action.

They were not directing or assisting           people    in anyway.They d i d n ’t

seem to have radios.

They did not seem to be making any efforts to be informing anyone

of what was happening.         I feel there    is a total    lack of Police

involvement directly outside the gate prior to the game starting.

They had lost control of the mass of people they were making no

effort to regain control.         They seemed to be a lot of officers

more concerned away from the ground.            Once    I had managed to

leave the stand there seemed to be a long delay in the arrival

of Police Officers and ambulances.            There was only one ambulance

with two    crew members who c ou l d n ’t cope with the number of

people,    they were doing their best.         The few Police Officers

that did arrive at the back of the ground arrived too late.

The bodies were already laid out at the back of the ground.

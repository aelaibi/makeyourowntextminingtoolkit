from your constituent M r f          of
                                       Melton

Baseball Ground earlier this year.  He has read
Mr          comments with interest, and will
take them into account in his Inquiry.

                                Yours sincerely




                             R M WHALLEY

I enclose a letter which I have recently
               111 /                      a. *j_   â€¢   |

       of
               \ Melton Mowbray, Leics.
It seemed to me that this was relevant to
your enquiry as Mr.       ^ strongly believes
that the dangers at Hillsborough may not have
been unique to that particular ground and
game.

                    I in fact            a t t e n d e d t o g ether w i t h some                          friends.

                    The     point         I wanted                    to    make    was    that       exactly        the    same       thing     very       nearly

                    happened           on         that        occasion             when     I was          crushed    prior       to     entering          the

                    turnstiles              Leppings                   Lane       end    and    had        considerable       difficulty              getting

                     into    the       ground.                  When         I    got    into     the       ground    I walked           along       the    tunnej
        and    went        to     ay    right          at    the       end       into       Pen    thrse,          .It     was       nearly        kick

        off    time        by. n o w        and    I    really          had       to    push       to    get       into        it.        I managed

        to    work     my       way     about          two    thirds             of    the    way       into./the          Pen       and    ended          up

        on    the     last        barrier          before          the       pitch..          It    was       crushed           more       than       a

        normal        football              game       but    tolerable,                however          Spurs        scored          a b o u t 't h r e e

        or    four     minutes              into       the    game          at    tne       fa-    end     <SPION          H O P >.        This       caused

        the    crowd         to       cheer       and       people          to    rush       into       the    Pens        and       I was       then

        really        crushed,               I    lost       my    footing             and    there        were       a    lot       of    people

        around        ms     extremely             distressed,                    I    had    to    hang       onto        a    little          boy       who

        had    got     lost           from       his    father.

        The    crush         caused          me    to       move       forward          towards          the       gates,            I was       still

        holding        the        little          boy.,       When          I got       to    the       gate       several           of    us    shouted

        to    the     Police           and       Stewards          to       open       it.        People       were        passing          out       and

        having        difficulty                 breathing,             people          were       getting           hysterical,                s h ou t ing

        and    screaming.

        The    game        had        just       kicked       off       again          after       the     goal       when       a    senior          Police

        Officer        obviously                 realised          what          was    happening             so     he    authorised              the

        gate     to    foe      opened           causing          us    to       spill       out    onto       the        apron       of    the       pitch,

        the    Police           then        allowed          at    least          250       fans    out       of     the       Pen    to    relieve

        the    pressure               and    escorted             them       to       the    SPION       HOP       end     where          there       was

        more     room,            A    lot       more       fans       were       allowed          to    stay        sitting          outside             the

        Pens     on    the        pitch.

        On    this     occasion              St.       Johns       Ambulance                had    to    become           involved          reviving

        mostly        women           who    had       passed          out       in    the    crush,

        I    suppose         what       I was          trying          to    say       was    why       w a s n ’t    the        lessonlearnt                   in

        ■1981,        The--incident                a t -H i l l s b o r o u g h         made       me    re 1 i v s         m y e x p e r i e n c e s of

        1981     and       me     realise          how       lucky          I was       then.

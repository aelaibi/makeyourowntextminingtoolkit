COST OF IMPLEMENTING LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS FOR
FOOTBALL GROUND IMPROVEMENTS

Thank you for sending me so promptly the results of the Football
League's survey into the cost and methodology of implementing
Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations.

In view of the very helpful but summary nature of the information
and the inevitable risk of inconsistencies between clubs in how
they have estimated these implementation costs, it would be
useful if you could provide me with some further information.  In
particular it would be helpful to have information on the
following.

First, does the difference between the costings for questions 2
and 3 mean that some of the Taylor requirements will not be
implemented or that clubs are not able to do all they, would like
but are not required to?

Secondly, is there a breakdown available of what those clubs who
have responded plan to do in response to Taylor as estimated in
reply to question 3?   In particular do we know which clubs plan
to redevelop their clubs and which clubs plan to re-locate?

Naturally any   information     you   provide   would   be   treated    in
confidence.

I look forward to hearing from you.

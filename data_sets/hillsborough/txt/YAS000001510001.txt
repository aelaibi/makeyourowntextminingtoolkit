       1.   I am employed as a Control Assistant for SYMAS.


       2.   My date of birth is 21st July 1967.



       3.   I have been with SYMAS since May 1988.              Prior to that I was
            employed as a switchboard operator for BritishTelecom.



       4.   I was off duty on 15th April 1989.           I received a telephone
            call from                  one of the Control Assistants at about
            1545.   She said that there was a major incident and asked if
            I could come into work.       This was the first that I had heard
            of an incident at Hillsborough.



       5.   As a result of various delays I did not arrive at work until
            1720,   when I went on duty at Control.              I stayed on duty

            until   2130   and   was   fairly    busy   most    of   the   time.   I

            principally    dealt   with   the    arrangements    for   transferring

            patients from the Northern General to the Royal Hallamshire

            Hospital for scans as well as the "routine" emergencies.


       Dated this   3   day of M. Cu j ^ 1989.

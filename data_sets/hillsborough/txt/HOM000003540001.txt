     Thank you for your letter of 14 October to Virginia Bottomley enclosing one from
     solicitors E Rex Makin & Co. of Whitechapel, Liverpool LI 1HQ about the gase of
     Hillsborough victim Andrew Devine. I have been asked to reply.

     I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but as you know we did not originally
     have the full set of papers on the case.

     Having considered the full submission, it appears that the point at issue which E Rex
     Makin & Co. is pursuing on behalf of the Devine family is the administration and use of
     the Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Fund. This is properly a matter for the Home Office,
     not the Department of Health, and I am forwarding the correspondence to them.

     I hope this is helpful.

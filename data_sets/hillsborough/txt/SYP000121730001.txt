               g r o u n d on 9th April              1988    (090488)       I report as follows.

               s e a r c h e d fans after            they    had come       thro u g h the gate.

               A    police        cordon had been set up outside                    the gate and was          controlling

               outside          of the       ground.

               Most       of the       fans     e n t ering were good          h u m oured    but a few were

               aggressive            towards        us,    ma i n l y as they o b j ected to being           searched.

               Several          fans     did get      through with o u t       tickets       but were     immedi a t e l y

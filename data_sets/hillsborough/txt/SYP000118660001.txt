             this    has got to be the                  'Music Hall        joke of the y e a r *, because one

             I certainly did not get one and                           I have        checked with P o l i c e C o nstable

            W hen you ask the              Inspector who deals w i t h football                       for    intelligence

            for the two L i v erpool               clubs,        the    reply you get every time                  is "WE DON'T

            honest,        *he did not want               to know us*,          and     I had all      on gett ing         out of

            him some        copies       of e x p i r e d E x c l u s i o n Orders         in order      that     I would

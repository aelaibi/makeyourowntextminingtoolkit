                 privately organised one and we travelled in                                     car,    leaving

          one hour.        I did not see anyone drinking as                     we travelled towards

          Sheffield where we               arrived at about £.35 pm (1435).

          Because of the delay caused by the roadworks we actually turned off

          and headed towards Sheffield on the Stockport Rd, arriving                             in

          Sheffield from the opposite side of the town.                          We parked     our car in a

          road near the town               centre, Bedford R d . , and took a taxi the rest of

          the way.     As we neared the ground I did not see any disorder,

          drunkeness or fighting of any sort by anyone, arriving at the ground

          at about 2.>5 pm (1445).

          Having arrived in Leppings Ln I could see massey'of                           people approaching

          the tu r n^ Ti le s.      There are blue gates bef ore ^£he Lef'rnst i 1es and the

          trowdy^as    right back to it.                      I would say there/was 'queues but not

          orderly.     We waited in Leppings Ln deciding “now we should enter the
fOL
          ground.     There were           police           in the aj^a about five or si;< mounted

          police who were trying to get supporters to wait and queue                             in an

          orderly fashion.               One of the^e horses, whose              rider had a moustache,

          turned facing the ground and people were gelling kicked by the horses.

          After a short time we had made our wayyaflong towards a wall by the

          river when a policeman called that Jfhe gate was open.
GfATEc'
          Crowds from the back as well asy^urselves got through this gate.                               I

•si       remember people from the apparent queues were getting past the railing

          to go through the gate.                    I saw a boy passed over the heads of the

          crowd.     I think he had been hurt.                      I cannot    recall seeing any ground

          stewards by the turnstiles but I did see a couple of police officers

          and stewards by the gate as we were let in.                           I did not show my ticket.

          I did not see who opened it.I have                        in fact been to this ground on

          several    occasions so I knewwhere to go.                      So,   having gone through the

          gate with the others, we made our wa^, as before,                           towards the tunnel.

          become separated from my son in the Leppings Ln area.                              As we made our

         way through the tunnel       I did not see any^fSolice or stewards and

         although the tunnel was fairly full we moved along it steadily.                   There

         was no trouble at this point that f was aware of and I did not see

         rfiyone drinking.When we got to the end of the t u n m ^ the game was due

         to start,    that wduld be at about 2.58 pm (1 4 5 8 * a n d    took up my initial

         viewing    position a couple of yards down the terracing a little bit in

         from the/fence.        I was still with my two friends.

         Almost as soon as we had taken up our position the pushing             and shoving

         started.     We    were packed in like sardines and Iended up being         pushed

         sideways and forward to about          10 feet from the front of the compound

         and roughly the same from the side fence to my right.             My friends were

         holding onto       me so I wouldn't get lost.

         As we got to       that position I remember a big man       having his arm in

         front of my neck.        I thought he was trying to get out over me.           He was

         choking me so I bit his arm.           He also,   before that, was banging me on

         the head.     I'd already asked him to stop I suppose he may have been

         panicking.        Just to my left I saw a young      lad to my left and a little

         in front.     His face was all     blue.     I didn't know if he way'dead or

         what.     At about that time there was another          push and I^^ent to my left

         managed to get        me to my feet.    He had a Liverpool shirt on.

         Someone helped me towards the          back of the^compound and I ended      up

         against the wall where        I got my breath iiack.     After a couple of

         minutes    I asked some     other fans     to h/l p me to the tunnel where I

         struggled past        other people.    I dam't know what   it was like in    there    I

         was too dazed.        When I got out jf sat by the turnstiles until      I got my

         breath back.        I was bleeding / r o m the mouth.     I think where the man

         had hit me with his arm,              ribs were hurting from the crush of the

            I had become separated from my friends so I waited for them outside.

            I was eventually found by                  .   About   10 to 15 minutes   later

            my son turned up.    It wasn't until about 6.30 pm (1S30) that we found

                          at the hospital.    He had been waiting for me there,

            thinking that I'd been injured.

            When   it all started I recall some injured people being passed over the

            heads of the crowd towards the gate and being passed out.         The gate

            was then shut again.    I remember a steward shouting "Get back,      get



            We got home that night somehwere about         pm (2200).

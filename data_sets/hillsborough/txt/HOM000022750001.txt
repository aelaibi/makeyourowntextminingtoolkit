TECHNICAL WORKING PARTY

JNOTE OF A MEETING HELD IN ROOM 749 THE HOME OFFICE QUEEN ANNE'S
•GATE ON TUESDAY 7 NOVEMBER AT 10.30AM


Present:   Professor L Maunder       (Chairman)
           Mr N Bush
           Mr W Carter
           Mr M Dickson
           Dr C Nicholson
           Mr B Stickley
           Mr J Sweet                (Secretary)


                                                       Action


1.   Professor Maunder welcomed the Working Party
members and confirmed that the meeting would use
the agenda for WP(89) 2nd meeting as the basis for
discussion.


Minutes of Previous Meeting


2.   The minutes of the meeting on Thursday 2
November were agreed subject to the following:


      i.   Paragraph 23 - perimeter fencing.
           Although not raised at the previous
           meeting, useful information might be
           gleaned from the Scottish experience,
           where few clubs had perimeter fencing.
           There was a general consensus that, if
           such fencing was to remain, a review of
           design was essential.   The 'high-
           security' type fencing formerly favoured
           by a number of clubs was regarded by
           Working Party members as unsatisfactory;
           some divide between players and
           spectators was probably necessary, but it
           ought not to be an impermeable barrier.
                                                 Action


Paragraph   10 - "defects" should replace
"exit signs"    in line 10.


Paragraph   16 -although agreeing with the
principle   of a 'step-down' to a greatly
reduced density, Mr Bush would only be
prepared to see acceptance of barriers
marginally outside existing standards on
terraces of shallow depth.


Paragraph 27 - after discussion, it was
agreed that the definition of the loading
test described in Annex C of the Green
Guide needed further refinement.      It was
essential to avoid misunderstanding as to
what constituted "a test".    After
detailed discussion, it was agreed that
the following procedure offered a
suitable framework.    There should be one
preliminary load to act as a "shake-
down" test followed by one principal
load.   All deflection and recoveries were
to be measured, and comparisons made with
previous tests and other barriers on the
same terrace.    The Working Party would
need to give consideration to the level
of load on the 'shake-down' test - should
it be 50% of the working load, for
example? - arid to ensuring
standardisation of recording procedure.
Consideration would also need to be given
to the number of loading increments, as
recorded in paragraph 26 of WP(89)M2.       It
was agreed the Dr Nicholson/Mr Dickson           Nicholson/
would report back further at the next            Dickson
meeting with a draft form of words.
                                                         Action


3.   It was recognised that the whole question of
barrier testing was fraught, in the light of
■Hillsborough, with political connotations.    This
applied equally to new barriers as it did to old,
since any recommendation to reduce testing would be
politically sensitive, and arguments to do so would
need to be overwhelming.     Although the building
regulations approach offered a rationale for
ceasing to test new barriers (where new meant a
properly authorised design of barrier in prime
condition and with design figures authenticated),
nonetheless, it was not entirely analogous.     Unlike
the testing of buildings, testing of barriers was a
comparatively simple and straightforward process,
on a modest physical scale.     Where the testing
process was perhaps unsatisfactory was in its
approach to the percentage of barriers to be
tested, and the application of that percentage by
clubs.    Testing 25% of the barriers in any one year
meant usually that both new and old barriers were
tested;   what was needed was a means of
concentrating testing on the older barriers,
thereby targetting the application of the testing
process more effectively.


4.   It was accepted that any perceived relaxation
in the mechanical criteria for testing would need
to be countered by a tightening of the inspection
process generally.   Working Party members agreed
that inspection had to     play a substantially larger
role, and that Chapter 4 of the Green Guide would
need redrafting to emphasise the underlying
objectives.   Members would give further thought to      All
a revised format.                                        Members
                                                       Action



Review of Flows


5.   The previous meeting had given some
consideration to this topic and Mr Bush continued
his examination of the issues.


6.   It was accepted that the maximum notional flow
rate per turnstile of 750 persons per hour set out
in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide was too high.
Clearly much depended on the age, type and
mechanical soundness of each turnstile, on the
effectiveness of individual turnstile operators and
on whether a match was all-ticket, or had a simple
cash figure for entry (eg £5 as opposed to £3.60).
Nevertheless, informal research carried out by Mr
Bush at Anfield and Everton and by Dr Nicholson
following Hillsborough suggested that a more
realistic maximum figure was in the region of 660
per hour.   The suggestion that a figure of 500
persons per hour be regarded as the mean and that
variations either up or down be certified by the
local authority was left open for further              All
discussion at the next meeting.                        Members


7.   The paper on ingress presented by Mr Bush at
the last meeting (already circulated) suggested
four additional clauses for inclusion in Chapter 5
of the Green Guide.    These related to a) amenities
inside the ground;    b) subdivision of enclosures;
c) number of entrances to large enclosures and d)
greater care in the design of entrances so as to
avoid local pressure on spectators by particular
attention to matters such as downward ramps.      It
was felt that much useful information in the
chapter on egress was also relevant when dealing
with ingress and that the Green Guide therefore
                                                         Action


needed expansion to reflect this.     Whether it would
be possible in all circumstances to comply with any
'ideal type' was unlikely;     nonetheless the
important principles about design should be
reinforced in the Guide.     It was agreed that the
informative diagrams in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the
Guide should be adapted, additionally, for
inclusion in Chapter 5 on ingress.


8.   There were definitional problems when talking
about "large enclosures" and "adequate number".
Thought was given to the possibility of laying down
an engineering method to establish the relationship
between the number of entrances to an enclosure and
its capacity.     There were two aspects, the first
being the overall capacity of the entrances to an
enclosure to cope with the flow of spectators
emerging through outer turnstiles, and the second
being the distribution of entrances to a particular
enclosure so as to facilitate even packing.      There
were a number of unique factors affecting flow
rates on ingress which did not affect egress,
including the speed of flow through turnstiles,
individuals deciding to stand at particular points
(eg behind the goal) and the location of
refreshment stalls which might produce bunching of
spectators.     After discussion, it was accepted that
although it might be difficult to quantify these
features numerically, the general principles on
ingress to enclosures should be emphasised,
including where appropriate suitable references to
stewarding and gangways.


9.   Research carried out by Professor D Canter on
human behaviour in fire situations might offer some
useful insights, and it was therefore agreed that
                                                         Action


copies of his research paper be distributed to all
Working Party members.   (Studies of Human Behaviour     Sweet
in Fire: empirical results and their implications
for education and design - to follow).


Egress


10.   Chapter 6 of the Green Guide needed to be
cross-referenced with Chapter 11 which, although
having an unduly narrow 'fire' perspective,
nonetheless contained some useful advice.     Although
it was recognised that the fire authority was a
powerful body, Working Party members believed that
consultation on all safety matters should be with
the certifying authority, who, in turn, would
consult with the fire authority.   It was essential
to maintain simple, clear lines of authority and
communication;   independent input from individual
bodies was to be avoided.


11.   A number of particular issues on egress
emerged in discussion.   There was some doubt as to
whether the advice in paragraph 50 of the Green
Guide on restricting the speed of egress at
bottlenecks remained valid.   Differing views
emerged, but it was accepted generally that the
principle of keeping the bottleneck outside an exit
route (eg back on the terrace) rather than in the
exit route (eg the tunnel) was right.


12.   Paragraph 53 - evacuation onto the pitch.
Evacuation onto the pitch should never be
considered as part of the normal egress system.
Although it was recognised that such evacuation
might well occur in an emergency, the pitch should
not be considered when working out egress times.
                                                         Action


13.   Paragraph 51 - it was agreed that this needed
qualification by reference to the exit times in
paragraph 56.                                            Bush


14.   Paragraph 54 - it was agreed (i) that the
first sentence would be more appropriately sited if
it appeared in paragraph 50 and (ii) that the
density of 54 per 10 sq metres was too high for
reservoir areas.   A lower density, in the region of
35-40 persons, was required, and it was agreed that
the Inquiry would seek Professor Canter's views on       Maunder/
an appropriate figure.                                   Sweet


15.   Consideration was given to the possible
amalgamation of features common to both ingress and
egress, such as signposting, but it was recognised
that there was comparatively little common ground
and that emphases might well differ.


16.   Working Party members agreed that the current
Green Guide contained insufficient information on
emergency lighting, and that the information it did
contain was inappropriately placed in Chapter 11.
The emphasis on 'emergency' lighting was wrong;     it
should more accurately be considered as 'auxiliary'
lighting and the Guide should have a separate
chapter on the subject.   That chapter should
explain in greater detail why the figure of 3 hours
(currently in paragraph 167) had been chosen -
Working Party members understood that the figure
had its origins in public entertainment licences.


17.   Paragraph 60 was superfluous, and the Working
Party agreed to recommend its removal.
                                                          Action


18.   Paragraph 61 on exit systems was an important
one but placed too much emphasis on routine egress
-and attached too little weight to the problems of
emergency evacuation.     What was required, both in
the general introduction to the Chapter and in this
particular paragraph was greater emphasis on
analysis of emergency networking of routes.      It was
agreed that Mr Bush would give more detailed
consideration to emergency/fire/network analyses
and their presentation in the Guide.                      Bush


Chapter 7 - Stairways and ramps


19*   Paragraph 73 - Discussion centred on the
possibility of aligning these figures more closely
with those quoted in the Buildings Regulations 1985
approved document K on stairways and ramps.      On
balance, it was felt that the building regulation
figures might restrict flexibility, and it was
therefore agreed that the figures currently shown
could remain.   However, there was general
recognition that sharper presentation would be
helpful.                                                  Bush


20.   Paragraph 74 - Much discussion was given over
to the contents of this paragraph.     Some members
felt strongly that 'winders' was an unacceptably
loose definition, and that the Guide would benefit
from greater precision;    the preferred term was
'tapered treads'.   It was agreed to adopt this
term.


21.   The figure of 16 steps in paragraph 74 (ii)
was the subject of considerable debate, with some
members favouring a reduction to 12 consistent with
74 (iii) on cascade staircases.    On balance,
though, it was felt unwise to depart from existing
                                                         Action


figures without very good reason.     The figure of 16
would therefore remain.     Paragraph 74 (iii) was
deemed acceptable.


22.   The Working Party noted and accepted the
suggestion in Mr Bush's paper to introduce an
additional clarificatory sentence into paragraph
75.


23.   More contentious was the question of
handrails, regarded by many, it was felt, as an
easy panacea for a multitude of sins.     After
considerable debate, and a recognition that the
fire service view would need to be obtained, it was
agreed that the Working Party would recommend a
width between handrails lower than 1.8 metres, and
probably either 1.1metres or 1.5 metres.     The views
of the fire service would be sought and the matter       Stickley
tabled for discussion at the next meeting.               Sweet


24.   The extension of handrails for 300mm before
the first step at the head of a stairway to at
least 300mm beyond the last step at the bottom of a
stairway, and the whole question of 'protection'
were areas requiring further thought.     It was
clear, however, that protection was needed only
when there was a drop, and that Table 2 of Chapter
9 needed amendment so as to refer to "handrails and
protectors ...".     It was agreed the Messrs Bush,      Bush/
Dickson and Nicholson would review all of these          Dickson/
matters further and report back at the next              Nicholson
meeting.


25.   It was agreed that Fig. 1 in paragraph 82 be
amended to specify that 'The width of A and B to be
no less than 1.1m each' and that the word 'Down' be
                                                          Action


removed from the diagram.


26.   Similarly, Fig. 2 in paragraph 84 would be
enhanced by figures giving the size of the wing
barriers, and by the inclusion of an additional
barrier in front of the central arrow facing the
stairway.


27.   The section on ramps was inadequate,
particularly in failing to address separately the
question of disabled access and egress.      Building
regulations specified a gradient no steeper than 1
in 12, and 1 in 10 was probably too steep.        Mr
Stickley agreed to obtain further details of work         Stickley
already carried out by the Sports Council and the
Centre of Environment for the Handicapped.        He
would report back at the next meeting.


28.   It was agreed that Messrs Bush and Carter           Bush/
would look in detail at Chapters 10 and 14 in             Carter
readiness for the next meeting.


Review of Capacities


29.   Consideration had been given by Professor
Maunder to Chapters 8, 11, 12 and 16 of the Green
Guide.     A number of points had emerged including:


      i.     paragraphs 92/93.   The second sentence of
             paragraph 93 should refer to a 'drop',
             not 'rise', since use of the latter
             weakened the first sentence of the
             paragraph;
                                                      Action


 ii.   was the 280-380mm range too wide, and, in
       particular, was the 280mm figure too low?
       Working Party members agreed to give           All
       further thought to the question;               Members


 iii. paragraphs 97/98 needed to be more
       emphatic - "spectators should not ...";


 iv.   similarly, in paragraph 99 spectators
       were to be "instructed";


 v.    were sunken gangways a good idea?     In the
       absence of any firm data on accident
       rates, it was probably acceptable for
       them to remain, although there was
       general consensus that they should be
       painted in their entirety;


 vi.   paragraph 100 ought to refer to gangways
       which were sloped or might, more
       generally, be recast to say that where a
       sunken gangway existed, its profile
       should match that of the rest of the
       terrace.    It was agreed to adopt this
       approach;


 vii. Paragraph 101.     It was agreed that "in an
       emergency" in line 8 should be replaced
       by "except under strict control";


viii. paragraph 102, Professor Maunder's
       suggested addition (see paper already
       circulated) was not without its
       difficulties, since any attempt at
       segregation of sub-divisions would only
       be effective if such segregation was
                                                         Action


            effective all the way back to the
            turnstiles.    It was agreed that the
            matter would be reviewed, once Mr Carter
            had obtained details of the current          Carter
            position at clubs;


      ix    paragraph 106 'desirable' and 'is' were
            to be deleted, and 'should be'
            substituted for the latter.    It was
            agreed to recommend deletion of the final
            sentence;


      x.    paragraph 107 Mr Sticklev felt strongly
            that the barriers on viewing slopes
            should be closer than on normal
            terracing.    It was agreed that he would    Stickley
            review Table 1 (on page 37), and would
            reconsider the acceptability of the
            gradient quoted in paragraph 106;


      xi.   paragraph 108.   There was some suggestion
            of a minimum two metre width for an
            obligatory pitch perimeter path.    Before
            recommending adoption of this, Mr Carter
            undertook to find out the current            Carter
            position at League clubs.


30.   Further consideration needed to be given both
to Chapter 11 (Fire Safety) - should section 4 of
the ISE document be incorporated? - and Chapter 16
(capacity).    The Interim Report had recommended a
15% reduction in capacity, effectively reducing the
permissible maximum density from 54 per 10 sq
metres to approximately 46.      Should that figure
remain, despite some clubs' resentment, or should
                                                         Action


the Working Party recommend a return to the higher
.figure?    Was some longer-term research on packing     All
density now required?                                    Members


31.   In addition, Working Party members would also
need to give thought to the following:


      i.    possible new design of structural
             elements such as fences, gates, barriers
             under the general theme of "design
             considerations";


      ii.    the possible role of the FLA on grounds
             and levels of standardisation;                All
                                                           Members
      iii. provision for the disabled;


      iv.   all-seater stadia;   and


      v.    what should be said about non-football
            stadia?


Date and Place of Next Meeting


31.   It was agreed that the next meeting would take
place on Tuesday 28 November in Queen Anne's Gate
commencing at 10.30am.     Details of the room and
Agenda would be distributed in due course.               Sweet


32.   A further meeting would take place on
Wednesday 13 December in Queen Anne's Gate
commencing at 10.30am.     Again further details would
be available in due course.                              Sweet

NOTE OF A MEETING HELD IN ROOM 749 THE HOME OFFICE QUEEN ANNE'S

1.   Professor Maunder welcomed the Working Party
members and confirmed that the meeting would use
the agenda for WP(89) 2nd meeting as the basis for
discussion.


Minutes of Previous Meeting


2.   The minutes of the meeting on Thursday 2
November were agreed subject to the following:


      i.   Paragraph 23 - perimeter fencing.
           Although not raised at the previous
           meeting, useful information might be
           gleaned from the Scottish experience,
           where few clubs had perimeter fencing.
           There was a general consensus that, if
           such fencing was to remain, a review of
           design was essential.   The 'high-
           security' type fencing formerly favoured
           by a number of clubs was regarded by
           Working Party members as unsatisfactory;
           some divide between players and
           spectators was probably necessary, but it
           ought not to be an impermeable barrier.
                                               Action


Paragraph 10 - "defects" should replace
"exit signs" in line 10.


Paragraph 16 - although agreeing with the
principle of a 'step-down' to a greatly
reduced density, Mr Bush would only be
prepared to see acceptance of barriers
marginally outside existing standards on
terraces of shallow depth.


Paragraph 27 - after discussion, it was
agreed that the definition of the loading
test described in Annex C of the Green
Guide needed further refinement.     It was
essential to avoid misunderstanding as to
what constituted "a test".   After
detailed discussion, it was agreed that
the following procedure offered a
suitable framework.   There should be one
preliminary load to act as a "shake-
down" test followed by one principal
load.   All deflection and recoveries were
to be measured, and comparisons made with
previous tests and other barriers on the
same terrace.   The Working Party would
need to give consideration to the level
of load on the 'shake-down' test - should
it be 50% of the working load, for
example? - and to ensuring
standardisation of recording procedure.
Consideration would also need to be given
to the number of loading increments, as
recorded in paragraph 26 of WP(89)M2.     It
was agreed the Dr Nicholson/Mr Dickson         Nicholson/
would report back further at the next          Dickson
meeting with a draft form of words.

3.   It was recognised that the whole question of
barrier testing was fraught, in the light of
Hillsborough, with political connotations.     This
applied equally to new barriers as it did to old,
since any recommendation to reduce testing would be
politically sensitive, and arguments to do so would
need to be overwhelming.    Although the building
regulations approach offered a rationale for
ceasing to test new barriers (where new meant a
properly authorised design of barrier in prime
condition and with design figures authenticated),
nonetheless, it was not entirely analogous.     Unlike
the testing of buildings, testing of barriers was a
comparatively simple and straightforward process,
on a modest physical scale.    Where the testing
process was perhaps unsatisfactory was in its
approach to the percentage of barriers to be
tested, and the application of that percentage by
clubs.    Testing 25% of the barriers in any one year
meant usually that both new and old barriers were
tested;   what was needed was a means of
concentrating testing on the older barriers,
thereby targetting the application of the testing
process more effectively.


4.   It was accepted that any perceived relaxation
in the mechanical criteria for testing would need
to be countered by a tightening of the inspection
process generally.    Working Party members agreed
that inspection had to     play a substantially larger
role, and that Chapter 4 of the Green Guide would
need redrafting to emphasise the underlying
objectives.    Members would give further thought to     All
a revised format.                                        Members

Review of Flows


5.   The previous meeting had given some
consideration to this topic and Mr Bush continued
his examination of the issues.


6.   It was accepted that the maximum notional flow
rate per turnstile of 750 persons per hour set out
in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide was too high.
Clearly much depended on the age, type and
mechanical soundness of each turnstile, on the
effectiveness of individual turnstile operators and
on whether a match was all-ticket, or had a simple
cash figure for entry (eg £5 as opposed to £3.60).
Nevertheless, informal research carried out by Mr
Bush at Anfield and Everton and by Dr Nicholson
following Hillsborough suggested that a more
realistic maximum figure was in the region of 660
per hour.   The suggestion that a figure of 500
persons per hour be regarded as the mean and that
variations either up or down be certified by the
local authority was left open for further              All
discussion at the next meeting.                        Members


7.   The paper on ingress presented by Mr Bush at
the last meeting (already circulated) suggested
four additional clauses for inclusion in Chapter 5
of the Green Guide.    These related to a) amenities
inside the ground;    b) subdivision of enclosures;
c) number of entrances to large enclosures and d)
greater care in the design of entrances so as to
avoid local pressure on spectators by particular
attention to matters such as downward ramps.      It
was felt that much useful information in the
chapter on egress was also relevant when dealing
with ingress and that the Green Guide therefore
needed expansion to reflect this.     Whether it would
be possible in all circumstances to comply with any
'ideal type' was unlikely;     nonetheless the
important principles about design should be
reinforced in the Guide.     It was agreed that the
informative diagrams in paragraphs 82 and 84 of the
Guide should be adapted, additionally, for
inclusion in Chapter 5 on ingress.


8.   There were definitional problems when talking
about "large enclosures" and "adequate number".
Thought was given to the possibility of laying down
an engineering method to establish the relationship
between the number of entrances to an enclosure and
its capacity.    There were two aspects, the first
being the overall capacity of the entrances to an
enclosure to cope with the flow of spectators
emerging through outer turnstiles, and the second
being the distribution of entrances to a particular
enclosure so as to facilitate even packing.      There
were a number of unique factors affecting flow
rates on ingress which did not affect egress,
including the speed of flow through turnstiles,
individuals deciding to stand at particular points
(eg behind the goal) and the location of
refreshment stalls which might produce bunching of
spectators.     After discussion, it was accepted that
although it might be difficult to quantify these
features numerically, the general principles on
ingress to enclosures should be emphasised,
including where appropriate suitable references to
stewarding and gangways.


9.   Research carried out by Professor D Canter on
human behaviour in fire situations might offer some
useful insights, and it was therefore agreed that
                                                             Action

    in Fire: empirical results and their implications
    for education and design - to follow).


    Egress


    10.   Chapter 6 of the Green Guide needed to be
    cross-referenced with Chapter 11 which, although
    having an unduly narrow 'fire' perspective,
    nonetheless contained some useful advice.     Although
    it was recognised that the fire authority was a
    powerful body, Working Party members believed that
    consultation on all safety matters should be with
    the certifying authority, who, in turn, would
    consult with the fire authority.   It was essential
    to maintain simple, clear lines of authority and
    communication;   independent input from individual
    bodies was to be avoided.


    11.   A number of particular issues on egress
    emerged in discussion.   There was some doubt as to
    whether the advice in paragraph 50 of the Green
    Guide on restricting the speed of egress at
    bottlenecks remained valid.   Differing views
    emerged, but it was accepted generally that the
    principle of keeping the bottleneck outside an exit
    route (eg back on the terrace) rather than in the
    exit route (eg the tunnel) was right.


    12.   Paragraph 53 - evacuation onto the pitch.
    Evacuation onto the pitch should never be
    considered as part of the normal egress system.
    Although it was recognised that such evacuation
    might well occur in an emergency, the pitch should
    not be considered when working out egress times.
                                                         Action


13.   Paragraph 51 - it was agreed that this needed
qualification by reference to the exit times in
paragraph 56.                                            Bush


14.   Paragraph 54 - it was agreed (i) that the
first sentence would be more appropriately sited if
it appeared in paragraph 50 and (ii) that the
density of 54 per 10 sq metres was too high for
reservoir areas.   A lower density, in the region of
35-40 persons, was required, and it was agreed that
the Inquiry would seek Professor Canter's views on       Maunder/
an appropriate figure.                                   Sweet


15.   Consideration was given to the possible
amalgamation of features common to both ingress and
egress, such as signposting, but it was recognised
that there was comparatively little common ground
and that emphases might well differ.


16.   Working Party members agreed that the current
Green Guide contained insufficient information on
emergency lighting, and that the information it did
contain was inappropriately placed in Chapter 11.
The emphasis on 'emergency' lighting was wrong;     it
should more accurately be considered as 'auxiliary'
lighting and the Guide should have a separate
chapter on the subject.   That chapter should
explain in greater detail why the figure of 3 hours
(currently in paragraph 167) had been chosen -
Working Party members understood that the figure
had its origins in public entertainment licences.


17.   Paragraph 60 was superfluous, and the Working
Party agreed to recommend its removal.

18.   Paragraph 61 on exit systems was an important
one but placed too much emphasis on routine egress
and attached too little weight to the problems of
emergency evacuation.     What was required, both in
the general introduction to the Chapter and in this
particular paragraph was greater emphasis on
analysis of emergency networking of routes.       It was
agreed that Mr Bush would give more detailed
consideration to emergency/fire/network analyses
and their presentation in the Guide.                       Bush


Chapter 7 - Stairways and ramps


19.   Paragraph 73 - Discussion centred on the
possibility of aligning these figures more closely
with those quoted in the Buildings Regulations 1985
approved document K on stairways and ramps.       On
balance, it was felt that the building regulation
figures might restrict flexibility, and it was
therefore agreed that the figures currently shown
could remain.   However, there was general
recognition that sharper presentation would be
helpful.                                                   Bush


20.   Paragraph 74 - Much discussion was given over
to the contents of this paragraph.     Some members
felt strongly that 'winders' was an unacceptably
loose definition, and that the Guide would benefit
from greater precision;     the preferred term was
'tapered treads'.   It was agreed to adopt this
term.


21.   The figure of 16 steps in paragraph 74 (ii)
was the subject of considerable debate, with some
members favouring a reduction to 12 consistent with
74 (iii) on cascade staircases.     On balance,
though, it was felt unwise to depart from existing
                                                         Action


figures without very good reason.     The figure of 16
would therefore remain.     Paragraph 74 (iii) was
deemed acceptable.


22.   The Working Party noted and accepted the
suggestion in Mr Bush's paper to introduce an
additional clarificatory sentence into paragraph
75.


23.   More contentious was the question of
handrails, regarded by many, it was felt, as an
easy panacea for a multitude of sins.     After
considerable debate, and a recognition that the
fire service view would need to be obtained, it was
agreed that the Working Party would recommend a
width between handrails lower than 1.8 metres, and
probably either 1.1 metres or 1.5 metres.    The views
of the fire service would be sought and the matter       Stickley
tabled for discussion at the next meeting.               Sweet


24.   The extension of handrails for 300mm before
the first step at the head of a stairway to at
least 300mm beyond the last step at the bottom of a
stairway, and the whole question of 'protection'
were areas requiring further thought.     It was
clear, however, that protection was needed only
when there was a drop, and that Table 2 of Chapter
9 needed amendment so as to refer to "handrails and
protectors ...".     It was agreed the Messrs Bush,      Bush/
Dickson and Nicholson would review all of these          Dickson/
matters further and report back at the next              Nicholson
meeting.


25.   It was agreed that Fig. 1 in paragraph 82 be
amended to specify that 'The width of A and B to be
no less than 1.1m each' and that the word 'Down' be
                                                          Action


removed from the diagram.


26.   Similarly, Fig. 2 in paragraph 84 would be
enhanced by figures giving the size of the wing
barriers, and by the inclusion of an additional
barrier in front of the central arrow facing the
stairway.


27.   The section on ramps was inadequate,
particularly in failing to address separately the
question of disabled access and egress.      Building
regulations specified a gradient no steeper than 1
in 12, and 1 in 10 was probably too steep.      Mr
Stickley agreed to obtain further details of work         Stickley
already carried out by the Sports Council and the
Centre of Environment for the Handicapped.        He
would report back at the next meeting.


28.   It was agreed that Messrs Bush and Carter           Bush/
would look in detail at Chapters 10 and 14 in             Carter
readiness for the next meeting.


Review of Capacities


29.   Consideration had been given by Professor
Maunder to Chapters 8, 11, 12 and 16 of the Green
Guide.     A number of points had emerged including:


      i.     paragraphs 92/93.   The second sentence of
             paragraph 93 should refer to a 'drop',
             not 'rise', since use of the latter
             weakened the first sentence of the
             paragraph;
                                                      Action
                                                                t
       was the 280-380mm range too wide, and, in
       particular, was the 280mm figure too low?
       Working Party members agreed to give           All
       further thought to the question;               Members


 iii. paragraphs 97/98 needed to be more
       emphatic - "spectators should not


 iv.   similarly, in paragraph 99 spectators
       were to be "instructed";


v.     were sunken gangways a good idea?     In the
       absence of any firm data on accident
       rates, it was probably acceptable for
       them to remain, although there was
       general consensus that they should be
       painted in their entirety;


vi.    paragraph 100 ought to refer to gangways
       which were sloped or might, more
       generally, be recast to say that where a
       sunken gangway existed, its profile
       should match that of the rest of the
       terrace.    It was agreed to adopt this
       approach;


 vii. Paragraph 101.     It was agreed that "in an
       emergency" in line 8 should be replaced
       by "except under strict control";


viii. paragraph 102, Professor Maunder's
       suggested addition (see paper already
       circulated) was not without its
       difficulties, since any attempt at
       segregation of sub-divisions would only
       be effective if such segregation was
                                                         Action


            effective all the way back to the
            turnstiles.    It was agreed that the
            matter would be reviewed, once Mr Carter
            had obtained details of the current          Carter
            position at clubs;


      ix    paragraph 106 'desirable' and 'is' were
            to be deleted, and 'should be'
            substituted for the latter.    It was
            agreed to recommend deletion of the final
            sentence;


      x.    paragraph 107 Mr Sticklev felt strongly
            that the barriers on viewing slopes
            should be closer than on normal
            terracing.    It was agreed that he would    Stickley
            review Table 1 (on page 37), and would
            reconsider the acceptability of the
            gradient quoted in paragraph 106;


      xi.   paragraph 108.   There was some suggestion
            of a minimum two metre width for an
            obligatory pitch perimeter path.    Before
            recommending adoption of this, Mr Carter
            undertook to find out the current            Carter
            position at League clubs.


30.   Further consideration needed to be given both
to Chapter 11 (Fire Safety) - should section 4 of
the ISE document be incorporated? - and Chapter 16
(capacity).    The Interim Report had recommended a
15% reduction in capacity, effectively reducing the
permissible maximum density from 54 per 10 sq
metres to approximately 46.      Should that figure
remain, despite some clubs' resentment, or should
                                                          Action


the Working Party recommend a return to the higher
figure?      Was some longer-term research on packing     All
density now required?                                     Members


31.    In addition, Working Party members would also
need to give thought to the following:


       i.     possible new design of structural
              elements such as fences, gates, barriers
             under the general theme of "design
             considerations";


       ii.    the possible role of the FLA on grounds
              and levels of standardisation;                All

       iii. provision for the disabled;


       iv.   all-seater stadia;   and


       v.    what should be said about non-football
              stadia?

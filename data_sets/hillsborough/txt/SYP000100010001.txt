            SUBJECT:       policy for disclosure of hillsborough material

             1.    This paper is submitted to enable policy decisions to be made
                   for dealing with any request that is received seeking material
                   connected with the Hillsborough Enquiry.

            SIZE OF PROBLEM

             2.    Currently the force has received some fifty requests for material.
                   This does not include possible requests to West Midlands which
                   may not have been forwarded. This does not include the
                    "Hillsborough Steering Committee" requests which have never been
                    specified. It does not include the requests for return of
                    material that was surrendered on condition of ultimate return
                    such as tickets.  It is believed that there are hundreds of these
                    conditional surrenders.

             3. One may anticipate that once it becomes known that South Yorkshire
                 Police are releasing material further requests will be received.

            PROBLEM OF "OWNERSHIP"

             4.    It is a question never resolved as to the status of this material
                   which would make it appropriate for South Yorkshire Police to
                   release it. For example a request was received for the release
                   of a pathologist’s report that might have been dealt with by
                   referring the requester to the pathologist or to HM Coroner.
                   Another example would be photographs taken by press cameramen.
                   Would South Yorkshire Police act correctly to release such
                    material?

            GENERAL PLAN

             5.     Once the problem of "ownership" is resolved the general plan would
                    be to seek to classify requests by type and have a disclosure
                    policy according to that classification. Then when a similar
                    request falling into that classification is received it can be
                    dealt with in accordance with the determined policy.

             PHILOSOPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

              6.    The legal position I would suppose is that there is no legal
                    requirement for South Yorkshire Police to disclose anything.

              7.    The choices of policy are:-
                                                  a. disclose nothing
                                                  b. disclose anything on request
                                                  c. disclose selectively

              8.    A policy of giving on request is attractive since it shows an
                    openness that will find favour publicly and will comply with the
                    wishes of the requester. The material is innocuous and current
                    numbers are small.


GEN/2   |
9.    At the other extreme a policy of non-disclosure has benefits in
      that it is less costly of resources, avoids nice judgements that
      might give rise to criticism and avoids embarrassment or argument
      in the event of the requested material not being found.

10.   Any disclosure might become part of a gathering of material that
      could form the basis of a book or a programme exposing differences
      with the "authorised version" of events revealed by the Taylor
      Enquiry or the Inquest. The chance of this occurring piecemeal
      is exceedingly remote but any disclosure may lead to access to
      researchers seeking exactly this objective.

11.   If not an "all or nothing" policy then disclosure will require
      decisions on merits of individual cases. This may lead to South
      Yorkshire Police arbitrating on matters of good taste for example
      a request for a photograph showing dead son's corpse in situ.
      Probably any souveniers will be marketable.

CLASSIFICATIONS CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED

12.   The classifications currently identified are:-

      C1   Request for copy of statement made by the requester.   Such
           requests have been received in the past ostensibly for inquest
           or litigation purposes and have not been actioned.   It may
           be that the purpose has now passed. Probably none of those
           already received should be actioned unless fresh request is
           made.

      C2   Request for copy of statement made by someone other than the
           requester.

      C3   Request for copy of statement made by someone other than the
           requester when the maker has given consent for supply to the
           requester. Requests falling in both these categories have
           been received but like Cl the purpose may have passed.
           Probably none of those already received should be actioned
           unless fresh request is made.

      C4   Request for return of ticket handed over to West Midlands
           Enquiry.  Some requests by letter have been received that
           may relate to civil actions. Others arise from a form of
           receipt given by West Midlands at the time indicating the
           handover was conditional. There appear to be some hundreds
           of these. Probably none of those should be actioned unless
           fresh request is made.

      C5   Request for audio, photographic or video material. Requests
           have been received for photographs. There appear to be
           possible sub groups depending on the provenance of the
           material:-

           a.   South Yorkshire Police Material;
           b.   Media Material;
           c.   Fire and Ambulance Service Material;
           d.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Material;
           e.   Private Individual's Material;
           f.   West Midlands Police Material.
             Probably copyright considerations arise in relation to   _
             disclosure of any other than South Yorkshire Police Material
             and if a policy of disclosure finds favour then legal advice
             Should be sought together with the approval of the owner .
             Costs also arise as supply probably should be conditiona
             on payment of fee. The administrative problems may be
             considerable in that if the requester does not have a
             reference for the photograph he wants it may be exceedingly
             difficult to trace.

            nomioQtc, for expert pvidence such as pat h ologists report.
            ptobablv t h e 'answer to the "ownership” problem would indicate
            that South Yorkshire Police should not disclose but refer the
            requester to the pathologist, etc.

      C7    Reauests for               n1 "«de bv police officers.    As far as is
            known no r e q u e s t ^ h a v e been made by South Yorkshire Police
            officers who might feel they had grounds to sue the Chief
            Constable and would seek specific material to support thei
             case.

DECISIONS REQUIRED

13.    The need for the following decisions to be made has been
       identified:-

       A - The "ownership problem" - needs legal advice as to status
              of this material

           B - "Philosophical problem" - needs to be a decision on
                fundamental stance o r the force, all?, nothing., selective.

           c - If selective then decision needed on whether to release
               on past requests or only any fresh requests.

           D - If selective then decision needed on whether classification
               olan is appropriate after which more detailed work will be
               undertaken in relation to each identified classification
               to enable a specific disclosure policy to be made on each
               classification.

 COMMENT

 14.       Any policy of disclosure can be implemented.

 1R        The easiest course to take is to disclose nothing.          The
           justification of that course, if justification is nee e ,
           harder to supply.

              SUBJECT:          DISCLOSURE OF 'HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL'


               Forwarded herewith is a copy of an advice from R C Johnston concerning
               the disclosure of Hillsborough material.

               We spoke on Thursday respecting the maintenance of this policy of
               non-disclosure that remitted from this advice and you stated that
               it was your intention to stay with this policey.

               Letters are from time to time being received asking for copies of
               items of material and presently they are forwarded to me here at
               Hammerton Road.  I recommend that they be acknowledged at your office
               on receipt and that acknowledgement should be in the form of one or
               more standard letters drafted to your personal satisfaction. The
               letter with copy correspondence should then be sent to me for filing
               in our papers.

               Obviously I might draft such letters, but it represents a diversion
               from my present occupation and not desirable.  I do not have immediate
               typing power at my disposal, nor are you and I easily able to confer
               as to the wording of the different letters involved.  I wonder if
               you would care to discuss with Chief Superintendent Mole your policy
               so that perhaps he would sign letters on your behalf in this area.

GEN/2
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

1   I am aware that a substantial number of requests have been received for
     copies of documents and other material acquired for the purposes of the
     various investigations into the Hillsborough Disaster and now in the
     possession of the South Yorkshire Police. The following purposes can be
     identified.
     1   Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry.
     2   Coronal inquests.
     3   DPP investigation.
     4   Disciplinary investigation.
2   It will be known that Council opinion has been sought on the vexed question
     of disclosure and the following principles can be drawn from this opinion.
     a   As a general rule no documents or material ought to be disclosed unless
          civil proceedings have been commenced and discovery is due to take
          place.
          No disclosure of documents, video films and photographs which are
          clearly in the ownership of someone else should be disclosed by the
          Police without the owners consent.
          No information should be disclosed that is likely to prejudice any
          disciplinary hearing.
          Statements taken for the sole purpose of the six comnla^nts from Messrs
                                                                   These being as
          1 understand it the only complaints which have been investigated
          separately and not subsumed in the investigation into the "main event",
          are subject to public interest immunity and therefore must not be
          disclosed under any circumstances.
3   There is no legal requirement as far as I am aware at present to disclose
     any information. No request for information has been made in the course of
                                                                              <
     civil proceedings concerning the Chief Constable where the stage of
     discovery has been reached and there are to my knowledge no relevant
     criminal proceedings.
4   It seems   to me there are three policies which can be adopted by the Police.
    a     Disclose nothing,
    b     Disclose everything,
    c     Disclose selectively.
    The first may be seen as attractive because of the resource time which will
    be taken in finding, copying and then releasing material. However against
    this is the loss of public favour which may result from not disclosing the
    most innocuous material, say a persons own statement which has no bearing on
    any remaining issues of the disaster. Indeed I would go further and suggest
-   2   -




            that such a policy may be misinterpreted deliberately or otherwise by the
            media and others so that there is constructed a belief that the Police have
            something to hide.
5       A policy of disclosing everything is not possible for the following reasons:
            Material which is owned by someone else should not be disclosed without
            their permission and in this context it may seem to be more practible to
            refer the person who has     requested the material to the owner. Statements
            taken as part of the six     complaints referred to in Paragraph 2d cannot be
            disclosed since they are     public interest immune and itis not for the Police
            to wave that immunity.

6                       policy of selective disclosure appears attractive because although
            it w i n have resource implications it does enable the Police to protect the
            public image aspects of the case, particularly in the light of the Forces
            most recent statement of purposes and values. But it does have a further
            drawback which is the inevitable arbitration which will have to take place
            and which may well lead to allegations of "cover-up" or something similar
            thus negating the primary purpose for adopting the selective disclosure
            poI i c y .

7       ? ne f1"al matter which must not be lost sight of is the policy which has
          i t t r c?°P ? a1!! rela* i0!? t0 requests from the Hillsborough Steering Group.
                         And?rson s letter of 2 May refers). It has been reiterated on a
         " S r .?f J?03? 1?1?5 that n0 request for disclosure will be considered until
         after the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have been completed. The
         reasoning is of course the possibility that disclosure may prejudice those
         EIffefd \ T : Even then it has been said that applications will be dealt
         with on their merits and that regard will be had to the purpose for which
         the material is required. So the principle of selective disclosure has
         already been articulated at least to the Hillsborough Steering Group.
8       ? i r r ber  diff?re,?t classifications of document can be identified and
        although the following list is not intended to be exhaustive it can be used
        to develop a policy of disclosure although such a policy would not be
        implemented until after the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have been
                    T5 1S °- COur sf Wil1 1[>clude court action such as Judicial Review
        relating to decisions taken on those disciplinary aspects
        a       Own Statements
                Apart from statements taken in connection with the six specific
                complaints referred to in Paragraph 2d there can ultimately be no
                objection in law to these being disclosed. If previous requests have
                been refused on a "for the time being" basis. There is a risk of
                criticism if these requests are not dealt with until a fresh request is
      b    - equest for c°Py Statements of someone other than the maker
           Again with the exception referred to at (a) there can be no o b ie c tin n
           in Taw to providing copies as Tong as there is a written authorisation
           from the maker of the statement. Where previous requests have bee^
           refused the potential criticism referred to at (a) is relevant.
      c    Request for return of ticket

                  been numbered and the history of the correspondence is set out at the
                  front of each. For example, HD1 refers to a request made on
                  20 December 1989 which was denied by West Midlands Police on
                  3 January 1990. HD/2 is a request dated 14 December 1 9 8 9 which was
                  denied by West Midlands Police on 5 January 1990. And so on.

                  It is a matter for your decision as to whether you wish to resurrect
                  interest by writing further updates in response to such requests.
                  Do you intend to write say every three months?

                  Your minute of 3 October 1991 implies that y<Su will write acknowledging
                  receipt. I was led to believe your letter woiild express policy. It
                  was not envisaged that further attention would be given by me other
                  than filing the requests with the other Hillgborough papers. What
                  further attention do you have in mind? Do you wish the actual requested
                  material to be searched out and copied? Do you wish the question of
                  'property' to be researched?

                  Please indicate those areas that you decide require further action
                  and the necessary action will be taken.  I would point out this will
                  inevitably delay the work of this team, but this other work can easily
                  be done if required.

Re:    H illsb orou gh D is c lo s u r e P ile

At 4.00 p.m. Wednesday 29th January 1992 I saw Mr Paul Middup, Secretary
of the Police Federation, and discussed with him the position regarding
the disclosure of statements of police officers involved in the
Hillsborough disaster enquiry. I pointed out that we were now receiving
applications for statements and that authority from officers would be
required before they were released.

In brief, in accordance with legal advice it had been decided that
statements could be released but they should not be released unless
appropriate authority had been obtained. In discussions with members of
the Hillsborough families, they had been told that any applications for
officers statements should be forwarded to Headquarters rather than
individual officers, and then approaches would be made through this
department to seek approval from the officers concerned. Unless approval
was given then statements would not be released.

In addition, mention was made of the fact that some members of the families
sought meetings with individual officers and again requests would be
directed to Headquarters in order that necessary approaches could be made.
Comment was made that it was felt time to let matters rest and that many
officers might not wish to be involved further in resurrecting the
Hillsborough disaster. Police Constable Middup indicated that he felt
he should seek legal advice on behalf of his members as to whether or not
officers should grant approval for their statements to be released.
I agreed that I would not approach any officers for approval until such
time as I had received Federation advice and I would ensure that where
requests were made to officers they were made avare of that advice,
whatever it may be.

Police Constable Middup assured me that he would expedite the matter and
would seek to have the advice in the next few days.


NOTE - POLICY

Where requests are made for police officers statements then approaches
would be made to the officers by memorandum accompanied by Federation
advice given by their legal representatives.

No approaches would be made until that advice has been received.

                                SUBJECT:           HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY - PROPERTY


                                The following is a resume of property held with the Hillsborough
                                File for your information and consideration as to disposal:

                                CLOTHING

                                There are 41 pairs of shoes and 40 single shoes.   In one case
                                the owner is known and in one other an enquiry to establish a
                                suspected owner is still outstanding.   The remaining shoes are
                                unidentified.

                                There are 60 hats/caps in the property none of which have been
                                identified.

                                There are 44 scarves and 1 flag, together with 61 items of
                                personal clothing including shirts, jumpers, coats etc.    There is
                                one enquiry outstanding to trace a suspect owner.

                                The majority of the above property is dirty and despite being
                                sealed in plastic bags is now beginning to emit a distateful
                                odour.   I would suggest that with the exception of the items where
                                owners are known or suspected, the remainder now be destroyed.

                                OTHER ITEMS

                                There are 23 pairs of spectacles in the system most of which are
                                damaged in some manner.   No owners are known

                                There are 22 watches and with the exception of two 'Sekonda' makes
                                none are of any value.

                                There are several items of misc' property including cigarette lighters
                                combs, beer bottles and cans, earrings badges etc.   The only
                                items which could have any value are a Gold St. Christopher charm
                                and four 'Walkman' cassette players.   There are however no owners
                                known or suspected.

                                I would ask that permission be granted to destroy all these items
                                of property.

                                CASH

                                There is a total of £14.53p. in cash recorded as found property.
                     —"C        Subject to your approval, it is intended to pay this into the
                                finance department against receipt.

        TICKETS

        In addition to all the ticket stubs obtained from the Sheffield
        Wednesday Football Club there are a further 474 tickets in the
        system.   We have signed disclaimers for 56 of those, tickets
        and 51 where the owners are not know or photocopies only were
        supplied to the enquiry.   Of the remaining tickets receipts
        exist for many which were taken from witnesses although this
        is not true in all cases.

        The West Midlands recorded system is confusing in that se«eEal
        teams dealt differently with the receipt of tickets, some
    7   simply issued receipts, others obtained disclaimers, some endorsed
        the receipts that the tickets were supplied specifica]Jy for the
        'Hillsborough enquiry' etc.

        There are I understand some specific requests for the return of
        tickets and these form part of the diclosure file.

        You may feel that we could destroy those items for which we have
        disclaimers and the photo-copies.




        Inspector.


        Discussed with the Hillsborough Team this day and the following
        agreed

        1.     Clothing                    Destroy all outstanding clothing with the
                                           exception of that property which has been
                                           positively identified to an owner.  In the
                                           interest of not opening old wounds, retain
                                           that property for six months pending any
                                           claims. The ultimate disposal of that
                                           property will then be considered further.

        2.     Other Items -The incidental property detailed as
                            spectacles, watches, etc, should be destroyed.

        3.     Cash                    - This should be paid into the bank.

        4.     Tickets                  - Destroy those   items which have been subject
                                         of disclaimers   and photocopys. Where claims
                                         have been made   for return, they should be
                                         returned. All    other tickets retained for
                                         six months for   further policy to be
                                         determined.

        Mention was further made of a baptisim certificate and this
        should be retuy>rl6 n~~T>c^the owners through Solicitors if known.

At 9.15 a.m. today, I spoke to Mr Steven Walker on the Disclosure Policy.

Agreed that the existing advice remains appropriate and that he can see
no reason why our photographs cannot now be released in connection with
my suggestion in the interests of goodwill on behalf of the South Yorkshire
Police.

The matter will be discussed further on 28th January 1992.

Dear Mr. Mole,

Statements made by Police Officers - Hillsborough

I refer to our discussion on Thursday, 30 January 1992, regarding the
supplying of copies of the statements made by police officers involved in
the Hillsborough disaster.

Having discussed this with Mr. Simon Allen of the Police Federation
solicitors, Russell Jones and Walker, I would ask that the following advice
be quoted in your letter to any officer whose permission is sought for his
statement to be released.

"The advice from the Police Federation is that the decision whether or not to
release his/her statement must be a personal one for the officer from whom
the request is made.  However, any officer receiving such a request should
consider very seriously what possible reasons anyone could have for making
such a request. Having thought that through, very carefully, the officer
should then make his/her decision."

Thank you for all your help in this matter.
                                                            SOUTH YORKS. POLICE

                   SUBJECT:        Disclosure - Destruction of Hillsborough Material

                   The  content   of  the  report  dated   28 September 1991 submitted  by
                   Ex-Superintendent Fell and the attached advice by R C Johnston relating
                   to disclosure of Hillsborough material, has been complied with.  Except
                   for the delay in providing material where ownership is held by other
                   agencies and authority to release is sought causing the delay, there
                   have been no problems.


                   Destruction of Hillsborough Material

                   The following material is stored in the Hillsborough Store Room

                   A    Original statements plus three copies

                   B    Original documents plus three copies

                   C    Photographs and several copies

                   D    Videos plus several copies

                   E    Audio tapes plus several copies

                   F    Miscellaneous material


                   In relation to destruction of unwanted material,          I believe the following
                   policy should be adopted:-

                   A    Keep original statements plus one copy

                   B    Keep original documents plus    one copy


   ft              C    Keep two copies of all photographs

                   D    Keep original tapes plus two    copies where applicable

                   E    Keep original tapes plus one    copy

                   F    Keep all miscellaneous papers


                   We should shred all other material we do not intend to keep as this
                   would be the only safe method to prevent it from entering the public
                   domain by accident.

                   In   the   case of video and audio    tapes,    these   should be wiped    clean   for
                   reuse by AVA, etc.

                   I submit this report for your information.                   ^

HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY - DISCLOSURE OF STATEMENTS


Relatives of some of the people who died at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 have and
are still approaching the South Yorkshire Police requesting copies of statements of witnesses,
including those of police officers. It is the policy of the South Yorkshire Police to release copies of
statements only when the authority of the statement maker is obtained.

Approaches by the relatives are now being made direct to police officers requesting copies of their
statements.

Should any officer receive such a request from any source they should forward the
correspondence, together with a report either giving their authority to release their statement or
declining to allow their statement to be disclosed, to Chief Superintendent Lowe, Discipline and
Complaints, Heeley Police station. Every endeavour will be made to abide by the wishes of the
statement makers.

The following is an extract from a Police Federation letter regarding such requests.


       "The advice from the Police Federation is that the decision whether or not to
       release his/her statement must be a personal one for the officer from whom the
       request is made. However, any officer receiving such a request should consider
       very seriously what possible reasons anyone could have for making such a request.
       Having thought that through, very carefully, the officer should then make his/her
       decision."

           Dear Sir,
                    I refer to your letter of 12* August which has left me somewhat perplexed. Your
           rules relating to disclosure are ambiguous to say the least. In the post your officers have
           released information to me without requiring the written authority o f the family concerned. To
           insist upon the same at this particular time can only he regarded as a tactic to obstruct and
           impede ihe families who are trying to comply with the deadline set by Ixjrd Justice Stuart-
           Smith. It also heightens their anxiety and suspicions.

           In relation to the written authority of the statement author*. I note that you have enclosed
           statements of, for example, Ambulance woman                 and Dr Bull on the basis that they have
           been in the public arena previously at the Coroners Inquest and therefore you did not require
           any authority for their release I have to tell you that neither o f these two people ( and indeed
           most o f the others listed in your letter ) were called to give evidence at the inquest. Can you
           therefore explain your inconsistent approach in such matters.

           Finally I would remind you that your Chief Constable has gone on public record stating that he
           would co-operate folly with the Independent Scrutiny. I would urge you to put Richard Wells
           pledge into practice. As an indictiun o f my concern and that u f the HUtsburough FwniEvu 1 son

Dear Ms Adlington

I am in receipt of your lettter of the 12 August, and perhaps I can go some way to resolving
your confusion.

The policy in relation to unpublished statements has been in existence since 13 June 1991.
There is no wish to hide behind any issue, but our legal advice is that we should not publish
these matters without the consent of those people that made them. W e are actively
seeking that authority.

The second point relates to the statements of Miss      and Dr Bull. These statements
were tended in evidence at the Coroners Inquest and therefore published. The fact that
neither were called as witnesses is immaterial.    They are public documents and we
pleased to released them to you.

Finally, we will do everything we can to corporate fully with the Independent Scrutiny. Our
approach has been discussed with Mr Richard Bone at the Home Office, who is assisting
Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, and he has expressed no concern over the policy.

I hope this letter will go some way to clarify issues for you.

Yours sincerely

              Dear Sir

              I refer you to a statement dated 22 August 1989 from Philip Harvey Rich, in the body file of
              Gordon Rodney Horn. Mr Rich, a civilian photographer for South Yorkshire Police refers to
              photographs he took o f the crowds in the pens at kick off, which formed the albums PR 1-9,
              which he passed to West Midlands Police. Would you please forward copies o f the
              photographs contained in those albums to us as soon as possible,

              Thank you for your assistance.

             27 October 1997 and in which you make reference to the statement of Philip Harvey Rich in the

             frame that Mr Rich shot during the day, a considerable number of photographs In materials
             atone the cost of reproducing these photographs will amount to over £530 not taking into account
             the time of the personnel involved in the process of providing the copies.

COPIES OF PHOTOGRAPHIC ALBUMS: PR1-PR9

I refer to your letter dated 27 September 1997, which was faxed to this office for the first time on
27 October 1997 and in which you make reference to the statement of Philip Harvey Rich in the
body file of Gordon Rodney Horn. You refer to photographs Mr Rich took of the crowds in the
pens at kick-off, which formed the albums PR1 - 9 and request copies of the photographs
contained in those albums be forwarded to yourself.

Mr Rich's statement in the Gordon Horn file introduced just one photograph into evidence and
you were supplied with a copy of this as part of the file. The albums PR1 - 9 contain every single
frame that Mr Rich shot during the day, a considerable number of photographs. In materials
alone the cost of reproducing these photographs will amount to over £530 not taking into account
the time of the personnel involved in the process of providing the copies.

I would therefore be pleased if we could specifically address what you are attempting to discover.
If it is photographs of the crowds in the pens of the Leppings Lane Terrace at kick-off as
identified in the third line of your letter that you require, these are covered in a series of 26 timed
photographs. W e could provide these in a reasonable time scale particularly if you will accept
laser copies.

I look forward to receiving confirmation of your agreement to the above.

                                INTRODUCTION



T he enclosed papers give an account of how a num ber of casualties, including
Philip Hammond, cam e to be treated at the Northern G eneral Hospital.

This response is prompted by an article from Doctor Ed W alker in recent
publications, including the Liverpool Echo, a local new spaper published in that city.

T h e articles purport to establish that Doctor W alker has new evidence to shed light
on the tim e of death for a num ber of casualties, in particular Philip Hammond.

It must be said at the outset that Doctor W alker's evidence is not new. T h e article
published on Thursday 2 7 February in the Liverpool Echo quotes, "But he
(Doctor W alker) confirmed he has never been interviewed by the police." Enclosed
in this bundle of papers is a statem ent from Doctor W alker dated 2 0 July 1989 taken
by officers from the W est M idlands Police. Th ere is also a copy of an action
schedule warning Doctor W alker that he may be called to attend the inquest. In fact
Doctor W alker was approached on at least two occasions by the police following the
disaster.

There are other inconsistencies in the new spaper articles com pared to his statem ent
given to the police in 1989 but that is quite understandable. Eight years later it is
not always possible to recall accurately events that took place, particularly in the
traum atic circum stances in which Doctor W alker found himself.

W h at his statem ent does confirm, however, are the findings of the doctors and the
Hom e Office pathologists giving evidence at the inquest into the tragedy.
Professor Usher, Doctor S later and Doctor Gum pert gave evidence to the effect that
all the casualties who died w ere dead before the 3 .1 5 pm cut off time. In his
statem ent concerning treatm ent to Philip Hammond, Doctor W alker says that, "His
pupils w ere fixed and dilated throughout."

In addition, M r W ardrope, Doctor W alker's supervisor, when giving evidence at the
inquest and in his statem ent, said, "No patient adm itted in a state of cardiac arrest
survived."

In conclusion therefore, it is safe to say there is nothing new in w hat Doctor W alker
is now saying, although it does support the evidence given by Professor Usher,
Doctor Gum pert and Doctor Slater. That evidence led Doctor Popper, the coroner,
to believe that 3 .1 5 pm w as an appropriate point at which to call a clearly defined
cut off time.

        * 5. At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
     area, a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer f i t ' the police are monitoring it) whose
     sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
     period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any other
     steward or police presence. He should have ready access to the police officer authorised under
     Recommendation 9 below, and by radio to the control room."

      1 repeat that recom m endation (w ith a slig h t ch an ge o f wording to achieve clarity) but qualify it to avoid
   absurdity w hen num bers are sm a ll. T h e recom m endation need not be applied to any self-co n ta in ed pen or oth er
   standing area w here the sp ectators present, or reasonably to be ex p ected , during a particular m atch do not
   exceed one third o f th e area's m axim um perm itted capacity , or 2 ,0 0 0 , w hichever is th e low er.

   Cutting E quipm ent
     205. In the immediate aftermath of Hillsborough, I recommended that suitable and sufficient cutting
   equipment should be provided to enable spectators to be released from behind perimeter fencing. Assuming
   the recommended maximum capacities are observed, that fences are lowered, that sufficient gates are
   provided and left unlocked, cutting equipment should not be necessary. Something in these provisions would
   have to go badly wrong for such equipment to be required. N ev e rth e less, I recom m end that th e equipm ent
   should be m aintained in case o f so m e unforeseen em ergency.

    Functions o f P o lice and Stew ards
        206. Which functions should be discharged by the police and which by the club’s stewards is one of the
      most vexed questions. To describe the background to the argument I can do no better than repeat what 1 said
^ ^ | n my Interim Report at pages 28 and 29.

       "Who should Monitor the Terraces?

        161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be both? O r should it be by arrangement,
      depending upon the ground or section of the ground in question?

         162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
      responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:


         "23. The safety of the public inside the ground is the responsibility of those who stage the event and
         administer the ground in which it is held, ie the •‘management". This responsibility applies in both
         normal and emergency situations. . .

         195. . . . there are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

              (a) controlling or directing members of the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to help
              achieve an even flow of people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal of spectators on the terraces or
              viewing slopes;

              (b) patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing fires;

              (c) manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which are
              continuously open whilst the ground is in use:

              (d) assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control: and

              (e) undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

       The Interim Popplewell Report
          163. There was considerable controversy in the course of the public inquiry held by M r Justice
       Popplewell in 1985 as to the responsibility of the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 of his interim report.
       M r Justice Popplewell quoted from a report produced for the Minister of Housing and Local Government
       in 1969 as follows:-

         "The responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club operating
       the ground. The broad line of division being that police are responsible for movement of spectators in
       public thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the
       control of spectators once they are on the club’s premises ..
    M r Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the
    P ^ ic t have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph


       “ It follows, therefore, that as a matter of practice, while the physical safetv of the building and the
       maintenance and good housekeeping of the ground must always be the responsibility of the club the
       pohce hav e to take the de facto responsibility of organising the crowd, with’ all that entai.s durmg Z

      uld bear the responsibility of supervising the organisation of the crowd.

    The Final Popplewell Report

       164.      He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 of his Final Report. There, he came down more firmlv
       favour of holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “Because as a matter
   o f practice, police officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow
   been assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control of what goes on inside the ground has passed

   circumstances^This very difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed
   in greater depth at stage two of this Inquiry."                                    '                 icviewtu

  Since Hillsborough was concerned with a disaster on the terraces. I headed that passage "Who should
 mom tor the terraces. . But the wider question is: who should control the entrv of spectators, their placing
                         ln u f 8r0Urd and their exit fr0m it? 11 is undisputed that' the club, as a matter of law
 he!n t      take reasonable care for the safety of the spectators invited to its premises. There have, however
      tw0 Practical difficulties about the club, rather than the police, being defacto in charge.

  207. First, the club discharges its duty through stewards. They are part-time emplovees or assistants whose
 ut.es are confined to match days. Many of them are seasoned supporters of the club and some tend to be
m t           t are keen young supporters. Due either to age or youth, many therefore lack the phvsique to
       ! hT       ■ customers. They are usually not well paid, part of their "remuneration" (indeed all of it at
p X V S r COnS/ p mf          opportunity to see the game. As the submission from the Association of Chief
Police Officers of England. Wales and Northern Ireland (ACPO) puts it:

    (Stewards) are at best casual workers (usually working one day in two weeks), thev are probably not people
  » 0 havKe ta supervisory role m ordinary life and are not always equipped or used to giving directions or
   acing obstruction. Many are retired people and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee commitment."

H.)hchl 1St nere f FH except,ons- 1 have frequently been told that the stewards presently employed at many
clubs are of limited capacity and reliability.                                                           '

   208. Secondly, there has to be a police presence at a match to maintain law and order. Police are trained to
         r l ° rCe instructl?ns- Thls- together with the uniform they wear and the respect for and fear of the
 aw winch the majority of spectators have, gives the police far more authority than stewards. Moreover if
trouble arises, whether from misbehaviour or from any other cause, the police will inevitably be drawn into
assuming control. They have all the means to do so at their disposal - the control room, the CCTV, the
planned deployment of serials of officers round the ground, a communications system to co-ordinate them
a d reserves on call. The submission from ACPO suggests that in these circumstances, and to avoid
from the.V argum ent        ‘ ^          PnmC responsiblllty for controlling the crowd. I quote two passages

HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your letter of 12 November commenting on the issues raised by
the Hillsborough Family Support Group about access to information held by your
force. It was very helpful to have your views on the issues raised by the Family
Support Group.

I enclose a copy of the reply which I have sent today to Trevor Hicks, Chairman
of the Family Support Group. As you will see, Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has
confirmed to me that he has not experienced any difficulties with access to
information required for his scrutiny and that he expects to complete his report
by the end of the year.

Trevor Hicks Esq

Thank you for your letter of 9 November about the difficulties which you say
have been experienced in obtaining material from South Yorkshire Police and
others and the need, therefore, to extend the timescale for Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith's scrutiny.

As you know, I asked for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's advice on the issues which
you raised. Richard Wells, the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, has also
written to me after the contents of your letter were disclosed to him by the
media.

I should make it clear that, having appointed Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to
conduct this scrutiny, the management of the scrutiny is entirely a m atter for the
Judge. Although I indicated when announcing the scrutiny that w e hoped it
would be possible to complete the scrutiny by the end of the year, the timescale
is ultimately a m atter for the Judge to decide. I have told Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith that if he reached the conclusion that more time was needed to complete
his work, this would certainly be within his discretion. However, Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith has indicated to me that he hopes to be able to keep to his original
timescale for completion of the report. I understand that he has now written to
you and other interested parties to confirm this.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has also assured me that he has been given full access
to the material held by South Yorkshire Police and that the force has co-operated
throughout his scrutiny. He has not seen any sign that the police are
deliberately obstructing requests for information from other parties. He has also
expressed surprise that difficulties should have been encountered in obtaining
hospital records, (which are held by the hospital, and not the police), if the
request was made by a properly authorised representative of the victim 's family.
In his letter to me, Richard Wells has indicated that the force has made every
effort to respond to requests for information within the constraints of the
Coroners' Rules and considerations of witness confidentiality. He states that no
family is waiting for all or part of a body file to be released, although the force is
processing requests for photographs from tw o families having already supplied
laser copies.

From w hat I have been told by Richard Wells and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith it
appears that, for the purposes of the scrutiny, all the material which should be
available for examination by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has been available to him,
and that the scrutiny has been able to investigate fully the issues raised by the
Family Support Group and others.

The Judge has indicated that he would have arranged for the archive of material
to be removed from the South Yorkshire Police if there had been any doubt as to
its continuing integrity there, but that this was not his view. He does not,
therefore, consider it justifiable to incur the considerable logistical difficulties and
costs involved in such an operation.

You have also written to me about the scrutiny's terms of reference. I will
consider the points you have raised and reply as soon as possible.

Re C326, C327, C328, C329 and C330

I refer to your letter of 12 January 1998.

Enclosed please find photographic copies of exhibits as follows:
      C327, C328, C329 and C330

The negative to C326 is currently held by the Lord Justice Stuart Smith scrutiny team at the

              Dear Sir

              James Gary Aspinall

              There are no references on James’s bodyfile to Video VRM2, however, Mr and Mrs Aspinall
              have viewed the tape and believe there is a possibility that James was shown in the
              gymnasium.

              As there are no reel times on the copy o f VRM2 James's parents viewed, they are unable to
              specifically pinpoint a time. However, James was certified dead at 3 45 (later changed to
              3.54) by Dr Matthew Bull, in the presence o f PC Lindop.

              I hope that this will assist you.

Dear Ms Adlington

I refer to your facsimile letter of 24 March 1998.

I can confirm that I have responded to the requests 1, 3, 4 and 5 in your letter.

In our previous correspondence to you on 13 and 26 February 1998 we advised you that we had not
received any response from our correspondence to]          | Until we receive authority from him I
am unable to release his statement to you.

 Finally, I supplied Louise Brookes with a copy of the file on her brother Andrew. Your request
 appears to be for a second copy of the same file. As you know, these files take some time and
 trouble to prepare. If your request is indeed for a duplicate of material already released I will have to
 ask that you contribute to the cost. If you wish me to proceed, I would be obliged to receive your
►cheque for £50.00 (payable to the South Yorkshire Police Authority)

Yours sincerely

SUBJECT:      REPORT FOR SCT DECISION - CHARGES FOR PROVISION OF
              COPY DOCUMENTATION FROM HILLSBOROUGH ARCHIVES


BACKGROUND

To date all requests for copies of statements, body files, plans, charts, photographs, video stills
and video film from the Hillsborough Archives have been met without charge. The cost to
South Yorkshire police in terms of the time taken to search for the material and photocopy, plus
production costs in use of materials is considerable.

Advice on disclosure of Hillsborough information, received by the force on 13 June 1991 from
Stephen Walker, solicitor to the Police Authority and countersigned by R C Johnson, the Clerk and
Financial Officer, concluded with the words "any policy of disclosure should be supported by a
policy of charging".

Many requests for documentation are concerned with the content of body files. On these
occasions, we are actually acting for Her Majesty's Coroner and providing information on his
behalf. The Coroner's Records (Fees for Copies) Rules allow the Coroner to impose a charge of
£0.80p per sheet for photocopies of documents. There is also a complicated system for charging,
based on the number of folios, if transcripts are requested and they have to be typed. There are
no charges laid down for the provision of photographs or videos. These charges were last
reviewed in 1991 and Coroners have been requesting the Secretary of State to update the
charges for the last two years.

Invariably, once we have forwarded a body file to a family, or to the solicitor to the Hillsborough
Family Support Group, there is a follow up request for the statement of every individual mentioned
in the statements, or continuity chart contained within that file, even though they were not part of
the evidence placed before the Coroner. This then involves further letter writing and postage to
secure the individual's consent to release the statement and then, additional costs in copying and
forwarding.

PRESENT CHARGING POLICY

South Yorkshire Police has a policy and scale of fees for charging for copies of accident reports,
etc which was last revised on 15 September 1996. A copy is attached. This would form the basis
for charges for the supply of Hillsborough Documentation as follows:-
1)      Minimum charge for copies of documents                          £50.00

2)      W here number of sheets copied exceeds 50,
        there should be an additional cost of £0.80 per sheet

3)      Copy of any plan, sketch or chart supplied separately           £50.00

4)      Supply of photographs, irrespective of number                   £50.00 per set
        or whether black & white, or colour

5)      If number of photographs exceeds 20, an additional
        cost of £2.50 per photograph over 20

6)      Copies of video tapes                                           £50.00 per tape

7)      Cancellation of request for item after search conducted         £50.00

8)      Cancellation of request when documents                          £50.00
        are ready for despatch
        (or actual cost if it would have exceeded £50.00)

9)      Plus in all cases cost of postage by recorded delivery




RECOMMENDATION

I recommend that South Yorkshire Police adopt a policy of charging for copies of documentation
and other information, supplied to interested parties from the Hillsborough Archives, as outlined
above and that the charges should be updated in line with reviews of the Coroner's Records (Fees
for Copies) Rules and reviews of our charges for copies of accident reports.

TIME SCALE

The charge for the copying and supply of video tapes should be introduced now, as there are no
outstanding requests for copies of videos and in fact, most of the videos are copyright. If we were
to provide copies it would be on behalf of and with the authority of the copyright holder. I therefore
think it appropriate to charge. For other documentation I do not feel that the charge should be
imposed until the day Lord Justice Stuart-Smith announces that the Scrutiny has stopped taking
new evidence, for to do so earlier will undoubtedly bring about accusations that we are
disadvantaging some families in their search for the truth and obstructing the families and
Hillsborough Family Support Group, in submitting new evidence to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
Scrutiny.

    Charging for Material from the Hillsborough Archive

    I attach a report which Superintendent Alan Hepworth prepared at my request.
    South Yorkshire Police has incurred considerable costs over the years in
    responding to requests for Hillsborough disaster m aterial. W e have not charged for
    such m aterial despite advice in 1991 from the Police Authority that w e should do so.
    Som e requests have been of such a scale that they can only be view ed as fishing
    trips rather than in pursuit of the truth. Eight and a half years after the disaster, I
    think w e can legitim ately say that w e will continue to supply m aterial only if our costs
    are met. If that principle is accepted two questions follow;

    a)     how much?
    b)     start date?

®   T h e proposed charges are simple, easy to compute and based (approxim ately) on
    the costs of staff tim e and m aterial.

    If w e agree on the principle the start date could be;

    a)     Im m ediate   - not recom m ended while       Lord Justice    Stuart-Sm ith   is still
           receiving submissions.

    b)     W h en Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith announces that he has ceased to receive
           submissions - recom m ended.

    c)     W h en Lord Justice Stuart-Sm ith’s report is published - not recom m ended as
           the report m ay prompt a fresh w ave of requests for m aterial and our charging

    Alan Hepworth has just informed me that the representative of the Hillsborough Family
    Support Group has written to ask for an additional copy of three body files which we
    supplied to her (free) recently. I suggest that we start charging immediately for duplicates
    of previously supplied information.

SUBJECT:      REPORT FOR SCT DECISION - CHARGES FOR PROVISION OF
              COPY DOCUMENTATION FROM HILLSBOROUGH ARCHIVES


BACKGROUND

To date all requests for copies of statements, body files, plans, charts, photographs, video stills
and video film from the Hillsborough Archives have been met without charge. The cost to
South Yorkshire police in terms of the time taken to search for the material and photocopy, plus
production costs in use of materials is considerable.

Advice on disclosure of Hillsborough information, received by the force on 13 June 1991 from
Stephen Walker, solicitor to the Police Authority and countersigned by R C Johnson, the Clerk and
Financial Officer, concluded with the words "any policy of disclosure should be supported by a
policy of charging".

Many requests for documentation are concerned with the content of body files. On these
occasions, we are actually acting for Her Majesty's Coroner and providing information on his
behalf. The Coroner's Records (Fees for Copies) Rules allow the Coroner to impose a charge of
£0.80p per sheet for photocopies of documents. There is also a complicated system for charging,
based on the number of folios, if transcripts are requested and they have to be typed. There are
no charges laid down for the provision of photographs or videos. These charges were last
reviewed in 1991 and Coroners have been requesting the Secretary of State to update the
charges for the last two years.

Invariably, once we have forwarded a body file to a family, or to the solicitor to the Hillsborough
Family Support Group, there is a follow up request for the statement of every individual mentioned
in the statements, or continuity chart contained within that file, even though they were not part of
the evidence placed before the Coroner. This then involves further letter writing and postage to
secure the individual's consent to release the statement and then, additional costs in copying and
forwarding.

PRESENT CHARGING POLICY

South Yorkshire Police has a policy and scale of fees for charging for copies of accident reports,
etc which was last revised on 15 September 1996. A copy is attached. This would form the basis
for charges for the supply of Hillsborough Documentation as follows:-
                                                    -2 -




    1)     Minimum charge for copies of documents                           £50.00

    2)     Where number of sheets copied exceeds 50,
           there should be an additional cost of £0.80 per sheet

    3)     Copy of any plan, sketch or chart supplied separately            £50.00

    4)     Supply of photographs, irrespective of number                    £50.00 per set
            or whether black & white, or colour

    5)     If number of photographs exceeds 20, an additional
            cost of £2.50 per photograph over 20

    6)     Copies of video tapes                                            £50.00 per tape

    7)     Cancellation of request for item after search conducted          £50.00

    8)     Cancellation of request when documents                           £50.00
            are ready for despatch
            (or actual cost if it would have exceeded £50.00)

    9)     Plus In all cases cost of postage by recorded delivery



    RECOMMENDATION

    I recommend that South Yorkshire Police adopt a policy of charging for copies of documentation
    and other information, supplied to interested parties from the Hillsborough Archives, as outlined
    above and that the charges should be updated in line with reviews of the Coroner's Records (Fees
    for Copies) Rules and reviews of our charges for copies of accident reports.

Q   TIME SCALE

    The charge for the copying and supply of video tapes should be introduced now, as there are no
    outstanding requests for copies of videos and in fact, most of the videos are copyright. If we were
    to provide copies it would be on behalf of and with the authority of the copyright holder. I therefore
    think it appropriate to charge. For other documentation I do not feel that the charge should be
    imposed until the day Lord Justice Stuart-Smith announces that the Scrutiny has stopped taking
    new evidence, for to do so earlier will undoubtedly bring about accusations that we are
    disadvantaging some families in their search for the truth and obstructing the families and
    Hillsborough Family Support Group, in submitting new evidence to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's
    Scrutiny.

I ANTHONY JAMES EDUARDS will say:              I was born or



I work as an ambulance man on day work.               I joined SYMAS in
September 1988.     I started part time and was promoted to day
work on     6th March 1989.        I had previously been in the
ambulance service in 1973 in Liverpool and had received
qualified status.      I had done further training which lead to
me being admitted as a Fellow of the Ambulance Service
Institute.      This    is    a qualification         above   the   normal
standard but it is not a paramedics course although it is an
introduction to it.      I left the service in 1982 and went tp
Sheffield Polytechnic to do social studies.                   I worked in
adult education until I rejoined the service.


On Thursday and Friday I worked a shift of 0800 hours to
1630 hours.


On Saturday I was to work from 0900 hours to 1730 hours.                 I
was with                     who is a qualified ambulance man and

was acting as driver.



The first I remember about the Hillsborough incident is when

we were taking a patient to the Northern General Hospital.

We heard control telling a crew from Rotherham to go to the

gym at Hillsborough where they would be met by a station

officer.     I thought that it would be some form of a fight

going on.     Our radio was on the day frequency which I think
is channel     3+. We stayed on the channel all the way through
the   day.         We    did HBOdfc_ change    to   ERC   air aoy- ™afcage.


It was about 1510 to 1515 hours when we were on our way to
the Northern            General   Hospital.      We arrived at Northern
General about 5 minutes later.                There were various messages
coming over the radio but I was concentrating on the patient
in the ambulance.           We took the patient into the hospital and
it was sometime before 1530 hours when we got back to the
ambulance and started to clean up.               We then gave the call to
control that we were clear.             I made the call on channel            \|
Control then told us to go to Hillsborough gym entrance
where we would be met by an ambulance officer.                   We did not
know which side the gym entrance was on and I was going to
use the radio to try and find out where the entrance was.
We went down to the traffic island on Herries Road which is
about one and a half miles away.                     Control   then gave a
message to all mobiles.             They repeated that it was for all
mobiles      and    said that they were to proceed              to the gym
entrance at Hillsborough as they had notification of some
fatalities.        I think this was around 1530 hours.           We arrived
at the ground at about 1532 hours.                  There were no problems
in approaching the ground until we reached the junction of
Herries Road,           South and Penistone Road.           There were two
ambulances in front of us and a police officer was directing
us to park behind them.               A short time later, probably no
more than a minute we were moved into the entrance while the
next ambulance was sent to the further gate.                    I saw______
       standing outside the first entrance and pointing for us
to go into it.         The police officer shouted to us that if we
went to the second entrance then we would be able to get out
via the first entrance.            Dale said no and that he wanted us
to go into the first entrance.                We did so.      We were met by
Mr.Hopkins       the     Assistant           Chief     Ambulance     Officer.
Mr.Higgins was also there.               Higgins told us to drive up
behind an ambulance which was already parked and almost at
the same time Hopkins told us to go on to the field.                          At
this    stage    there      were      rows    of     police   with   vans    and
stretchers coming out of the entrance on to the pitch.                        It
was clear that there were dead bodies on at least two of the
stretchers.      I would say the time was about 1535 hours.


We were stopped by a police officer at the entrance to the
corridor to the pitch.              The officer at the front of the
ambulance said that we could not get through.                        Spectators
were shouting at us about a body on a stretcher.                     We stopped
and Hopkins came up to the ambulance and opened the door.                      I
said that the police officer said that we could not go
through and he replied that he wanted us on the pitch
immediately.         He said that there were casualties at the far
end of the ground and he needed us on the pitch and that we
were not to stop for anyone until we got to the far end of
the ground.          He told us to put our two tones on and go
through.        We    did   as   we    were     told    and went      past   the
                    policemen.        It was slow progress getting on to the pitch but
                    we certainly did not get stuck.              On the pitch we saw five to
                        six boards being used as stretchers with bodies thereon
                        being carried by fans.        We drove past them while they were
                        screaming    at   us   to   stop.      The St.John's   ambulance was
                        leaving the pitch as we came through the entrance.                    It
                        waited until we were out of the way before going off the
                        pitch.    We were the only ambulance on the pitch by this
                        stage.    We drove up to the 18 yard box in front of the west
                        stand.    There were people everywhere.         My driver was looking
                        for an officer but we could not find one anywhere. . There'
                        were fans bashing on the ambulance wanting us to stop and
                        help their friends.         We were approached by a woman and she
                        shouted     through     the    window    and    said   that    she   had
                        resuscitated a casualty.            I got out of the vehicle with a
                        bag, mask and airways, and went to a body which was lying in
                        front of the goal in the 18 yard area.             Someone was giving
                        mouth to mouth resuscitation.           I noticed the colour of the
                        patient and was doubtful whether the patient had in fact
                        been revived.     All the time there were people shouting at me
                        for oxygen and all I could remember shouting was "one at a
                        time."      I knelt down over a male casualty and                someone
                        deliberately kicked me in the back and said "what about my
>     t   vnA       daughter."       I continued to look after the boy on             the floor.
                ^ 1.—       —
hrs d^'-jkrcr           j decided that we needed to move him.              I told the people
    fv^             around me to pick him up and I shouted to someone to bring a
                        girl that I had also briefly seen.             I would say it was now
about 1540 hours.         I looked for my driver and he had driven
over to the other side of the goal towards the corner flag.
We carried the bodies over to the ambulance and I was being
followed by people carrying other bodies.                When I got to the
ambulance I saw that someone had already opened the back
doors.     I asked a police officer to stay with me to look
after me after I was kicked.             We put the young boy on the
left hand side and the girl on the right hand side and
someone else put another body on the floor down the middle.
Then someone tried to get another person into the ambulance.
I shouted to the policeman to take the person off and he did

so.


When I turned round again the ambulance was packed with
people and so I asked the police to clear the ambulance.
The doors were closed but I could hear people kicking the
back doors and wanting attention.                In the ambulance there
were     now   three     bodies,    a   nurse,     two    policemen,   two
spectators, my driver and me.              One of the spectators was
trying    to   revive      the young     boy.      The    nurse was    from
Nottingham.     She had been a spectator who had volunteered to
help during the chaos on the pitch.              She was using a bag and
mask correctly.         The other spectator was holding the head of
the girl.      I told                   to get going.          [put on the
lights and horns and drove off the pitch.                  I have no idea
what time it was by now.           I assume that the man on the floor
was dead.      I tended to the girl and showed how to do mouth
       to mouth    resuscitation while   the   spectator did cardiac
       compressions.                                          I cannot
       remember anything about getting out of the ground and I do
       not know what time it was.        I remember nothing of the
       journey up to the Northern General Hospital.


9.     We took the three bodies into casualty and I assisted the
       doctor for a few minutes.     We then loaded trolleys back on
       to the ambulance.    I asked the spectator nurse to come back
       with us and she agreed.     I cannot remember any instructions
       as to what we were to do next.       We drove back down to the
       ground and I could hear conversations on the radio to do
       with Hillsborough but I was not really taking them in.


10 .   There were no problems in the approach to the ground, with
       police cars everywhere.       This time we went through the
       second entrance.    There were a couple of ambulances ahead of
       us.    I also saw a West Yorkshire   ambulance.   I said   to
               that I would report to an officer to see what wanted
       to be done.     I went to an ambulance officer in the yard
       although I do not know his name.        He said that
       was to stay with his vehicle and     that I was to help    asmuch
       as I could.     I went back to the ambulance to tell IZZ        to
       stay with his vehicle but discovered that he had gone.           I
       went to the next ambulance and helped myself to a first aid
       box.   Just then a casualty on a trolley was brought up.        He
       appeared asthmatic and semi-conscious.       I put him on the
       second     ambulance.   Then   the   attendant   on   the   second
       ambulance,                arrived with another casualty.      Once
       they were loaded, that ambulance set off to the hospital.


11.    I then met another officer whom I did not know.        He told me
       to help some of the casualties out and pointed towards the
       gym.   I did not realise before this that the casualties were
       in the gym.      I went into the gym and met Station Officer
       Higgins.     He said that I was to assist priorities.       I then
       helped with trolleys and directed arriving ambulance men to
       priority casualties.     Each time I loaded a priority onto a
       trolley I went back to the senior officer in the yard to
       tell him what I had done and asked for more instructions.
       He would then tell me to go looking for priorities again.


12 .   At one stage I offered to be a runner because there appeared
       to be no communication system between the officers at the
       ground as the radios were not working.      Within a short space
       of time we did not need trolleys and were onto the walking
       wounded.     By this time I felt exhausted and explained to
       Station Officer Higgins that I had been kicked.        He told me
       that I had to go to casualty.        I did not want to.     He said
       that there was a vehicle going to Hallamshire Hospital and
       said that I should go with it.


13.    I was at the Hallamshire for about 20 minutes.
       then arrived with some doctors who were needed at casualty.
      it was quite by accident that we met up at the Hallamshire.


14.   The control officer on the radio told us to have a drink at
      the Hallamshire.        We did so and we took two transfers to
      King Edward Hospital.            We finished at King Edwards at about
      1900 and then control told us that we were finished.                        We
      went back to the station, cleaned the ambulance and went off
      shift.


15.   I was not aware that there was any Hillsborough plan or of
      the role that the gym was the play in it.                     I did not realise-
      that     the   gym   was    the casualty           clearing centre or       the
      temporary mortuary until I was told by one of the officers.
      I was aware of       the major incident plan prior to this.

Dear Mr Daines
Hillsborough Documentation
I write following my conversation with Superintendent Hepworth (retired) on Monday.
As you may know, a solicitor representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group has
asked for sight of certain documentation under the terms of Rule 57 of the Coroner’s Rules
1984. The relevant phraseology there refers to documents taken in evidence.
The majority of documents requested have caused no problems but documents originally
given exhibit number C349 and C350 seem rather more difficult.
C349 relates to recollections of Superintendent Marshall which were read out in their
entirety on day 27 of the inquest. C350 relates to a voluntary statement of the same
officer which was read out in part before being interrupted by legal arguments. Both
documents were then withdrawn from the jury and were expunged from the list of exhibits.
Whether they are documents taken in evidence must remain a matter of some conjecture.
I take the initial view that they were taken in evidence even if the jury were later told to
disregard them and that it would be unnecessarily officious to hold that Rule 57 did not
apply. In the first instance this is of course entirely a decision for me but I would always be
pleased to hear any representations that parties wish to make before making a final
decision.
However, Mr Hepworth has suggested to me today that one or both documents
(particularly C350) should be covered by Public Interest Immunity. This is obviously a
complex issue which I will have to research further but I would be glad if you would let me
know:
• whether South Yorkshire Police do wish to claim that Public Immunity applies
• if so on what basis
• what is the authority for a police force claiming Public Interest Immunity (as opposed to
  a public body such as the Police Complaints Authority).

                                       Fax: (0114)272-6247
                                                                                        CJA7013I.DOC
Fairly obviously, these arguments are primarily irrelevant in respect of C349 which is printed
in the transcript of Day 27 for anyone to see, so our considerations should no doubt be
focused upon C350.
I appreciate that you may wish to take legal advice on this difficult subject but nonetheless I
would be grateful for your reply when possible.
if you have any queries in the meantime please do not hesitate to contact me.
Yours sincerely




C P Dorries

                       SECTION H - INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
                     SUB-SECTION 5 - DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

REQUESTS FOR COPIES OF INTERNAL REPORTS AND POLICE
OFFICERS’ STATEMENTS
Copies of reports compiled by police officers should not, under any circumstances, be
disclosed. Where a court or a tribunal makes such a request this will be forwarded to the
Senior Nominated Officer who, at the discretion of the Chief Constable, will inform the
court or tribunal that, since such documents may contain expressions of opinion (other than
expert opinion) and not strictly evidence, their disclosure would be likely to impose
constraints upon future reporting, which could ultimately act against public interest A
similar procedure will be adopted where such requests are made by individuals or their legal
representatives, or the representatives of other agencies or orgamsations.

Copies of statements made by police officers in the course of an investigation into a section
85 complaint should not be disclosed and action taken as described in (a) to (c) above. In
claiming public interest privilege in respect of such statements, it should be borne in min
that the basis of the privilege is that disclosure would be likely to impede the statutory
purpose of section 85 by inhibiting police officers from giving full and frank co-operation.

Copies of statements made by police officers in the course of criminal investigations should
generally not be disclosed on the grounds that they may not be directly relevant to the civi
proceedings and/or that they may contain expressions of opimon. Copies of such statements
may be released, but only with the permission of the Superintendent (Management Services),
who will have the discretion to release a copy of the statement rather than insisting the
interview procedure referred to in the following paragraphs.

 Where it is considered appropriate, the facility to interview a police officer should be
 communicated to the person making the request.

 REQUESTS FOR INTERVIEW WITH POLICE OFFICERS - GENERAL
 CONDITIONS
 Interviews with police officers on any matter other than road accident cases < where chl|<*
 care proceedings are involved, will be authorised by the Senior Nominated Officer and will
 normally be permitted to enable a solicitor to obtain a proof of police evidence for a civil
 action arising from cases in which there are no criminal proceedings or criminal proceedings
 have been finalised. Confirmation must have been received from the solicitor concerned that
 an appearance has been entered in the action or that a notice of defence has been delivered.

RE: HILLSBOROUGH DOCUMENTATION

I refer to our meeting of Monday 28 September 1998, during which you requested that I provide
you with copies of three exhibits from the Hillsborough Inquests and a copy of the transcript of
the proceedings of the initial inquest held on 19 April 1989.

Please find the following documents encolsed:-

1      Exhibit C514 - (I have copied the three pages of this document contained in the exhibit
       folder - a copy of the front cover and pages 40 and 42 of the South Yorkshire Police
       Standing Instructions for the Policing of Football Matches).

2      Exhibit C515 - second page. (Please note that the original is a poor copy and I have
       enhanced it as much as possible).

3      Exhibit C533 - (Although this document refers to enclosed correspondence there is no such
       correspondence attached to the document in the exhibit folder).

4      I am unable to find any transcript of the initial inquest held on 19 April 1989. Although we
       do have a transcript of what became known as the mini inquests, held from 18 April 1990 to
       4 May 1990, which runs to 1259 pages, plus 248 plans and also 248 photographs.

   SUBJECT:        FA Cu? SEMI FINAL - 9 April 195£


 I refer to the enclosed! correspondence regarding the above event. I have
 liaised with the officers concerned with the preparation, control and
 super-vision of the abcve event and we have noted locally the lessens that
 were learned and the improvements that can be cade for any similar future
 event. Generally I was well satisfied with the event and I will confine this
 report to matters which effect the Force Operations Room and Road Traffic
 Department.

 COKCJinCATIONS

 On the day more use than normal was mace of the radio link between ground
 .control at Hillsborough and the Operations rocn in attempting to contact
 those units equipped with both crcund control ar.c UKF radio. This was
 entirely due to difficulties in personal radio transmissions which were
 effected for most of the event by breakthrough from local radio. The
 Superintendent (Cocrmmications) is aware of this and an immediate survey
 of the equipment was cace after the event, but the fault could not be traced.

 TRAFFIC FLOW AND CONTROL

 Transmissions in relation to problems with traffic, from mobile units and
 the spotter plane were being received at Operations roost and were not
 monitored at ground control. It seems sensible to me that for future 'semis'
 all Eatters relating to the control and movement of traffic should be
 supervised by Operations rocn, with the exception of the local arrangements
 made immediately outside the ground when the final whistle is blown.

 FOOT HALL TRAFFIC SICr.'S

Purpose made signs have been requested in the past, but for financial
reasons have not been approved. Such signs are extremely beneficial and
it is pleasing to r.cte that Superintendent Erougham is locking into this
aspect.

S£AF.C-.ISS OF COACHES FC=. ALCOHOL AEUSS ETC.

The effect of alcohol on football supporters is well known and I would not
wish to see anv relaxation of enforcement of the laws relating to the carriage
of alcohol on coaches etc. It is appreciated that this can cause sense t r a m c
congestion, but surveys are being carried out on the major roads approaching
the city to ■establish where this can be carried out to cause rJLnimum
inconvenience to traffic flows.

CLOSE CIRCUIT TV LINK WITH WADS LEY BRIDGE STATION

A TV monitor was sited in the control rocta giving pictures frcn Wadsley Eridge
Railway Station. This jaonitor took up valuable room in the control area and
was of little use and I would not wish such a system to be implemented in the
future.                                  ' '•

                         DRAFT LETTER TO ANN ADLINGTON FROM PETER METCALF



                   Dear Miss Adlington

                   Hillsborough : SYP Documents

                   Further to my earlier fax and in the hope that the matter of the Order is quickly sorted

                   out I thought it might be helpful to set out some points about the inspection process

                   which as far as my clients are concerned can begin at 2 days notice as soon as the

                   Order is agreed.



                   Firstly the Hillsborough archive is stored at Heeley Police Station, Windsor Road.

                   Sheffield.




                   Although this is not a normal working police station it is the headquarters of the

                   Discipline & Complaints Department of the South Yorkshire Police and accordingly

                   there are one or two security issues which I should deal with initially -




                   1        The registration numbers of vehicles which will be entering the car park and

                            will be parked there must be known and logged in advance. This can be done

                            direct with Alan Hepworth.



                   2        Access will be restricted to yourself and legally qualified staff with names,

                             notified in advance. For the avoidance of doubt this does not in any way affect

                            what happens to documents which you copy and take away                That is a matter

                             regulated solely by your undertaking.
1 4 - S E P . 99 S T UE ) 0 9 : 0 8    S. Y. P. C H I E F DEPT                 T E L T I I U 25 25 48 1   848




                      3         Access will be available from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm Monday to Friday but

                                 always with prior notification.



                      4.        My clients will provide a room for document examination which will have a

                                 power supply. There will also be access to washroom facilities



                      5.        My clients propose that they will work their way through the requested

                                 documentation dealing first with that which is not to be the subject of a

                                 supervision charge. They propose to bring through boxes, one at a time for

                                 examination




                      6.        The intention is that a police officer or civilian member of staff will be present

                                  in the room during inspection but not in hearing of any conversation



                      7.        If requested our clients will make available without charge an audio tape player

                                  and a VHS video player and monitor        As these are normal working items of

                                 equipment for use at the police station they are likely to be required from time

                                 to time for other purposes but I would not expect this to create any difficulties

                                 Please let me know if they are required.



                      8.        If there are non-standard audio or video tapes there will be no equipment

                                  available to play these
1 4 - S E P . ' 99 (TIJE1 0 9 : 0 8     S. Y. P. C H I E F DEPT                    T E L : 0 1 1 4 2 5 2 3 4 8 1 848       P, 009




                      9.        Turning to the question of copying you indicated that you would probably

                                 bring !’0 ” p own copying machine and power will be available for this as noted

                                 above. Alternatively my clients will provide copies of plain A4 material at a

                                 price of          p per A4 sheet.



                      10        If you require copies of items other than plain A4 then my clients will endeavor

                                 to arrange this on the following basis:-



                                 A3 - black & white per sheet

                                 Colour photocopying per A4 sheet

                                  Photographic prints per print

                                  VHS video tapes                    each

                                  Normal audio interview tapes              each



                       11.        T here   may be some items which my clients can neither copy nor arrange for

                                  copying eg. BBC broadcast standard video tape             In such cases it will be for

                                  you to make use of the reference numbers to obtain material direct from the

                                  BBC



                       I now turn to the categories of documents requested but before doing so I should deal

                       with that part o f your fax of 6 September 1999 relating to where items may be located.

                       I am instructed that it has been the policy of the South Yorkshire Police to locate

                       Hillsborough documentation (including the box referred to in your letter) in the archive

                       at Heeley Police Station.           I am also instructed so far as my clients are aware no

                       material has been moved out of the archive save to deal with the requirements of Lord
1 4 - S E P . ' 9 9 I TUEI 0 9 : 0 9    S V. P. C H I E F DEPT                   T E L :0 1 14 252348




                       Justice Stuart Smith and those of Mr Cadbury. It may be that there is other relevant

                       material elsewhere but (with the exception of item 9 which I will deal with below) mv

                       clients do not accept an obligation to search for the indicated material except within

                       the archive at Heeley Police Station,



                       As to the specific items: -



                        1.        No comment needed



                       2          I am told that there are no notebooks known to bewithinthe            archive.   Any

                                   "recollections" o f the type referred to should be found within item 1 above.




                        3         No comment needed



                       4          My instructions are that nomeetings were taperecorded.           I am alsoinstructed

                                   that my clients are not aware o f any other notes of meetings within this

                                   category attended by the Defendants other than those for which you have the

                                   notes. This is being checked further     At this stage I have no instructions in

                                   relation to notes of any meetings at which assertions of fact about Hillsborough

                                   were made in the days and weeks following the disaster but at which the

                                   Defendants were not present. However, as such notes would be a chargeable

                                   item it is for you to indicate whether a search to be made.




                                   For the avoidance of doubt all of the foregoing excludes any consideration of

                                   notes of meetings at which Counsel or solicitors were present.

              5      You probably have most of these items already but if there are any others then

                    , they will be produced



               6.    My instructions are that there are no tapes other than those already produced



               7.    This of course is now restricted to officers o f the rank of Inspector and below.

                         Otherwise no comment.



               8.    I await hearing whether you wish a search to be made m respect of this

                         chargeable item.




               9.    My clients tell me that they do not have a copy of Mr Bume's report I believe

                         I have a copy which was loaned to Lord Justice Stuart Smith and subsequently

                         returned I will try and locate this and send it to you.




               The remaining items were left over to be the subject of a furthei Application if so

               advised




               This bnngs me to the issue of the HOLMES computer. My clients believe there may

               be some misunderstanding here in that all of your requests are for original signed

               documentation HOLMES is not (or was not then) a scanning system and the material

               entered on the HOLMES system is entered by way of copy typing.                        None of it

               therefore can be described as original signed material although no doubt within the
1 4 - S E P . ' 9 9 ( TUE) 0 9 : 0 9   S. Y. P. C H I E F DEPT             T E L : 0 1 1 4 2 5 2 3 4 81   848                 p n’ ■




                       physical files there are statements printed off from HOLMES and then signed by the

                       maker



                       It would be helpful to know now if this affects your wish to have access to the

                       HOLMES material



                       Aside from these points my clients are writing as indicated to The Home Office to ask

                       whether there are any legal or security objections and are also obtaining comments

                       from their own technical expert on HOLMES as regards any technical issues.




                       I hope that our Counsel will be hearing from Mr Jones in the very near future



                       Yours sincerely

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: I will make the following order - who
             is going record the order?

                     MR. GODSMARK:   I will, your Honour.

                     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Would you do it?
    B
                     MR. GODSMARK: Yes.

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I say order, it is not really an
             order because parts of it are ordered and parts are not. I am
             going to give the result of the day.

                   MR. GODSMARK: M y Lord, I beg your pardon, but before you do
              so, there are concerns about undertakings.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, I will list the things and then we
              will do the - subject to conditions which I shall look at with
              Counsel in a moment and following the arguments that have been
              presented to me, the South Yorkshire Police will make available
              for inspection and copying, at their expense, the matters set
              out in paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of the letter of the 20th of
    D         August of 1999 from the Hillsborough Family Support Group to the
              Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Ian Danes.

                      Insofar as 4 is concerned, the South Yorkshire Police will
              make that available, if it contains assertions of fact made by
              either of the two defendants. To the extent to which it does
              not, the Prosecution are entitled to see those documents on
    E         payment of - it is £30 an hour? That is an agreed fee for
              t h e ...?

                     MR. JONES:   It is not agreed, m y Lord,   it imposed by....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:     Payment of a fee which I shall discuss
              with Counsel later.

                   5. Insofar as photographs and video tapes taken on the day,
              they will be made available to the Prosecution in the same way
              as 1, 2 and 3. Then as far as the photographs and video tape and
              the balance, will be on payment on a fee which I shall determine
              later.

                     6. Is in categories of 1, 2 and 3, as is 7.

                     8. Available on payment of a fee.

                     9. The same as categories 1, 2 and 3.

                     10 and 11 I shall consider later,      if it is necessary to do
               so.

                     12.       Unless the Prosecution and the South Yorkshire police
    H          carl reach agreement, I will decide that issue at the begining of

J. L Harpham Ltd.
             October, in London, at a time to be arranged through m y clerk,
             and 13 I am not dealing with today.
                   Right, fee. You want £30 for providing a civilian to
             supe r v i s e .

                  MR. GODSMARK: Including the copying. We are doing all the
             copying included in t h a t .

                  MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Let us not deal with the copying
             because either they bring there own photocopier or,
    B       alternatively, they are going to get it on disc anyway. So what
             about just the person who is going to suprevise this?

                   MR. GODSMARK: All that I can say about this is that it is
              the estimate of Mr. Danes, the Assistant Chief Constable, is
              that that what it costs him to have an individual there, in
              terms of payment for that individual, support services and all
              the unseen o v e r h e a d s .

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

                    MR. JONES: Well, m y L o r d ---

                   MR. GODSMARK: Sorry, I beg m y learned friend's pardon, with
              the observation that that is about what it costs to get your car
              serviced these d a y s .
    D
                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: A little bit more, perhaps, but anyway.
              Mr. Jones?

                       MR. JONES: Well, m y Lord, the origin of our complaint is,
              as your Lordship knows, that there was a levy of £30 an
              h o u r ....
    E
                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: What do you say it should be? You are
              going to have to p a y something under t h e ....

                   MR. JONES: Well, we would have said that ten was more than
              adequate, more than enough. It is not buying a house, I know, my
              Lord, but one would have thought that - m y Lord there is a deep
              history of lack of trust between the two sides here.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:      I appreciate that.   I cannot deal with
              that today.

                   MR. JONES: No, of course not, but, m y Lord, £30 an hour we
              would regard as extortionate, bearing in mind, m y Lord, if I may
              just make this point, the South Yorkshire Police have procured
              all the costs of the defence from the beginning of this private
              prosecution, all the costs and out of pocket expenses for the
              defendants. M y Lord, in those circumstances, now that the matter
              has gone past committal, one would have hoped for a little more
              gracious attitude as the CPS have shown, who are not charging us
              anything.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:     £20 an hour. Next point?
    H               MR. GODSMARK:    Confidentiality.

                                                   -2-

J. L Harpham Ltd.
     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Confidentiality.

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, there are undertakings implied on
any disclosure exercise.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes.

     MR. GODSMARK: In m y submission, it is desirable, in the
circumstances that we have h e r e , that those undertakings be
acknowledged and also that we are aware w e l l ....

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:  Would you like to draft them now and
then I will retire while you draft them with Mr. Jones, and if
you cannot reach agreement, I will rule on it. Do you think you
can reach agreement on that?

     MR. GODSMARK:    I am sure.

      MR. JONES: Well, m y Lord, I would submit that we ought to
be bound  by such undertakings, as implied at common law. M y Lord
it has been decided in the case of T a y l o r , by the House of
Lords, last year. There is another case called Mahn and R a h n . My
Lord, we should be subject to exactly the same implied
undertakings as though we were defendants in the case or
prosecutors.

        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, I am giving you - because of the
w a y we have approached today - yo u have got a lot, Mr. Jones. I
want you to draft the undertakings, work together so that we do
not have any problems.

     MR. JONES: Well, m y Lord, we will try and agree, we try and
agree in q uarte r - o f - a n - h o u r . If not, we will have to ask your
Lordship to rule.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:     First of all, y ou set out the ones you
are prepared to g i v e .

     MR. JONES: Well, m y Lord,       I say the common law is adequate
protection, as it stands.

     MR.   JUSTICE HOOPER: Just draft what you say the common         law
does and   then we will see how far apart you are.

      MR. JONES: V e r y well.

      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:        What else?

     MR. GODSMARK: My Lord, I think it implicit in the order
that you have made that we are talking about material that is
actually in the archive and in the possession of the Chief
Constable.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Oh, yes, definitely. Yes, this why we
have to, I say, we have to go the route of the witness summons -
you are treating it as a witness summons without actually
issuing i t .
                      M R . GODSMARK:   I   see     th e   p o in t o f t h a t ,   yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, all right, quarter-to-two, please.
              You will now draft those under t a k i n g s . I think this order is so
              important that it ought to be drawn up rather more as if it was
              in a civil c a s e .

                   MR. JONES:      I am sure m y learned friend and I can deal with
              that.
    B
                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Could you do that?

                   MR. JONES: M y Lord, I genuinely am anxious about this, my
              Lord. There is a big point of principle here. M y Lord, we do not
              understand why we are not to be trusted to receive documents on
              exactly the same basis as a prosecutor or defence team would, in
              any criminal c a s e ....

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well, Mr. Jones, you m a y be right, you
              may be wrong, but the first thing we going are going to do is
              draft what you say you are prepared to give.

                      MR. JONES: Yes.

                   MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Having done that, if there is
    D         disagreement, and it is now quarter-to-five, it may be things
              will get delayed.

                      MR. JONES: Ver y well.

                                                  (Short A d j o u r n m e n t )

    E              MR. JONES: My Lord, we need not decide that at the moment
              because it is at the end of all all proceedings. M y Lord, 2.3
              has gone, requiring a brief explanation of relevance to the
              material, arid the outstanding condition is 2.1 materials
              supplied and any further copies taken will be used in a bona
              fide for the purposes of the prosecution and not for any other
              purpose whatsoever. M y Lord, we have agreed, with your
              Lordship's approval, that that will apply pro tem and if we
              cannot agree, then we have liberty to re-apply the matter afresh
              at the beginning of October.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Well,                  that is what is to apply now,   for
               the time being.

                      MR. JONES: Yes.

                    MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, well, anything else? One thing I
               meant to raise in the presence of the defendants and forgot to
               do so, is there an Internet site for the...?

                      MR. JONES: Hillsborough Family Support Group. There is,
               yes.

                      MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:            Is there one?
    H

J. L Harpham Ltd.
     M R.   JO N E S :   T h e re   is ,   yes.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: The last time I had Internet site I
ordered it to be taken off because of the danger o f . ...

     MR. JONES: M y Lord, we have thought about that, a Mr. Cadby
did make observations about it. My Lord, we have got the matter
under review, I will discuss it with my learned friends. My
Lord, can I raise with your Lordship the interesting prospect
that we proposing, wit h the Court's approval, the evidence given
in the trial, if there is a trial should be posted on the
Internet.

     MR. JUSTICE HOOPER: Yes, well that is a matter we do much
later, but what I had in the last case I had an Internet site,
in that case it was the Prosecution worried about the contents
of the Internet site because the defendants were rather someone
a considerable degree of popularity. I do not want a prosecution
going wrong because of something that should not be on the
Internet site.

     MR. JONES: M y Lord, that is understood. We will make sure a
picture of your Lordship is not put on i t .

        MR. JUSTICE HOOPER:                I do not mind about that. Thank   you
v e r y much.

           I am a registered medical practitioner and a chartered chsnist.     My

           qualifications include the degrees of bachelor of Science, bachelor of

           medicine and bachelor of surgery, and the Mastership in Clinical

           Biochemistry.     I am a fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry and a

           member of the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal College of

           Pathlogists.     I hold the posts of Consultant in Chemical Pathology at

           Royal Hallamshire Hospital and Honorary Lecturer in Forensic

           Toxicology to Sheffield University.

           On the morning of 18 April 1989 (180489) I was handed a box by an

           officer who identified himself to me as Sgt John TURNER of South

           Yorkshire Police. The box contained 94 samples of blood each in a

           container with an appropriate preservative and each container being

          enclosed in a plastic bag labelled with a decedents's name and

           identifying numbers. The blood containers themselves were also

           lab ailed appropriately.    The box also contained a universal container

           in which were two tablets. This container bore a label stating that

           the tablets had been found in the stomach of                 (identifying

           numbers    and          ). On the April 18, 19 and 20(180489) (190489)

(200489) these samples were analysed under my direct supervision for

ethanol with the results given below.       Ethanol is the alcohol present

in alcoholic beverages.

likaly alcohol consumption that would produce a particular blood

not that blood alcohol level would be associated with intoxication.

As a broad guide, an average man who consumed two pints of average

beer over 2 hours might well have a blood ethanol concentration, at

that time, of about 50 milligrams per 100 millilitres.     The state

commonly recognised as being drunk is associated with large variations

in the blood alcohol concentration.     For example whilst it is unlawful

to drive a motor vehicle when the blood alcohol concentration

exceeds 80 milligrams per 100 millilitres, I have examined individuals

with few objective signs of intoxication although their

blood alcohol concentrations were in e x c e s s of

200 milligrams per 100 millilitres.      Such individuals usually have

problems related to the habitually excessive consumption

of alcoholic beverages.    On the other hand, I have seen many

individuals who were obviously impaired when their blood alcohol

concentration was below 100 milligrams per 100 millilitres.      It should

be noted that the degree of intoxication associated with a particular

blood concentration of alcohol in a particular individual is usually

greater when the concentration is rising rather than when it is

falling. (Signed)    A FORREST

           This statement is intended to supplement my statements of 20 April

           1989 (200489) and 2 May 1989 (020589) and should be read in

           conjunction with them. In the process of analysing samples of blood

           ethanol, other volatile compounds may be serendipitously detected.

           The commonest of these is acetone, although others may also be seen.

It m s apparent, in the course of analysing the blood samples obtained

at autopsy from the 94 individuals who died at or near the

Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April (150489), that many of them contained

significant concentrations of acetone and seme contained significant

concentrations of aceltadehyde.

Acetaldehyde is a difficult compound to measure accurately in blood

samples.   It may be generated spontaneously frcm ethanol after a

sample has been taken, and it is quite volatile so even if the sample

has been taken with appropriate precautions it may be lost frcm the

container in which the blood sample has been placed.      There are

also problems with the standardisation of the assay.      These aspects of

the matter are discussed more fully below.

Aftar the ethanol concentration had been measured in the 94 blood

samples, an attempt was made to quantitate the acetaldehyde and

acetone concentrations.     The results obtained are presented in tabular

and graphical form below.     Note that all the concentrations are

presented in milligrams per litre and that where the concentration of

ethanol is low, either less than 10 milligrams per 100 millilitres

or "not detected" in my original statement, the results may be

expressed differently here.     Where the concentration of ethanol is

less than 100 milligrams per litre but more than a trace is present, I

hava here expressed it arbitrarily, for purposes of statistical

analysis as 50 milligrams per litre.       Where only a trace is present I

hava expressed the concentration as 1 milligram per litre.      For all

purposes, other than the purely scientific, the results given in my

 statement of 20 April 1989 (200489) should be used.      Measurements of

 low concentrations of ethanol in blood, below 10 milligrams per 100

millilitres, are quite imprecise.

 Acetaldehyde is virtually only found in human blood samples after the
FORREST                ALEXANDER   ROBERT   WALKER                             3


consumption of ethanol.    Ethanol is metabolised by the body first to

acetaldehyde and thence to acetate.    Tables 1 and 2 and figure 7 show

the close correlation of the blood acetaldehyde and ethanol

concentrations.

It will be seen that the concentrations of acetaldehyde found are

quite high.    It is quite unusual to see substantial amounts of

acetaldehyde in blood samples submitted for ethanol analysis either

in living or dead patients.    Peak blood acetaldehyde concentrations

in normal subjects drinking ethanol might be as much as 2 milligrams

per litre.    After drugs such as carbimide, Which inhibit the

metalbolism of acetaldehyde to acetate, the concentration might rise

to 10 milligrams per litre.    Same subjects here have acetaldehyde

concentrations that are significantly higher than that (Figure 5).The

question obviously arises? "could the presence of such large amounts

of acetaldehyde in certain samples be an artifact?"       The main

mechanism by Which acetaldehyde is generated in a blood sample

containing alcohol is as follows:     A proportion of the oxyhaemoglobin

in a sample is converted to methaemoglobin with the generation of a

suparoxide radical.     This can in turn oxidise ethanol to acetaldehyde.

The stochiometry of the reaction is:

Hb02 -> MetHb + 02.

0 2 + 2 CH3CH20H -> 2 CH3CH0 + 2 H20

One haemoglobin molecule, fully oxegenated, contains 4 Hb02 subunits.

Blood contains about 2 mmol/1 of haemoglobin.        1 mole of

oxyhaemoglobin could theoretically generate 8 moles of

acetaldehyde.     Thus theoretically, the complete conversion of all the

oxyhaemoglobin in a blood sample containing an excess of ethanol would

genarate acetaldehyde at a concentration of 16 mmol/1.           That is 704

milligrams per litre.     In this instance, there is likely to have been
FORREST               ALEXANDER   ROBERT   WALKER                           4


little oxyhaemoglobin present after death.    However, even so,it is

quite possible that a substantial proportion if not all, of the

acetaldehyde present in the samples could have generated post mortem

by not metabolic oxidation of alcohol, particularly as

the samples were placed in plastic vials with a large dead space,

containing air, above the blood sample.     It is still surprising that

one does not usually see such large concentrations of acetaldehyde in

the course of normal case work.     The reason may be that post mortem

samples are usually submitted in 20 millilitre universal containers,

filled to the brim and containing little dead space, whilst clinical

samples are submitted in "vacutainers" with a significant dead space

albait with a low oxygen content.     In both cases there may be less

oxygen available to promote acetaldehyde formation.The acetone

concentrations found are probably not artifacts.       Acetone can arise as

a product of metabolism at times when glucose is not readily available

to cells or when stress hormones mobilise fat stores which are then

metabolised.    Normally, the presence of ethanol tends to inhibit the

production of acetone from the metabolism of fat, its presence

favouring the production of beta hydroxy-butyrate instead.       However

there are theoretical reasons for believing that, under circumstances

of extreme hypoxia, this mechanism would not operate and acetone would

be produced even in the presence of ethanol.        It is noteworthy that

there is little correlation between the concentration of ethanol and

the concentration of acetone in the blood samples examined here.

Acetone can be produced in large amounts during fasting.        It is

unlikely that this was a significant mechanism in this case.

Conclusions s

1) Whilst there are theoretical reasons for believing that significant

concentrations of acetaldehyde might accumulate in the blood as a
FORREST               ALEXANDER   ROBERT   WALKER                       5


result of the metabolism of ethanol during severe hypoxia, it is not

possible to state that the unusually high concentrations of

acetaldehyde found in some of the samples examined here are not an

artifact of sample collection.

2) Ihe relatively high concentrations of acetone found here are likely

to be an indication of significant metabolic stress during the agonal

period.

           Further to the three previous statements I have made concerning this

           matter which I understand have been submitted to Lord Justice Taylor's

           Inquiry through H.M. Coroners Office I should like to state the

           following.

           I had no direct contact with the events of Saturday 15th April 1989

           (150489) but through ray role as Medical Officer to a Voluntary

           Organisation I attended at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street,

           Sheffield on the 16th April (160489).   Incidental to ny visit there I

           had converstions with Professor USHER, Dr John CLARK and Professor

           Laurence HENRY who were carrying autopsies on the deceased. I also

           spoke to the Coroner and his Officer who both indicated to me that

           there would be a number of blood samples sent to me for analysis

           within the following couple of days.

           On the morning of 18th April (180489) Sergeant John TURNER of the

           South Yorkshire Police brought a box of 94 blood samples and one

           container                   to ray department at the Royal Hallamshire

           Hospital. All the containers were appropriately labelled and

           identified and I have no reason whatsoever to believe that any mis-
FOPREST                 ALEXANDER   ROBERT   WALKER                           2


identification has taken place at any stage.

However, I did notice immediately that the blood samples were

contained in plastic 5 millilitre containers usually used for blood

samples taken for blood glucose analysis.      This poses of itself a

number of problems:

(a)       It has been shown a number      of occasions that a volatile

          substance such as ethanol (the alcohol in alcoholic

          beverages) can diffuse relatively rapidly from such

          containers.     This might be over a period as short as a few

          days.     This is because the container is plastic as opposed

          to glass and is I think caused by permeation through the

          plastic.     In other words over a period of time there could

be           a drop in the measurable alcohol content of the sample

          without the container being opened.

          Over the period of two or three days from these samples

          being taken to being analysed in my department I would not

          think that such a drop could be very great.       I would be very

          surprised if in any individual case it had exceeded 10

(b)       The particular container used is marked and designed to

          leave a considerable dead space above the blood sample -

          that is to say that the tube is filled to only about 50        of

          its capacity.     This leaves   in comparative terms a

          considerable amount of air      in the gap between the sample and

          the top of the container.       Ethanol could evaporate into that

          air and would thus be lost every time the container was

          opened.     Further the oxygen in the air by virtue of a

          complex reaction with the haemoglobin in the blood and

          the ethanol present can lead to a significant reduction in

          the ethanol concentration by a process of oxidation.       I
FOP REST              ALEXANDER   ROBERT   WALKER                           -3


            regret to say that there is evidence that such oxidation

            took place because the blood samples were found to contain

            an unusually high proportion of acetaldehyde. This is an

                                                    ,
            oxidation product of ethanol. However it seems to me

            unlikely that this oxidation could account for a loss or

            more than 5 of the ethanol concentration during the period

            between the samples apparently being taken and being

            analysed in my department.
(c)         The particular type of container used tends to leak once it

            has been opened and closed more than a few tunes.   This is

            generally undesirable from both the analytical and safety

            point of view.   Obviously if blood can leak out, air can

            leak in which would further increase the process of

            oxidation and thus alcohol loss.

It is of interest to comment that when I was at the Medico legal

Centre I did not see any of the tubes that I have referred to in

evidence in the post-mortem room.     I can only speculate that blood

samples were taken by the Pathologist and held in glass universal

containers (this would be the normal course) and then transferred in

part into the type of container that I have referred to by either

Mortuary attendants of Scenes of Crimes Officer from the Police.        I

did see a Pathologist taking one sample into a universal container

which leads me to believe that my supposition is in fact probably

accurate.
Despite my reservations about the type of container used for blood

samples I would like to stress that in my opinion the results achieved

by :ny analysis are sufficiently accurate for general conclusions to be

drawn about the alcohol contents of individual blood samples at the

tine of death.     In other words although I would not wish to claim that
       FORREST                ALEXANDER    ROBERT   WALKER


       the results of the analysis obtained must be absolutely accurate they

       are certainly not going to be very far wrong.
       I drew the attention of H.M. Coroner to the question of the blood

       sample containers at an early stage.
       I should also like to say that in relation to my first statement it

       will be noticed upon a careful scrutiny that the numbers accorded to

       the deceased on three occasions are in fact exactly the same numbers

       as the blood alcohol content in milligrams per one hundred

       millilitres.     This was notice immediately in my department and has

       been carefully checked.       It is pure coincidence however bazaar that

       may seem.   I have also drawn this matter to H.M. Coroner's attention.


                                                                          SIGNED

    I refer to your recent telephone conversation with Constable Ken Greenway, South Yorkshire
    Police, regarding the above named, Mr

    Mr           Is seeking damages from South Yorkshire Police for a sum up to £400,000 in

    connection with the 1989 Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Mrj         blaims that he was at
    the Heysel Stadium when he experienced some trauma.

    I would be obliged if you could forward to Constable Greenway any reports relating to Mr
             1attendance at the European Cup Final between Liverpool and Juventus, which
    was held at the Heysel Stadium, as this may have a bearing on his current action against
    South Yorkshire Police.

    W e are required to submit our defence by 28 March 2001, so an early reply would be
    appreciated.

Dear Mr

Please accept my apologies for the delay in replying. To be frank I wished to speak to staff at
Headquarters to see if you had made any other approaches. My opinion is that you have a
professional interest in the policing of Hillsborough and I did not wish to take a line which is contrary to
that taken by colleagues. If you could do me the courtesy of explaining what your professional interest
is (if I am correct that is) then at least there will be no ambiguity in our communications.

However, on re-reading your E- Mail I can answer your query quite easily. South Yorkshire Police do
not own the CCTV within Hillsborough. SWFC is a commercial enterprise and you should approach
the club about their system. To the best of my knowledge Sheffield North do not possess and CCTV
recordings.

Our Data Protection Officer is Ms G. Bower-Lissaman and she can be contacted at Police
Headquarters in the Audit and Data Protection Unit. If you have any further queries I would be obliged
if you would route them through our Legal Services Department at Police Headquarters, perhaps
explaining what your profession is, precisely what you want and why.

my previous correspondence in this matter, particularly as I am sure that
you must have a very sizeable workload to contend with. However, I must
draw your attention to the fact that it is now seven days since I received
any additional response from you with respect to my request for information
regarding video recordings made at Hillsborough stadium.
Therefore, can you please confirm that South Yorkshire Police does not have
copies of the material that I outlined to you in my e-mail of 26/01/01 in
its posession.
Alternatively, if South Yorkshire Police does have such material in its
posession, then I would obliged if you can provide me with the contact
details of the appropriate Data Protection Officer or other applicable
official to whom I can address a request for access to this material under
the terms described in the Data Protection Act.
Best Regards

Dear Supt. Wilson,
Thank you for your reply.  Please accept my apologies for not providing you
with an adequate qualification of my request.
As I am sure you are aware, CCTV and other video recordings of individuals
are now classified as "personal data" and as such are incorporated into
Section 7(1) of the Data Protection Act 1998.  For me to correctly address
any request that I may wish to make regarding such recordings, I first need
to establish which organisation owns the various cameras that I may have
appeared on and which organisations may have copies of material produced by
those systems.  In view of the fact that I witnessed one of your officers
with a hand held video camera taking recordings of the crowd, I thought it
not unreasonable to assume that the Police may also be using fixed position
cameras for crowd monitoring purposes.
I am presuming by your response that this is not the case and that South
Yorkshire Police do not own any CCTV cameras within Hillsborough stadium
and
do not hold any recordings made by any CCTV system within the stadium.   If
my presumption is incorrect and South Yorkshire Police may have such
recordings, can you please provide me with the name of the Data Protection
Officer or another appropriate official to whom I may address any requests
that I may have pertaining to the access of this material under the terms
of
the Data Protection Act.

Dear Supt. Wilson,
Thank you for your reply, I look forward to receiving Mr. Nesbitt's
correspondence.
In the meantime, I would be grateful if you could clarify the location of
the CCTV cameras for the West Stand and the concourse area behind the Upper
West Stand along with an indication of which ones are under the control of
South Yorkshire Police and which ones are operated by the club.

Dear John,

Re:                 SW FC v Bolton

Further to our discussion regarding the above please find a copy of my E mail to him,
simply confirming that you will be replying. I sent this because I did indicate that I
would make a reply.

I have asked the officers that were in the W est Stand that if any approach is made to
them directly then they should refer the matter straight to me. I have also spoken
briefly to Jim Greensmith in case the above makes direct contact to our press office.
In fact Jim knew of this man because he has requested access to material from the
force.

About the W est Stand a couple of officers on that serial were approached by different
members of the visiting fans about the issue of seats - i.e. they were sitting in other’s
seats or the opposite situation, and a couple of arguments had broken out. I know
you mentioned about how the tickets are sold and this may be something to consider.

I can see how it is easier to manage a group together, rather than separate blocks -
is it possible to somehow remove seat numbers for certain matches when we do not
anticipate a large away contingent? Possibly not. I appreciate this is your province
John, it is just something we may wish to bear in mind.




All the best,




Richard Wilson

Re; Fax complaint - Mi                            iWFC v Bolton

Enclosed is a copy of a fax sent to me by a Mr         Despite his last paragraph he seems
an eminently reasonable bloke who on the face of it makes a reasonable point. I remember
you saying something to me about a Bolton fan in the Upper West Stand being displaced but I
cannot remember the detail.

I honestly believe that the stewarding and policing of the away fans is very good, but I don’t
really feel qualified to reply in detail to his points. Could you perhaps consider the points he
raises and either write or ring me with your views? I will then provide him with a more
considered response that the acknowledgement e-mail I sent.

Dear

Thank you for your fax.dated 23 January 01. You are right in your assertion that the admission and
seating policy is set by the club and that the police are simply there as a public order contingency.
You are also right that it is possible to create the very situation one is trying to avoid by adopted
certain policies.

To be honest, we do not normally have problems by using the Upper West Stand for away supporters.
We very successfully maintain segregation between opposing fans and the manner in which fans
arrive and exit the ground tends to optimise public safety. Indeed your is the first letter of complaint I
have received about this issue whilstcCommanding football matches at Hillsborough.

You raise some valid points which I will discuss with the club safety officer with whom I have an
excellent working relationship. I will write back to you to address all the you points you have raised in
due course. Thank you for raising your concerns in such a constructive manner.

Yours faithfully,

                                      R E : Sheffield Wednesday FC



   Dear Supt. Wilson,

   On Saturday 20th. January 2001,1attended the Sheffield Wednesday versus Bolton
   W anderers match al Hillsborough stadium. I had purchased two tickets from Bolton
   Wanderers for the Upper West Stand - Row 32, seats 84 and 85. As I approached the
   turnstile, I noted that there was also turnstile that was operating a cash entry policy.

A After entering the stadium and proceeding to the allotted gangway, I approached a steward to
W s e e k directions to our seats. His reply was “ Ignore the tickets, just sit anywhere”. This
   instruction was, however, somewhat undermined by a number of his colleagues who were
   ordering spectators to sit in the central area of the stand, although this policy was hastily
   abandoned when the balance of spectators arrived.

   Approximately 10 minutes prior to kick-off, I was approached by a man who insisted that I was
   sitting in his seats and who showed me the ticket to prove it. I explained that the steward had
   told me to sit anywhere and the man’s response was “These are my seats and if you don’t
   f***ing get up, l‘m gonna f***ing punch you". After vacating the seats, I approached a police
   officer to complain about the situation regarding seat allocation but was told that, despite his
   sympathies and agreement with my grievances, I would have to take the issue up with a
   steward. After locating a senior steward, I was told that the situation of operating a cash
   turnstile allowing unallocated positioning of spectators was standard practice.

   In a subsequent discussion with two of your officers, I was informed that the police were


•
   expecting around 1,200 visiting supporters but that the eventual figure was closer to 3,000 and
   [hat Sheffield Wednesday’s stewarding policy was geared towards smaller clubs with fewer
   traveling supporters.

   The following points are of great concern to me regarding the cash turnstile policy and general
   stewarding at the West Stand end of the Hillsborough stadium:

       1. The negating of the best method of attempting to segregate rival fans.
       2. The negating of the best source of police intelligence regarding the expected number of
          visiting fans.
       3. The risk of public order offences such as the one that I experienced, a risk which is
          compounded by there being no signs to inform fans that, once inside the stadium, their
          tickets are irrelevant.
       4. The greatly reduced ability to apprehend offenders on CCTV as, without a seat/row
          reference, there is no means for a complainant to pinpoint where an offence occurred.

   In addition, I am deeply concerned about what may have happened had another 500 or so
   Bolton Wanderers fans decided to make the trip.
                                                                                               continue

There existed, of course, excess capacity in the unopened Lower West Stand but fans with
tickets would, naturally, have made their way to their allotted place in the Upper Stand,
especially as there are no signs to warn of the seating policy. The potential threat to public
safety that this scenario would have presented is extremely serious.

As I understand it, the seating/stewarding policy is set by the club and the police role, despite
close liaison in an advisory capacity about this policy, is only to act in response to public order
offences that occur on the day. For the reasons that I have outlined, I feel that the police must
intervene in the immediate revision of this policy as it represents a clear danger to public order
and public safety.                                                                                                     '   :




The last time that I attended a match at Hillsborough was 15th. April 1989, when I was
fortunate enough to be rescued from Pen number 3 of the Leppings Lane terrace. To return
almost 12 years later and discover a policy in place that so obviously places the public’s safety
in jeopardy again almost defies belief.

 I await your comments.

Ken,
We have had an inquiry about Hillsborough footage, released to the media.

I know some tv stations have footage which we released shortly after the event. I don't think we have
ever requested a copyright fee for this material but we have now had a request for use of material for
a documentary. If we agree - a copyright fee would be payable to the Police Benevolent Fund.

My question is this: is the footage we released ours or does it belong to Sheffield Wednesday (or this
they pass the ownership to use)

The programme producer is also asking: do we or don't we have footage in our possession recorded
by Sheffield Wednesday's cctv cameras. This of course may include material seen in evidence but
not released for tv transmission.


I am not clear whether the footage we released was ours or Sheffield Wednesday's.

The material that was released by us is in the ITN archive so if we agreed, the programme producer
could access it there.

E DIVISION CONTRIBUTION



 I am afraid that we cannot agree with your suggestion that
 there was a fcover u p f .   First, there was the full public
 inquiry into the tragedy conducted by Lord Justice Taylor
 which reported in January; second, there was the inquest into
) the deaths at Hillsborough which took over a hundred days to
 examine the material facts.      The Home Secretary has general
 responsibility for the law governing inquests but he has no
 power to comment upon the way in which a coroner, who is an
 independent judicial officer, carries out his duties in any
 particular case.    I should also explain that it is not the
 function of an inquest to determine liability.      The law states
 that the purpose of an inquest is to ascertain the identity of
 the deceased and how, when and where he came by his death.
 The Coroners Rules specifically provide that neither the
 coroner nor the jury shall express any opinion on any other
 matters.   In addition, the Rules specifically prohibit the
 framing of an inquest verdict in such a way as to appear to
 determine any question of criminal liability on the part of a
 named person, or civil liability.      Any issue of civil or
 criminal liability is a matter for the civil or criminal
 courts and not the coroner's inquest.


 If anyone is dissatisfied with an inquest, under section 13 of
 the Coroners Act 1988 it is open to them to apply, with the
 authority of the Attorney General, for the High Court to quash
 the verdict and order a fresh inquest to be held, either by
 the same coroner or a different one.      Coroners inquests are
 also subject to judicial review by the High Court.



 [Finally, I should like to offer my sympathy to you for your
 sad loss.]

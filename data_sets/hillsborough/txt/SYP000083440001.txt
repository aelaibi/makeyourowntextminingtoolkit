              V e hi cu la r    traffic: flow was         normal     for a E-Saturday,               I was       not   required

              traffic      had      returned    to a normal        flow.         I was        then    conveyed by         police

              transit      van to the         police     driving     school           B r i g h t s i d e Lane    in order        to

At ,3.25 pm the same day                  I was      i nstructed to a t t e n d          the H i l l s b o r o u g h

I a rr i v e d at Hi 1 1 sbo rough at approx imate 3.y 3 .35 pm                            ULp-mf'llr rival       I was

instr u c t e d to take a               position      in a line on t h j ^ perimeter                  track    facing

the N ot ti n g h a m Forest            football      s u pporters /o^r what             I b e l ieved was a

public         order    situation.            I faced NottLrlgham Forest                 fans    in the S p i o n

Ho p a rea of the              football       ground.      Wmlst        at    this    location        numerous

L i v erpoo l      fans    ran towards          the S ? n o n Hop shouting abuse                 in r e t a l i a t i o n

to taunts          being       directed       by Forest Fans.

At    one      point there was a rush of L i v e r p o o 3. s u pporters                      t o w a r d s the

S p i on K o p ? a police          line was        then formed          to    push the L i v erpool

su pporters         back       towards    the L e p p i n g s Lane       end    in order        to    prevent a

large       public      order     situation.          1 remained         near    to the S p i o n Kop.              The

forest         s u pporters      co n t i n u e d to shout abuse             for some 20 minutes              before

the    reality         of the s i t ua t i on was        realised.

During         the time on the           perimeter       track     I was       continually           breaking       fans

up who were            confronting        each other with threats and abuse.

B e ca u s e    of my awa r e n e s s     of an obvious          disaster        no arrests          were made

also     due     to the number           of    confron t a t i o n s    I felt       it more a p p r o p r i a t e         to

part the         supporters        and advise         them.

I remained at the football                      gr o u n d u n t il a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4.30     pm w h e n      I

was    instructed          to    return to my traffic              point.        Once      outside      the

football         ground        I found that        traffic      cong e s t i o n was       so great       it took

us a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1 hour    to get      into the         city    centre.

I took         up my traffic        point       until    6 prn before          returning        to West Bar

Police S t a t i o n.           I was    later     t r a ns fe rr ed   to B r i g ht s i de Lane        to    retire

f rorn duty at 8 pm.

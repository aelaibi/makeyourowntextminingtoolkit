For    the     first    hour     or so things were             quiet       but by about          IE.30       pm

(1230)        fans mos t l y L i v erpool           were walk i n g along Leppings Lri towards

the    ground.         The    fans were well           behaved        but a significant               number were

carrying         cans of beer,            bottles     of wine     or      cider.        Some were       standing

in small        groups       on L e p p in gs    Lri drinking.

It was also          noticeable* that many having                     reached the ground were

walking        back along L e p pin gs           Ln asking      directions             for the    coach        parks,.

These     fans were want i n g             tickets.       They were also a p p r o a c h i n g             other

f a n s^-sm        k i n g for      'spares’.

the    faces of the fans as                  they    passed that man y                    the worse          for

drinking.          1 thought         to myself at          the time it seemed that                 m any       of

these     supporters          had tried         to get    'as muc h ale*           as    possible       down thei

necks     before       the start          of the match.

Opposite        the j u n ction of Leake Rd and L e p p i n g s                   Ln    is a small       alleyway

that    leads      to some       b un ga l o w s and f o l lowing a            complaint       that     s u p porter

                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                             S2663

At 3 O'clock             <1500)     the    crowd had d w i ndled to just a few but up to

3   pm     (1500)       the    flow of supporters              had    r e m ained    continuous.

At 3 . 0 5    pm    (1505)      together with my serial                     Fns         /l -Began to walk               to

C l a yw he el s Ln for          lunch     leaving DC Wren on t h e v j u n c t i o W.

As we wa l k e d along            L e p p i n g s Ln   I could hear messages                 on his Police

radio         but couldn't hear what was                 being said but              it was   obvious        by the

tone       of what was         being      said that       there were           problems      somewhere       and we

listened          carefully.         We    then heard a mess a g e                to the effect       that

everyone was             required on the           running       track.

On hearing          this we       immedi a t e l y      turned       round and began to walk quickly

back       to the L e p pings        Ln end of the             ground.        Whilst we were m a k i n g           our

way back          the    Inspector a t t e m p te d to          contact Police          control       for

instruct ions            but   could not get            through.           The m e s sages    that were       being

tr a ns mi t t ed       sounded to me         to be very badly garbled.                      I saw that

other       officers were also              hurrying along L e p p i n g s Ln on foot and                     in

vans.          On reaching the Leppi n g s              Ln end of the ground                 I saw a large

number       of     officers waiting.             Instructions              were    given    to form a cordon

across       the L e p pings        Ln entpanc/.           I

There were          very few        supp o r t / r s a b o V t aJ^tThis time          outside       the     ground.

These       s u pporters were          ushe r e d outside            the    cordon    line.     At    this    time

no one knew what was                 h a pp ening      or what        had happened,          some    officers

knew       that    the game       had been stopped as                 I h eard them tell            supporters

t h is „

Whilst       I was s t a n d i n g     on this         cordon    I overheard a conversation                   to the

effect       that       the/e were        casualties       inside          the gr o u n d an d even        people

dead.        As    I s i e m e c ^ m / be serv i ng no useful                pur pose   together       with

               It was my impre s s i o n that                there     had been some            sort          fight    between

               rival       fans.

               I made my way onto                the    terracing        by way of t t y d tu/tnel under               the West

               stand.        This       tunnel    was     clear.      T o g e t h e r wit h PC^Sfnart          I cleared a way

               down the terracing                      t h m fence,      dividing        paddock 41       from the         pitch.

               I saw no       c a s ua lt ie s/ ij ^t ni s       paddock     but was          subject    to a certain

               amount       of abuse       from the        crowd.

               On    reaching       the are a at          the    rear of the g o a l m o u t h    in front       of the West

               Stand,       I saw that        there were a number                 of bodies       lying all        over      this

               area.        1' realised       then that          something        of an e x t r e m e l y serious          nature

               had happened.
      m
               Ihere were a large                number     of civilians             on the     playing area,          some

               at t e m pt in g    to    r esuscitate       unconscious           people,       other    evacu a t i n g     people

               by using       boards       torn from the edge               of    pitch.

               The    s it ua t i o n was a b so lu t e         chaos.      I saw at this          time a p p r o x i m a t e l y    15

               bodies       lying       in the a rea at the            rear of         the goalmouth.          I then went           to

 ^7/ I i Q j   the    gate    that       gives access           from the     pitch to          paddock 31 whereyT" could

A. —           see    bodies       lying    towards        the bottom of the               terracing.         Tog^dher^?ith

               other       officers       I hel p e d to        remove    these        bodies    through %1~te A & t i        onto

-t0            the    running       track.        This     e v a c u a t i o n was     done    by offiSeers %farrying           tne

               body to the gate where                   myself and some              other     p o licemen took        the    body

               and m a n o e u v r e d    it t hr o u g h the gate.              The    body was       then    removed by
,L/>
               others away onto             the    ptich.

               Whi l s t    this was       going       on civilians were               scr e a m i n g abuse at       some

               officers,          others were          just w an d e r i n g about         clearly distressed.                There

               was    no d i r e c t i o n or     control at         this end of the             ground,       the whole       thing

               was    just    out of       control       w ith    people     picking          up bodies,       putting       them

               onto    boards and          carrying        them away.            We had no       idea where        the

               c asualties were            being       taken to.

               There was a point w h e n the s pe c t a t o r s                   in the West S t a n d began              jeering

had a large wet area around it* I was told this was where alcohol had

been poured down the drain after having been removed from some of the

Liverpool fans whilst we had been away from the area.

        In company with Pw GIBLI1T I continued my task at the railway station

until approximately 2 55 P ® » t h a t time we were instructed to take our

meal which we did at Uest 3ar Police Station#                                    All the Liverpool fans

X saw arriving at the railway' station were orderly.

        At approximately 3 15 P® as a result of a radio message giving the

code ’Operation Support' X travelled at speed to Hillsborough Football

ground with Pw Oiblin.

        On arrival numerous other dog handlers were present and after a sho>

while X saw officers taking their dogs into the ground at the Penistone

Road end,         I took my dog into the ground at this stage assuming it was

a public order incident.             I was        only in the ground a few minutes when

along with all the other dog handlers we were told to leave the ground

and standby at our trehicles by a 3outh Yorkshire Dog Sergeant#

        Having returned to our vehicles w® had by this time become aware

of the nature of the incident but not the magnitude of it.                                             It became

increasingly frustrating having to standby on the road outside when we

wanted to go into the ground and help.

        Eventually we were all instructed to enter the ground with our dogsj

this task was an extremely precarious one due to the large ixumber of

people running around assisting with casualties eto just inside the

ground, my dog was in an excited state due to the noise and general

movement . I eventually managed to make my way with other dog handlers

onto the pexmimeter track across the opposite end of the ground to

Leppings lane.           This end of the ground was occupied by Forest fans

and we were instructed to face them with oi*r d asea— Whilst I respeot

tile decision to have us faoing the Forest fans it seemed to me at the

time to "be unnecessary, many fans "behind the large fence were in tears

ft,
  nd none looked as though they were likely to try and climb over onto

the pitob.
       X remained in that position until just after it was announoed on

the publio address system that the game was being abandoned*                   On the

announcement being made that the game was to be abandoned an appeal ues

made to the crowd to stay calm and remain where they were rather than

lea-re tB^&rovnd so that the roads around the ground oould be kept

dear for use by the emergenoy vehioles/ a small but significant number

of fans immediately left the ground.

       On leaving the ground I went in company with Pw G13Lni in our

vehicle back towards the City Centre where we had been detailed a static

point to monitor fans returning from the ground.                 The vast majority of

these fans were very quiet and subdued.                 They were both Forest and

Liverpool fans.            After all the fans had dispersed I returned to Niagara

and subsequently returned to my own Foroe*

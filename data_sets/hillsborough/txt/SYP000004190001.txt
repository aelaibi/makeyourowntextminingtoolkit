                to the shops         in M i d d l e w o o d R oad for some        clothesanyway.                               LL^'L

                The supporters were happy,                   cheerful        like they usually are.                  The

a blue     steel      barrier      stop an yon e         climbing      over.      Two     kids      in

Liverpool       colours         were    s i 11 i ng. _on top of the w a l l ,- the           barrier wa s

broken,     I c ou l d see        the    jagged edge.            They di s a p p e a r e d   into the

ground.        A minute         after    that     I saw the       con c e r t ina g a t e,     the second

one    beside      the    turnstiles        13,    14,   15 and       16 open to arms            lengths.           I

couldn't,      see w h o       opened    them     but at that         point,     the gate* j u st s hot

open no o t h e r words           for    it,    half of the         crowd at the front just

di sap peared.           The    rest f o l lowed     in pursuit,          it was        like w a t e r     thro u g h

a hole.        The    rest seemed to just stop dead a t t h e r > I

of fic ial s    in front of the g a t e .

The off ic ia ls stopped the               crowd for a few m i n u t e s            but at this            point,

I thought       no more and wal ked home.                   At hqifte I found out what-.~had

hajaiayw f ^ o n     the television.              At this    I gr abbed my pedal              bike a n d w i t h

it I made my way back along Leppings Lane.                                U n b e l i e v e a b l y , L i v erpool

fans were still            making       their way towards            the ground*          only s t r a g g l e r s

 bout fifty or more.                   1 made my way to the ground,                     to where the BBC

cameras and the floodlight s were erected,                             the S o u t h stand.              I came to

a m i n it ur e set of conc ertina gates 6 ' in height,                             I    looked t h r o u g h I

was    behind the electronic               scoreboard.

At this     time      I could see what was               happening*          T here wa«        bodies          on

the    pitch.        I could see a w o m a n on            the    right hand Side Of the                  pen.          I

could see her            face   pushed     into the        railings.                                      "X

this shouting and neard                 this Liverpool            fan sh outing at a PjolJ.c©ffian_jgh

fan was dr essed           in a funny          coloured jumperj           horizontal         st ripe s and

blue    jeans.        I could see         people     in the top stand trying to pull

people from the Ho p up                 into the stand.            P h o t o g r a p h e r s were   ru nning up

to the    pen,       taking     phot ographs of those               crushed      inside.         There was

scream ing and shouting                 ’Get me out        of here*       and pulling at the

fence.      The      last thing         I saw was a        P o l i c e m a n he had pulled a t e n ye«r
            old boy from the pert over              the    fence,    carried h i m   in his arms and        laid

            him oY* the       pilch.     He then took off the b o y ’s jacket and             laid     it over

            his   head.       The P o l i c e m a n was   in tears.      I thought enough was enough

            and went      home.

            The two boys who           climbed over the wall           into the ground,      they were

            about    19 - 20 years         old,    both white,       one a p p e a r e d very thin but     t h a t ’s

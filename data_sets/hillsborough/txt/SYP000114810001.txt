L i ve r p o o l    F o ot ba ll    Club.       As time wen t on,                 traffic    became        very heavy,

Between        11.20 a m a n d 2 . 3 0 pih ( 1430)                 we    checked 33 vehicles,                being a

m i x t u r e of coac h e s a n d mini              buses.         On the         coaches     checked there were

no drinks           f ou nd a n d only 7 persons w ere f o u n d to have                            no tickets.

Due    to our         location,         a n d the fact          that those 7 persons w e r e amongst

o r g a n i s e d groups,          it seemed        i mpractical           to     prevent the m continuing

their journey,               but they were            s u i t a b l y advised.           T h e y all      hoped to

purchase           tick e t s    fro m touts.             In the mini           buses    checked,         so far as we

occupants           had bee n s t r o n g l y advised,               the    drinks were          surrendered.

the     persons on the               coaches,       or     in the mini            buses were        under the

influence           of drink a n d there were                   no problems w h a t s o e v e r w i t h their

would        consider        normal       for    persons a t t e n d i n g         this type        of function.

Du r i n g    the w hole         of the time we wer e                checking        vehicles,         we had no

t h o u g h there was       d i f f i c u l t y being     e x p e r i e n c e d w i t h traf f i c     in the

C i t y area.       This    fact was        c on fi r m e d by v i s i t i n g Traf f i c Officers,                who

felt we had bee n           lucky to have           been s e l e c t e d to cover            the      point we

had,    instead of at          the N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t     side of the ground.

M y serial        had b e en d e t a i le d during P h a s e 2 to meal at C l a y w h e e l s

Lane,     then re t u r n to the T a n k e r s l e y area.                In view of the             fact that

traf f i c was n on - e x i s t e n t ,    at 2 .55       pm    (1455)      I stood m y serial              down and

we b e g a n to make        our w a y to C l a y w h e e l s Lane.

As we     t r av el le d d o wn H al i f a x Road,         for the first time,                 we heard

m e ss ag es    o n the    personal        radio.        T hese tended to indicate                   that     things

a r o u n d the g r o u nd w ere      busy,       but noth i n g more.             As we     turned        round

the    traffic      island at the bo t t o m of L e p p i n g s Lane,                  I was        s u r p r i s e d to

was now past 3 pm <1300)                   the kick off time.

fro m P e n i s t o n e R o a d towards            the P o l i c e Garage,            I saw C hief          Inspector

Purdy,      I i n f o r me d him of my             i n t e n t i o n to meal,        and then a t t e n d e d at

t he G a r a g e    f o recourt.           O n arrival       at C l a y w h e e l s Lane,        my serial was

b r i e f e d to meal        as a group,           ready for future                deployment.            In the m ain

I e x p e c t ed this        to be a f t e r the m a t c h had ended.

W h i l s t at the P o l i ce Garage,                I u s e d the toilets,              an d thetn went           to the

mobile      c a n t e e n to     collect my hot meal.                     After     being serve d w i t h the

meal,     I began walking               back towards           the e n t r a n c e     into C l a y w h e e l s Lane

garage,       an d at      this      point,       was met by my serial                 leaving the garage.

They     i n d i c a t e d to me that we w ere to a t t e n d at the L e p p i n g s Lane                             end

of the g o u r n d as there was some kin d of a problem.                                      After       d e positing

my meal       on a table,            I rejoined my serial.                      We a t t e n d e d near      the

L e p p i n g s L ane     e n t r a n c e to H i l l s b o r o u g h .     The time w o u l d now be about

3 . 1 3 pm.     (1315)           \

On   initially attending                   this    point,      I saw that O f f i c e r s were               forming a

dordon a c r o s s        the a c c e s s a rea to the ground.                      The only Senior

Officers        in the are a a p p e a r e d to be other                   Inspectors.                 I a s k e d them

vfhat was wrong,             none        se e m e d to know,          but that we were to prevent

f urt h e r a c c e s s    to the ground by suppor t e r s .                       I the r e f o r e     left one of

my o f f i c e r s w i t h our vehicle              to protect            it,    or move      it as necessary,

a n d d e p l o y e d the      remainder of my serial,                     w i t h the other           officers

already forming              the     cordon.        The    traf f i c      on the      personal         radio was

s uch that         it was      i m possible        to get air            time to clar i f y from ground

control       either w hat           the    problem was,           or     if they w i s h e d my serial

deploying          elsewhere.              Also,     the m e s s a g e s being        passed on the air did

not see m to indicate                   a s i t u a t i o n such as was found to have                     occurred.

A l t h o u g h the time was            now past 3 . 1 5         pm      (1315)     there w ere         still a number

of s u p p o r t e r s m a k i n g    their w a y to the ground,                    and o b v i o u s l y they were

Eventually,          I picked up a mess a g e                that a m b u l a n c e s were a t t e n d i n g and

other dead          persons          lying    in the area,          covered         by coats       etc.        Even at

this     point,       I was     still        not fully a w a r e       of what had occurred,                       but

whilst      near     the a c c e s s gate,           I saw that fans were                  p r e v e n t i n g an

I was     pulled an d          pushed about and on m a n y occasions                           it was        pointed

out to me quite             f o r c i b l y that      I was a murderer.                  The    language being

uses was        some of the most foul                   I have heard.               It seemed        to me taht

further,       and after             trying to calm dow n the various fans,                            left them to

During        this    phase,    the Obvious           probl e m s    that     o c c u r r e d and w h i c h has

bee n h i g h l i g h t e d since,       was    the    lack of stret c h e r s          or other means of

moving        the    inju r e d a n d dead persons,             other     than by p h y s i c a l l y

C a r ry ing t h e m f r o m the scene.

E v e n t u a l l y th i n g s a p p e a r e d t<j be s e t t l i n g    down and most          of the

inju r e d     persons     ha d been m o v e d f rom the area.                   At this time,          I went

a lo n g     the tunnel     which       leads f rom the           rear of the stand,             onto the

s t a n d i n g a r e a of L ep p i n g s L ane terraces,               at the     centre.       O n arriv i n g

at the        terracing,       I saw that there w ere still                    a number        of persons

w a n d e r i n g a r o u n d on the t e r r a c e d area.           I also saw that            there wre

p eople       on the    pitch,       some still        b eing g i v e n first aid,             and also,

t here was a line of P o l i ce O f f i c e r s                s t a n d i n g on the    centre     line

a c ro ss     the w i d t h of the        pitch.       On    looking      els e w h e r e a r o u n d the

g r o u nd    I r e a l i se d that     the N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t    fans were        just s t a nding

p a t i en tl y around,        and     I was    thankful        that     they h a d n ’t deci d e d to

cause other           problems.         On   re-entering         the tunnel,          I was met      by two

off dut y nurses who we r e seeking help.                           W h i l s t s p e aking w i t h these

nurses,        we w ere    d i r e c te d to a y o u t h sitt i n g          nearby who was

c o mp la in in g of      pains      in his     ribs.        The nurses        took     charge of this

p e r s o n and b eg a n to e v a c u a t e him to the ambulances.

I returned to the a r e a near the a c c e s s gate,                          where     I met    Inspector

Sykes,       and a serial           of Officers.            T h e y had made an e n c l o s u r e out of

p o r t a b l e f e n c i n g and    I saw that t here w e r e several                  bodies    covered up

in this e n closure.                O n q u e rying    the    number,        I was    i n f ormed that there

wer e      ten persons.         The L i verpool         fans     t hen b egan leaving the ground

and     I w o r k e d t o g e t h e r w i t h other o f f i c e r s      in di r e c t i n g   them from the

ground.

At    this     point,     we w ere joined by I n spector Webster.                         He stated that

he was       trying to a s c e r t a i n the number of dead                    persons at our end of
                                                                                                       PAGE              9
                                                                                                       R408

the ground.             I was    under   the    i mp r e s s i o n that the     10 dead       persons w e r e

the only f a t a l i t i e s      to have occurred,          and     that the      injured       persons we

had r em o v e d wer «         the bulk of those         injured.        We were       i n f o r m e d that

there w ere          dve-r 70 other       persons dead       in the gymnasium,              a n d this was

the first time            that    I realised the scale              of the     incident.

We w e re t h e n joi-ned by Dr.              Leigh,   P o l i c e Surgeon.        Superintendent

Marshall        r e q u e s t e d that he a t t e n d at the gymnasium.                As there was             no

one else        in the a r e a who knew the w h e r e a b o u t s          of the gym,         or the

route,     I took him to that              location.        I left him at           the e n t rance to

the gym w i t h other o f f i c e r s a n d b egan m a k i n g my wa y back towards                        the

L e p p i n g s Lan e    end of the ground.              I saw that       by this time,          the

t e r r a c e d a r e a was a l mo s t    clear an d d e c i d e d    to sue that as the easiest

r e t u rn route.         On    crossing      the football      pitch I saw that              there were

very few persons,               other    than P o l i c e O f ficers,      still      on the     pitch.

On arriving           back at the L e p p i n g s Lane       end of the ground,               I located my

serial,      still a s s i s t i n g w i t h g r o u n d c l earance       of u n i n j u r e d fans.           I

n o t i c e d that      the time was       now 4 . 4 5    pm (1645).         During      the w h o l e of this

time,     the    radio had be e n receiving,               but there was          no free air time                  to

pass m e ssages.

B y 5 pm     (1700)       the m e s s a g e s wer e    talking a b o u t     traffic       problems,

o b v i o u s l y b e i n g ,caused by the fans           leaving the ground,             made w orse by

r e t u r n i n g e m e r g e n c y vehicles.      At the L e p p i n g s Lane a r e a the fans were

now clear,           a n d as our original         brief had been traffic                patrol      in the

T a n k e r s l e y area,      I d e c i d e d to resume    to my serial          to as s i s t w ith

traffic,        as    possible.

I noted that as we b e g a n to mov e off                   in our vehicle            the time was         in

fact 5 pm (1700).                We   p a t r o l l e d as best we    could a long        the A61       between

H i l l s b o r o u g h and Greno s i d e ,    but saw that         points wer e being worked.

One   of the         problems      causing traffic         h o l d-ups was      the    coaches       still

             pick up t heir             passengers.           These vehicles            caused     problems      throughout.

             We    c o n ti nu ed to       patrol,       and attended an              incident     reported as Po l i c e

             Officers         in t ro u b l e     near thfe s u p e r m a r k e t s     in H a l i f a x Road,    but

             noth i n g was           found.      Due    to the a m o u n t         of traffic on the         radio     it was

            '•till      not      passible        to   pass m e s s a g e s    to     control.

             By 6.30        pm    <1830)       the A61      towards T a n k e r s l e y was al m o s t        clear.       as we

             t r a v e l l ed dow n t ow a r d s H i l l s b o r o u g h ,      I n o t i c e d a gap    in air traffic

             an d for the first                time m a n a g e d to contact            control.        I e x p l a i n e d the

             road      condi t i o n s a n d a s k e d for           instructions.           We wer e    inst r u c t e d to

             continue         patrol       for     the time being.             Due     to the fact that we had               not

             had a ny t h i n g        to eat      or drink since            10.30     am I instr u c t e d my driver to

             Again,       t hey w ere        i ns t r u c t e d to    remain toget h e r        until    i n s t r uctions

             were      confirmed.           At 7 . 1 5     pm <1915)         I was     instr u c t e d to s tand down my

             serial,        but to       remain a v a i l a b l e m y s e l f        until   inst r u c t e d otherwise.

             At C l a y w h e e l s Lane,         I could find no one who a p p e a r e d to be collecting

             d eb ri ef in g      forms,       radios or other            paperwork,         but   realised this was

             due to the o p e r a t i o n still               in a c t i o n at the ground.              At 7 . 3 0   pm I ws

        On Friday 14 April 1989, as instructed, I attended a pre-match briefing at

        Hillsborough              Football Ground.                                 The briefing took place at 10 am and was

        conducted by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, together with other Senior

        Officers, and was for Inspectors and above. The briefing was adequate and

        seemed well prepared.



        At 9.30 am on Saturday 15 April                                                           1989,                I commenced duty at Hillsborough

        at           random coaches                                       and mini-buses                                  carrying Liverpool                                       supporters, these

        duties to be carried out in conjunction with Road Traffic Officers. During

         and after the match we were to remain in the Tankersley area as a mobile

         patrol.                     I attended                               the pre-match briefing at                                                         10am that date,                                    and on

         checking my serial, found that one of the Officers listed was in fact on

         sick leave, this leaving me 9 Constables and a Sergeant. We were issued

         with a                       Ford Transit Van as transport, this being registered number C410

         HET.



         The             briefing was                                   given                 by Chief                    Superintendent                               Duckenfield and again

          appeared adequate. It followed the general pattern of other briefings for

          similar matches                                          I have attended in the past.                                                                    It appeared that Chief

          Inspector Purdy was in command of our sector.



          After the briefing, we were given a small pre-packed meal, and drink, which

          were consumed at the ground. Myself and the Sergeant were issued with a

          personal radio.



          At 11 am, we picked up our vehicle and went to Tankersley intersection

          where we rendezvoused with several Road Traffic Officers. On speaking with

          those Officers, we were informed that they had not been briefed to work

          with our serial, and in fact their order specifically informed them that

          because                      of          traffic                      problems                     in       1988,               such            checks                for           1989 has                     been

          dispensed with. This therefore left me with just 11 Officers including

          myself.                         At 11.20am I set up my reception point in the lay-by which is

           situated on the Sheffield side of the motorway, on the A61 approach road.

                       (CJ Act, 1967, s.9: MC Act, 1980, s.102: MC Rules, 1981, r.70)

         I pre-briefed my serial to randomly check coaches and mini-buses, as per

        the order, tfct to enter vehicles unless there were 4 or 5 of them together,

        in the event of trouble on any vehicle. I instructed them to check persons

        for drink, drunken condition, and the possession of the correct entry

        ticket, and any problems to be referred to either the Sergeant or myself.



        It       quickly   became   apparent     that   the     personal   radios were      of   no use

        whatsoever, due to our location and distance frcm the ground. The van

        contained a Force radio, but our radio call signe as issued was India 18 on

        personal radio.



        At the outset, traffic travelling towards Sheffield was only moderately

        light, with the majority of vehicles being private cars. Almost all the

        cars were displaying colours associating them with Liverpool Football Club.

        As time went on, traffic became very heavy, and there were periods where

        traffic was in fact at a standstill, backing up frcm the traffic island at

        the new Stocksbridge by-pass.



        Between 111-20am.and 2.30 pm we checked 53 vehicles, being a mixture of

        coaches and mini-buses. On the coaches checked there were no drinks found

        and only 7 persons were found to have no tickets. Due to our location, and

        the fact that those 7 persons were amongst organised groups, it seemed

        unpractical        to   prevent   them   continuing        their   journey,   but   they were

        suitably advised. They all hoped to purchase tickets frcm touts. In the

        mini buses checked, so far as we could ascertain it appeared that persons

        were I possession of the correct appropriate tickets. On some of the mini­

        buses cans of drinks were located. These were few in number, and after the

        Continuation of statement of      Kenneth Edward Athorn                            Page 4

        occupants had been strongly advised,                 the drinks were surrendered.              The

        contents were poured away, and the empty cans collected and deposited in

        the waste container at Claywheels Lane Garage. None of the persons on the

        coaches, or in the mini buses were under the influence of drink and there

        were no problems whatsoever with their behaviour.   The occupants were
                                                                         l
        obviously in high spirits, but what I would consider normal for persons

        attending this type of function.



        During the whole of the time we were checking vehicles, we had no problems,

        and so far as I was concerned all vehicles leaving our location were in

        order.



        We had occasion to stop several coaches which were displaying signs to the

        front    which   showed        'Nottingham Forest',         but   these   turned    out   to    be

        destination sheets issued by the operator to simply indicate to fans, where

        the coaches were going, as many coaches had left the same area in Liverpool

        to both the match in Sheffield and the other semi final between Everton and

        Norwich. After being suitably advised the signs were removed to prevent

        wrong identification of the visiting fans when nearer the ground. It might

         also be pertinent to note that many of the coaches had been searched by the

         Police in Liverpool prior to departure.



         After 2.15 pm traffic was almost none existent, and except for 2 coaches

         which arrived together at about 2.30pn, we checked no other coaches or mini

         buses for quite sane time. The reason given by the drivers for these last 2

         coaches for being so late was that they had decided to travel towards

         Sheffield via the M56 intending missing as much traffic as possible on the

M62, but had instead run into heavy traffic at roadworks in the Manchester

area of the M56.



After these two coaches left, we checked no other vehicles.



During the time we were operating at Tankersley nothing whatsoever was

received by personal radio. On the vans VHF radio, it sounded as though

there was difficulty being experienced with traffic in the City area. This

 fact was confirmed by visiting Traffic Officers, who felt we had been lucky

to have                       been selected to cover the point we had,                                                                                                 instead of at the

Nottingham Forest side of the ground.



My serial had been detailed during Phase 2 to meal at Claywheels Lane, then

 return to the Tankersley area. In view of the fact that traffic was non­

 existent, at 2.55 pm I stood my serial down and we began to make our way

 to Claywheels Lane.



 As we travelled down Halifax Road, for the first time, we heard messages on

 the personal radio. These tended to indicate that things around the ground

 were busy, but nothing more. As we turned round the traffic island at the

 bottom of Leppings Lane, I was surprised to still see lots of fans making

 their way to the ground, even though it was now past 3 pm, the kick off

 time.



 We arrived at Claywheels Lane at about 3.05 pm. As we turned frcm Penistone

 Road towards the                                             Police Garage, I saw Chief Inspector Purdy. I informed

 him of my intention to meal, and then attended at the Garage forecourt. On

         arrival at Claywheels Lane, my serial was briefed to meal as a group, ready

         for future deployment. In the main, I expected this to be after the match

        had ended.



        Whilst at the Police Garage,                                                          I used the toilets, and then went to the

        mobile canteen to collect my hot meal. After being served with the meal, I

        began walking back towards the entrance into Claywheels Lane garage, and at

        this point, was met by my serial leaving the garage. They indicated to me

        that we were to attend at the Leppings Lane end of the ground as there was

        sane kind of a problem. After depositing my meal on a table, I rejoined my

        serial. We attended near to the Leppings Lane Entrance to Hillsborough. The

        time would now be about 3.15am.



        On initially attending this point,                                                                  I saw that Officers were forming a

        cordon across the access area to the ground. The only Senior Officers in

        the area appeared to be other Inspectors. I asked them what was wrong, none

        seemed to know, but that we were to prevent further access to the ground by

        supporters. I therefore left one of my Officers with our vehicle to protect

        it, or move it as necessary, and deployed the remainder of my serial, with

        the other officers already forming the cordon. The traffic on the personal

        radio was Such that it was impossible to get air time to clarify frcm

        ground control either what the problem was, or if they wished my serial

        deploying elsewhere. Also, the messages being passed on the air did not

        seem to indicate a situation such as was found to have occurred.



        Although the time was now past 3.15 pm there were still a number of

        supporters making their way to the ground, and obviously they were upset at

        not being allowed access on the production of their tickets.

                      (CJ Act, 1967, s.9: MC Act, 1980, s. 102: MC Rules, 1981, r.70)

         Eventually,      I picked up a message that ambulances were attending and

        realised that someone must have been injured. On looking down the small

        road which runs alongside the football ground I saw that there appeared to

        be something happening near to a large access gate, but from my position

        could not tell what it was. I left my serial in position whilst I made way

        to that area, firstly to try to ascertain what was happening and secondly

        to seek a Senior Officer to see if we were required elswewhere.



        On entering the large access gate, I saw a large number of injured persons

        lying around on the ground in the triangular area to the rear of the

        Leppings Lane stand. Some were being given mouth to mouth resuscitation,

        others cardiac compression. Others were being treated for other problems. I

        also found close to the gate the body of a male who was obviously dead. I

        returned to my serial and instructed them to go into the area previously

        described and give what help they could. I made my way further into the

        area,     still   trying to assess vdiat had         occurred.    During this     time    3

        ambulances had arrived behind me, near to the large gate, and some injured

        personswere being moved towards them by either police                    officers or the

        injured persons friends.



        It was during this time that I met Superintendent Marshall. He instructed

        me to fetch the ambulances to the rear of the stand as they were needed. On

        checking, I found that the ambulances were too high to gain access to the

        ground area, this     being due to the large metal bars vtfiich stretched across

        the top     of thelarge access gate, and which carry the running gear for the

        sliding     gates. I considered this to be a point which required future

        consideration as it was impossible to take the emergency vehicles into the

        ground area. I searched out Superintendent Marshall and informed him of the

into     any other gates in the area, and in any case, to have breathing

apparatus brought up to the rear of the stand.



I then went to the ambulance nearest the gate and passed on the message

regarding the breathing apparatus, and saw a member of the vehicles crew

enter the ground with such equipment. I also saw that by this time several

fire tenders were        in attendance,      and     fire brigade officers were also

entering the ground carrying breathing apparatus. I then checked the large

gates in the immediate area and found all to be too low to allow access,

for the same reason as initially stated. I again returned to Superintendent

Marshall and passed on this information. He then instructed me to begin

moving injured persons out of the area and towards the ambulances.                      I

therefore went around the area and arranged for police officers and other

persons who were administering first aid, to begin to move the injured

persons towards the access gate. As I walked around, I saw other dead

 persons lying in the area, covered by coats etc. Even at this point, I was

 still not fully aware of vfaat had occurred, but realised the persons were

 suffering crush injuries. At one point, whilst near the access gate, I saw

 that fans were preventing an ambulance entering the top of the access road,

 and made my way to the area. With others we managed to get the ambulance

 through the supporters. Also whilst in the area, both whilst moving around

 assessing the situation, and whilst trying to arrange casualty evacuation,

 I was abused on a number of occasions by Liverpool fans. I was pulled and

 pushed about and on many occasions it was pointed out to fee quite forciby

 that I was a murderer. The language being used was sane of the most foul I

             have heard. It seemed to me that the abusers were suffering shock, and were

             relieving their frustrations on m e . I could see little point in taking

             their actions further, and after trying to calm down the various fans, left

             them to make their way out of the ground. Others were simply trying to

             obtain information, none of which I was able to give.



             During this phase, the obvious problems that occurred and which has been

             highlighted since, was the lack of stretchers or other means of moving the

             injured and dead persons, other than by physically carrying them from the

             scene.



             Eventually things appeared to be settling down and most of the injured

             persons had been moved frcm the area. At this time, I went along the tunnel

             which leads frcm the rear of the stand, onto the standing area of Leppings

             Lane terraces, at the centre. On arriving at the terracing, I saw that

             there were still a number of persons wandering around on the terraced area.

             I also saw that there were people on the pitch, sane still being given

             first aid, and also, there was a line of Police Officers standing on the

             centre line across the width of the pitch. On looking elsewhere around the

             ground,                    I realised that the Nottingham Forest fans were                                                     just standing

             patiently around, and I was thankful that they hadnt decided to cause other

             problems. On re-entering the tunnel, I was met by two off duty nurses who

            were seeking held. Whilst speaking with these nurses, we were directed to a

             youth sitting nearby who was complaining of pains in his ribs. The nurses

             took charge of                                     this person and began to evacuate him to the ambulances.

        Continuation of statement of                                                               Kenneth Edward Athorn                                                                              Page 10.

          I returned to the area near the access gate, where I met Inspector Sykes,

          and a serial of Officers. They had made an enclosure out of portable

          fencing and                                I saw that there were                                                      several bodies covered up in this

          enclosure.                           On querying the number,                                                        I was informed that there were ten

          persons. The Liverpool fans then began leaving the ground and I worked

          together with other officers in directing them frcm the ground,.



          At this point, we were joined by Inspector Webster. He stated that he was

          trying to ascertain the number of dead persons at our end of the ground. I

          was under the impression that the 10 dead persons were the only fatalities

          to have occurred, and that the injured persons we had removed were the bulk

          of those injured. We were informed that there were over 70 other persons

          dead in the gymnasium, sind. this was the first time that I realised the

          scale of the inccident.



          We were then joined by Dr. Leigh, Police Surgeon. Superintendent Marshall

          requested that he attend at the gymnasium. As there was no one else in the

          area who new the whereabouts of the gym, or the route, I took him to that

          location. I left him at the entrance to the gym with other Officers and

          began making my way back towards the Leppings Lane end of the ground. I saw

          that by this time, the terraced area was almost clear and decided to use

          that as the easiest return route. On crossing the football pitch I saw that

          there were very few persons,                                                                       other than Police Officers, still on the

          pitch.



          On arriving back at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, I located my

          serial, still assisting                                                         with ground clearance of uninjured fans. I noticed

          that the time was now 4.45 pm. During the whole of this time, the radio had

        been receiving, but there was no fee           air time to pass messages.



        By 5pm, the messages were talking about traffic problems, obviously being

        caused by the fans leaving the ground, made worse by returning emergency

        vehicles. At the lappings Lane area the fans were now clear, and as our

        original brief had been traffic patrol in the Tankersley area, I decided to

        resume to my serial to assist with traffic, as possible.



        I noted that as we began to move off in our vehicle the time was in fact 5

        pm. We patrolled as best we could along the A61 between Hillsborough and

        Grenoside,    but   saw that points were being worked.                One of the problems

        causing traffic holdups,        was   the    coaches        still   parked along Penistone

        Road/Halifax Road, and obviously waiting to pick up their passengers. These

        vehicles caused problems throughout.



        We continued to patrol, and attended an incident reported as Police Officers

        in trouble near the supermarkets in Halifax Road, but nothing was found. Due

        to the amount of traffic on the radio it was still not possible to pass

        messages to control.



        By 6.30 pm, the A61 towards Tankersley was almost clear. As we travelled

        down towards Hillsbrough, I        noticed a gap in air traffic and for the first

        time managed to contact control. I explained the road conditions and asked

        for instructions. We were instructed to continue patrol for the time being.

        Due to the fact that we had not had anything to eat or drink since 10.30 am.

I instructed my driver to attend at Claywheels Lane Garage with the hope of

obtaining refreshments for my serial.



Again,     they were   instructed to remain together until instructions were

confirmed. At 7.15 pm I was instructed to stand down my serial, but to

remain available myself until instructed otherwise.



At Claywheels Lane, I could find no one who appeared to be collecting

debriefing forms, radios or other paperwork, but realised this was due to

the operation still in action at the ground. At 7.30 pm I was joined by

Inspector Sykes who informed me that we had now all been stood down. I then

went off duty at 7.45 pm that date.



One of my Officers had been delegated to go with one of the deceased. Prior

to     leaving,   I made certain that his whereabouts were noted,                  and made

provisional arrangements for his transport back to                 'A' Division on his

return.                  /)

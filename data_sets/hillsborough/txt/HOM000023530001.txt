BACKGROUND BRIEFING:   ATTENDANCES, CAPACITIES AND SEATING



1.   The FA was founded in 1863 but football emerged in a
recognisably modern form in the 1870's and 1880's.


Size of Crowds before First World War


Crowds in excess of 50,000 annually attended the F A Cup finals
at Crystal Palace between 1897 and 1915.


1920's and 1930's


The 1920's and 1930's marked the growing popularity of
professional game but systematic data on the expansion is not
available. However at the 1923 Cup Final at Wembley, a crowd
estimated at between 200,000 and 250,000 invaded the new 127,000
capacity stadium and spilled onto the pitch and in February 1925
a cup replay between Leicester and Newcastle attracted a crowd of
36,000.


The 1920's and 1930's saw 36 grounds enjoy their largest ever
attendances, most of them the older established First Division
clubs.


After World War II


At the end of World War II, the appeal of soccer as a spectator
sport reached unprecedented heights.    The 1949-50 season, when a
total of 77 million people are estimated to have attended
matches, saw the peak of this rising trend.


Total attendances fell to around 33 million a year in the 1950's,
to 25-9 million in the 1960's and to 24-5 million in the 1970's.
In the early 1980's they dropped to below 20 million and in
1985/6 were still falling.   Since then, there has been a small
resurgence and attendances in 1988-89 showed an increase of some
2.5% on the previous season's figures.
2.   Present Capacities and Record Attendances


Sheffield Wednesday


New Kop 55,000 capacity including 23,224 seats. Record crowd was
72,841 for Manchester City's visit in the FA cup in February
1934.


Liverpool (Anfield)


Capacity 46,000 including 21,700 seats. Highest attendance was
61.905 for Liverpool's 4th round FA cup tie v Wolves.

Aston Villa


Capacity of 48,000 of which 19,900 seated.   Highest attendance of
76,558 for a cup match v Derby County in March 1946.

Manchester Citv


Capacity is 49,500 but the total number of seats, 25,700 is still
marginally the highest of any English club ground. Attendance of
84,569 at a game against Stoke on 3 March 1934 was the highest of
any English club match apart from a Cup Final.

Tottenham Hotspur


Capacity is 48,200 including 17,000 seats.   Highest attendance
75,038 on 5 March 1938 when Spurs lost 0-1 to Sunderland in the
FA Cup 6th round.


Chelsea


Capacity is 43,900 including 20,264 seats.   Highest attendance
82.905 Chelsea v champions Arsenal on 12 October 1935 (second on
the Manchester City - see above).
3â€¢   Trend Towards All-Seater Stadia


In 1981 Coventry City was the first English club to go all-
seater. However, in 1983 2000 were allowed to stand and 2 years
later a whole side was restored to standing, QPR made a move
towards all-seater but took out some seats under pressure from
followers.     Old Trafford and Goodison Park have both seated and
standing provision on all 4 sides.     Wembley Stadium will be all-
seater by early 1990.


In Scotland, Pittodrie was converted in 1978 and Clydebank
followed. The Ibrox stadium of 1981 has a capacity of 45,000 of
which only 9,000 are standing. A new all-seater 10,000 capacity
stadium at St Johnstone was opened in August 1989.

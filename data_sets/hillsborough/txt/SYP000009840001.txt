    During      the    course      of my        patrol      I did go to the F i.vj/Arches Public

    House arriving            at about mi d d a y and the                     pu^IJj^fimise was             full   of people

    drinking       I could see            this because                there    is a large           glass    conservatory

    on the front.              I c a n ’t say which supporters                            they were and as far as                I

The    only    cars        to be a ll ow ed    to use the     car     park with green and ye l l o w

car    parking        stickers       ^nd the    coaches were         dropping       off the fans at

this    point and then driving                 off to    park.        It was a normal             tour of

duty up until about 2 . 1 5 pm                <1415)    on the same day when a double                     decker

bus a rr iv ed with N ot ti n g h a m Forrest             fans    on board and numerous                  fans

got    off    the bus by means              of the e m e rgency exit and made               off    into the

crowd.         I didn't         see a n y b o d y throughout      the    entire      day drinking any

alcohol       from either           cans    or bottles.       The     general       mood of       the    fans

was    very good with a friendly banter                    taking       place.        At about 2 . 3 0 pm

(1430)       the     car    park    became    full and no more          vehicles were          let on the

car    park.          I did receive          several    enquiries       from Liverpool            supporters

on how they           could get       into their       part of the ground and               I directed

them.



It w ou l d have           been about 3 . 0 5 p m    ( 1 5 0 5 ) that we noticed that              there were

about     100 to       150 f a n s who were         s t a n d i n g in a group outside            the Spion

K o p e n t r a n c:e unable        to get    in due to the       gates      being    closed and were

becoming       upset and angry.                It was also about          this      times that      the    radio

t r an sm is si on became           very hectic and also          that    policy      dogs     vans

and    police        personnel       carriers were making            their w & y to the Police

entrance       in P en n i s t o n e Rd.        We did attempt          to /se      the   radio     to get

the fans       into the ground              but were    unable    to m-jifae contact wit h              control.

A moun t e d officer also a t te mp te d to               contact C o n t r o l      with our       radio       but

he was also           unable       to make    contact wit ! \ j ^ n t r o l , shortly after that a

P o l i ce S e r geant was          going    past and a gain this         time      using    his    radio we

at te mp te d to       contact       control    but was    unable       to do so.

                   for    the gate as a result             of this    I was     flung      to the side and the WSC

                   was    knocked to the floor,, abou'                                  fans    gain access        through

                   At about 3 . 2 5 pm (1525),          together with the WSC               I entered the football

                   was    shortly after        this that       two fans were           brought     up on boardings,                and

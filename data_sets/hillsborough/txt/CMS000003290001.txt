      PESPONSIPTLTTY FOR PUBLIC                      SAFETY   AND    HYGIENE      DURING         LARGE
      GATHERINGS OF PEOPLE
      I am writing to seek you help, along with that of colleagues in
      the Home Office, DoT, DOE and in house, in connection with
      letter (copy attached) received last week.
      The Committee on Health Promotion of the FPHM pose a range of
      broad Questions.    There is no intimation of what may have
      prompted the enquiry, but I foresee the possible rise of on-going
      debate and perhaps a need to agree definition (or scope) of some
      of the terms used.
      DOE have pointed out that whilst some responsibilities in the
      scenarios outlined fall to local authorities, acting on advice
      from other bodies where necessary, the two indents referring t
      public entertainments invite attention from your Department.

      I should be grateful for comments from yourself or Divisional
      colleagues, and for any specific contribution you may like to
      offer to assist me in collating a response to the Facul y.

      Thank you for your help.

Dear Dr Martin

The Faculty of Public Health Medicine is concerned about the potential for
harm when there are large gatherings of people if proper precautions are
not taken. We are concerned, in the first instance, to establish who is
responsible for public safety and hygiene and for the coordination of
emergency services in a number of settings. We are especially interested
in:

        public transport (including the role in both safety and hygiene of
        different local and health authorities through which a train might
        pass);

        stations and termini for any form of public transport; and also

        public entertainments at fixed venues such as football stadia and
        concert halls;

        public entertainments at temporary venues (whether organised or
        informal) such as pop festivals, street carnivals, 'raves', circuses
        and gatherings of new age travellers;

        roads around either of the above where pedestrians are gathered in
        large numbers and where their movement is restricted.

I should be most grateful for any information you can provide on these
matters.

Yours sincerely




John Ashton
Chair, Committee on Health Promotion

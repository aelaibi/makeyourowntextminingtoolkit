A    complaint         was    received from a pesiaeni                   of                         (b e l ieved

heard C o n v e r s a t i o n      relating         to     people        inside     the ground       being    injured,

an afmbulance a rr i ve d a nd was                    d ir ec te d       into     the ground.       Numerous

arrived,         c o nv er sa ti on was then heard                   relating        to 3 fatalities,          people

then slowly star te d to                  leave       the        ground,    further a mb ul a nc e s        then

a r ri v e d   together        wit h     other      fire        tenders,         by now people were          leaving

the    ground      in large          numbers many were                   shouting abuse at Police

O ff ic e rs     saying     it was        our fault             for opening         the gate and a cc using             the

Po li ce       of killing         people,       the a tm os p he r e        outside        the ground was          so

              s upp or t e r s    were     talking     about      bodies        being all         over.     Some

              of the s u pp or te rs were             o b vi ou sl y      injured an d when offered help they

              refused         it and just      becam e a b us iv e           towards        the officers.

              I r em ained o u t s i d e the          gr ou nd    in an atte mp t            to keep the       road   clear    for

              e m er ge n c y    vehicles,      I r et urned to the N or th S tand sometime                        later when

              the    ground had been            cleared.

              I. had no         contact w ith any d ec ea se d               persons at all.

              I cannot          say what     time     the t urnstiles             op en ed to the         public   but   can say

              that    X was       not aware      of any       problems          outside        the Leppi ngs Lane

              entrance          w hi ch   1 could see        from my         point.

              I have      per f or me d duties         at    previous m ajor               events at H i l l s b o r o u g h and

              have always           been     in the    locality           of L ep pi n gs      Lane    there   have   been no

              serious         incidents at       previous         events        I have       attended.

              F rom my o b se rv at io ns        I w o u ld say that              the major        cause of the       incident

              was    the fact         that   so m a n y     people a rr i ve d         late and had no intention of

              en tering         the ground      in good time.                They had         consumed     large a mounts      of

              alcohol         a l t h o u g h only a few were             o b vi ou sl y    drunk,    and there were

              hu ndreds         of s upporters        present M^ithout tickets who                      usually still       try

              to gain entry any way the y                    can.

              I was also           a sk ed by s up po r te r s where            the nearest           pub was.

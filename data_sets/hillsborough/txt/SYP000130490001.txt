s p e ci fi e d     in S ec t i o n   101 of the Local                G o v e r n m e n t Act,    1972    <000072).

The Se ct io n           provides     that a local a u t h o r i t y may arran ge for                      the

disch arg e         of their       functions         by a committee,             sub committee            or an

officer        of    the authori ty.              It is ther ef ore           possible for a council                   to

de leg ate         its dec isi on making             powers         to a committee,          sub committee             or

officer.           Whilst a named officer,                  who w o u l d usually be a chief                  officer,

was    the officer             nom in at ed to fulfil               the d e l eg at ed functions           of a local

au t h o r i t y    in ap pr o p r i a t e    circumstances,             as a matter         of    practice,       such

schemes a c t u a l l y operate               by the      relevant         chief     officer a u t h o r i s i n g        one

of his officers                to take act io n on his                behalf.        Thus an       individual

officer        can take a c ti on            in the name of the               chief officer          of that

department.              The    case of R v Sou th wa rk Lo nd o n Bo ro ug h Council,

Go ve r n m e n t    Act,      1972   <000072).           In this        instance,        David BOWNES,            the

Chief Li c e n s i n g Officer,               was a u t h o r i s e d to take act io n under                 the    powers

d e l e g a t e d to the He a d of A d m i n i s t r a t i o n and Legal                 Department.             The

action       to be taken was of an ad m i n i s t r a t i v e                   nature as Mr B O W N E S was and

is an a d m i n i s t r a t o r as opposed              to a te c h n i c a l l y q u al if ied expert.                   The

S a f e t y of Sports G r o u n d Act,               1975      <000075)       requires       c o n s u l t a t i o n to

At    its meeti ng           on the 3rd March,            1986,     (030386),       the Panel a d o p t e d the

A seco nd       report was         prepared by D a v i d B O W N E S wh ic h was ag ai n su bm itt ed

th ro ug h the He a d of D e pa rt me nt              to the Panel           on the 6th May,           1986

As a matter              of    practice,        the m in ute s of the Panel              were seen by MEG S and

the City Council.                    The a dm i n i s t r a t i v e    syst em    therefore      op er ate d    in

a c c o r d a n c e wi t h      those     resolutions           between 6th May          1986    (060586)       and 7th

September          1987        <070987).          During       this    period,     the system       in op eration

was a common one th roughout                        this       local    a u t h o r i t y and other    local

auth or it ie s.              The   basic       principle       o p e r at ed on is that        if there       is

di s a g r e e m e n t    between the            parties       or a mat te r      of   policy    requires

det ermination,                then the         issue shou ld be ref erred to the app ro pr ia te

co mmittee         or sub           committee by way of a report                   from the      relevant

officer.           Where        there      is a consensus of opinio n between the                       parties,        an

administrative                 de ci s i o n    can be taken not           to    refer   the matter      to the

relevant         committee            or sub committee,               and ac ti o n    is taken      in line with

the    consensus              of opinion.

In the       instance           of the         removal    of    part of barrier          144,    I believe that

pro fe ssional            ad vi c e was         received from all           the    sta tu to ry consultees and

that     the C l u b ’s en gineers were also                      present,        given that      there was

apparently           consensus           between all           parties     regarding        the ac t i o n to be

taken,       then the           correct ad m i n i s t r a t i v e      de ci s i o n was    taken not     to       refer

the matter           to the General               Pu rposes Panel.

In Se pt emb er           1987       <000087),      a report was su b m i t t e d to the Panel                  through

             The minut es       of the m ee tin g were         co ns id er ed as a matter         of practice by

             M E G S and the Council         at    its meeti ng      on the 7th October           1987     (071087).

             My    int erp r et at i on   of the    phrase     "routine mat ter s" means           to operate           the

             day to day        running     of the      licensing     system.         It is a matter        for

             individual        ju dgement     taking ac cou nt       of the      relevant     factors at the

             time.     In practice,        I wo uld expect         that matter s about w hi ch there were

             d i sa gr ee me n t s   or matter s    of    policy,    wou ld    be referred to the           relevant

             committee,        but that where          there was     consensus        between the     parties,          this

             wou ld    be dealt wit h as a routine matter.

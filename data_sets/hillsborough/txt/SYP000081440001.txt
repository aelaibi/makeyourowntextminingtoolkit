number    had been drinking.

Just    after       1500 hours,       our brief was to go to Claywheels Ln for meal.

Ws wa l k e d up Rawson Spring Rd onto Herries Rd and then down towards

the H i l l s bo ro ug h ground.

Once we       reached the       j u n ct ion with P e n istone Rd adjacent                 to the Spion

Hop end,       I saw a S u p e r i n te nd e n t    stood on the          central     reservation.

He told us to standby because                    there was possible            crowd trouble within

the    ground at the Leppings Ln                 end.

A matter       of thirty seconds            to   a minute       later         he ordered us      into the

ground to the L e p pings Ln end                 where the       supporters were climbing                 over

the fences          onto the    playing area.

We went       directly       into the ground and at that                 time     saw the       players

leaving       the    pitch.     We a p p ro ac h e d from the Hop end and whilst                    running

towards       the Leppings Ln end            I saw supporters             climbing       over    the fence

onto    the    pitch.

On arrival          at the L e p pings Ln end           I saw s u p p o r t e r s crammed up against

the fence,          these were       o b v iously being      c r u s h e d.

I went to the          right    hand side of gate four,                 that     gate was a l r e a d y

open,    there were          several    Officers alre a d y at that               gate.     I remember

one was a bald headed Sergeant.                     These Officers were               pulling

supporters          from    inside    the   gate.

I climbed onto a w o o d en spar situated to the                          right hand side          of gate

four,    in front          of the wire fence.

I gestured with my hands and shouted to the                             supporters at the           rear       in

an effort       to encourage          the supporters        to move           back and    pull    back    the

people    in front.           This was met by shouts              of abuse        such as       'Fuck    off5

and two fingered salutes.

At that       time there a p p e a r e d to be room at the                    back of the       immediate

crush.

One man a t t ra ct ed my a t te nt io n he was a p p r o x i m a t e l y            four yards         into

the    crush and was          crying.     He said he was stood on someone and

c o u l d n ’t move.     At this time       I was also ass i s t i n g      supporters who were

f ree i ng themselves          to get over       the fence.

The wo o d e n spar      that    I was stood on broke and myself and other

O f f icers    fell.

At    that    point    I noticed the       people who were at the front were                       being

crushed.        One man was tra pped about            one foot to the        right hand side of

gate    four,       his head was turned sideways and trapped against                        the      fence,

he was       bleeding    from a r o un d the ear.        O t her   people adjacent          to him

were    obviously       dying.

I then gave a ss i s t a n c e at gate four           pulling      people   through.           The n   in

company w ith PC 1914 R O Y L E , other Officers              and several        supporters,           we

ripped up wire meshing                fences.     I tied one section up with a-scarf

suppl i e d by one of the spectators,                then a s s i s t e d with   pulling           people

out and onto the          pitch.

Once    the    crushing had       ceased an Officer         dropped down         into    the       terrace

and was       giving m ou t h to m o u t h to a supporter,           I do not know who               this

was    or whether       the    person survived.

I then a s s i s t e d supporters         on the    pitch wit h first aid.              Then P C 1 9 1 4

s upporters      carried the body of a person to the gym n a s i u m .

The    three    of us carried the body into the gym and PC RE E V t S                       rfamained

with    it.

The n PC R OYLE        returned onto       the field and at that stage              there were

m any d i stressed supporters.

I joined other Officers                then to form a cordon across              the field,          I then

ramained there until             ordered onto P e nistone Rd to supervise N o t t i n g h a m

Forest       fans    leaving    the    ground.

I then returned to original                point on Raw s o n Spring Rd,           junction with

Herr i e s Rd,       a s sisting wit h traffic       control.

             W hilst at that          location        I was a p p r o a c h e d by a distr e s s e d Liverpool

             fan,      who was shouting about              the gate at the Leppings            Ln end being

             opened.         He threw a hamburger across               the   road at me which struck my

              1 eg .

              I went       over    to him,    calmed him down and a d v i s e d him.            He was   then

             e s c orted away by his           friends.

             At    1830 hours,        returned to Ciaywhee 1 s Ln where                  eventu-sTly we got     back

             on the        coach and     returned to R a w m a r s h Police Stat/Eon.

As    we     placed          him       on      the       ground       I felt                        objects           hitting           my     body.             At

I    c o u l d n ’t     believe               this       but    shrugged                       it        off      and      returned            to      gate        3.

          Ian Capes.                                                               K I 2 (


          Police Constable 1^78.

          tfoodseats Police Station,
          Sheffield.Tel 500200.

          D Group.


          At 8.1+5am on Saturday the 15th of April 1989*1 commenced duty at Woodseats Police
Station in order to perform duties at Hillsborough Football ground regarding the F.A.Cap
Semi Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.At this time I was in full Police Uniform.
          Shortly after my arrival at Woodseats I was conveyed together with numerous other
Officers to the ground by a South Yorks Passenger transport bus arriving there approximately
9.30am the same date.
          Once at the ground I made my way to the North Stand in preparation for a briefing
by Senior Officers*At this time I was with my designated serial number 9 which was supervised
by Inspector Booth and P.S.Jessop both of Woodseats Police Station.
          At 9.^5am the briefing took place and various speeches were made by Senior Officers
including Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.
          We were informed that all Officers were expected to be in their various positions
by 11.15am in order to commence duties as oultined in the Operational Order.
          All serials were provided with a packed meal and approximately 11.00a.m.our serial
made it's way to the Spion Kop where we received a further briefing from Supt.Greenwood.
          During this breifing Mr.Greenwood advised us on our duties for the day and also
outlined the various locations where trouble between rival fans were expected.We were told
that should any Liverpool fans stray into the Kop area allocated to Nottingham Forest
supporters they should be ushered to a taped off area to one side of the kop near to the
North Stand where they would be Policed accordingly.
          All Officers present then received a briefing from .Inspector Booth who oultined
the actual duties we were to carry out i.e.Phase 1 - Penistone load- Turnstiles to be Policed
outside the ground.All/majority of fans to be searched prior to entry to the ground and any
prohibited articles e.g.Banners,Bottles and alcohol were to be seized.
          Phase 2 -During the match serial 9 were to Police entrance Z to the Spion Kop.Mr.
Booth pointed out the fact that the majority of the fans would be in good spirits and that
should any problems arrive we were to Police the area as a serial not as individuals and so
protect the safety of Officers at all times.
          Phase 5 - After the match had finished we were to make our way into Penistone Boad
and assist in boarding Nottingham Forest fans onto Football Special buses bound for the city
                                                                               #

centre.
          At 11.15am I commenced my phase 1 duties in company with P.O. 3289 Sutcliffe at
turnstile kS/k$ in Penistone Boad.The turnstiles in question did not open to the public
until 12.00 midday by which time there was a steady flow of Nottingham Forest fans arriving at
the ground.
          Throughout the next 2% hours or so P.C.Sutcliffe and myself Policed the turnstile
   V




       and during that time searched numerous Nottingham Forest supporters for prohibited
articles.We both took possession of numerous items including cans of Soft drinks,beer,
air horns,sticks which had been attached to various banners and a large quantity of Milk
crates that fans had brought to stand on during the match.These items were placed in a
small store within the ground as previously arranged and mentioned during the briefings*
       Whilst Policing the turnstiles I became aware of a person selling programmes through
an open concertina gate situated some 5 - 1 0 yfpds away from where I was stood*The person
in question was stood inside the ground and selling the programmes to persons in Penistone
Boad through the gate whieh was opened 2 feet or so*
       Ibis practice was pointed out to my Supervisory Officers and Mr.Booth advised the
programme seller accordingly and the gate was closed.
       On several occasion whilst stood in Penistone road a large crowd of supporters
arrived at our turnstile and on each of these occasions I could smell intoxicants in the air
which suggested to me the the supporters had been drinking.She majority of these people were
searched.
       Shortly before the kick off approx 2.^5p® I noticed that P.O.Sutcliffe was held in
conversation with two men near to the turnstile.On approaching them I could see that one
of the men was under the influence of alcohol showing the usual signs of a drunken man
his eyes were glazed,he was unsteady on his feet andhe was having difficulty in peaking.
The man in his company had also been drinking but was more composed in his actions.
       I would describe the drunken man as ; White male approx *K) yrs old,5* 8" tall,
medium build with dark collar length hair and a dark moustache.He was wearing a jumper and
jeans.His friend was a white male approx 35 yrs old with sandy coloured hair and moustache.
       The two men were advised that they were not about to gain entry to the ground and
if they made attempts to do so they would be arrested,Both men became arguementative and
abusive towards us and told us of their intentions to make a formal complaint about us.
       I told the men it was their right to complain if they so wished and furnished them
with our collar numbers which I wrote down on a piece of paper.
       Both men decided to stand at the side of us near to the turnstile where they debated
on what to do*
       At this time I noticed a white male who I would describe as 20 - 25 yrs old
5 '8M tall medium build wearing denim jeans and a brown leather bomber jacket.He had light
brown hair cut in a 'bob' style and was wearing black framed sunglasses.As he walked towards
me along Penistone Boad from the direction of the city centre he approached a large crowd
of supporters that had congregated nearby.He was immediately surrounded by these people
and I saw pieces of paper change hands including money.I formed the opinion that this man
was selling tickets and this was confirned when I heard one of the group shout,"Have you
got any more tickets.MThe seller w Jced off in the same direction he had come towards the ^
South Stands*I saw this man from a distance on two further occasions and each time he was
surrounded by youths.
       At 3.00pm I heard a roar from the crowd and assumed that the game had commenced*I
remained where I was as I had been made aware that the turnstiles on Penistone road
■'   ‘                                                            £ \ % v


          were to be left open until half time so that late comers could gain entry.This
 information was passed to me by the ticket collector on the turnstile.
           Approximately 3.05pm I was stood near to P.S.Jessop when I heard traffic on his
 personal radio to suggest that something was happening in the ground.I could not make out
 what was said as I was not in possession of a radio myself.
          Minutes later I heard a message over the tannoy system in the ground requesting
 Liverpool fans to clear the pitch.At this point we were instructed by P.S.Jessop that we
 were required inside the ground.P.C.Sutcliffe immediately ran through the nearby concertina
 gate and into the ground,on doing so I shouted to the turnstile operator to close the
 turnstile doors.this they did without question.
          Once in the ground we made our way through various passage ways to entrance Z on
 the kop.From there I made my way along the front of the kop and through a gate which lead
 us onto the pitch*

           As I ran onto the pitch I immediately noticed that there were no players or official!
 present.I looked down towards the Leppings lame stand and could see numerous spectators
 on the pitch itself.I could see a commotion taking place including Police Officers and
 at this point though that there was a fight taking place between fans.
           The majority of the people on the pitch were near to the goal mouth and I could
 see numerous fans actually climbing over the perimeter fence from the stands*
           I ran the full length of the pitch and came face to face with what I can only
 describe as shear horror.I approached the Lepping lane end slightly to the left of the
 goal mouth near to gate number 3 on the stands.I ran up to the perimeter fence and froze
 with shock at what I saw,My first views were that of a young girl approximately 20 yrs old
 with long dark permed hair .Her face and body were pressed hard against the perimeter fence.
 Her eyes were open and staring into space her mouth was open and she had a look of        shear
 shock*
          My eyes made their way along the front of the fencing.The next person I saw was a
 grey haired man in his 60's*He was blue     in the face his eyes were closed and mouth open his
 body was lifeless,he was obviously dead.At    the side of him was a young man approx 20 yrs old
 with the same appearance he was covered in vomit.Bodies were entwined throughout the length
 of the fencing and piled on top of each other some four or five high.My mind was blocked
 out of hearing anything I was not aware     of what wasbeing said or shouted around me.
          People were climbing over bodies   to get over the fence others were struggling to get
 free from the crush.There were numerous young people crushed against       the front   ofthe
 fence and were obviously fighting for breath. I realised that people were     dying    infront of
 me but I couldn't do anything for them,I couldn 't get to them,I couldn't move the fence.
          There was obvioulsy utter chaos taking place all around me but I wasn’t aware of this
 at the time.I remember seeing ay brother in law another serving Police Officer(Insp•Harvey)
 who looked at me and said words to the effect'Their dying in there.w
          These initial sights and shocks took a few seconds to sink in     and after      hearing
 Inspector Harvey's statement my instincts took over*I climbed on to the top of the
   perimeter fence and began to pull people to safety.I carried them on to the pitch
 and placed them on the floor where other Officers were administering first aid.I recall
 carrying two men to safety who      were conscious butfighting     for air.I    shouted     a
 to breath deeply to get oxygen      into their lungs.
   I went back to the fence and it was at this point I became aware of a man in the
 middle of the crush.He was a Negro male approx 25 yrs old    in a leather bomber jacket.
   Re was up to his waist in bodies and people and literally taking hold of people and
 throwing them over the fence where myself and other Officers carried them to the safety
ojp the pitch.
   At one point I saw him give one person the kiss oflife before lifting    him to safety.
If there were any heros on that     day he was one.He hadtotal     disregard    forhisown safe
and must have saved numerous lives on the day.
   As I helped to get people over the fence the pile of people and bodies grew smaller.
I stood on the perimeter fence leaning over into the compound.I held on with my hips and
legs and reached down to a youth who was trapped at the waist.I managed to get hold of
his finger tips as did another Officer beside me. He looked at us with desperation on his
face.I couldn't get a good enough grip on him to pull him to safety.His body was trapped.
I could see that he was able to breath alright and after a few seconds had to make the
decision to leave him until I was in a position to get him out to safety.I knew I couldn't
remain there holding his hand forever whilst other people needed assistance.I still don't
know what happened to this youth.
   After I had let go of his hand I noticed that gate number 3 nearbywasopen.I     could
see numerous bodies trapped in the entrance.The situation was similar to an egg timer
that was blocked.There were hundreds of grains of sand trying to get through a small
opening but due to the shear quantity the exit was blocked.
   There were numerous Police Officers in the viscinity of the gate including Chief
Superintendent Nesbit.He was at the entrance to the gate and eventually people were
dragged to safety through the gate.I assisted in this operation and formed part of two
lines of Officers at the exit gate that were passing people and bodies onto the pitch
where emergency serfices were waiting to give    first aid.
   I recall dragging a man from the gate onto    the pitch,hewas heavilybuilt   and must
have weighed in excess of 20 stone.I dragged him onto the pitch with the assistance of •
another Officer and placed him on the grass to the left of the goal mouth near to the
South Stand.As we placed him on the ground I felt objects hitting my body.At first I
couldn't comprehend what was happening but then realised that some one from the Leppings
Lane end(Stand)was throwing coins at us.I couldn't believe this but shrugged it off and
returned to gate
   When all of the people had been removed from the compound I assisted in carrying the
dead and injured to the gym area on the bill boards that had been pulled down from the
edge of the pitch.
   I returned to the Leppings Lane end by which time the disaster had run it's course and
I there joined fellow Officers and Liverpool supporters who were stood in disbelief at
what had happended.People were coming round with drinks of wfcter for everyone but no matter
           how much you drank your mouth remained dry.When the incident was all over I recall
looking at my watch and saw that the time was 4.^5pm ironically the time the match would have
finished.
           I made tracks to find the rest of ay serial and eventually,we all congregated on the
 half way line.I have never seen so many bobbies crying or so deeply shocked by what had
happened that afternoon and hope          I will not have to experience such an incident again
in ay life.Words could never explain initial uselessness I felt when I first approached
the perimeter fence and saw what was happening,but not being able to get to the people
because of a silly steel fence erected to stop a minority from running onto a bit of grass.
To my knowledge no one has ever died from running onto a football pitch.
          My serial was eventually deployed into Penistone load to board the remaining fans on
the buses.I couldn't help with these duties it didn't seem important any more.My mind was
full of pictures of what I had experienced.I just sat on the front of a car until we were
stood down by ground control.The pictures will be in my mind for a long time to come.
          We were eventually conveyed back to Woodseats Police station by bus and finished
duty at 6.45pm that date.


          My general observations on the day in relation to the fans and Policing of the
event are as follows;
          I was mainly involved with the Policing of the turnstiles open to Nottingham Forest
Fans prior to the match.I found them to be well behaved on the whole and in good spirits,
if anything I would say that they were quiet for such an occasion.lt seemed to be a nice
family day out for many who attended.
          There were no problems at the Penistone road end of the ground and everything appeared
to run smoothly and according to plan.
          My observations at the scene of the disaster are that I found the safe Liverpool fans
to be totally un co operative throughout the incident.Officers were continuolsy requesting
fans to move back from the fencing but were met with abuse and total disregard for what was
happening.
          Fans that had made their way onto the pitch also hampered the rescue attempts by
obstructing Officers trying to get the dead & injured onto the pitch.They also refused
to move out of the way when requested and continuosly shouted abuse at the emergency services
present.As I have also oultined I was hit by coins thrown from the Leppings Lane Stand*
          I found that   in spite of the totally unexpected incident and impossible circumstances
all Officers present carried out their duties to the best of their abilities.Mr.Nesbit took
command of the situation at gate number three and Officers worked together to rescue the
people from the stand and administer first aid.The situation at the Leppings lane end
dictated the number of Officers that were able to assist at what transpired to be a confined
area.Too many Officers at that location would have only hampered the situation.
      I          discovered at the end of the incident that the Negro in the Stand as oultined
earlier was infact an off duty Police Officer from the Metropolitan Police Force,and deserves

recognition for his brave efforts.

            In w r i t i n g        this       r ep o rt ,     I intend         to       be as       accurate       as    possible       but    in

            purposely           not       thinking           or    talking       about          what       occurred       that    day,    it has

            become        difficult             to    recall           with    great          accuracy,       minor       detail.        This

            report        will       be m a i n l y      about          general          recollections,

            A t about          3.Q0       pm    (15Q0?        Saturday          15 A p r i l         1989    < 150489),      I w a s on        duty

            when     I w ent         to    the H i l l s b o r o u g h         Football             Stadium.        On    arrival     1 went

            straight           onto       the     pit c h ,       along       with       many       other    Police       Officers.        I

            immediately              saw       that    the        game    had    been          stopped.        I sa w      four    men

            including           one       policeman            carrying         a man          towards       the    exit    from    the

            p it c h .     That       person          I. a s s u m e d    to    be       d e ad ,    at    least    he    certainly       looked

            that    way.

            I saw        the    line       of P o l i c e         across       the       pitch       in    front    of a    chaotic       scene

            in f r o n t       of    the       Leppings           Lane    end.           I merely          joined    in    trying    to help,

      comforting          people          trying     to a s s i s t        in     reviving          victims             and      although               I

      did    not a c t u a l l y      ’d e a l ’ w i t h       a dead          p e r son,     1 helped             carry m an y               out       to

      I remember          the      shock      I felt wh en            I thought             how     unusual             and      shocking               it

     would      have      been       normally        to    h av e     just        one    person          k i l l e d at          a football

     match      and    there         we   were     with        dozens.           Each       time      I went            b a ck     to     the       gy m

      bodies       were     literally           being      piled          up    outside        and       inside          I ha d

      indescribable             feelings          when     I saw          numerous          bodies          lined        up.

      I remember          walking          back    towards          Leppings            Lane       end ac r o s s          the      pitch and

      bending        down     to a s s i s t      on e m a n a n d         being        kicked        in the            side       by a n o t h e r

      tb«n    pushed aside.                 I remember            immediately               after        that        stopping             a fight

      af^yoaehing           the      pitch      exit,      I was          hit     at    the    s id e       of iriv p e e k         by a

      ^(attended          tin      can w h i c h     hurt       c o n s i d e r a b l y.

      I remember          that       as    X, w a i t e d w i t h     a    body        outside           the       aVm    that          Iw a s

      u rinated       upon      by a n u m b e r       of y o u t h s          standing        on        the       g a n t r y aliavx*.             I

      looked       up a n d     they       laughed        before          runing        a w a y.         I r e m e m b e r the           awful

      smell     as    the     urine        dried.         It    had       run     down my          n e ck    s o a k i n g rny

      coat,     shirt       and      underclothes.

      I remember          that       as    things      settled            down     towards          the      evening,              many

      officers        were      walking        around apparently                       aimlessly            looking           for m o r e           to

      do.     We     were     eventually           debriefed              and     I left       a short             time       later.

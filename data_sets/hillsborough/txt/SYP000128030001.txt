            I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife and

            small     son and I have done so for the past seven years.          I work for

                                                       St Helens    but I have only been

            there for tewelve months.      I have supported Liverpool FC for many

            years.      I started watching them in 1976 but because       I have been

            unemployed I h a v e n ’t been going to many matches      lately.

            One match I wanted to go to was the Semi Final           between Liverpool      and

            Nottingham Forest on Saturday 15 April        1989?    so my brother   in law

                      who lives at                                 St Helens who is a

            season ticket holder at Anfield got me a ticket for stand but 1 am not

            sure which stand because when I got Sheffeild           I swapped it for a

            ground ticket.

            On that Saturday we left St Helens just after           nine o ’clock in the
                                                                                  PAGE


morning we travelled in three           cars,   I drove my own car which is a red

Ford Escort       in the    car with me was my brother     in law|______________ who

is married to my sister and his two brothers                     and

          still    lives in              ith his mother and              lives    in

                                     St Helens;   but I d o n ’t know the number           I

d o n ’t really know the other       lads and their girlfriends        in the other-

two cars.

After we    left St Helens we went straight to Sheffield,, we d i d n ’t stop

anywhere on the way and we d i d n ’t get caught up in any traffic jams or

anything    like that.        It was about half one to quarter to two that we

got    into Sheffield itself and we stopped for a drink at a boozer                    I

think    its name was the       ’Blue B a l l ’ I ’m sure about that   ’B a l l ’ but it

was definitely       ’B l u e ’ something when we were   in the pub there were

other fans drinking          in there as well but everybody was well behaved.

We then got back       into the car and drove towards the ground and I d o n ’t

remember seeing any fans drinking out of cans or anything else

for that matter.           We managed to find a parking space on a side road,

what name I can’t remember and it was just after two when we left the

car I ca n ’t be any more definite than that but when w e              did leave the

car I co uld n’t see any policemen on the street and none came to us at

all.     The walk to the ground must have taken us about fifteen minutes

and during that time          I d i d n ’t see any fighting or anything     like that

and certainly I c a n ’t remember anybody being really drunk everybody

was    in a bouquest mood on the way to the match.

Everybody from all the three          cars walked down to the Leppings Lane

turnstiles and we must have got there at about twenty five past two by

this time    I had been given a ground ticket by                and I was     looking

for the    *B’ turnstiles and there were no orderly queues at all outside

the    ’B ’ turnstiles      it was just a crowd of people     it was just chaos so

we went up to the          ’C ’ turnstiles because there were no crowds          in front
                                                                                 PAGE         3


of that just      people queuing up, we found a turnstile and asked the

bloke    inside    it we could get    in on a *B* ticket because of the crush

but he said no so we had to go back into the             'B'    crowds   I cannot

remember seeing any coppers outside the            *C* turnstiles.

When we got to the blue metal main gates            in front of the        *B'

turnstiles there were two policemen on horseback there?                  their horses

were    led on to us but moving from side to side and I thought that they

were trying to stop people walking          past them and I think they

were telling people to wait but          I c a n ’t be sure.    Then one of them

started to walk off into the crowd and the space he left behind people

had to try and get nearer to the turnstiles and because of that the

other    policeman started to make his horse         run round in a short of

circle and there were crowds all around the horse,                including me and

we had to push back as far as we could because we co uldn’t go back

because of the crowd behind us so I waited until                I saw a space and I

dodged past him,       through the gates behind the horse and I was stuck

inside the crowd again which seemed to be getting worse by the second

then I saw that one of the girls          in our group who was       in the crowd

looked like she u^as going to faint so together with a few of the lads

we sort of made a circle          round her and pushed back just to give her

some space    like but it was about this time that             I got split up from my

group,    so I decided to just concentrate on getting myself into the

ground because       I've been in similar things before and they always had

cleared and I thought that was what was going to happen this time but

I still felt a little crushed and I saw fans getting onto a wall

between the       *B' and the    *C* turnstiles and I made my way over to that

side because      I thought     it got that bad I could get onto the wall

myself    but once I got over that way I decided to stay in the crowd

because    if I got on the wall the Police might think             I was   'Bunking     in*

and chuck me out so I continued pushing my way through the crowd and I
                                                                                     PAGE       4


remember seeing t w o      police horsemen,        I c a n ’t remember    if they 'A>ere

the same two I had seen earlier by the turnstiles they appeared to be

panicking by the look on their faces and I could hear the crowd

shouting and swearing at them and I think that got to them but I

managed to get to the turnstiles              in the    ’8 ’ section u,>hich was nearest

to the    ’C ’ section and I showed my ticket and got the one part back

and I got    into the ground.        Whilst     I was waiting     in the crowd I c a n ’t

remember anybody actually          ’Bunking     In’ also    I d i d n ’t see any Stewards

by the turnstiles either          inside or outside.

Once    inside the ground I looked for my mates and I saw some of them by

the entrance to the tunnel which led. into the Leppings Lane Terracing.

I knew that because        I had been there before not because I saw any

signs    because    I ca n ’t remember seeing any signs at all showing fans

where to go and that.          I stood by the entrance to the tunnel for a

couple of minutes waiting for my mates and during that time I d i d n ’t

see any coppers or stewards anywhere near the entrance to the tunnel.

Then it must have been about five to three,                 because    I remember    looking

at my watch and thinking          that I should get         into the   match, when I saw

over the heads of the people           coming    in that the big       metal doors

directly opposite the tunnel          entrance was being opened but I d i d n ’t

actually see who opened it but           it was fully opened and there was the

first    little    rush of people through it and then that slowed down a bit

to what    I would describe as a fast walking              pace and everybody actually

in that part of the ground that I was in applauded the decision to let

the gate be opened because          people could have been hurt outside              if that

had not have hap pe ne d „

But because       I still h a d n ’t seen I            sort of stepped into the middle

of the oncoming crowd to          see if I could see him but           because there was

so many people I decided          I ’d better get in so I sort of went with             the

crowd although I felt that          if I wanted to go back out of the tunnel                I
                                                                                PAGE


could have done so I just walked through at the pace of the crowd not

being    crushed or anything   like that when I got to the other end of the

tunnel    I remember seeing the letter      ’A ’ on my left and the letter            ’B*

on my right so I stuck to ’8' side and when I got out of the tunnel                      I

saw there was a metal      fence   running down the middle and I went to the

right of this fence as I was        looking at    it and into the terracing.

I have been shown a grid referene map of the two parts of the

terracing by PC _______ of the West Midlands Police             (Exh No           )

( IDN PM1)   and on it I have marked with a number            (1) where    I stood to

watch the    match and with the number     (2) to show where I got pushed to

as a result of the incident,         When I got down to number one I could

feel that    it was more   ’s qu ash y’ than usual and       it d i d n ’t worry me at

this time    because   Ithought it would get easier          as people settled down

but this time     it d i d n ’t after about a minute   if that,      I just got

pushed forward just quickly like and I got pushed down to point two

where    I c o u l d n ’t go no further because of the people      in front of me

that were    crushed between me and the fence and I had had my arms in

front of me covering my chest and although I think               I could have moved

them I had this instinct to leave them where they were.                   I looked to

my left and I saw a lad behind a barrier           pushing back from it and he

had his girlfriend in between him and the barrier trying to give her

some room and he looked at me and said           ’Help me'    but I co uldn’t do

anything and 1 saw him being pushed forward by the crowd and I d i d n ’t

see him or the girl again.         By this time everybody was shouting and

screaming and I saw the Policeman on the pitch side of the gate in the

fence at the bottom of the terracing,         and everybody was shouting at

them to open the gates and they were         looking around as if for someone

to tell them what to do and they were muttering to themselves then

they started shouting      ’Push b a c k ’ ’Push b a c k ’ and doing pushing

actions with their hands this went on for a couple of minutes and I
                                                                         PAGE


said,    "Never mind push back get onto your mates and tell them to pull

them out from the back'       but they never answered me but I was still

getting more and more squashed but I w a s n ’t finding       it hard at this

point to breath.

By this time       people were trying to climb over the front fence onto the

pitch,    but   it looked like the Police were trying to push them back in

and I even seen people walking across the heads of people in the crowd

to get out of the terracing.        Then a lad fell down in front of me and

because    I knew what    could happen to people who fall down in a crowd I

reached down and grabbed his trouser belt but because           it felt flimsy I

grabbed hold of his waistband as well and tried to pull him up but I

c ou ld n’t budge him and two lads got hold of him under his armpits an

we all tried to pull him up but we couldn’t manage him so after a

while they let him go and I hung on to him a little           longer and I heard

something go maybe his jeans popped open I d o n ’t know but by this time

my arm felt       like lead and although I tried to hold on I c oul dn ’t and I

had to let him go and I d i d n ’t see what happened to him after that.

All    I could see of him was a light brown jacket and blue jeans and he

was a    white kid being a big chubby not fat and he appeared to be

middle to late teens but he was out cold all the time I had hold of

him.

But    I myself   by now because of the crush had started to have trouble

with my breathing so I stood on my tiptoes and started deep controlled

breathing that       I have learnt as part of my martial arts training but              I

still had a weird feeling which I c a n ’t describe        in my chest and I

really thought 1 was going to die but I kept up as best I could.               It

seemed like fifteen minutes       later   I saw the gate   in the fence was open

and I    seemed to have a little space around me and I looked down and              I

saw that the lads legs that       I had tried to help were    like wrapped

round the bottom of a crash barrier.          I was walking   round in a daze
                                                                            PAGE


and I can't    really remember much but I do remember helping a couple of

people    in the terracing and seeing        policemen and policewomen in the

terracing and I offered to help the policewoman but she said she was

ok so I got out onto the pitch through the fencing that had been

ripped off,

I felt really weird like I was floating like so I walked out to the

middle   to the pitch where     it was more open air.      After a M^hile I

decided to go     and see if I could see any of my mates       in the   terracing

and I Mfent up    and asked a copper and he told me where all the people

were sitting that had got out of the terracing so I went back to have

a look but    I couldn't find any of my mates so I walked back to the

goal area where       I could see   people tearing up the advertising

hoardings so I helped to do that and together M,<ith about four or five

other    lads and a    copper all of which I don't    know I carried    a girl on

a hoarding to     the other end of the pitch and      when we got to    the corner

there was some congestion because of other           people doing the same thing

and another    copper not the one with us shouted at us to leave the

hoarding and carry the girl         into the place where all   the people were

being taken a sort of sports         complex.

So we    looked round at her and saw she had all vomit down her front

part of her jeans and there was a sort of a pause before           I grabbed

her,    right leg and the copper with us grabbed the other        leg and

somebody else grabbed her upper body and u;e took her into the Sports

Complex.     As we went through the door a man in a dark uniform

wearing a flat hat looked at me said,           'Dead or alive* and the bloke

who had hold of her upper body I think he was a policeman said              'Dead*

so we put her down in the makeshift area where other dead people with

sheets    covering them were.       After   I put her down I looked around a bit

then started to walk off and I just started to cry and this copper

came over    put his arm around me to comfort me and I got over it a bit
                                                                                 PAGE         8


         and I went back out onto the pitch and up to the terracing          to try and

         find my mates.      I found them all and then we left the ground,       I d o n ’t

         know M,'hat time   it was    but   it was after Kenny DALGLEISH walked out of

         the Police Control Box,

         I would describe the girl we carried as being a white girl about 20

         years of age she looked to be just over five foot tall she had dark

         shoulder   length hair slightly wavy.        She was wearing a red Liverpool

         F„C football   shirt and blue jeans.

             On Saturday,       15th April   1989 (150489)     I was returning home after a

             squash match when I heard a request on Radio Hal lam for medical staff
                                                                     m
             to go to Hillsborough,  At first I paid little notice to this that as

              it was expected I made my way from Crookes to Hillsborough via

             Walkley*         On arrival at Hillsborough at the at the Leppings LN

             gates   I informed a Police Officer that            I was a Doctor and I was

             directed to a LN at the right-hand end of the gates.



             On entering the Lane       I noted a row of bodies on the right against a

             M,‘ire fence,     people sitting and lying against a wall on the left and a

             group   of people near an ambulance at the end.                  I went to this group

             who were resuscitating a boy of late teens or early twenties.                        He had

             been resuscitated by the Ambulance             crew but had no I .V . access.           I
                                                                       PAGE


inserted a venf low on his arm and commenced an infronon of Haemaccel

He had no pulse or spontaneous       respiration but his pupils were

constricted so I decided to continue with C.P.R.         We transferred the

patient to an ambulance and performed ceased cardiac massage and

artificial   ventilation until arrival at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital

a few minutes    later.     In the Accident Department   I transferred the

care of the patient       to the emergency team with Dr. Paul GERRISHAM as

Anaesthetist.    At no time during the journey did the patient show any

signs of recovery.



Following this    1 returned to the ground and assessed a number of

patients none of whom were seriously injured.        After   crossing the

pitch to the Gymnasium and assessing that I was no longer needed at

the ground I returned to the Hallamshire Hospital v;ith a Police escort

and gave assistance over the next 96 hours in the Intensive Care Unit.

The patients    involved on I.T.U. were                  ,

                                              and               All these

patients were still alive on I .T .U . when I returned to my normal

duties.



I now know that the patient       I transferred by ambulance was called Carl

LEWIS and also that he was declared dead shortly after arrival at A „ &
                                                                      PAGE

            On S a t u r d a y , 15th April   1989 <150489)     I was   returning home after a

            squash match when I heard a request on Radio Hal lam for medical                  staff

            to go to Hillsborough.            At first   I paid little notice to this that as

            it was expected I made my way from Crookes to Hillsborough via

            Walkley.        On arrival at Hillsborough at the at the Leppings LN

            gates    I informed a Police Officer that             I was a Doctor and I was

            directed to a LN at the right-hand end of the gates.



            On entering the Lane        I noted a row of bodies on the right against a

            wire fence,      people sitting and lying against a wall on the left and a

            group    of people near an ambulance at the end.                I went to this group

            who were resuscitating a boy of late teens or early twenties.                    He had

            been resuscitated by the Ambulance             crew but had no I .V . access.      I
                                                                     PAGE


inserted a venflow on his arm and commenced an infronon of Haemaccel.

He had no pulse or spontaneous     respiration but his pupils were

constricted so I decided to continue with C .P .R „    We transferred the

patient to an ambulance and performed ceased cardiac massage and

artificial   ventilation until arrival at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital

a few minutes    later.   In the Accident Department   I transferred the

care of the patient to the emergency team with Dr. Paul GERRLSHAM as

Anaesthetist.    At no time during the journey did the patient show any

signs of recovery.



Following this I returned to the ground and assessed a number of

patients none of whom were seriously injured.      After crossing the

pitch to the Gymnasium and assessing that I was no longer needed at

the ground I returned to the Hallamshire Hospital with a Police escort

and gave assistance over the next 96 hours in the       Intensive Care Unit.

The patients    involved on I.T.U. were

                                            and               All these

patients were still alive on I.T.U. when I returned to my normal

dut ie s .



I now know that the patient     I transferred by ambulance was called Carl

LEWIS and also that he was declared dead shortly after arrival at A.&

              I am a married man and I live at the above address with my wife..                       We

              have no children.        I am a Senior Ward Manager,             Charge Nurse,     in charge

              of               at Broad Green Hospital,         Liverpool;      this   is a

                          ward.     I have been a nurse for 12 years.

              I am a season ticket holder at Liverpool                 football    club,

              On Saturday       15th April   1989    (150489),    I was going to Hillsborough

              Stadium in Sheffield to watch Liverpool               play Nottingham Forrest         in the

              FA Cup Semi-Final.         I got a     6 standing ticket for the Leppings Ln end

              of the ground for the semi-final match.                  I got my tickets from

              Liverpool Football Club.

              I was going to the match with my brother-in-law,

              aged 38 years,       he is a Project Manager for                                      and he

              lives at                                       Li ve r poo 1        and a friend who
                                                                                    PAGE        2


is a Merseyside Police Officer,           a                        who lives at

                  Widries-   He    is a CID officer at Liverpool Police HQ.,               He

is aged about 40 years,

At 10 am    (1000)   on match day,.              picked me up at my house      in his

car and we drove to                s house where we picked him up at about

10.,43 am <1045).       We stopped at             s house for a coffee.        We all

set off about      11 am (1100)      for Sheffield.     We went on the M62 to

Salford and on to Sheffield via Country and on the motorway.                    The

motorway was subject to delays at the Sheffield                end due to   heavy

traffic.    We did not stop en-route,

I have been to Hillsborough before and              I was at   the 1988 semi-final at

Hillsborough when I had a seat for the              North Stand,

        parked at 2.25 pm (1445)         in Sheffield in a side street         in

Hillsborough,      only about a ten minute walk from the ground.

We all walked towards Leppings Ln where we all had tickets for this

part of the ground.

It was busy M/ith people          in the area.     It was a warm dry day.       I saw

people drinking from cans of alcohol             in the street but everyone was

well   behaved.

We got outside the turnstile entrance at Leppings Ln at 2.35 pm

(1435),     I saw a couple of police officers on horseback at the

entrance.     I think they were Liverpool Police Officers but they were

away from the turnstile entrance.             It was very busy with lots of fans

in the area.       There was no recognisable queues.           We approached the

turnstiles and behind us were a set of blue doors or gates.                    These

gates were closed after we passed through them but I believe they were

then burst open and never          closed again afterwards.        Above the

turnstile   I saw fans standing on top of the wall,             these fans were

throwing tickets      into the crowd outside and these were people waiting

outside who did not have tickets.
                                                                                 PAGE


The crush was very intense,          the worst that      I have ever experienced and

it seerned that there were far too            few turnstiles for the    amount of

people trying to use them,           I got    separated from my two friends       in

this   crush.

There was a lot of screaming going on.                There was pain in these

screams and people were shouting for others to push back.                 People were

shouting,       "We're getting    crushed."     I began to get frightened as well.

There were so many heads         so close together that the air was becoming

wa rmer and warme r .

A concertina style gate to my left,            as    I faced the turnstile, was

opened from the inside,           I d o n ’t know who by.    There was no control on

the gates at the outside.           This would be between 3 pm (1500)         and 3.03

prn (1503),       I knew the game had kicked off as         I had heard the cheer go

up while I was still waiting outside,

I entered the ground through this             open gate, as a lot of others did,

I walked through a hole          in the wall towards the direction of the South

Stand,     At 3,04 pm (1504),       I met            behind the West Stand,      He    is

heavily built,      6* tall, with bright       red hair and was dressed in a

green barbour jacket over a red Liverpool               shirt,   I was wearing a red

Liverpool sweatshirt with almost a full size Liverpool                crest on

the f ro nt ,

         and I waited for             :>ut M>e could not see him entering the

ground.

At about 3.07 pm (1507),                 and I went onto the terracing        into the

back of the terrace leading into pen 1,               We were still at the steps

leading to the terrace when we came upon a girl who was coughing and

in distress.       She was with a young       lad.     I would describe this girl as

white,    aged about 20s,    plump, wearing a black coat.          She was a bit-

blue around the face,        I thought she was having an asthma attack and

I sat her down and calmed her down,             A Police Officer    came along and
                                                                              PAGE       4


I asked him to call for an ambulance for the girl,             which he did*        We

left the girl with the young        lad and the Policeman,       By this time she

appeared to be recovering.

         and I then moved towards the terracing.        The    crowd were saying

the game had been stopped*         I climbed onto a railing to try to see

what was going on.      The game had stopped.     The players were walking

off*     I saw a body being given cardiac massage at the Leppings Ln end

of the    pitch.   I saw people,    a lot of people,   at the front of the

perimeter fence,    many trying to climb over the fence onto the playing

area.

I realised that I may be able to help and I approached some Police

Officers,    identified myself as a nurse and offered my services*              A

Policeman escorted            and I onto the field.      I had refused to leave

         on his own and,   in fact-, he ended up acting as a stretcher-

bearer for the afternoon.

At 3.09 pm (1509),     I made my way to the Liverpool         goal area.     There

was a lot of people     in shock,   wandering around and in the goal area,

people were    lying on the grass.      Many of the people      lying down in the

goal area were blue     coloured and had no pulse*      At first     I was

surprised that     these young fit men failed to respond to treatment.

People would approach you and ask you to work on the particular                person

they had found and if you could not because you were busy on someone

else they would get quite angry with you*

I saw a man I now know to be Doctor Glynn PHILLIPS working on a body.

I identitied myself to him and started working on th body of a young

male.    This body was revived and Dr PHILLIPS turned and started

working on another body*       I turned as well and saw a man in a light

coloured shirt who     I now know to be Dr Bill PURCELL.         He was working

on a body and I began to assist him*

I told Dr PURCELL who I was and he identified himself to me and we
                                                                             PAGE          5


worked together during the afternoon.        We worked on at least 6 male

bodies    in this goal area.    I t hink one or two were      revived.     I started

with Dr PURCELL about 3.17 pm (1517).

A man    in uniform approached and spoke to Dr PURCELL,          I don't know

what was said.     The man wore a flat cap,      he could have been a Police

Officer or a St John Ambulanceman,        This was about 3.40 pm (1540).

Dr PURCELL took me with him to the gym below the North Stand.                There

were people being carried out on hoardings,         people sitting against

walls,   there was ambulances     in the area.

On the way we stopped in front of Spion Hop,         people on stretches were

in that area.      A young man was on a stretcher,      he was blue but people

with him said he was alright a few minutes ago.             We worked on this

young man without success.        It appeared to be all males      I worked on.

I can't describe clothing of any of them.

Dr PURCELL and I then went towards the gym and on the way I saw large

vehicles    parked in the area.     To the right side was a line of bodies

and on the left side     was a row of the    injured.       Amongst the dead

bodies   I saw   a young male who    looked pink not blue.       He was about     14

years or 12 years old.     He wore jeans and a white         *t* shirt.     We

worked on him.     We got a pulse and got him off to hospital            in an

ambulance.

Dr PURCELL and I entered the gym about 3.55 pm (1555),            it was loud.

My reaction was shock.     The first third of the gym was         laid out with

bodies and with a large number of police         present.     The injured were

along the left hand wall.       We put some drips on the injured.          They

were getting whizzed off by ambulance quickly.          In the last area of

the gym were about a dozen people counting bags and bags of money.                     I

couldn't understand this as it was an all ticket game.

I 'phoned my     wife at our mother-in-law*s about          4 pm (1600).

A man I take     to be a Senior Police Officer who          was dressed in a green
                                                                            PAGE


jumper resembling a gardener took command and quickly got the gym

organised.     The police appeared very busy.           A board was put up with .

photos on it which were all numbered.           A fireman was also    in the gym.

After Dr PURCELL and I checked the dead and injured,             I was told that

there was nothing more for me to do, all the injured had been taken

away by ambulance.       Dr PURCELL and I went back onto the         pitch and out

through the player's entrance.        This    was about 6 pm (1800).      The

ground was empty apart from a group of Policemen             in the North Stand

being addressed by another Senior Officer,              Dr PURCELL tried to drive

me out of the ground in his car but,          dueto road closures and heavy

traffic,   this wasn't    possible.

I left Dr PURCELL in the car park of          the football    ground at about 6      pm

(1800) and walked back t o ______ |*s car.       Both          and       L*ere

sitting    in the   car waiting for me.      Neither of us had been injured at

all ,

I don't know the      identities of any of the people that I assisted to

work on,     I do not know if any of them survived who had been revived,

as a result of my working on them.

               POLICE CONSTABLE 2913



               'F2' ECCLESFIELD



               Following the match briefing      in the North Stand at Hillsborough,       I ,■

              along with other members of Serial       17, attended the enclosure behind

               ’C * gate at the Leppings Lane turnstiles.         We arrived there at around

               11.15 am to take up our position outside the         'A' turnstiles    in order

               to search Liverpool fans entering the ground and to keep Public

              Order.    At the time of arrival     the turnstiles we re closed and there

               were very few Liverpool      fans waiting outside the ground.
At around 11.30 am, we were deployed to the outside of turnstiles                           'A*

and took up our positions,             one officer to each turnstile entry,             I

m y s e 1f taking up pos i t ion at the second turns t i1e along from              'A' g a t e .

At around 11.45 am, myself and two other officers were requested to

leave our pos it ions and ass i st another serial with the off-loadi ng of

buses outside the turnstiles on Leppings Lane.                     This serial    consisted

of   'F2'- area officers         controlled by Inspector Sykes*            Only a few

coaches arrived at this point and it appeared that most of the fans

arriving were either walking to the ground from the direction of

Penistone Road or from Catchbar Lane.

As   I pat ro11ed the area out s ide the turnst iles              I not i ced a number of

youths stood around the small               shop close by the      'A’ gate and also a

number walking past the ground,               the majority of whom donned some form

of   ’Liverpool         M em or abi li a’, who were drinking from cans of lager or

other alcoholic beverage.              On a couple of occasions         I spoke with

these supporters and warned them regarding their entry to the ground

with alcohol           or being worse for drink.           I also saw a number of others

officers do the same and some directed youths to get rid of cans they

were c a r r y i n g    or drinking from,     escorting them to nearby        ’waste bins*

and throwing away the cans.

By 12 noon,        the gates at Leppings Lane were opened,              but the majority

of the fans        refused to enter the ground,            being content to gather on

both sides of Leppings Lane and outside the turnstiles.

Over the next 20 minutes,             the crowd outside the turnstile          increased

in number, as did the number of supporters on both sides of

Leppi ngs L a n e .        Dur i ng this   period,   the   ’mounted o f fi ce rs ’ pat rolled

the area outside the turnstiles               requesting the supporters to move

towards the turnstiles and into the ground.                    A number of buses arrived

outside the ground and occupants were diverted towards the turnstiles

and searched on leaving the buses*                   I could still see a number of
                                                                           PAGE


fans drinking from cans and empties were          lined up on the wall on the

far side of Leppings Lane.

As the numbers outside the turnstiles       increased,   myself and the other

two officers    returned to assist Serial    17 in their duties.     I must

say that at this stage the majority of fans I saw were good humoured

and a small    number had obviously been drinking but appeared fully in

control   of their faculties.      I returned to the turnstile    I had

originally started at and there spoke with Sergeant Whitlam.              I think,

it was at this stage that Police Constable Pulfrey from our serial

left the turnstiles to take a prisoner he had found in possession of

Cannabis to the Police     room.   I was working with Police Constable

Elsam on the turnstiles and we carried out searches on fans who

entered the ground at this point.       Their searches were selective and

not everyone was searched as this would have been impractical             to

carry out.     The majority of fans who entered were either       children or

the older fans who wanted to get their seats early.          Orderly queues

had formed outside each turnstile but these were only of a short

length,   and it appeared that the majority of fans were waiting

outside the ground to enter at a later stage.

As 2.00 pm approached,     the queues   lengthened and the crowds    increased

outside the turnstiles.      At one stage a couple of the fans jumped the

turnstiles and entered without      tickets and some youths tried to enter

the ground via the wall     next to gate   'A'.

On searching one youth I found a tin of lager hidden in a po c k e t , he

was reminded of law and the lager was disposed of.          Some of the

other youths who queued were obviously under the effects of a l c o h o l ,

slurred speech,   etc,   but by 2.20 pm the queues had disappeared being

replaced by a large mass of people, mak i ng s ear chi ng and the deali ng

of the unruly impossible.       Over the next 10 minutes the crowd

increased and people wai t i ng at the turnstile openi ng were being
crushed and pushed,        people were trying to push their way to the front

and gain entry.         I shouted back towards the crowd in an attempt to

get them to move back or people were get t i ng crushed,           but all   I could

see were        people smiling back at me and the crowd pushing towards me.

11 was     now gett i ng very dif f i cult to move at all and people we re

obviously in a distressed state.           Children and some of the M/omen and

old age pensioners were struggling to get through the turnstile and

were obviously scared and frightened by the circumstances which were

ar i s in g .

At this point it was decided that Police Constable Elsam would fight

his way through his turnstile and see if officers          inside the ground,

could help.        This was at around S.40 pm and the crowd was now beyond

control.         I was pressed up against the wall of the turnstiles and was

unable to move,       having to fend off the crowd who were        pressing up

against me.         I could see and hear the crowd who were gathered beyond

the screen outside        'B ' gate.   They were chanting and shouting and

some had managed to climb on to the screen and were scrambling over

the turnstiles        into the ground.    Officers situated there were trying

to send some back but        it appeared the impossible ta s k .     I was uanble

to contact Sergeant Whitlam as I had no radio and had lost sight of

him.     Members of the crowd were shouting at me telling me to get

something done about it,         '‘disgusting" and "someone's going to get

killed out here" were words used.           I decided that I was not helping

the situation by being        pushed to the turnstile wall,   I was also

frightened for my own safety,          so I forced by the people moving      into

the turnstile and went through the turnstile          into the ground.       I went

to Inspector Woodward and explained the ci rucmstances to him.               There

appeared to be a lot of noise over his radio at this time and so I

moved back to give me a chance to get my breath back.              People were

moving through the turnstiles and were shouting at us as they went

past,   "get out there and get something done,          s o m e o n e ’s going to get

killed",   "you're no good in here get out there".            Everyone was

complai ni ng as they passed u s .

Supporters were jumping the metal        railing and getting into the

enclosure by gate       *C * g iv i ng them access to the Leppings Lane Central

Terrace.    There was nothing we could do as there were supporters

grabbing ho Id of us and complai ni n g «    The gateman on gate         'A * was

having to hold the bolts       in the top of the doors as the supporters

outside were trying to break their way in.

At around 2,55 p m , we formed a cordon from gate           ’A' to direct fans

around the back of the North Stand *        The gate was opened and the fans

poured in, shouting angrily at us.          "You should have opened the gates

ear 1ier" was quoted at me several       times and many of the supporters

were obv iously di sgusted by the arrangements outside.

The gates were only opened for a short time and then w e r e             closed by

I nspe ctor S y k e s , he the n directed us outside.     I would est imate that

there was only 200 f ans outside as we got the r e .          Police Se rgeant

Whitlam immediately received a message to the effect that the crowd

M/ere i nvadi ng the pitch so we ran through the tur nst i les and made our

way around the back of the stand into North West enclosure end on to

the pitch*I would like to mention that during the three hours                 leading

up to the start of the game,- I noticed a large number of fans and

spoke to a number who had no tickets*         They added to the mess outside

the turnstiles and obviously a number got into the ground when the

gates were op en ed *

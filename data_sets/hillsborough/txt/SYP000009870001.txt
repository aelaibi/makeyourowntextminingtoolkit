An    officer            did       go    to    the       tunn e l        entrance         I am       unable          to    say w h e t h e r          he

was       a sergeant               or a PC          but       he    beckoned           towards        us a n d        te n      of       us

followed            him.            Whilst          enroute           to    the     t u n n e l a man           came       out       of       the

tunnel        who        was       obviously             in a v e r y           distressed           condition             and       having

difficulty               in b r e a t h i n g           and appeared              to     be    in shoc k .                He    was       in his

late       twenties.                    I helped             him    out     of    the     gates       I didn't             see       any

injuries            to    this          man    he       sat       down     by    the     gates       leaning          against             the

w a ll.         I asked             him       if    he was          alright         and       he    s a i d yes.               So    I walked

back       towards            the       tunnel          and       numerous         police          officers          were       going          into

the       tunnel         at    this        time.              I also        s ome      more        fans       coming       out       the       tunnel

I had a g o o d               view       of    the       tun n e l .            I must        add    here       that       this          is    the

tunnel         to    the N o r t h S t a n d                 and West           Stand     c orner.              At    t his         t im e     I wa s

approached               by a n o t h e r          two       fans    wh o       were     assisting            another           fan

who       appeared            to    be     in w o r s e           condition         to    the       first       I had atten de d

position.                 He       seemed          to be a l r i g h t          I then        noticed          the    first           man       whom

I had a s s i s t e d              he was          leaning           bac k a n d       1 could         see a        line       of     blood

from       under         his       c hin      d o w n his         neck     he    didn't        appear          in    immediate

assistance               so    I carried                on    back       into      the    football             g round.




I gained            access          to     the      pitch          I could         see    about       twenty          people             l y ing     on

the       pitch who            ha d      their          faces       covered         over       and appeared                to       be    dead.

I noticed            one y o u n g            lad a g e d          about        14 y e a r s       I couldn't             see       any

Control Assistant               1400 - 2200 Saturday 15th April 1989.




About 1510 hours I took a call from the Police who said "I want a fleet of
ambulances to Leppings Lane".     I passed this information to
as we had already had at least one call from the Police.             told me
that further information was also coming in from Hillsborough.


We mobilised vehicles to the scene.     Ray Clarke told me to open up an
incident log.   Mr. Hopkins was in control and instructed the second
Middlewood vehicle to be mobilised and then informed us that he would be
going to Hillsborough to assess the situation.


We started to mobilise other vehicles, most of these were through radio
communications via               I   As best I could, I logged the vehicles
booking mobile straight away.


                informed the hospital casualties about the situation and
started to notify people for calling in.      I then went with Mr. Clarke to
operate from the Incident Room on ERC.


I rang Nottingham, they were unaware of the situation, I informed them
about Hillsborough and asked if help was available if it was required, they
said "you only have to ask".


From then on, everything happened at once.


1 rang Mr. Smith and informed him of the incident at 1535 hours.        The
incident log was opened at 1512 hours, this being the time I received a
call from Force control.    The Policeman was panicking, I did not get any
information other than "I want a fleet of ambulances to Leppings Lane".        I
explained officers and ambulances were located at the ground already, he
did not give me any further information.      I do not think the Police knew
what was happening when I spoke to them, he just wanted to get off the
telephone.

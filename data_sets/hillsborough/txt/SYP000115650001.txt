I was not aware of the reason for                             our instructions, b u t ' a s s u m e d there

;w.as disorder            inside       the    ground.

On .enierang H i l l s b o r o u g h w ith my serial,                      I we n t ; di r e c 11 y onto                the

pitch.         The    players were w a l k i n g            off     the    pitch via the                players'

'tunnel,       and    I could          see m a n y Police          officers       on the       pitch at             the

Leppings        Lane       end of       the    ground.

I made my way d i r e c t l y to t h a t . e n d and                     from that       point          I lost          contact

with most        of my s e r i a l .           I saw that          fans    on the L e p pings                Lane       terrace

were     pressed          hard up against            the    perimeter           fence    to such a degree

that     the    fence was            bowing     outwards       under       the    pressure.              Police

officers        were       trying       to    lift   people        over    the.fence          and       onto    the

pitch,.        1 saw that              to the    right of          the    pen where          the fans were

standing        there was              a corridor       about       2 yards       wide and supp o r t e r s were

attempting           to    climb       from the      pen    into     this       corridor       to escape                the

crush.         I saw that            once     in the    corridor,          these       fans were             remaining

w here    they were,            as     if    in a daze.        This       had    the    effect          of    pr eventing

others     escaping             into    the    corridor.           Access       onto    the    pitch was

available        from the              corridor      via an        open    gateway, and 1 set about

p u 11 i n g pe o p 1 e a n t o t h e p i t c h .

Eventually           I was able             to get   into     the    corridor          and    ay    pressing my

knee     between          the    palings       of the      pen fence,           fans were          able       to use          it

as a step up to                 climb over       the    fence and          into    the       corridor.              I

c o ntinued      doing          this    until    the    crush       inside       the    pen seemed             to ease.

1 remember           seeing       other       officers      on the pitch trying                    to    pull       away       the

perimeter mes h fencing                      but without       success at that                stage.

On   leaving         the    corridor,          I went      on the        playing       surface          to see          if

there; was, a n y t h i n g          I could do.           O n l y at     this    point did             I realise

there were         fatalities          whe n    I saw four                or five bodies             laying near            to

the    goals.         Ambulancemen,            Red Cross          personnel and Po l i c e                 officers

do.      I saw, P o l i c e       officers      and s u p p o r t e r s          using m a k e s h i f t      stretchers

to    car^y the         injured       to the Forest             end of the ground,,                   and     I gave a

hand wit h this.

An    incre a s i n g    number       of Liverpool            fans were              now on the           pitch apd          it

was    obvious        that     the Forest           fans at       the        other     end had no           idea, what

was    h a p pening .         The y    chanted f oq.t>bail                                                     •'i.-n'c^n^e^

the Liv e r p o o l      supporters           who    began ma k i n g            sporadic          cha_rges ^across "the

pitch^‘t‘o war5 the Kop.                    We were      ordered           to form a cordon across                    the

pitch to .stop these                  charges and for a while                        I formed        part     of the

cordon.

The    charges        soon stopped?            and     I    saw a number               of L i verpool fans             on the

pitch throwing             punches          at a man        they          were    surrounding.              I went     to

I took      him by the arm and                 led him to the Kop end of the                               pitch.        I

clearly       remember         asking        him what       the       hell       he thought          he was       doing and

him    replying         "It's my j o b " ,           I left       this man with some                      other

p h o t ographers        at    the    other     end of the                ground and          retur n e d     to the

L e p p i n g s Lane     end.         I saw another           phot o g r a p h e r        being a s s a u l t e d and             1

r e cognised him to               be a civilian scenes                     of     crime      officer       e m p l o y e d at

There     f o l lowed what            I remember         see m e d        like a kind of             limbo,       with

Police and fans               standing a r o u n d         on the          pitch and wit h               rumours ,on the

          o b v i o u s l y a father           as k i n g about    his    child and officers                  trying   to help

          My    overwhelming             feeling at that           time was         of he 1 pi essness          and

          in a d e q u a c y ,    and    I saw many        of my friends            and    colleagues          looking      just

        , as    1' must      have       looked - totally           shell      shocked.

          E v e n t u a l l y we were          called     to the N o r t h       stand     for   redeployment,             and   I

          were      to get        transport,        but    on arrival         there, was         insufficient

           transport         to    convey all         ttie unit.         Wit h    other     officers          l therefore

          at    us etc.,          but    the    only violence as           such      that     I saw     involved        the

                                                              A    4.^2
My name is Raymond Leslie Johnson. I am Police Sergeant 1771 of the South Yorkshire
Police currently stationed at Rawmarsh (C.2.) Sub - Division.

At 9.15 am on Saturday 15 April 1989 I attended at the North Stand, Hillsborough
for briefing in connection with the F.A.Cup semi - final between Notts Forest
and Liverpool due to take place at 3»00 pm that day.

I was assigned Serial No 57 (1 Sgt + 9 P.cs) with instructions to patrol either
side of Herries Eoad between the Five Arches railway bridge and the Five Arches
Public house. My serial commenced these duties at 11.10pm and it quickly became
apparent that the Five Arches pub would require special attention: It was soon
full of Forest supporters who were drinking heavily and chanting football slogans
in the pub#

Supporters were queueing to get into the premises and those who couldnt get in were
buying cans of beer from a nearby Off Licence. However, at no time did I see any
violence from these supporters.

At approximately 2.55 p.m, with most (but not all) of the Forest supporters
having left for the ground, my serial made its way to take up our 'Phase 2'
position and meal break at Claywheels Lane. As we were passing the ground
entrance opposite the Penistone Rd/Herries Rd junction we were directed to
go into the ground. At that stage, I was not aware of the reason for our
instructions, but assumed there was disorder inside the ground.

On entering Hillsborough with my serial, I went directly onto the pitch. The
players were walking off the pitch via the players tunnel, and I could see
many Police Officers on the pitch at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

I made my way directly to that end and from that point I lost contact with most of
my serial. I saw that fans on the Leppings Lane terrace were pressed hard up
against the perimeter fence to such a degree that the fence was bowing outwards
under the pressure. Police Officers were trying to lift people over the fence
and onto the pitch. I saw that to the right of the pen where the fans were
standing there was a corridor about 2 yards wide and supporters were attempting
to climb from the pen into this corridor to escape the crush. I saw that once
in the corridor, these fans were remaining where they were, as if in a daze.
This had the effect of preventing others escaping into the corridor. Access
onto the pitch was available from the corridor via an open gateway, and I
set about pulling people onto the pitch.

Eventually I was able to get into the corridor, and by pressing my knee between
the palings of the pen fence, fans were able to use it as a step up to climb
over the fence and into the corridor. I continued doing this until the crush
inside the pen seemed to ease. I remember seeing other Officers on the pitch
trying to pull away the perimeter mesh fencing but without success at that
stage.

On leaving the corridor, I went on the playing surface to see if there was
anything I could do. Only at this point did I realise there were fatalities
when I saw four or five bodies laying near to the goals. Ambulancemen, Red
Cross personnel and Police Officers were tending to injured fans and for a
time I was at a loss what to do. I saw Police Officers and supporters using
makeshift stretchers to carry the injured to the Forest end of the ground,
and I gave a hand with this.

An increasing number of Liverpool fans were now on the pitch and it was obvious
that the Forest fans at the other end had no idea what was happening. They
chanted football slogans etc and this incensed the Liverpool supporters who
began making sporadic charges across the pitch toward the Kop. We were ordered to
form a cordon across the pitch to stop these charges, and for a while I formed
part of the cordon.

The charges soon stopped, and I saw a number of Liverpool fans on the pitch
     throwing punches at a man they were surrounding. I went to this incident and saw
     that they were assaulting a newspaper photographer who had apparently been taking
     photographs of the corpses, I took him by the arm and led him to the Kop end of the
     pitch. I clearly remember asking him what the hell he thought he was doing and
     him replying *Its my job.* I left this man with some other photographers at the
     other end of the ground and returned to the Leppings Lane end. I saw another
     photographer being assaulted and I recognised him to be a civilian scenes of
     crime officer employed at Force H.Q. and known to me as 'Spike.* I went to him
     and led him away to a safe position.

     There followed what I remember seemed like a kind of limbo, with Police and fans
     standing around on the pitch and with rumours on the extent of the fatalities
     passing this way and that* We were told to leave the playing area and I made my way
     to the area of the gymnasium behind the North stand. I went to the gym and looked
     through the doorway, I saw corpses laid in rows across the gym floor and I couldn't
     comprehend what I was seeing. The effect was like a hammer blow, and I was fighting
     to control my emotions, I saw a man, obviously a father asking about his child
     and officers trying to help him.

     My overwhelming feeling at that time was of helplessness and inadequacy, and I saw
     many of my friends and colleagues looking just as I must have looked - totailly
     shell shocked.

     Eventually we were called to the North Stand for redeployment, and I formed part
     of an ad hoc unit directed to attend Barnsley Morgue to assist with the corpses.
     We made our way to Claywheels Lane where we were to get transport, but on arrivail
     there was insufficient transport to convey aill the unit. With other officers
     I therefore remained at Claywheels Lane until stood down off duty at about 6.30pm.

     During my duty at Hillsborough, I was not personally assaulted in any way. Many
     Liverpool fans did say the Police were to blame and swore at us etc, but the only
     violence as such that I saw involved the Photographers as related above.

                 see them put him out but I ’m sure they did.       A i/ou t 10 minutes later I

                 was still in the Kop when I saw                        he had obv io us ly got

                    back     into the ground.             I could            pick him out because he had a green

                    Rugby shirt        on with a white                  collar.         We got      back together.              The police

                    were     obviously       looking for him,                    as he had got back             in the ground.               We

                    could see the          police searching,                     As               top stood out so much,

                    shouted to a Forest S up porter                         to    lend him a coat to                put on to       cover

    HlGrH-C/        his shirt and one of them                    passed over a black                   leather       jacket wit n a
    U(UvC64j>/      .
                    badge     on the       pocket.      I do not knoup who                   the Forest S up porter was and                       I
              w ould    not    recognise       him again,                   did not give the jacket              back and

              as far as        I know he has          still/go 'Y it.

              We    then made     our way to the front                corner        of the Kop and both          climbed

              over     the f e nce onto        the track.           We were        not stopped by the          police as

              there were        none very       close to where we              climbed over.

              As we     looked at the Liverpool                end the two           of us wal ke d down the           right

              hand side of the           pitch.        I    could    not say what        time this was          but    it was

              before     the    players     came out.          One steward a p pr o ac h ed us and a sked                us

              what we were       doing.        We told him a               police    officer had sent          us from the

              K o p end to the other           end.        He told         us to    carry on but to keep off the

              pitch.

              W he n we got to the L iverp ool                end we went           into the    corner where we saw

              a police officer,           we      told him the            same story we had told the             Stew ar d

              an d he opened a gate in the front                      fence and        let us    in.

              We made     our way across          the T e r r a / r e ,    over a very narrow           pen,    then went

              up to the back,           w al ke d along       t/ne back       past    the tunnel       and got    into

              what     I now know to be          penQ^o.       3.     We went        to the far side of          it to the

              fence and started to                make our way            tp^aards the front.          We were    still

              both together and           I w ould         say w^rgot       to wi th in 6 feet         of the    front

              fence.      The    next    thing    I re m jm b e r     is the        players    being    on the    pitch

              k i c |<i n g i n , w hen t h ere w ayr quite a              surge from the back w hi ch           caused us

C>0£Pt£S      to be pushed furth^r^jyfward.                      I was      close to the       side of a barrier

C£0^])        and quite        near the dividing             fence.        I went     forward to the side             of the

              barrier and fell           to the ground.              I was only able           to get up after          I had

              crawled forward a bit,              found a space and got up.                     I have    no

              rec o l l e c t i o n of any of the barrier?                 breajs^ng.

              The    next thing     I remember             is a Liverj^efol         player    shot and hit       the    bar,

              then     there    seemed to be a big             cru^jf and          1 don't    remember m uch for         some

Hi t       time
              A fter    it went a bit q^ietj^i                remember        I saw what       I thought was a very
                                                                                                       PAGE         4


        young     girl,   at the time       I thought about 8/9 yrs.                old,   laying on the

        gro un d a couple      of feet away.             She    had on a Liverpool         football    top and

        black trousers.        *C lo se    to her there were other                bodies   laying on the

        ground.      I picked the girl           up and        tried to    pass   her over the fence          at

        the     front.    I knew    it     was girl as she had long brown hair.                   As   I

        passed her up, a police             officer       took her from jp e *        I thought    she was

        dead and he said,          "Forget       it, you c a n ’t doy^ny th in g       for her".       All I

        w a n te d to do then was           get out,     so; I clirr^ed on the front         fence     an d I

         was     pulled onto    the      pitch-by twj/ f ari^/f



        Whe n    I got onto the       pitch      I sat by the goal.           I d o n ’t know just where

        but     I suppose   I was     there      for about 20 minutes.              I even tu al ly got up

        and walked away towards             the N o t ti n gh a m Forest      end.     I met a lad I know

        by sight from my home.              We went out of the ground together,                   t hrough

        the gate where       the ambul an ce s were             leaving,    it w ould be about

        3 . 3 3 - 4 5 pm (1535-1545)      by this time.           1 then met some more         people who

        lived     in my area and got home via Manchester.




        The one     point   I would       like    to make       is that as Liverpool         have more       fans

        than the other       clubs,       they should have been given the Kop end of the

        gr ou nd and not the L ep pings            Ln.    terrace.

        I did not go home with any                clothing       other    than the ones      I went    in,

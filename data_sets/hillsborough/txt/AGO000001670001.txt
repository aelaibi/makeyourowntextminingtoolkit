       Dear Sirs,

       THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL TRAGEDY

       I refer to your letter of 21 March 1995 asking whether this
       office would be prepared to outline the explanation received from
       the Daily Telegraph in the context of the complaint made on
       behalf of your client that the Daily Telegraph was in contempt
       of court.

       Please accept my apologies for the delay.      We approached the
       Daily Telegraph to ascertain whether they would be willing for
       a copy of their letter to be disclosed to you.   They have taken
       the view that it was a response by themselves to an authority
       enquiring into a criminal allegation and that they are therefore
       not willing to consent.    We propose to respect that position.


       Yours faithfully,




       S. J. WOOLER

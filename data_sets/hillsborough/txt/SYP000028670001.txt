                John A ldridge converts one o f his tw o goals against Forest in last years semi.

                No one wants to return to Wembley more than John Aldridge.
                Last season, the free-scoring Liverpool striker dragged himself o ff the most famous soccer stage in
                the world, a forlorn F A Cud figure at the end o f a sensational final tie against Wimbledon.

                Lee Chapman beats Bruce Crobbelaar to score fo r Sheffield Wednesday a t Anfield.

                Lee Chapman’s return to his happy hunting ground today could be just what the doctor ordered —
                unlike his last appearance in an F A Cup semi-final.
                The big Forest striker, back a t the Hillsborough ground where he had such wonderful success in his career,
                defied a serious illness to play fo r Sheffield Wednesday in the 1986 semi against Everton a t Villa Park.
He had missed the penalty th a t might have changed the course o f a
remarkable afternoon. Liverpool's defeat was very much down to their
collective failure to perform as a team on the day, but the Republic o f Ireland
striker still blamed and punished himself fo r a defeat th a t made a mockery of
the pre-match predictions.
That's why John is desperate to put the record straight. He said. "If we can
beat Nottingham Forest and get back to Wembley — and I can keep my place
— it will be the perfect opportunity to get tha t penalty miss out o f my system
once and fo r a ir'
Aldridge is in the mood to conjure up something special. He's been scoring
goals like there's no tomorrow, meeting a mighty challenge this season head
on. The return o f scoring legend Ian Rush to Anfield from Juventus before the
start of the new campaign suggested to many people th a t the form er Oxford
star's days with the ciub he has always idolised might be numbered.
Far from it, John, who won a prestigious Adidas Colden Boot after leading the
First Division scoring charts last season with 26 league goals, knuckled down
from the word go to produce the goods once again.
He returned to Wembley in the Charity Shield in August to plunder a
magnificent double as Liverpool gained quickfire revenge over Wimbledon.
His season really began to take o ff in a big way from mid-January when everything he touched seemed to turn to
gold, or more to the point, goals! In tandem, Liverpool's form has been truly magnificent.
The Merseyside Reds go into todays semi-final, looking fo r a repeat o f last season's result when they saw o ff the same
opposition on the same ground, winning 2-1 thanks to an Aldridge double. 8ut you won't hear Liverpool or any of
their stars making any wild predictions.
They will get on with the job in hand in their usual low key manner, letting their fe e t do the talking. Looking back at
last season's meeting, Aldridge said: ” l remember John Barnes had a tremendous game. I scored the goals, but he was
our match winner. The second goal, when he rounded a defender and crossed fo r me to volley home, was vintage Barnes.
"I   m et the ball perfectly and it went in, as sweet as you like. It was a really great day."
Aldridge had scored Liverpool’s opener from the penalty spot. He hasn't lost his confidence when it comes to taking
them — despite tha t subsequent Wembley nightmare. It says everything about his approach to the game. John is a
Scouser who can relate to the fans every inch o f the way. A fte r all, he was a Kopite himself as a youngster.
He revels in every game in a Liverpool shirt. Today's clash — if selected — will be no exception. I say "if selected"
because no member o f Kenny Dalglish's outstanding team is sure o f his place. That's the way it has always been at
Anfield. The on-going battle fo r places, week in, week out, is one of the major reasons fo r the club’s phenomenal success.




Wednesday lost, b u t their manager then, Howard Wilkinson, said it was a miracle tha t Lee had played a t all
Only after the match was it revealed th a t he was suffering from hepatitis, a liver complaint. It was wondered a t the
time what e ffe c t this would have on his football career.
He had to give up alcohol fo r six months and follow a fat-free diet. But he came back as good as new.
Today he comes back to the ground where he scored some marvellous goals and was a huge favourite with
Wednesday, fo r whom he scored 78 league and cup goals in fo u r seasons.
And a t Hillsborough last New year's Eve, he and Forest played some flowing football as they won 3-0 against Wednesday.
Lee, now enjoying himself in Brian Clough's side, stands out as one o f football's success stories.
He began as a goal-scoring centre forward a t Stoke, but suffered after being sold fo r £500,000 to Arsenal in 1982. His
price had gone down to £100,000 when Alan Durban signed him fo r Sunderland the following year.
But things got worse. Durban and the club parted company, and Lee fell out o f
favour with new boss Len Ashurst.
Lee was playing fo r the Roker Park Reserves when Wednesday, about to
embark on their First Division comeback in 1984, signed him fo r £100,00.
His power in the air has been a threat to First Division defences ever since. But
he acknowledges th a t his game on the ground improved while he was at
Hillsborough. And he went through one spell where he scored many more goals
with his feet than with his head.
He became known as a centre forward with all-round ability.
Sheffield fans were sad to see him leave last summer, for French club Niort,
and so was Brian Clough. But when the French experience did not work out,
there was only one club tha t Lee wanted to play for, and th a t was Forest.
So now Lee is an im portant part o f Brian Clough's skilful, widely-admired side.
Liverpool bar the wav to Lee's Wembley debut. He not only finished on the
losing side against Everton three years ago, b u t also suffered the same
experience in 1983, when he went on as sub fo r Arsenal in their semi-final
defeat by Manchester United.
But th a t too was at Villa Park, and a t Hillsborough, Lee is playing on a ground
where he and the team he has been playing fo r have rarely failed.
He can also count Liverpool among his victims — he scored against them at
Anfield in a 1-1 draw on 16th November, 1986.
It would not be a miracle if either side won today, but whatever the result,
there will have been 100 per cent e ffo rt and com m itm ent from Lee Chapman.

Liverpool and N ottingham Forest
have had some th rillin g matches
over th e years and i'm sure the
latest will be no exception.
Meeting the m again at
Hillsborough revives pleasant
memories o f last season's semi-final
here when we progressed to
Wembley w ith a 2-1 victory. That's
all history now and while everyone
at Anfield would like it t o be
repeated we know th e size o f th e
task facing us today.
Like ourselves, Forest are also
challenging f o r th e title. They have
had a trem endous season so far,
playing entertaining football, and
will be doubly determ ined to make
amends f o r last time.
But we, too, want to re tu rn to
Wembley fo r th e second year in
succession, hopefully t o go one
fu r th e r tha n on our previous visit.
The League Championship remains
th e to p award in the
dom estic game because
it is won with
consistency over
38 games.

        continue         on his way.

        At 3 . 0 5 p m     (1505)           on the o u t b r e a k       of t r o u b l e    I heard a radio m e s s a g e

        We    quickly        r e al is ed       this was        impossible           as abuse and                  threats        fro m

        Liverpool         s u p p o r t e r s was         so fie r c e      we    had to       retreat             to upper

A police        o ff i c e r    scuffled          with       a Liverpool            supporter         in my v i e w i n g

and a f ur t h e r         group of        L i v e r p oo l    s up p o r t e r s     moved     in the       direction      of

the    o ff i c e r    but     an a m b u l a n c e    drove       slowly       between         the g r o u p    and   it

dispersed.             The     crowd      c o n t i n ue d    to leave        the L e p p i n g s      Lane     end.

I then r e t u r n e d         to the g y m n a s i u m        and I recall              going     to a d e - b r i e f i n g

After     that        I took up a point                of duty         at   the P e n i s t o n e      Road     entrance        to

the    ground         and with P.S.            Batty         and other       officers           worked       this   point

until     5•30 a.m.            (0530)       the    f o l l o w in g morning.

Throughout            the night          I was     on dut y       at    this        gate    point      preventing

press     from e n te ri ng           and m ee ti ng          relatives             from L i v e r p o o l   who were

a r r iving    throughout             the night.

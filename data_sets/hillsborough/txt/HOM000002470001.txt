                                                                                   (S I G N E D >



           I am a Liverpool    Football   team supporter.       My father   is a season

           ticket holder and qualifies      for a ticket to all the important

           matches.    Also a friend qualifies for 2 tickets via the Development

           Association and my other friends are also season ticket holders who

           qualify.

           On this day there were eleven of us with tickets for various sections

           of the ground, my own ticket being a £14.00 ticket for the North

           Stand.     We were to travel   to the ground in three cars.

           At about 1030 am on Saturday 15th April         1989,   I and the other ten met

           at              house.   She is one of the other ten people.

           I was    in one car with a man named           I who lives   in London but

           quite regularly comes     to Liverpool for weekends.                              was

           the third one in this c a r .

           We started off from                 house at about 1045 am to travel         to

           Hillsborough Football Ground in         Sheffield.

           We stopped at a public house on         a road heading towards Huddersfield

           and away from Sheffield.        It is   off the main road.       We stopped there

           for      meal and a drink and also      to meet some other friends there,

#   four    in total.

    We left there at about 1405 pm to go to the ground.            It takes us

    about 15 minutes       to get there. , I know this because I have been to

    Hillsborough many times before and you get to know the best times to

    arrive.

    We arrived there and parked the car on a garage fore-court at about

    1430 to 1440 pm after having a little dificulty in finding a place to

    park.

    We walked to the ground and arrived there at about 7 minutes            to three-

    o-clock.     On the way there were a lot of other people walking but

    there was no fighting or drunkenness           that I could see.   There were no

    policemen around at this time.

    At the ground we knew which end to go to but we w e r e n ’t quite sure

    which entrance to make for.          There was a line of about three policemen

    on horses,       side on to u s .   I tried to ask them where to go but they

    were busy looking towards a crowd of supporters on the other side of

    them.     One did point towards a gate but thats all.

    We walked towards        the direction in which he had pointed and came upon

    a gate,    a sliding concertina type and about 12 feet wide.          This gate

    was open and no-one around except other fans.            There were no stewards

    at all.

    At this stage,       because .we had tickets for different sections of the

    ground we seperated and I eventually ended up going through the gate

    on my o w n .

    I still had my full ticket          in tact.   I have retained this at home.

    Once through the gate you have to follow it through to the North Stand

    I went towards an entrance into the stand which was nominated on

    my ticket and this was only about 3 feet wide and about            3 or 4 steps

    up into the stand.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



There were two police officers at the top of these steps together

with a couple of stewards.                                            I could see that the policeman was

standing on the steps with his back to the wall                                                      trying to stop us

coming up.                    At this stage there were a lot of fans trying to get into

the stands but I could also see that it was chockabloc up there too.

There was a policewoman standing at the top with her arms spread

across the entrance stopping them and me from going any further.

I was          in fact able to see that the game had just kicked off.

The policewoman was certainly having dificulties.                                                       There were fans

ducking under her arms to get in.                                                       In the end she just gave up because

of the pushing she was getting and stepped aside.

The fans then piled into the stand and I made my way to my seat.

Within a minute or two of sitting down I could see people spilling

 out onto the track at the Lepping Lane end standing area.                                                      There were

a lot of them climbing over the fencing.

 At first the police began to push them back.                                                      Thats the way I saw it,

 but when people saw how serious                                                 it was I could see then that the same

 policemen were then helping them over and getting them onto the pitch

 side.

         f^whatever                           was going on didn t seem too serious to me.                           I

 could see that it was very full                                                 in the middle there but     it must have

 been 15 minutes before I realised the seriousness of it.                                                      By this time

 the game had been stopped and most of the activity on the pitch was

  fans running and helping other fans and carrying them away on

 advertising boards.

  Looking back on it, because of the amount of fans still outside the

  ground x wonder wh y they d i d n ’t delay the kick off time.                                                I feel this

  would have relieved the anxiety of the fans waiting for entry to the

  ground thereby relieving the problem inside the ground.

           lust    one thing going back to the journey to the ground there was one

           gtage where there was a set of traffic lights at some road w o r k s .

           This held us up and in fact we remarked that anyone coming after us

           would probably have dificulty getting to the ground on time.

           I d o n ’t know why but it seemed to me that the whole affair was

           handled diferently from the other times I have been to Hillsborough.

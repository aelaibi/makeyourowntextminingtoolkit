 Dear Sir_

     J l sborough:               Public Inquiry

 Further to our mcetjing yesterday, we send herewith, for reference,
 a copy of the proof: of evidence submitted to the Cleveland Public
 Inquiry by the Chief Constable of Cleveland.   There will follow by
 post copies of the rather bulky Appendices and we will also send
 you, again by way c £ example of the format adopted for such proofs,
 a copy of the evidence submitted by our clients Hargreaves
 Clearwastc Limited to the inquiry into the gas explosion at Loscoe
 in 1986.  We should perhaps make the point that all of this
 documentation is wi thin the public domain.

 The proof of evidence usually has to be submitted some seven to
 fourteen clays beforje the inquiry opens for full hearing and may
 then be expected to be supplemented by oral evidence.    For example,
 in the Cleveland inquiry oral evidence was given by the Chief
 Constable and five other Officers, ranging in rank from Inspector
    ^Assistant Chief C o n s t a b l e .

 Whilst this matter is only in the very early stages and we shall
 need to be guided by Counsel, our own feeling is that Lord Justice
 Taylor will be expecting the South Yorkshire Police to put in a
 formal proof of cvijdenco and will also be expecting Officers
 principally concerned in the events which occurred on Saturday,
 15th April to give joral evidence.  It should be noted that the
 inquiry has the power to compel any pers
                                      person to attend and give



                                                                                                                      /...       contd.

 evidence under Subpoena and, obviously, if: that is a possibility
 then we would advise that such evidence bo properly prepared and
 given voluntarily, !

 Our preliminary view of the appropriate headings for a formal proo:
 of evidence are as follows:


               The South|Yorkshire Police:  history,    geographical
               area, manhing and organisation.

               The policing of sporting events:  the statutory
               and common law background to Police involvement.

               The approach of the South Yorkshire Police to the
               policing £>f major sporting events: the history
               of such operations and the current standing
               operationhl orders.
                            |
               The specific background to Police involvement in
               the match! to be played at Hillsborough, on
               15th Apri 1.

               Details o f. the manpower and organisation Tor the
               match.

               The events which occurred.


 In our view, it will be necessary to have statements from as many as
 p^fcjible of the Officers who were deployed at the ground on that
 d^^," obviously, including a].] of the senior Officers and, even so
 far as junior Officprs are concerned, it may well be helpful to have
 statements indicating when they came on duty, to whom they were
 responsible, where they were, what they observed and what they did.

 We do not underestimate the size of the task indicated, but the
 quality of the prooif of evidence submitted by the Chief Constable
 will depend very much on the accuracy and quality of the information
 provided by the Offiicers who were on duty.

 As the statements concerned arc not required for the purposes of any
 crim.ina.1 in v e s t ig a t i o n , there is no reason for them to be prepared
 on CJA forms and indeed many can, in our view, b e 'self-taken, in the
 cerise of simply forjening a record of the recollections of the Officer
 concerned on the points raised above.




                                                                   /. . . c o n t d .
H a m m o n d Su d d a r d s                                   WAUF. NO.




 We propose immediately to instruct Leading Counsel to advise on
 preparations Cor the public inquiry and we anticipate that it will
 be sensible to hav$ an early conference, probably during the first
 two weeks in May.

 Much will depend oit the timing of the inquiry, as to which we are
 making contact with the Treasury Solicitor.   By way of example, the
 Cleveland inquiry ^ as announced by the Minister on 9th July, 1987, a
 preliminary hearing to open the inquiry was held on 4th August and
 the full hearing commenced seven days later on 11th August.    We
 would not anticipate that sort of time scale in this case, because
 we think that it will be generally accepted that the extent of the
 evidencci-to be collected prior to the opening of the inquiry is far ■
    ^ater than in the Cleveland case.  However, as we indicated at our
  Teeting yesterday, there will be strong political pressure, for an
 early start and we would expect the inquiry.to open for a full
 hearing within two or three months.   Obviously, we shall advise just
 as coon as we have any further information.

 We confirm, on behalf of our insurance clients, that if senior
 Officers with an active operational role at Hillsborough on
 15th April wish to [be separately represented at the. inquiry, then
 this will be funded by insurers.   The offer was made specifically in
 respect of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and Superintendent
 Marshal.1, but insurers would consider sympathetically requests from
 other Officers.

 We cannot emphasise too strongly that this offer has not been made
 because either insurers or ourselves think it desirable lor there to
 be separate representation.     In our view, the opposite is the case,
 in that, separate representation may create a needless impression of
 cy^unity and may seirve to isolate the Officers concerned from the
 jj^Pt-h Yorkshire Pollice as a whole;''' We would suggest that even the
 offer of separate r spresentation to these Officers could be
 misconstrued and th at .it may be better not to put this to the
 Officers concerned, unless they raise the point themselves.       Having
 said that, we shall    be more than   happy to discuss the situation with
 these Officers individually, if either or both o f them would
 appreciate such a discussion.

 We understand that you will be contacting us when you have had a
 chance to consider "he contents of this letter and we look forward
 to hearing from you in early course.


 Yours faithfully,

  llillsb o ro u u h ;                        Effect of the issue and service of Writs

  You have asked us - j o advise in relation to the effect of the issue
  and service of civij], process on your right to make any public
  statement in relation to the disaster which occurred at Hillsborough
  on 3 5th April. Reference has been made to the "sub judice" rule.

  Tt is a criminal oufence, usually charged as contempt of Court, to
  utter words or do       ets which obstruct or tend to obstruct or
  interfere with the administration of justicc.       Until the passage of
  the Contempt of Coiirt Act 1981, this was generally a crime of strict
  liabi .1,it y , there being no need to prove intent on the part of th-e
  perpetrator.

  lief ore the passage o f that Act, it was not uncommon for civil
 process to be issued,  » • for the sole purpose of being able to threaten
 wi t-h proceedings for contempt anyone who then issued any statement
^ b o u t the matter iii question and it may be that this is the purpose
     -'the speedy issue? of Writs by Messrs. t!. Rex Makin & Co.

  If that .io so, the   that firm have overlooked the passage of the
  Contempt of Court Act 1981, which restricts the scope of the strict
  liab.l3.ity rule in relation to civil proceedings to the time when
  arrangements have Ljeen made for a hearing.    Jn other words, although
  contempt of. Court   an still be charged against a person making a
  statement which bee .rs on matters the subject of a Writ, it is for
  the prosccutor to    how, not merely that the. statement could

 prejudice the fair Trial of the action, but also either that it was
 made with intent tc do so or that a hearing has been arranged.

 in our view, you are not, therefore, in any way inhibited from
 making statements about the events of 15th April, by the issue and
 service of these Writs.

 We would, however, jpoint out that the proposed Tribunal of inquiry
 will be a Court, fori the purposes of the Contempt of Court Act 1981,
 so that when arrangements for the hearing of the inquiry have been
 made, the strict 1 .Liability rule will again apply.

JJvcn at-that istage,j there is a statutory exemption relating to
^Publication made as or part of a discussion in good faith of public
 atfairs or other matters of general public interest, if the risk of
 .impediment or prejudice to particular legal proceedings is merely
 incidental to the discussion.    The meaning of. the word "discussion"
 is not defined by tjhe statute, but our feeling is that it could
 extend to a press conference properly called to deal with matters of
 public concern.

 Clearly, however, i I would be sensible to avoid any public
 statements, so far jas possible.

Dear Mr Scott

SHORTHAND WRITERS - PUBLIC INQUIRY - HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY

I refer to my telephone conversation with you earlier today and confirm that
Lord Justice Taylor's Secretary wishes to engage your firm to act as

   QUESTIONS BY POLICE AUTHORITY MEMBERS



   Clive Betts            I hope t h a t the Authority will place on record i t s
                          ap p reciatio n of the a c t i o n s of the o f f i c e r s who saved l i v e s
                          and a s s i s t e d the dead and dying. They must have suffered
                          tremendous trauma. Quoted h is c o n t a c t with a young Special

                          saw one of the young fans the next day. At h is r e q u e s t , the
                          young Special Constable had brought a s c a r f to the

                          He understood what the Chief Constable had s a i d , but f e l t
                          t h a t c e r t a i n q uestio ns had to be asked. F i r s t l y , had the

                          comments expressed by o f f i c e r s . Sometimes t h i s r e s u l t e d in
                          minor a l t e r a t i o n s but t h e r e were not any s i g n i f i c a n t
                          alterations.

   Clive Betts            Having regard to the Safety of Sports Grounds Act, were the
                          Local Authority given copies of the Force Manual?

   Chief Constable        The Force Orders were r e l a t e d to the a c t i o n s of police
                          o f f i c e r s , and simply r e f e r r e d to Police deployment and
                          reso u rce s. A copy had not been provided to the Local
                          Authority as no such r e q u e st had been made or a need to do
                          so been seen.

   Clive Betts            In fu tu re?

   Chief Constable        I will co n sid er.

   Clive Betts            What about a copy f o r l a s t S a tu r d a y 's game?

   Chief Constable        I w ill have to ask Lord J u s t i c e Taylor about t h a t .            I see i t
                          as evidence.

   Clive Be tt s          Does the document cover the control of crowds?

   Chief Constable        The Manual c o n s i s t s of many documents.           The main one i s the
                          operational o r d e r.

   Clive Be tt s          Was the number of p o l i c e o f f i c e r s o u tsid e of the ground the
                          same as in side?

   Chief Constable        We a s s i s t the Stewards i n s i d e of the ground, but I think
                          t h a t we are going i n t o the Inquiry i s s u e s now.
Clive Betts              Can we have a breakdown of the numbers of p o lic e on duty,
                         both in s id e and o u tsid e of the ground?

Chief Constable          We have a breakdown of a l l o f f i c e r s on duty.
                         A very complete breakdown.

Clive Betts              Can Members have a copy?

Chief Constable          I can ask Lord J u s t i c e Taylor i f I can supply t h i s
                         information to Members.

Clive Betts              Can you t e l l us t h i s morning about the number of o f f i c e r s on
                         duty o utsid e Leppings Lane?

Chief Constable          The same as fo r previous Semi-Finals.

Clive Betts              What i s the experience of the O f fic e r in Charge of the
                         game?

Chief Constable          He was previously O f f i c e r in Charge of games a t the
                         S h e f f i e l d United ground. He has been on h is c u r re n t
                         Division f o r t h r e e weeks. Every o t h e r command o f f i c e r had
                         been a t the previous Semi-Final match or even e a r l i e r ones.

Clive Betts              Does the Manual cover ground se gregation and se ction
                         capacities?

Chief Constable          Those p o in ts ar e c e n t r a l to the Inquiry.

Clive Betts              Were t h e r e a r r e s t s , both i n s i d e and out of the ground?

Chief Constable          Yes.     I d o n ' t have the d e t a i l e d f i g u r e s , but I will supply
                         these    to Members. There were a la rg e number.

Barbara B u lliv a n t   Did the 1,111 O f f i c e r s on duty include Special Constables?

Chief Constable          All the o f f i c e r s were r e g u l a r s - the Specials were e x t r a .

Ron G i l l i e s        Were t h e r e deaths o u tsid e the ground?

Chief Constable          The p o s itio n of the bodies i s s t i l l being reviewed, but none
                         to my knowledge.

Doug Axe                 Whilst t h e r e were no s i g n i f i c a n t changes, were the teams
                         a l l o c a t e d the same ends l a s t year?

Chief Constable          Yes.

Danny George             I'm sure t h a t a l l here have every confidence in the Chief
                         Constable and the South Yorkshire P o l i c e . The S h e f f i e l d
                         Conservative Group asked me to say t h a t .
Jean Cromar       Having regard to the trauma experienced by the o f f i c e r s ,
                  what arrangements have been made fo r co unselling?

Chief Constable   I 'v e spoken to my o f f i c e r s , both i n d i v i d u a l l y and
                  c o l l e c t i v e l y and the f a c t t h a t they c o u l d n 't save some
                  people weighs heavily with them. We've made arrangements
                  f o r c o u n s e llin g . As previously mentioned, we received
                  tremendous a s s i s t a n c e from the s t a t u t o r y and voluntary
                  agencies. I t i s d i f f i c u l t for me to express the real sorrow
                  of the Force. My o f f i c e r s d e s i r e to g e t t h a t message over.
                  We feel p a r t of the bereaved f a m i l i e s .

Clive Betts       Was t h e r e a c l e a r procedure fo r requesting a delayed kick-
                  off?

Chief Constable   We can ask f o r , but not defined procedure.

Jack Wood         There have been a l l e g a t i o n s of large numbers t r a v e l l i n g to
                  the ground without t i c k e t s .

Chief Constable   Such information would have been a v a i l a b l e to us.

S i r Jack        I am obliged f o r the f a i r way the questio ns have been asked
                  and answered, I suggest t h a t we ask the Finance and General
                  Purposes Committee which immediately follows t h i s meeting
                  t h a t we a s s o c i a t e the Police Authority with the Appeal which
                  has been launched ( a t the AMA y e s t e r d a y ) . Rotherham M.B.C.
                  are to give £10,000. I hope t h a t the Police Authority will
                  a ls o support a donation of £10,000.

         Dear Sir,

         Safety of Sports Grounds - Certificate Conditions

         Thank you for your letter of 5th April, in reply to mine of 30th March; I also
         refer to Chief Superintendant Dentons' subsequent telephone conversation with my
         Chief Licensing Officer, Hr. Bownes.

         I gather that you would find it helpful for a condition to be included in the
         Certificate which provided for the attendance of police officers at football
         matches.  I have no objection to such a condition being inserted and I would
         like to submit the following draft for your consideration:-

                "Before the stadium is used on any occasion for a specified activity, the
                Holder shall make arrangements with the Chief Constable of the South
                Yorkshire Police for the attendance of a sufficient number of police officers
                for the purpose of maintaining lawful and orderly behaviour amongst
                spectators.  The extent of the provision of police services is reserved for
                the determination of the Chief Constable".

         I would appreciate your comments on the Certificate conditions and the remainder
         of the Certificate Conditions which were enclosed with my letter of 30th March.

         I wish to proceed with the issue of the Sheffield United Certificates within the
         fairly near future, and I would therefore like to hear your comments, if
         possible, by 15th Hay.

         Yours faithfully,




            w \

                                  Dear Mr Wright, for your information only




    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR’S INQUIRY IHTO THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

    I have now been asked by Counsel appointed by Lord Justice Taylor to request
    from a selected number of police officers their recollections, in writing,
    of what happened at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989* The reason for my
    request is that I understand that a number of your officers performed duty
    on a mutual aid basis. Counsel are keen to obtain a cross sjpction of
    accounts as soon as possible.

    I would like to make     arrangements as soon as convenient, through a Liaison
    Officer whom you may     care to appoint, to receive these written submissions
    as soon as possible.      There will be no need for my officers to see yours
    personally, although     a proof of continuity will be necessary, but I would
    hope that this could     easily be achieved through your Liaison Officer.

    The invitation to submit written recollections is based on criteria that I
    have already, adopted with South Yorkshire Police officers. That is,
    there will be no interviews just simple requests to which the officer will
   -be free to decide what he or she wishes to say. When supplying any written
    submission the officer will be free to keep a copy. I have also been asked
    by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, if a copy of
   any submission can be made available? I have no objections nor have Counsel
   appointed by Lord.Justice Taylor.

    In this respect copies of any written submissions can be forwarded direct
    by you to Mr Wright at his Sheffield Police Headquarters.

    It would be helpful if I could arrange for one of my senior officers to
    contact your Liaison Officer in the next few days.

    Attached to this letter is the list of officers who I understand were
    seconded from your Force.

                                                                  REF:              MS/DD/JW
FROM:    Chief Superintendent, Management Services
                                                                  STATION/DEPT:     HQ Man Services
TO:      Chief Superintendent, ‘D’ Division
                                                                  DATE:             11 May 1989




        SUBJECT:        PUBLIC INQUIRY - POLICING REQUIREMENT


        You will be aware that the Public Inquiry in relation to the Hillsborough Disaster will
        commence to hear evidence on Monday 15 May 1989 at 10.30 am. On subsequent
        days it is anticipated that the hearings will start at 10.00 am. Lord Justice Taylor will
        sit in the Council Chamber where there is provision for the attendance of counsel for
        the interested parties, the press and members of the public. Certain other rooms
        within the Town Hall are set aside for use by the parties involved, ie Lord Justice
        Taylor and his counsel, the Inquiry Secretary and his Home Office team, Treasury
        Solicitors who are briefing official counsel for the Inquiry, and the counsel
        representing the interested parties. On commencement of the Inquiry, in view of the
        uncertainty of the extent of public attendance, certain reception rooms in the Town
        Hall will be equipped with close circuit television relaying the proceedings in the
        Chamber for the benefit of members of the public who are unable to be
        accommodated in the Council Chamber.

        Lord Justice Taylor has requested that two constables be present at all times in the
        Council Chamber whilst the Inquiry is in progress and I am grateful for the
        arrangements you have already made in providing a sergeant and six constables to
        police both the inside and outside of the Town Hall. I would like to meet Sergeant
        Stevens at the Town Hall at 9.00 am on Monday 15 May where I can introduce him
        to the following people with whom he should liaise daily and who will be able to fully
        explain the needs of the Judge and the accommodation arrangements within the
        Town Hall.

             1.    Mr Pat O’Neill - Assistant Chief Personnel Officer for the City
                   Council who is appointed as the Liaison Officer in respect of the
                   Inquiry.

             2.    Jonathan Sweet (Home Office Official acting as Assistant Secretary
                   to the Tribunal).

        The Secretary to the Tribunal is Mr Bob Whalley, the head of F6 Division at the
        Home Office, and through Jonathan Sweet, Sergeant Stevens will be able to find out
        the daily requirements of Lord Justice Taylor in respect of sitting times etc.
        Mr Sweet will also provide for Sergeant Stevens a list of all the main counsel and
        where they can be found within the Town Hall.

        Lord Justice Taylor will be staying at the Judge’s lodgings and will be conveyed
        back and forth each day by official car in the same manner as High Court Judges
        sitting at Castle Street, but he will not require the usual motor cycle escort. It is
        anticipated that the Judge will take lunch at the Town Hall each day.




                                                                                     Continued/
The official support for the Judge at the Inquiry consists of the Home Office
Secretariat, appointed counsel who principally are Mr Andrew Collins QC,
Mr Bernard Philips and Mr Alan Goldsack (the latter two being local Barristers in
Chambers in Paradise Square) and the Treasury Solicitors. The party will total
almost twenty and they will all be staying at the Hallam Tower Hotel in close working
contact with senior officers from the West Midlands Inquiry Team.

There is little initial information that I can offer to Sergeant Stevens who will need to
‘ play it by ear" on a day to day basis in accordance with the Judge’s requirements
as relayed through the Home Office Team. The Inquiry is likely to last somewhere
between a minimum of six weeks and a maximum of six months.

 Dear Don,

Hi 1 Isborough

Hero arc further comments on statements requested by West M idland:


 13.                Control Room C o m m u n i c a t i o n s ■Officers

In your absence, 1* spoke to Superintendent Bennett yesterda y to make
the point that the three Officers and Mr. Sanderson have si ightly
d.iJ.Cerent perspectives as to exactly what happened in relat ion to
the communications problems.

 Factually, the statements all-agree that, after Mr. Sanders
 visit, there was working radio communication, MjPtyMXl            y H K F -'l
                                                                             C*2.16
HfMMMHi?-' v'll 'the hatid-hcid taflio. „ The tenor of Mr, S a n d e r s o n ' *
^statement is that this was p&iffec’tTy satisfactory and Aid not give
 rise-to a n y problems.     ‘H o w e ve r , as I understand i.t, the fac t t h a t
 the radio could only be operated on talk-through meant that; any                           ,,
 control room transmission would automatically be cut-off by an                             v
 incoming transmission from any of the Officers with a hand- held                            '
 radio.    As "there we're lS.ki.ly to be a number of such transini            s s i o n s ,
 the result, would be a problem in yetting out any .instructions from
 the ground control box.

1 have suggested that the three Officers and Mr. Sanderson be seen
again to go through their recollections of this crucial per iod, with
particular reference to exactly why there had to be a use      f. {a )
hand-held radio; (b) on ta 1*11-through and" also whether there w a s ,
thereafter,                 Wit:h the transmissions as 'such.



                                                                                                                                   / .. contd

       T have the .following specific c o m m e n t s ;


       J3.1      P.C. Bichard

        1 assume that the. abbreviation ''PR1' moans Personal Radio ar d, if so,
        this should be explained.   Likewise, although the abbreviat ion "XS"
        may bo. widely understood within the South Yorkshire Police to refer
        to the Force operation control room, this may not apply to persons
       .at the inquiry.   I appreciate that the abbreviation is defi ned in
         |he statement but, even so, it may be thought of as confusi n g . Page
        7 appears to have a line missing near the top.     Thera is al g o a
        reference to the "purpose" of fans climbing into the west tc:rracc,
       which T think should be omitted.     Again, the use of the wor      'angry"
        on page 8 could be replaced w.ith something more n e u t r a l .

       13.2     P .S , Goddard

         I am not: particularly happy about the e ©movent on page 4 , al;out the
         packing of the terraces,        1 should like to omit this, unles s it has
         already been accepted in the statements of both Mr. Murray and Mr.
        C r e a s e r , copies of which 1 do not have to hand.    On page 5, 1 would
         like the final paragraph to be reviewed, not only in relati on to the
        general points made above, but in the reference to the radi a being
        useless and to pop music being received for "a lony period' 3 a sj
        year.                                             laterally,. fighti TCj V'could
                              8,^1 think that the words 11.
         be misunderstood,        l think that               note 4 p p enBe3 t o t h i s
        statement should be detached, and. should, bo produced by Insj: ector
      ^lalvert, as to which see later.          Finally, I think that the comment
      ^ P b q u t manning the] tunnel on page._.ll should be expanded, by stating
        in terms that the purpose, of manning the tunnel was to ensU re
        segregation of home and away supporters and had nothing to do with
        safety considerations

       13.3     P.C. Rvan

       O.K.,   subject to genera], comments above.

       13.4     Mr.   Sanderson

       O.K.,   subject to general comments above.


       14       Inspector Darling


       15.      Serial No;        3

       15.1     P.S. Gardner

       The use of the word "fright" on page 2 suggests a concern i or his
       own safety, whereas my understanding is that the concern Wcs for the
       safety of others and, if that is also P. 5. Gardner's understanding,
                                            -i'l ;            8274 737;                  0742523409;;    4

    then the statement should be altered to make the meaning clear,
    perhaps the words: "serious concern",

    15.2    P.C.

    However much one mny agree with the further observation on page 5,
    :i think that it should be removed from the statement for su bmisaion
    to the inquiry.

    i think that the use of the word "panic" on page .1                     should he
    reviewed and also the reference to animals on page                      4 (two o c c a s i o n s )
    The observations on page 10 are helpful to Counsel,                      but 1 think
    should yo from the. statement for submission to the                     inquiry


    17.     Serial No. 5

    17.1    P .S . iiodgett

      should like him to review the comments on page 7 about pa nic and

          T think that this should be worked into one complete Staten ent, in
          chronological order, i.e. dealing first with history and be ckground
          and working up to the match itself.   The document referred to in
          Sergeant Goddard's .statement should be identified and exh.it i L e d .

     ^^fe have already discussed this statement,                      which I found at the

           Whore, on page 5 , he states that, he was "alone", 1 feel that this

           Perusal of other statement s.; i:rom this serial suggest that, during

       Dear Don,

       Hillsborough

       Here are further comments on statements requested by West Midlands


       20.           Senior Officers

       20.1          C .I . Purdy

       2 0. 2        C.I. EdmundSon

       There is a referenc e to XS, which I think means Force Control and
       should be explained as such.

      ^0.3           C.I. MeRobbji

       Paqe 4, line one, T think that "near" is a misprint for "new".    A
       number oil pages lis ting various Officers follow on from page 17 and
       T wonder if these a re in any way relevant.   If not, this should end
       at page 17.

       20.4          C;l; Bettiscn

       I have some doubts about the final sentence of the postscript,                                                                  as 1
       U'link this does amount to comment.

       20.5       C.I. Price

       20.6       C.T. Waring

       Ilis perceptions of .he crowd position at page 5                       do seem at odds with
       moot other Officert but, obviously, this should                        not be altered if it
       is his clear recollection,   I wonder what other                       Officers he saw on
       his walk down Loppings Lane and perhaps details                        could be included.

        0.7       C ,1. Sumner

       I would suggest subs titution of the words "extreme urgency" for
       "panic" on page 4.   As a personal matter, he may wish to consider
       whether he wishes t include the comment made to Mr. Lock on page 6.
       Other Officers have commented unfavourably on fans who asked whether
       the game was going :o re-start.

       20.8       C.I; Creaser

       I believe that T have already been through a statement with Mr.
       C r o a s e r , but 1 do not know whether this is the original or an
       amended v e r s i o n . A -: all events, I fee], that the comment about the
       packing of pens on jjage 4 should either be expanded to include
       detail of when (in liis experience) this had been done, or the entire
       section dealing wit          this should be deleted.   On page 7, there is a
       reference to a request to delay the kick-off.           It is indicated that
       this request was no i acted upon         but can he say, with certainty,
       that it was received.          If this is not within his own knowledge, then
           think this commen : should be deleted.        Comments on page 8/9 re: Mr,
      ^Rreenwood could eit ler be expanded to .indicate the nature of the
       difficulties or omi-ited after the factual, comment that P.c. Goodwill
       was deployed as Comijnunications Officer to Mr. Greenwood.

       20,9       C.I. Beal

       This has been used is the basis for much of the background, material
       on planning for the match.   I do not think that this should be
       duplicated in the s :atement and, accordingly, would suggest the
       statement should ac dually start at page 21, beginning with the words
       "On 2 9th March ...

       20.10      C.I.   Beal   (2

       2 0 '1;L   P ‘T ‘ Athorn
       .T think that the co:mment on page 5 to the effect that messages on
       the air did not ind icate the nature of the incident should either be
       expanded on or dele ed.

       20.12      P. I, Bennet-t-

       Hc may wish to reco nsider the use of the word "louts" at page 3.

      Whilut they probab] y were louts, some of them may claim to have been
      trying to escape se rious injury - a claim which will be difficult to
      disprove.

        SUBJECT:            DONCASTER ETHNIC MINORITIES PANEL


        I have discussed the attached report with Assistant Chief Constable (Staff Services)
        Mr Anderson. The policy which the Chief Constable wishes to adopt is one which,
        during the course of the Hillsborough Public Inquiry, avoids high profile sponsorship
        events by police officers in aid of the Disaster Appeal.

        If the Ethnic Minorities Panel wish to do something in their own name with no overt
        police involvement (although we would of course have no association with the event)
        there is no objection.

        The Sports Club Concert referred to was offered to the Club by the Country and
        Western Bands involved on Sunday 16 April before the Chief Constable declared a
        policy on the matter.

    Dear Sir,


         I write in my capacity as Secretary of           the A.C.P.O.       Sub­
    committee on Hooliganism at sporting events.

         To assist in the formulation of the A.C.P.O.'s written evidence
    to be submitted to     Lord Justice Taylor it would be of great
    assistance if all Chief Constables whose Force areas include football
    grounds could provide the following information.

         Details of problems    that have occurred during the past             two
    seasons involving:

    (a)   late arrival of spectators and/or drunkenness;

    (b)   spectators without tickets arriving at all ticket matches;

    (c)   spectators subject of attendance restrictions        arriving;      (e.g
          Leeds United, Wolverhamptoa and Cardiff City)

    (d)   other serious problems at turnstiles.


         Your early attention to this matter would be appreciated as the
    requirement for submission of this evidence is immiment.


                               Yours faithfully.

    Dear Sir

    SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS -
    DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

    I write with reference to your letter of 4 May last.

    I am pleased to note that you are now agreeable to the inclusion in the certificate of a
    condition requiring the provision of special police services on the occasion of a specified
    activity. With regard to the wording of the condition, may I suggest the following for your
    consideration:-

          “The holder shall make arrangements with the Chief Constable of the South
          Yorkshire Police for the provision of special police services on the occasion
          of a specified event at the stadium for the purposes of maintaining lawful and
          orderly behaviour amongst spectators, and the extent of the provision of those
          services shall be determined by the Chief Constable and he and his officers
          shall be allowed full access to all parts of the stadium”.

^ ^ A s to the other matters contained in the final draft of the new certificate, I would refer you
    to my letter dated 4 August 1987. In that letter I raised eleven points with regard to your
     original proposals and I am pleased to note that you have incorporated points one, two,
    ten and eleven in ^ e draft. With regard to the other points I still consider that the
     requirement for twt / eight days notice of a specified activity (point three); the power to
     require activities to be “all ticket” etc (point four) and the restriction on the parking of
    vehicles (point five) should be made conditions of the certificate and I ask that you give
    further consideration to this.

   On a minor point I would draw your attention to the omission of the word “not” in the
   second paragraph on schedule three of the draft.

   On the matter generally, you may feel it prudent to delay the issue of the certificates until
   after the recommendations of the current public inquiry are made known. You may feel
   that a meeting to discuss these matters would be beneficial and I shall be happy to make
   my officers available should you so wish.

   Yours faithfully

Dear Sir

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS -
DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

I refer to your letters dated 30 March 1989 and 4 May 1989 regarding your proposals
for the redrafting of the conditions to apply to the Sports Ground Safety Certificates.

You request comment on your proposals and in doing so I refer specifically to my
letter dated 4 August 1987 which was the last occasion when I commented upon your
original proposals. In that letter I raised eleven points and I note that you have
incorporated points 1, 2, 10 and 11. I still feel that my points relating to a requirement
for 28 days notice of any specified activity (point 3), the requirement for a match to be
 “all ticket”, changed to a different time or day or to another venue (point 4) and the
restriction on vehicle parking (point 5) should be incorporated in the certificate
conditions and not relegated to the Guidance Notes as I am unsure whether any non­
conformity with the notes would be regarded as a breach of certificate conditions
sufficient to permit the Council to take immediate action. I would appreciate your
confirmation of this point as it has particular relevance to the right of entry for police
officers to all parts of the ground.

On a minor point, the draft Schedules 3, detailing spectator capacities, should read
“the number of spectators admitted to each area of the stadium, listed below, shall
NOT exceed the maximum numbers shown”.

I thank you for agreeing in your letter of 4 May 1989, to the inclusion of a condition
regarding determination of the extent of police services provided. However, I would
like to suggest a rewording of your proposal along the following lines:-

       “The holder shall make arrangements with the Chief Constable of South
      Yorkshire Police for the provision of special police services on the
      occasion of a specified event ofef the stadium for the purposes of
      maintaining lawful and orderly behaviour amongst\special)and the extent of
      the provision of those services shall be determined by the Chief
      Constable”.          Vt—         — V v * Am v w \      W (^                       O

You rrnay feel that, rather than conduct tms discussion in correspondence, a meeting
would be beneficial to all concerned in reaching timely agreement on this important
issue.

Yours faithfully

Dear Peter

Please find enclosed a copy of the Police Authority Report which I promised.

You will no doubt have seen the television and read the papers about what actually
happened at the meeting, but nevertheless the paper was accepted without a great
deal of difficulty.

Kind regards

                      SUBJECT:   HILLSBOROUGH - PRESS STATEMENT




                      CONFIDENTIAL
                                                    Q_.                                — U. - *2*^ ,


                      Following the tragedy at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989, representatives of
                      the deceased and persons injured have understandably been actively pursuing
                      claims for compensation against Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Sheffield
                      City Council, Eastwood & Partners and ourselves.

                      After protracted consultations with our lawyers they have now advised that
                      the best way forward, without making any admission of liability, is to offer
                      an out-of-court settlement and this will be done at 2.30 pm today
                      (30.11.89).

                      The advantages of this course of action are that it avoids the necessity of
                      anyone - spectators or police officers - experiencing the trauma of re­
                      living the event through involvement a| . j l trial. Furthermore, a number of
                      people in genuine need of compensation will receive it much earlier than
                      would otherwise be the case.

                      The civil case was likely to.take place in advance of any criminal
                      proceedings against anyone arising out of the events at Hillsborough.  Had
                      this occurred a number of police witnesses, acting on legal advice, would in
                      all probability have declined to give evidence on the grounds of possible
                      self-incrimination.  The South Yorkshire Police would therefore have
                      unnecessarily appeared evasive and the civil hearing been unduly prejudiced
                      because of the lack of information forthcoming from those witnesses.
                      Furthermore, any findings of liability may have been prejudicial to officers
                      concerned in the criminal enquiry.

                      I have agreed therefore to accept the legal advice given to me and to settle
                      out-of-court.  Details of the press statement I have issued relative to this
                      are attached hereto.

                      It is essential that all members of the Force, particularly those directly
                      involved at Hillsborough, understand what is occurring and why and I would
                      appreciate it if you could cause this information to be disseminated
                      throughout your Division without delay. The official representatives of
                      both the Federation and the Superintendents' Association have been informed
                      of the above.

PRESS STATEMENT OF THE CHIEF CONSTABLE




              EMBARGOED UNTIL 2.30 PM, THURSDAY 30 NOVEMBER 1989



It has been decided by the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire and the South
Yorkshire Police Authority, in conjunction with their insurers, Municipal
Mutual Insurance, that those bereaved and injured in the tragic events at
Hillsborough stadium on 15 April should not have to await the outcome of a
further lengthy hearing in 1990 before receiving      compensation.

In the circumstances, the Chief Constable, in conjunction with his insurers,
intends to open negotiations with the aim of resolving all boni fide claims
against him for compensation arising out of the Hillsborough disaster.

The other parties presently named as Defendants ,in the civil proceedings
arising out of the Hillsborough tragedy, namely, Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club, Eastwood & Partners, and Sheffield City Council, have been offered the
opportunity of joining in the course of action now taken on behalf of the
South Yorkshire Police, but have refused to do so. It is fche intention of the
Chief Constable and his insurers to pursue legal action against those parties
to recover moneys paid out to the claimants pursuant to today's offer.

Dear Mr Jones

When Chief Superintendent Foster recently served an additional Reg.7 Notice on
Superintendent Roger Marshall, Mr Marshall mentioned to him the number of
supportive letters received by himself and his wife and asked that the authors
of the letters be seen and given the opportunity to provide evidence in support
of Mr Marshall's actions as the letters indicate.

I enclose a copy of a report submitted by Mr Marshall together with copies of
the most appropriate letters and ask that the necessary enquiries be undertaken
to obtain the evidence which might redress to some degree the allegations made
regarding Mr Marshall's actions or omissions on 15 April 1989.

I trust that you have fully recovered from your recent illness and can I take
this opportunity to offer you all best wishes for the coming year.

Yours sincerely




Chief Superintendent

        I forward herewith photocopies of personal letters my wife and I
        received following the disaster at Hillsborough on the 15 April 1989. I
        acknowledged each letter briefly in the aftermath of the disaster and my
        wife has since written to Mr Mulligan.

        In your capacity as Liaison Officer with the West Midlands Police, I
        should be grateful if you would forward these letters to the senior
        Investigating Officer.

        You will know that I have been served with Regulation 7 Notices from
        three complainants to date.     It would be appreciated if the letter
        writers could be seen by the investigation team.    It may be that they
        have already been seen but, if they have not, then it is possible that
        they have evidence to offer ’
                                    which might provide sane balance to counter
        the allegations which have been made in the Notices I have received.

        It is regretted that the identity of the writer of the letter marked 'A'
        is not Jcnown. However, the letter was handed in personally at West Bar
        Police /station and, as he describes himself as a_______________ it is
        possible t&at his identity may''■already be known from the enquiries which
        hgve peen made by the West Midlands Police at Merseyside.

Dear Superintendent Marshall,

My name is                    I am from Liverpool. What I want to say isthat I
thank you for saving somelives at Hillsborough. I believe if you had not
opened that gate I do not   believe there would have been 95 people dead, but I
think there would have been 295 or 395 people dead.

I have a nephew in hospital in Intensive Care. His name is____________
By opening those gates, what the media do not realise, is that you made an
escape route. What has got to come out of this is that we have got to stop
this madness now together. How we do it is we call for an amnesty of all arms
in the world as a tribute to Liverpool Football Club. No human being in the
world should be asked to pay the price as they are asking you to pay. The
price is far too high. By making you redundant or demoted will not bring back
the dead or get the injured better. The lesson that has to be learned is that
we do not believe that the Sheffield Police said or wrote those lies in those
shithouse papers as that is all they are fit for.

The only thing that cannot be replaced by time, money or effort, is human
beings. Obviously, you are in crisis yourself as I have been. I have got a
lot of help off people I did not even know. I am trying to help you to cope
with this problem. I want you to put me on your Christmas card list. We have
got to take the opportunity now to stop the violence. One way we do it is when
we report it we say people were fighting at Anfield but the men were shaking
hands with each other, drinking with each other and joking with each other.
As we are both aware, youths think it is manly to fight at football matches.
I like to think that gesture I am making to you will prove what being a man is
all about.

The only 'weapons' I have come up with from Liverpool are some photographs of
myself, family and friends.   Photo No. 1 in the picture is my friend who sadly
died 3 years ago, his son, his daughter in law and his wife. Picture Number 2
- that is me taken in 1975 when I was a hippy and I am still one today. Photo
No. 3 is my father, who sadly has had a stroke and my mother who has to cope
with him.

Going back to the media, one of the lies was that an unnamed policeman said the
hurtful things that the gutter press reported. Myansweris that there is no
such thing as an unnamed policeman. They all have names; Tom, Dick or whatever.
There is only one man I know with no name and he is called Clint Eastwood.

In Liverpool I want the people from Sheffield to know that the people from
Liverpool do not believe it. I would like you to look at your feelings like a
puncture. On Saturday, whatever date it was, as you can see I am in crisis
myself and cannot remember. You are the puncture. Whatever date it is now I
want you to know that you look on me as a puncturerepair kit. This is only a
start of a friendship starting now as from 10 minutes ago.

Yours, as a mate,


P.S.   The disaster was only an accident. With hindsight, I would know a horse
       was going to win a race at 3.00 p.m. at Aintree. So there is no way you
       knew what would happen. Because your name is not Doris the medium.
Dear Roger & Pat,

Just r c d f v o n yo u r letter today.  I would like to express rnv
qratitude in receivinq this, as this h e l D S me greatly «*t this
time of crisis, that we have both been throuqh.         I am hooinci
to qo to Wembley tomorrow.         Althouqh the result is immaterial
T still want Liverpool to win as T am a Liverpool Tan!

With your card, T assume y o u ommitted your Dhone number for
personal reasons , but y o u have my phone number which you mnv
feel free to use at anv reasonable time.     If you feel that vou
need to rinq me, but are unable to contact me please write aqain
lettinq me know when y o u will call.


Yours sincerely,
I.....

                     has r«ade any ioprcvement in her/his knowledge of the job (as
                     re-crtec urder Section 3 above).
Philosophy on Policing

                   think it means).
By, for example;
i)       getting the applicant to talk about events involving the police:
         what should they do/not do.

                     with the police? What was it like?” not helpful: The first
                     question tends to end in agreement with the public view, the
                     second is getting the applicant to assess you, in effect.

2.   Environment
     Ho assessment of the house or description of type of house is
     required: these are subjective areas. However, if the applicant's
     environment is in such a state as to indicate an extremely low
     level of physical care and emotional state, a description should
     be given, and the applicants own comments on this should be sought
     and reported - eg.
     . applicant drunk (if the interview was by appointment)
     . days of washing-up still lying in sink

     i)     asking them what they know about police work/what they belive
             the job is about.
     ii)    finding out what in particular attracts them to the post:
             does the job really have this aspect to it? i.e. clarify
     iii)    getting to know about other jobs applied for and talking through
             similarities and differences: does the applicant know what
             s/he wants?

        The r e s t r i c t e d choice of the Memorial Hall fo r the f i r s t two days venue
        brings some p a r k i n g / t r a f f i c problems which the West Midlands P oli ce , on

              SUBJECT:   SUPPLYING OF INFORMATION TO THE WEST MIDLANDS ENQUIRY TEAM
                         REGARDING THE HILLSBROUGH DISASTER____________________

                Sir,
                    With regards to the above mentioned subject I have to report as
                follows.

                As per instructions, I originally submitted a rough statement on plain
                paper to Force Headquarters. After this was checked and fully typed it
                was signed by myself and submitted to the West Midlands Enquiry team.
                A further copy was also submitted as requested by the enquiry team
                sometime later, this being merely a copy of the original.

                At the same time, a separate statement regarding my involement with one
                of the deceased(ie Formal identification by relative)was submitted to
                the enquiry team for purposes of the Coroners inquest. This statement
                was again typed and signed by myself. 'This particular statement was
                collected from me personally by a member of the enquiry team. The original
                was apparently lost by them and therefore submitted a further tv/o times
                as per their persistant requests.

                In June last year I attended the Junior CID Course at Wakefield. During this
                period and afterwards I was persistantly pestered to supply further
                information regarding the disaster which I was unable to do. As a result
                of this I_jyas_ advised- by. a senior officer. narngly_ChieJf Inspector Sumner.,
                to negate from speaking with the team as he informed them that everything
                I had been instructed to do I had complied with,

                I originally submitted a full and comprehensive statement as to my own
                personal recollection and involement on the day and can neither add nor
                alter what I have already said previously.

                I therefore respectfully submit this report for your information.

Detective Constable 146
Ecclesfield Police Station


At 9.00am on Saturday 15 April 1989 I commenced duty at Ecclesfield Police Station
and was at this time in casual civilian attire* Following my commencement of duty
I was transported to Hillsbrough together with other officers where we were firstly
briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield and then by our Sector Commander,
Detective Inspector Scaife.


Following the briefing I commenced fotpatrol in Middlewood Hoad in company with
PC 2302 Powell* Our designated duty was to patrol along that road, from the
Middlewood Tavern towards Hillsbrough Centre inorder to spot potential trouble
spots and/or street crime (Thefts from vehicles,pickpockets etc) I did note that
during this period whilst in Middlewood Road(Ougtibridge side) that numerous
Liverpool supporters were drinking alcoholic beverages which they had brought with
them or purchased near to the ground from Off Licences, A number of these supporters
had obviously travelled by private vehicles and by this time some of there numbers
were heavily intoxicated with drink. I would estimate that this would have been
approximatly 11as)/l1 .30asu


I recall later on, approximatly 12 noon, walking into the centre of Hillsbrough
shopping precinct and again Liverpool supporters appeared to be purchasing
liquor (Beer/Cider & lager) in large quantities from Off Licences. These were in
the form of cans and bottles.


Approximatly 1.00pm I attended at Parkside Section Station together with PC Powell
inorder for a short break. Whilst inside the Section Station I heard noises on the
roof. On going outside to investigate I saw four/five Liverpool supporters on the
roof of the builing, all of whom were urinating onto the floor below. Together with
other officers, we managed to move them an but even during this time other supporters
were walking round the building inorder to relieve themselves. All these youths
mentioned were heavily intoxicated and showed the usual signs of drunkenness. I
recall watching one youth who was about 19/20 years of age standing near to the sectioz
station. I saw him drink approximatly £ of a bottle of vodka in the space of a matter
of minutes* After finishing the bottle he simply walked away to the ground or rather
in the general direction.of it.


Approximatly 2.45pm following fotpatrol in Middlewood Road I attended at the Gym
                                frlT
for refreshments. We remained^for a few minutes due to the large number of people
milling around before returning to Middlewood Hoad via Leppings lane. It was obvious
to myself at this time, having worked numerous football matches at Hillsbrough,mostly
                               2*


in unifrom, that the large influx of people outside the entrance ways to the
Leppings Lane Enclosure was unusual for that time of day* There is usually
a heavy influx of supporters going into the ground at this time but on this
particular day this was well above normal* I also recall supporters standing
on walls above the turnstiles* From Leppings Lane we made our way into
Hillsbrough Park with the intention of making this a short cut up to Middlewood
Road*


Whilst in the park, and I can only hazard a guess at 3*10ptq/3*15pm, I recall
hearing urgent messages over our personal! radio* It appeared to me at this
time that supporters were fighting within the Leppings Lane enclosure/turnstiles*
After what seemed only a matter of minutes I then heard that a temporary
mortuary was being set up in the gymnasium and we therefore immediately made
our way to the ground, going in through the Penistone Road Entrance* On getting
inside I saw as what I can only describe as numerous people being carried in
by other supporters on plackcards/billboards. Some of these were obviously
injured/dead* I rendered assistance to one man who was already dead and I saw
that other bodies/injured persons were being taken into the gym* After directing
someone into the gym with the body I went into the gym vi^ the xear 'entrance*
I there saw bodies scattered all across the floor, all obviously dead. Other
injuried parties were at the far side of the gym where First Aid was being
rendered by Police/Ambulance and supporters from both factions*
I then left the Gym and made my way down the ramp between the Spion Cop and
North Stand* On getting onto the pitch it appeared as though there had been
a pitch invasion although realising the enormity of the situation quickly
realised it was not* I recall seeing three bodies laid out and covered up
infornt of the Spion Cop* I then assisted a young probationer constable to
render heart massage to a man in his twenties who by his appearance was already
dead* I instructed him to remove the body to the gym which he did having been
assisted by supporters* There were numerous bodies strewn around infront of the
North Stand and both police officers and supporters were rendering assistance*
I saw at this time that bodies were still being transported across the pitch
by both police and supporters alike on makeshift streches* I made my way
across the pitch towards the Leppings Lane Enclosure and saw bodies being pulled
thorugh an open part of fencing, this fencing had obviously been cut open to
allow fans to escape* At this time rival supporters began chanting towards the
Liverpool supporters and a large number who had already spilled out onto the
pitch ran towards the Spion Cop* I was unable to render assitance due to the

                        #
large amount of people infront of the fencingf so I ran back across the pitch and
through a condon of police who were by this time across the centre line to stop
rival factions meeting from either end of the ground.
After passing through the condom I assisted with both relatives/friends and the
like enquiring after injured parties, directing them towards the gymnasium.
I myself returned to the gym a short time later afterassisting and then transporting
a body back with a uniform PC, By this time the Gym was clutered with bodies of
the deceased and also relatives enquiring after them.
After some esemblence of order was restored I was instructed to assist   Uniform
FC*s with the searching, identifiaction and documentation of bodies. I did this
with two bodies.
After this had been done with all or should I say nearly all, together with other
I was transported up to Hammerton Road Police Station inorder to obtain Missing
Person Reports from relatives/friends who had accumulated outside the station.
A number of reports were taken by myself although I would not like to hazard a
guess as to how many.
Later that night, I dov not know what time I was transported back to the Gym at
the ground. I there assisted with relatives and the like re: identification
(formal) and the completion of documentation.
At one period after the temporary Mortuary had closed down, I transported
relatives to the medico legal centre for the formal identification of a body.
I recall going into the rear of the mortuary where I saw numerous bodies,
approximatly 15/20 in number, which had had to be laid out on the floor due
to shortage of space. Following the idetification I returned to the gym, where
together with other officers went formally off duty at 5am, I there returned
to Ecclesfield, leaving at 6am on Sunday 16 April 1989*

                                                               Ref:

    From:   Police Constable GREENWAY                          Station/Dept:
    To:     The Detective Chief Superintendent H'^ CID         Date: 010590



            SUBJECT:   INQUEST - HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY 500490


            The Inquests continue, the subject of tickets and timings being mentioned and
            points clarified. The subject of alcohol is kept very low key but it is
            noticable that some of the youngsters have consumed alcohol, however only in


            In the case relating to Graham Roberts concern by the relatives was made into
            the fact that one of the officers apparantly dealing with the body mentioned
            leaving at in the prone position breathing, when he returned to it a short
            time later the body was dead. This could well have been a mistaken identity
            as one of the officers involved based his identification on the clothing alone.

            And finally Mr Frazer is rather incensed about an article in the Yorkshire
            Post yesterdays (Mondays) Mi t i o n relating to Liverpool fans,;:dj?ink and times
            leaving pubs to get to the ground. A copy of the article is attached for your
            attention.

            I submit this report for your information.

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry

I enclose, for your information, a letter dated 27 April 1990 which I have received from
the Administration and Legal Department of the Sheffield City Council. The letter
encloses correspondence, unfortunately without means of immediately identifying the
author, received by the Council from Belgium.

As you are continuing to deal with all aspects of the events at Hillsborough, I forward
the correspondence for your information and any action you may deem necessary.

Yours faithfully



Chief Superintendent

                  Dear Sir,

                  Safety of Sports Grounds
                  Hillsborough Stadium Disaster 15th April 1989

                  Please find attached a copy of a letter I received on 24th April 1990 concerning
                  the tragic events at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April last year.

                  It would seem that the person/s (apparently foreign police officers - possibly
                  Belgian) were witnesses to the disaster. Unfortunately from the information
                  contained in the letter I am unable to trace the writer.  In view of the
                  comments of Hr. Van Lende you may wish to make some further enquiries.

                  If it is possible to trace the writer I would be most grateful if you could
                  forward details of his address or police division so that I may write to him.

                  Yours faithfully,

          HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION

          You will no doubt be aware by now that Mr Leslie Sharp, QPM, Chief
          Constable of Cumbria, was appointed as the new Investigating Officer with
          effect from 1 April 1990. He is now in full command of the investigation
          and is responsible for deploying officers of the West Midlands Police
          investigation team. Consequently, any future communications on the
          Hillsborough investigation should be referred to him, care of Nechells
          Green Police Station, or anywhere else he may specify.

          The Inquests were concluded on Friday, 4 May 1990 and that day saw my
          departure from this investigation. With effect from Tuesday, 8 May 1990, I
          took up a temporary post at the Police Staff College at Bramshill as the
          Assistant Chief Constable to the Senior Command Course. The purpose of
          this letter, therefore, is to indicate my departure and at the same time
          express my gratitude to you and your staff for the very professional way in
          which our relations have been over the past twelve months. In expressing
          these sentiments I also reflect those of my colleagues with whom I have been
          privileged to work.

          With Mr Sharp at the helm I feel certain that there will be no loss of
          momentum nor loss of continuity, especially as Detective Chief
          Superintendent Mick Foster remains with the team. Of course, whilst I will
          be in Hampshire I will be available to give Mr Sharp any assistance he
          requires.

   ^ ( In saying thank you can I also express my appreciation of the efforts made
     / by Mr Stuart Anderson, Assistant Chief Constable, Chief Superintendent Don
     ( Denton and Police Constable Ken Greenaway.


                                                                                  Cont....



  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                Lloyd, Hpuse, Birmingham
Mr P Hayes
11 May 1990

I fully appreciate that the past year has been a most traumatic one for
South Yorkshire.  In closing, therefore, can I wish the Force well, with Mr
Wells at the helm and you as an able support.

             Dear Peter,

             H illsboroug h                                Pathology Evidence for Civil Trial

             I can recall that we have previously either discussed or
             corresponded on the question of whether Professor Usher would be
             prepared to act as fin expert witness in respect of medical and
             pathological issues at the civil trial.   1 understand that Professor
             Usher is willing to da this.

             I appreciate that: he was acting as Pathologist only in respect of a
             certain number oi tne deceased, out I would anticipate that the
             Court would be will m g to accept: -* report from hirn covering his own •
             direct r.mdings and information <rdirectly gleaned from his
             colleagues.  if there were difficulties on that score then we would
             have to call the colleagues as veil.

              If" Professor Usher is agreeable, 1 should like to be able to write
             to hiir> direct giving det ila of the aspects which need to be covered
             for the purpose of the e vil trial.

             Could you let me know, as soon as possible, if Professor Usher is
             willing to deal with this and, if so, whether I should write to him
             direct at the Medico-Legal Centre,      If he would like to discuss the
             extent of the work involved before coming to a decision, perhaps he
             could telephone me to arrange a s u i t a b l e ’time for a meeting.

My medical qualifications aRE MB, BS, FRC Path, DMJ (Clin et Path).   I have been

in active practice in Forensic Pathology for almost thirty years and have been

Consultant Pathologist to the Home Office for South Yorkshire and the East

Midlands for twenty-five of those years.   During that time I have performed more

than twenty-six thousand post mortem examinations for Her Majesty’s coroners and

have taken part in some seven hundred and sixty murder investigations.



I have been asked by officers of the West Midlands Police to provide a general

overview of the pathological aspects of the Hillsborough disaster in which some

ninety-five persons were killed on the afternoon of Saturday, 15 April, 1989,

during a cup semi-final match.



I took part in the investigation of the deaths myself, being present at the

request of Her Majesty’s coroner at Hillsborough Stadium on the evening of 15

April, 1989, and at the Medico-Legal Centre on Sunday, 16 April and Monday, 17

April.   I personally carried out nineteen post mortems.   The other examinations

were carried out by teams of pathologists working five or six at a time in the

excellent facilities of the mortuary of the Sheffield Medico-Legal Centre at

Watery Street - following the transfer of the bodies from the temporary mortuary

in the gymnasium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground.    Initially, I

believe, some thirteen bodies were taken to the mortuary of the Northern General

Hospital in Sheffield, but later they were removed from there and brought to the

Medidc-Legal Centre.   As far as 1 know, the only body autopsied at the Northern

General Hospital was that of a Lee NICHOL (body No 95), aged 14 years, who

survived, under treatment, until about 2 am on Tuesday, 18 April, and whose body

was examined that same day by Dr Shirley HOLT, consultant pathologist at the

Northern General Hospital.   The work at the Medico-Legal Centre was performed by

five forensic pathologists and five clinical pathologists - all of consultant

I can only speak in a detailed way of the nineteen examinations which I

personally carried out.       Having, however, read all ninety-five post mortem

reports and seen certain statements made by witnesses, I believe I can speak in

a general way about the pathological conditions which proved fatal in the total

of ninety-five cases which were examined.         The details of individual cases will

need to be obtained from the pathologists who examined them, which is why their

names and professional addresses, together with the body numbers, have been

provided.
Of the ninety-five dead, eighty-eight were males and seven were females, which,

in my view, merely reflects the nature of the occasion.



AGE

Of the ninety-five who died:-

  Thirty-eight persons (approximately 40%) were under 20 years of age

  Thirty-nine persons (41%) were between 20 and 29 years of age

  Twelve persons (13%) were between 30 and 39 years of age

  Three persons (3%) were between 40 and 49 years of age

  One person (1%) was between 50 and 59 years

  Two persons (2%) were between 60 and 69 years old.

The youngest person to die was a 10 year old boy and the eldest a 67 year old

man.

Seventy-seven of the ninety-five (81%) dead were below 30 years of age.

Again, I imagine these figures probably reflect the composition of the average

soccer crowd.



CAUSE OF DEATH

In virtually every case, the cause' of death was basically compression of the

chest wall - against the bodies of the persons immediately around the deceased

or against fixed structures such as the walls of the stadium and the crash

barriers.   In the vast majority of the cases, this pressure caused the condition

of traumatic or crush asphyxia - the two terms are synonymous.



Asphyxia pathologically means some mechanical obstruction to normal breathing.

That obstruction may be caused in a variety of ways - by a hand across the nose

and mouth (suffocation), by a ligature tightened around the neck

(strangulation), by a bolus of food which sticks in the airways (choking), or by

a strong pressure upon the chest wall so that it becomes fixed and cannot move
in and out to enable the person to draw breath.    Whatever the impedance to

respiration, the result is similar.     The oxygen in the air cannot be drawn into

the lungs and passed into the blood to be transported to the body tissues which

require it for their normal function.     The deoxygenated blood in the tissues

turns a dark colour, giving the victim's complexion and bluish or cyanotic hue.

The heart begins to fail and the walls of the smallest vessels (capillaries)

which are under pressure and themselves starved of oxygen, give way and allow

spurts of red cells to pass into the surrounding tissues where they show as tiny

pin-point haemorrhages (petechiae) in the loose skin around the eyes, on the

forehead and behind the ears as well as on the internal organs.     Thus, a

somewhat bloatd cyanotic appearance with external and internal petechiae arises.

If the impediment to breathing is not removed in some four to six minutes -

perhaps less if the victim is struggling and thus using up oxygen at a higher

rate - then the brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes and

ultimately the vital centres in the hind brain are damaged and die and life is

no longer possible.   Appearances such as this were seen in almost every person

who died at Hillsborough, and in all but nine cases death was attributed simply

to traumatic (or crush) asphyxia alone.     In one case (No 76) the force

compressing the chest was (perhaps momentarily) so great that the rear surface

of the breast bone almost touched the anterior surface of the spine, nipping and

splitting the aorta between them so that the man bled to death internally before

he could be asphyxiated.   In only eight other cases (Nos 3, 27, 29, 48, 69, 91,

93 and 95) were factors other than traumatic asphyxia thought to have even

contributed to the death, and in six of these eight, the contributory factor

arose out of compressive damage to the chest, neck or head.     In the remaining

two cases (3 and 69) only, truly natural disease was believed to be a

significant contributory factor in the death.



In any form of asphyxia vomiting may occur before death and because of

unconsciousness and the lack of the protective reflex mechanism, vomitus may be
aspirated into the lungs, greatly increasing the likelihood of death.     Most

pathologists regard this vomiting as merely a facet of death from asphyxia and

though recording it in their post mortem reports, do not dignify it with a

separate heading in the cause of death.     This is my view and the one I have

adopted in compiling the simple statistics for this report.     It has, however, to

be said that for purely mechanical and obvious reasons, vomiting is more likely

to occur if the stomach is distended with food and/or drink and is subjected to

hard external mechanical compression.     Vomiting is also more likely to occur in

those persons intoxicated with alcohol.



In eighteen cases bones were broken - mostly ribs (thirteen cases), but in

addition the bones and/or cartilages of the larynx (voice box) were fractured in

three cases (47, 51 and 81) - perhaps suggesting that the throat of these

persons had been trodden on accidentally.



In only two cases were long bones fractured.     In one of these cases (18), both

bones in a woman's forearm were broken and in one (11 ) a young boy's femur was

broken.   Both injuries could have occurred as the result of accidental

trampling.



In two cases impacts to the chest wall were so severe as to cause extensive

bruising to the underlying lungs, affecting the victim's ability to breathe and

in one of these the ribs were fractured and their ends tore the underlying lung

allowing air to escape from the lung into the chest (pneumothorax) and seriously

adversely affect the victim’s breathing.



In one case damage to the nose with subsequent bleeding allowed the inhalation

of blood into the lungs and this was thought to be a significant factor in the

death.
OTHER INJURIES

As one would perhaps have suspected, a very high proportion of these bodies bore

superficial grazes and scratches - evidence of blunt impact against all manner

of solid objects such as walls, concrete flooring, barriers and fences. These

injuries are too numerous to be described or interpreted here and details should

be obtained in each individual case from the pathologist who actually performed

the post mortem (see above).



ALCOHOL

In discussing this matter, my impression was that the dead came mostly from the

front (ie near to the pitch) areas of the Leppings Lane end, from amongst

persons who had arrived early in order to get a good view and thus their blood

alcohols are not necessarily an indication of the alcoholic status of those who

arrived later and were pushing to get in at the Leppings Lane end.



No alcohol was found in the bodies of any of the seven female victims.

No blood was taken from the victim who died last ie no 95, because of the

interval of time which had passed between the accident and his death.

Of the remaining eighty-seven men and boys, fifty-one (58%) were shown to have

nor more than 10 mg% in their blood, which is negligible, but fifteen had more

than 80 mg% in their blood, which means they could notlegally have driven a

car, and six had upwards of 120 mg% in their blood.   Six youths below theage of

18, who were not legally allowed to drink, had taken drink, of which group one

boy, aged 17 years, had a blood alcohol of 141 mg%, whilst a 15 year old had a

blood alcohol of 56 mg%.

Dear Peter

Mr Hayes has asked me t o re pl y to your l e t t e r dated 11 May 1990 regarding the
w i l l i n g n e ss of Professor Usher t o a c t as expert witness a t Civil proceedings
in connection with the Hillsborough Tragedy.

I have spoken with Professor Usher who is q u i t e w i l l i n g t o undertake the task
and looks forward t o r ec ei v i n g your l e t t e r which should be addressed d i r e c t l y
t o him a t the Medico Legal Centre.               I should perhaps remind you t h a t i t is
Professor Usher's i n t e n t i o n t o r e t i r e on 21 June 1990 and an e a r l y approach
would be advantageous.

I understand t h a t you are alr ead y in possession of the r e p o r t he prepared for
Lord J u s t i c e Taylor which summarises the causes of death and ends by giving
b r i e f d e t a i l of the alcohol content of the deceased. Professor Usher informs
me t h a t he did not prepare a s e p a r a t e r e p o r t f o r the Coroner.

                    THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - UP-DATE IV




The first phase of the Hillsborough Inquiry was concluded on 29 June 1989.
Oral evidence has been received from various parties including police and
civilian members of this Force. A total of 55 South Yorkshire Police
representatives have given evidence to the Inquiry and each has performed
creditably.

The policy adopted by the Force, and employed by each of our witnesses, has
been one of openness and helpfulness towards the Inquiry. The purpose of the
Inquiry is to examine all the facts relating to the Hillsborough disaster and
to make suitable recommendations to prevent any similar incident occurring in
the future. The South Yorkshire Police fully support those objectives and
have not sought to obscure any fact, for fear of embarrassment, that may serve
the very worthwhile aims of the Taylor Inquiry.

^Neither the South Yorkshire Police nor Lord Justice Taylor have any control
over the press coverage of the evidence that has been given. Members of the
Force can be assured, however, that the journalistic 'slant' bears little
 relation to the mountain of facts and claims that have been set before the
 Inquiry. The job of Lord Justice Taylor and his two assessors,.now, is to
 sift through that mass of evidence attaching weight to, and dismissing, that
which they see fit.

All parties to the Inquiry, including the South Yorkshire Police, are now
preparing written submissions to the Inquiry based upon their interpretation
of the evidence.

These submissions, and others from representative bodies such as the
Association of Chief Police Officers, the Superintendents' Association and the
Police Federation, will be considered by Lord Justice Taylor prior to his
publication of an interim report in August 1989.

The Inquiry is to reconvene at Sheffield on 14 July 1989 for one day only.
The purpose of this arrangement is to enable counsel, for each party, the
opportunity to summarise the submissions they have made to the Inquiry.   In
essence, it may be little more than a press call with certain parties seeking
headlines.  These presentations should'not, however, affect the serious
deliberations of the Judge and his assessors.

The South Yorkshire Policfe has done all that it has been permitted to do to
present its case concerning the events of 15 April 1989. Those police
officers and civilians who represented that case by giving evidence are
thanked for all their efforts; those many many more who were prepared to do so
but were not called are not forgotten in those thanks.                   _

We must now await the interim findings of Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry, and
the subsequent final report to be published in 1990. The South Yorkshire
Police will reflect, conscientiously and professionally, upon any
recommendations that are relevant to the Force and move forward from the
tragedy that touched all of us.

As a postscript, the West Midlands Police continue to prepare a report for
HM Coroner who is to hold an inquest, in January 1990, into the 95 deaths.
The West Midlands officers may wish at some stage in the future to take
statements from members of the South Yorkshire Police who dealt with the
deceased. When their intentions are more clear the relevant individuals will   *
be fully advised.

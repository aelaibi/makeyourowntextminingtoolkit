   HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

   In the absence of the Deputy Chief Constable, Mr Peter Hayes, I
   reply to the letter from Miss Belinda Norcliffe, dated 28 April
   1989, in which she makes several requests on behalf of
   Mr Woodward QC.

           i)      I enclose a summary outlining the procurement,
                   briefing and deployment of non South Yorkshire Police
                   officers

           ii)    I enclose details of information which has been
                  provided to the Home Office in response to
                  Parliamentary questions to date

           iii) In respect of Counsel's request to visit a
                football match at Hillsborough, I wrote to you on
                the 2 May 1989 with proposed arrangements

           iv)     I have, awaiting your collection at South
                   Yorkshire Police Headquarters, copies of the press
                   books (A3 size) which have been maintained since
                   the incident occurred.  I am also having a
                   compilation of television news reports transferred
                   onto a single video tape which will be
                   available to you shortly.

          v)       The notes of the pre-match planning meeting
                   held at Hammerton Road Police Station, chaired
                   by Chief Superintendent Mole, cannot be traced
                   and are therefore unavailable to Counsel.

  In addition to these points, I can confirm the arrangements
  discussed by Miss Belinda Norcliffe and Chief Superintendent Mole
  in a telephone conversation yesterday.   Facilities will be made
  available for yourselves and Counsel to meet at Police
  Headquarters from 2.00 pm on Tuesday 9 May 1989.  I, and other
  officers, will be on hand during the afternoon.
Upon your arrival the Chief Constable would appreciate the
opportunity to speak with Mr Woodward prior to your meeting,
please.

On Friday 12 May 1989, we shall expect you for a full day
conference at Police Headquarters, and I hope that you, Mr
Woodward, Mr Limb and Miss Norcliffe are able to join me for
lunch.

Yours sincerely

              N o t t i n gh ams hi re, M e r s e y s i d e and West Yor ks h i r e w e r e requested by w a y

    b)       Al l dog handlers we re brie fe d at 9.30 am, 15 Ap ri l 1989. The actual

             officer in charge of the South Y o r k s h i r e Police moun te d section.

             A full list of officers who we re brief ed is attached,                       together w i t h
             a list of their or ig ina l deployment.
     Like the dog section, the vis iti ng m o u n t e d officers w e r e paired w i t h
     South Y o r k s h i r e officers.          The M e r s e y s i d e Offi cer s and
     N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e Offi ce rs wer e de pl o y e d to p olice the L i v e r p o o l and
     N o t t i n g h a m Forest fans respectively.

     It is w o r t h y of note that bo th v i s i tin g Sergeants - 1952 Smith of
     M e r s e y s i d e and 1710 W a t s o n of N o t t i n g h a m s h i r e had performed
     identical d uties at the H i l l s b o r o u g h F.A. C up semi-f in al in 1988.

     Insp ec tor H an d-D a v i s pro vi ded salient infor ma tio n from the 'F'
     D i vi sio na l O p e r a t i o n a l Order i nc luding co mmunications, ticket colour
     coding, gate openi ng times, train arrival and escort duties, coach

c)   The identity, rank and g e o gr ap hic al deployment of these officers is
     in c or po rat ed in the a ppendices to p a r a g r a p h (b) above.

     except for one mi no r d e v i ati on of two officers f rom rai lwa y station

     So far as the M o unt ed Offi ce rs are con cer ne d there w e r e two
     significant deviations, both in it iated by Inspector Hand-Davis.
     A r o u n d 2.00 pm it was apparent that m o u n t e d cover on Peni st one Road
     was m o r e than a dequate and two officers \                | No tt in g h a m s h i r e

     from the r a i l w a y stati on to Lepp in gs L an e turnstiles the officers
     remained there.        Therefore, about 2.10 pm, there were 13 mounted
     officers at L e p p in gs Lane turnstiles.

     At 2.40 pm the problems at Lep pi ngs Lane began to become apparent
     and the four m o u n t e d officers on the South Stand d eta il (2613
     Lindsay, South Yorkshire,                     L 4886 N a r e y and 4365 Edge, all

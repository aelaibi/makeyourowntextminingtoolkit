was    no trouble            whatsoever,,         I believe           there were          one    or two arrests,

but    no d i s t u r b a n c e s    or    crowd trouble              whatsoever.                                        :

ad v i s e    supporters           generally        the    direction          of the ground.

licensed           premises        called    the R a i l w a y        Inn,    when    I worked          in Sheffield,

I recall           v i s iting     these    premises,           but    it    is some y ears ago,             but when

we a r r i v e d at W a r d s e n d Road,             I recall         Police C o n s t a b l e ' B u t l e r ,■

informing           me    that     the    licensee        of the       premises w o u l d         like     to see me.

I met the           licensee,        a tali       chap w ith a beard.                He    informed me that              he

customers,            into    the    premises.            He    stated       that    he had op e n e d       in 1.988

for    the     s e mi-final         and that        damage       had been        caused to the             toilets,

a l t h o u g h there        had    not    been any serious                 trouble.        He a s k e d    that we

direct any            *o 1der      e n d 8 supporte r s , not           the younger             element who may

cause trouble and                  damage.        1 recall        that       he was       quite    friendly,        asked

us to keep an eye                  on the    place,        and    he would          probably       remain outside

or near        to the        door and we agr e e d              that    we would          cover    the     premises as

well    as our           duties     wit h the mini             buses.

I a g r e e d that         12.30 w o u l d be an           ideal       time and that we' d split                   the

officers           up so     that    they    could go           to the       back    of the       premises and

have a drink at about                     12.30.

impro v i s e d and         placed some           seats      of their          own    in the     van,     the     lads     in

it were all           in their          twerl't i e s , that age          group,       they were         in a good

mood,       these     did not appear              to be d r i nking at all,                  they were        joking

w i t h the        offieers,        there was         no trouble-              They    parked where we t o l d ’

them     to    park and          1 recall       that     this     first        bus    load made        their way

d i r e c t l y to the        ground.

Buses a r r i v e d a f t e r w a r d s        but    there was         not a great           number      of these

mini     coaches.           We    parked t hem on tine side                    of the       road and a l t h o u g h

the majority, of              the    o c c upants were          obviously            excited about          the

p r o s p e c t s o f t h e rna t c h , t h e y w e re g e n e r a 11 y well                be ha v e d a n d good

humoured.            We j o k e d with         them,     talked about            the match,           a n d they were

generally           in high       spirits and there was                   no    problem whatsoever.,

The     coaches       that were           proper mini          coaches,         the    drivers were           generally

remaining           with    the     coach and we           did not        see evidence           of a great          deal

of    drink        on this       type     of mini      coach.         Others which were                consisting          of

company        vehicles,          works'      vans,      that     had o b v iously           been b o r rowed had a

considerable            number       of    cans      of drink         in them.         But again,         the

o c c upants       were     no    problem w hatsoever.                  I recall        one     van    load

a r r i v i n g and as k i n g       if they         could ob t a i n a drink,               they were m a i n l y         in

the 3 0/35 age             group,       and a c t u a l l y w a l k e d    down to the           rear     entrance         of

the R a i l w a y Public            House.        Told     them to go quietly to the                      back     door

did    in fact        go    into the         premises       later      on through the             back      door    there

was    no     problem       in the        public, house whatsoever,                    as    I said     before      they

can>      they were* carrying a'half                      dozen    cans at a time,               a n d drinking

from them.             As    some     of the s p e c t a t o r s     left the           pub a g a i n there w a s ■no

problem,         t hey e v e n t h a n k e d us for           informing          them and        I saw one group

of fans        leaving        the     pub thanking          the    licensee           and shaking        hands with

him.

Wh i l s t we were at              the     location       of W a r d s e n d Road and Hal i fax .Road,                 we

were     v i s i t e d by Chief            Superintendent          Nesbit who was              touring      the area

in a Range            Rover.        He     came and       spoke    to     us,        I think he w o u l d      have

spoke       to us      in any       case,        but    his wife was        in,fact           in our    serial       w hich

w o u l d have        been    some       influence        on him visiting               us.     We were also

visi t e d b y S u p eri n t e n d e n t Sia r s h a 1 1 who was                on     foot, and ha was

checking         the       crowds.         This was       early    doors,            I w ould say      in the    region

of    IS o'clock            time,     he    came and spoke           to me.          I do know S u p e r i n t s n d e n t

Ma r shall       although          I've     never w o r k e d wit h him,              I know him from a

social       aspect.          His main           concern was       that     no weapons           arrived       in these

mini     buses        and    nothing was           taken down to the                 ground w h i c h would          cause

any     injury.            He also       r e quested      that we     check as m any for                tickets       and

adv i s e    those         that    h a d n ’t got      tickets     not    to make          their way       down to

the ground.,

As    the mini         buses       started to back           up W a r d s e n d Road,          we had      the use         of

a company            car    park,    and we        did    in fact     park a number              of mini       buses       on

this     car     park.        One    thing        i do    recall     is that a mini              bus   full     of

yo u n g s t e r s   SO years        of age        pulled onto       the car           park and when           I walked

up to this            van    they'd        got   the     sliding •dDor open,              I believe        two or three

round       public         house    tables       and a half        dozen     pub stools and number                    of

cans     of beer           on the    tables.           I a s k e d them     in a joking ma n n e r what                they

were     doing and they said that                        they knew that          the      pubs w o u l d    be shut so
                                                                                                                     PAGE        3

th e y ' d brought           their         own mini        pub.         Again,       they were    no trouble             1

believe D e t e c t i v e             C o n s t a b l e Hill   just       had to warn one          of    these       lads who

was     getting        a bit          stroppy,        to   clam down,           but    in general       we    had no

problem w h a t s o e v e r            w i t h any     of the mini             buses    that    came, .....                  :

I -counted a total                    of only      17 mini         buses,       I e x p ected that we w o u l d be

i nu n d a t e d w i t h mini            buses and         in the        end w o u l d be trying         to find

places        to     park    them on both sides                    of    the    road but this w a s n ’t so.

T here were           very       few and        I told the          officers          in my serial       that       if

there were            late a r r i v a l s       w ith      cars    rather       than send       the    cars to the

g r o u n d where        they w o u l d         cause a prob l e m             trying    to park       down there

that     we     could start              parking a few             cars as well          on W a r d s e n d Road.            I

did     in f act        radio         through. to the Cont ro 1 R o o m where                    I spoke       to

S e r g e a n t Goddard.                1 was     in fact      in posse s s i o n of a radio and

informed him that                     there were           very few       cars and buses arriving.                       I

recall         the    football           special       train arriving,                1 was    stood at the          end of

W a r d s e n d Road,        I saw the train                 cross       the bridge       over    the    road.           I

w o u l d say about              5 / 6 hund r e d      fans    came       off    the    train,    they wal k e d down

from the           station,           two m o u n t e d    officers           were    in front    of them,          they

just     held them           for a short              time,    until          they were altogether,             then

they went            down H a l i f a x        R oad towards            the    ground,    again although             they

were     in high spirits                   and were         singing,          I did not       see any    that       tried

to Jbrea k away,             t h e y f o 11 o w e d the        officer s and we n t d a w n tow a r d s t h e

Our     brief was           to    remain at W a r d s e n d Road,                until    kick    off    time       or

shor t l y before            if there was              no other          duty to       perform there,          but       I do

recall        as     late as          twenty minutes           to three,             young men,    I w o u l d think

that     they were           Liverpool           supporters,             running       up Halifax R o a d away

f rom    the gro u n d towards a shopping                           precinct          a short    distance       some 20

or 3 0 yards            further          up,    and o b v i o u s l y     they were       heading       for    the beer

off and         the     supermarket             and    right       up to ten minutes             to three or even
                                                                                                               P AGfc.
                                                                                                               R3S4

later,       crowds       of s u p p o r t e r s were         still       corning down H a l i f a x R oad and

the    significant             thing was        the am o u n t         of drink     they were         carrying,

cans    of beer.              A l t h o u g h we didn't          have any trouble w i t h them,                it was

n o t i c e a b l e at    the     time a n d        I ’m not      just     saying    this    in the a f t e r m a t h

of what       happened,           it was       remarked          on that why at this              late time were

t h e y :going      to the        ground and having                 a considerable am o u n t            of drink.

I have       gone    to football             matc h e s all         my    life and big matches,             I've

always       gone    early and .wouldn't                 think         of going     for a drink,          thinking

of being          in the         gr o u n d an d having had drink,                but    this    certainly

struck me and             I      rela t e d    to my own two sons who are                   in their      twenties,

an d every time               I go to a football                 m a t c h w ith them we a l w a y s       seam to

meet     in a public             house,       but    probably this            is what all         the y oungsters

do nowadays          and       it was     si g n i f i c a n t    at     the time and as          I've    previously

said,     I ’m' not       stating       this        in the a f t e r m a t h      of what       happened,      this       is

a fact and          it was        n o t i c e d fay quits a lot of                people.

As we     left W a r d s e n d R oad we              left as a serial,              there were         still    people

walk i n g    down at approximately, three                          o'clock       or just       before ana      I am

almost       certain          that    1 heard over            the      radio as we got           towards

Claywheels          Lane       the match,           the kick        off,    had been      postponed.           I was

c e r t a i n l y a ware       of thi s and anot h e r              thing     I recall      shortly       before      I

recall       a radio m e s s a g e        and again           I know Sergeant G o d d a r d ' s           voice,      he

was    in the Control                Room and        I recall          a radio message          where Sergeant

Goddard       in the Control              Roo m was ask i n g             other    officers       if they had

seen    the S outh Y o r k s h i r e          Tra n s p o r t     L i a i s o n Officer     in the       vicinity of

the Merr i e s R o a d           garage.        I recall          this     because      he was ask i n g       for

that    officer          to      contact       or at     least         if officers were          in contact with

him to       inform him they had                    closed L e p p i n g s    Lane      because      of the

volume       of s u p p o r t e r s    and     that     the      bus     drivers    should      be    informed of

this.        We    carried        on and went and a c t u a l l y              turned     into C l a y w h e e l s

Lane,     where      our       brief was        to obtain a meal,                 we had not         had a meal at
                                                                                                                                      P AGE

this      time,       and as     I w a l k e d w ith the                        serial             into C l a y w h e e l s    Lane,    I

h e a r d over        the    radio a n appeal                for            o f f icers                to go to the       g round as

there were            some    people        In L e p p i n g s              Lane,                trying    to get     to the       ground.

I stop p e d niy serial,                 told them to turn                                 round and we w a l k e d            towards

the ground.             I then met             Inspector                Charles                   coming       in the opposite
                                                       mr«nii»iryryTrirHniiir.''ir^*'r" —n— -

direction away               from    the g r o u n d . . As we met                                 he a s k e d me where         I was

going and            I told him about                the appeal                        I ’d heard over my               radio.         We

had a discussion,                I recall J o h n Char l e s                                    saying    no our     instructions

are      to go to C l a y w h e e l s          Lane and              I recall                     saying       to him w e ’d check

again,         you    check or       I'll       check        on the                    radio,           they want     offic e r s at

Le p p i n g s Lane.          J o h n Charles          did           in fact                     go over the air          he was       in

possession            of his     own      radio,       a n d .he                received the same                    i n s t r u c t i o n as

rfie.

J o h n Charles         had got          the    equiv a l e n t                 of about                five    serials       and the

only other            officer       with       him    I can              recall                  was    Inspector     Bo b Meek,

there may have               been s o m ebody          else,                 I can't               recall.        I c a n ’t recall

any      other S e r g e a n t      or    Inspector Ellis                              or any other              Inspector with us,

I can only            recall     Inspector. Charles,                                Inspector Meek and myself,                         and

we      took    the    serials       and       I believe                we' d got                  five serials         wit h us up

approached            the    gates       to the       ground.,                     We           stopped the       serials       at the

to try and o b t a i n           in f o r m a t i o n as a runner and                                    Inspector Ch ar l e s and

to move.             I looked after            the serials                         while Joh n Char l e s               was     trying        to

get     over     on the       radio.           I recall             telling                      the   serials     to follow

Inspector C h a r l e s          and      I and not              to break                        rank or move       a way and to

of the ground,            and    I recall           turning      round to make            sure       that       everybody

was with us,         a l t h o u g h we were w i n d i n g          our way        thro u g h the          crowds        o# \

that were      there       fo r m e d a kind of             tunnel      for    us to go through,                  and we

mQffientarily s t o p p e d          there and then an officer                     I d o n ' t 1 know who             it,

was,     it was an officer              of     Inspector         or S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    rank,        told us,

"Straight/into            the    gr o u n d    lads,       go straight         into     the, ground,             they

need some      help."           We    then went        thro u g h     the     concertina           gate,        the    big

blueVconcertina            gate,       as you        look at the Leppings Lane                       ent rance         it

wasr to the       right     hand side.               As we went         into     the area          i mmediately

 ehind the        s tand    1 could see the                 tunnel      in q u e stion that- goes under

around,     mi 1 1 ing a r o u n d and then                I saw    both officers and                    su pporters

carrying     three        people       from u n d e r n e a t h     the     tunnel      from       the ground,,              I

am certain that            all       those     three       people were alive              because          they ware

giving     them What        first aid they                 could and        I recall        forming a circle

with     the serials        that we           had    round these           people,      and       saying,        "Look

get these      supporters             that are        gett i n g    in the way,           get      them behind us

so that     they     can see          to these        casualties."             I *d no      idea that there

was anymore,         it    looked       like a f a i nting            s i tuation and             I *m    certain that

these     people were           alive and we           didn't       realise       the     e n o r m i t y of the

situati on in the           ground.

O ther    officers,        a g a i n w ith supporters,                came     up the tunnel               with some

more     casualties        and       I could then see              that     it was a more                serious

situation.         They were n ' t            just    needing       their      ties     loosening,              or air,

the normal        faint i n g        situations,           and   three      four or more were                   brought

out as     I say.         I recall       then a young              officer       running          up the        tunnel       as

they were      bringing          some    other       people and            I was stood more                or    'less

just     inside    the     tunnel       and he was more               or    less s c r eaming at me

  saying,       "Get       some men        in hers,      come and help us,               we    need help         inside,

  as man y as         possible."            I just      recall     shouting         to or getting            hold of

  as m a n y    chaps as          I knew.        1 recall getting hold of Steve Co'.Ok who was

  w i t h me and J ohn Hill                and saying,         "Right,       get them         inside       the ground

  they    need us          inside     the g r o und," and we went                  u n d e r the t u n n e 1.       We

  pushed/^bur wa y to the                  front and as we            got    to the front we were                  then

  f'acedrwith all             I can describe as a pile                  of bodies          that a p p e a r e d just

  stjicked on top of               one another          to the     level       of the top of the wall                    and

   everal       feet       back    from the wall.              O f f i c e r s and s pectators             alike were

  just    pulling at             these     bodies.       At    this    stage       I'm sure         that    they w e r e n ’

^ a l 1 dead and we were                 just    picking a body             up,    I c a n ’t recall         which

  officeryf and we               ran as     best we      could up the             tunnel      out    into    the area

  we' d yfirst        come       into on the       other       side    of the       stand.          I think      I did

  thi£    so m e t h i n g    like    eight,      nine,       ten times,          with officers and

  s/e ctato r s .          The    first     body you picked            up you       ran out w i t h him and

  there were          officers        carried      on giving assistance.                      I remember        that we

  ;.ried kiss         of     life and heart mass a g e             on one         chap who we         thought       was

  alive    for a       cons i d e r a b l e     length    of      time and then took                him out away as

  people were          falling        over      us on the         steps       ofthe    terrace        and we got

   him to the back.     As               I said,       this    took    place       carrying         bodies     out,      as

   far as I ’m c o ncerned               ten times,       it ma y have            been more and            I c a n ’t

^ recall       which       officer       I saw,    I can       remember       another         Sergeant       and    I ’ve

  just    thought          of his     name      over    the    last    day,       a Sergeant        Whit lam,      who

  used to be at Rothe r h a m .                  I can    remember          carrying a body with                him on

  a couple       of    occasions,          but    the others,          I've       no idea who         they were.              I

  remember       then that           the   entrance       tothe       tunnel      appeared      to become

  bloc k e d and       I then        remember      Superintendent             G r e e n w o o d who was        on the

  pitch side          of this        fence wit h a m e g a p h o n e        in his      hand organ i s i n g a

  chain,       and    the only way to do                it was    to take the           top body first.                  We

  appeared       to be just           sna t c h i n g at an arm and a leg and o b v i o u s l y                    it

 was    trapped.            I remember at           first      I was    near     the      gate and there was                   I ’m

 alm o s t    certain a man with his                    leg    t r a p p e d behind the gate             support,

 or his f o'o t , an d We were                 just     s t a nding    on him and e v e n t u a l l y s o m ebody

 got    him out and that was                   p reventing       us getting          thro u g h the gate,

 Qffic e r s were           trying     to     carry bodies           through; tHe gf t e .a n d this was

Ci'|i.possi:ble- due to            the w i d t h of      the    gate.        I remember S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            ,

 Greenwood        continually             telling       them,    "Form a chain,             form a chain,             don't

 try a nd      come t h r o u g h w ith the             body,    d o n ’t try and          come t h rough."               We

 formed a chain and we got                      some a s s e m b l a n c e    of order,          if you    can call

 it that       in this        situation,          where we       did    in fact        get a chain going.                      I

 d o n ’t recall          now w h e t h e r    this     came    to me a f t e r w a r d s    or at       the time,

 but    there was a man s o m ewhere along                       the    line     screaming about               his

 daughter.           At     first we        tried to shove            him away and          realised       that he

 had got       s o m e b o d y there and he went                through       onto the       pitch.        One       of

 the things          that     struck        me was      the    colour     of the faces            of the

 victims,,       These        were     purple and you            could       tell    that    they were          dead,

 there were          blue areas           on the body w hich was               obv i o u s l y    pressure and             I

 recall       some were         f r o thing     through        the    nose and mouth.              There       was

 either       one,     two    or    possibly more             people    there who were             obviously

 doctors       and     I remember           one of these         chaps       saying       on several

 occasions,          "Leave        him,     leave     him."      O b v i o u s l y he was        dead,    to    look

 for    someone        else.        I recall        also at      this    time       the    only other          officer

 that    I did see was Chief                   Superintendent           Nesbit and he,             with    other

 officers was             tearing     at the        fence,      away    from the gate             some    10 yards

awa y from the              gate,    and they a c t u a l l y         broke    the mes h near            to the top

 corner and          peeled        it back,       and    thinking about             it,    it was    like you             peel

a sardine        tin back,           an d then he started               saying,        "Pass      ’em through."

The y    ripped the           fence       out and that          fence was        ripped out         by hand,         by

was    only o n e .

The    orders          were     being         given by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Ne s b i t as best he

himself        on the         fence       near           the gate and was just                 giving the orders              to

the    lads to          pass       these       bodies        in the         chain.

The    only other             Inspector             I saw was an           Inspector          from the T r a i n i n g

De p a r t m e n t ,    Rob and          I forget         his s e c o n d       name.        He was    there and         I

believe        there was            Inspector Sykss                there.         I can't        recall      now who         I.

did see        of      the    officers,             I remember        seeing       Bob Gutcher and               several

other      officers.

E v e n t u a l l y we       got    all       the    bodies     from       behind the wall            and       they were

on the       pitch and were                   either      being     t e n d e r e d to by officers,               St.    John's

Fire     Serv i c e       oh,      I recall          as we were           getting a body out,                I recall

that     there         were     signs         of    l if e in his         chap,    a young man and we -s h o u t e d

and    screamed           for      o x y g e n and the Fire S e r v i c e               came and       they got

cylinders           of ox y g e n and              they then treat              this    chap with         the    oxygen,

were     dead obviously.                      When we *d got         the        bodies       out we    remained         in

that     enclosure.                We    h a d n ’t time? to think,               I wasn't        conscious        of the

spect ators            a r o u n d me,        and    I never       gave     them a thought,               but after          the

bodies       had       been     removed,            we   in that     enclosure,              then became         very very

conscious           of the         spectators            in the seating area above                    us,       and for       the

first      time,        I became          f r i g h t e n e d and     I feared that             the anger         was going

to be ve n t e d on us and                     I said,       " T h e r e ’s gonna be trouble,                   1 can see

there's        gonna be t r o u b l e . "                T h e y were      really angry.              I did      in fact

speak      to Chief           Superintendent               Nesbit         and    said,       "You know w e ’re gonna

have     trouble          here"         an d then he said,                "Get them out,           get the        officers

    and    saw    that     those       fans,      they were          hurl i n g abuse at us.                  I've got          to

    be honest,        I d i d n ’t see a n y t h i n g          th r o w n at us,         it was      the verbal

    abuse,       and you      could feel            the anger         that was        being      vented on u s , 'and

    I don't       frighten        easily.           I ’ve been        in one       or two      situations,            but       I

    was    f r i g h t e n e d and     I was      won d e r i n g    what we were           going     to      do,    whether

    we were       going     to turn and             run,    because         there was a crowd behind us.

    This    was     brought       home      whe n one       of the Police Ph o t o g r a p h e r s ,                Dennis

    Bond,     came and he a c t u a l l y            spoke      to me,        1 never       gave    it a thought at

    that    time,     he was         dres s e d     in    civilian       clothes        and he       came and the

    next    thing     he was         virtually           surrounded         by a n g r y suppo r t e r s who were

    milling       on the      pitch and           came away,          but as       1 walked        over       I saw

    anot h e r    c rowcl f ur the r ove r to the                   I ef t near      to the      control        box

    found out        later       his    name was Spike,               and    officers        had to v i r tually

    drag    him out.          1 remember            saying      to Dennis Bon d             in obscene          language

    (what     the    fucking         hell     they were         doing)       and he told me,               he said,

    "Well, w e ’ve been a s k e d             to get       some      photog r a p h s     by an A.C.C ."              I've

    got    to say     1 thought          that was          bloody      stupid,        whoever       had given him

    that    order,        what    the    hell       did he want          photographs           for at         that    time?

    The    evidence was           there,       and they were             nearly       lynched thro u g h             it.

    I. c a n ’t recall        seeing        anyone       else       getting      hold of that            sit u a t i o n

I nspector Ro b a n d            I forget       his    name      from Training,           who        I spoke       to.           I

can't      recall        any    other    officer       coming        until    I saw the A . C . C , Mr

Jackson       come.        W h e t h e r h e ’d been t here and              I h a d n ’t seen him               I d o n ’t

kiftow,‘b u t ,he was the            only one w h e n we got all                  the bodies ^out.                 it was

in m y book,         it was       down to Joh n Nesbit,                 a n d S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Greenwood'

a n d all     thtfse -lad$. Who- w o r k e d just              bl o o d y fantastically.

We    then e v e n t u a l l y    got an order           from Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            Nesbit       to

try and get           the      spectators        off     the     pitch and       to try and get them from

the    ground.        Oh,        l ‘d previ o u s l y     heard an appeal by D a l g l i s h which

went     down very well,             and someone          else       said-, that     the Notts             Forest

Manager,       Clough,          had been on the           pitch       but we didn't             see       him.     But

anot h e r    thing       that    struck me        is that        an a n n o u n c e m e n t    was made          over

the Police          tan n o y    by a Police Officer,                 1 presume asking the

spec t a t o r s    to    leave and when he was making                       it I was w o r r i e d          that       that

w h e n we *d have         some     real     trouble,       but      in actual       fact       they just went,

c e rtainly out           of the     seating       area,       and    it was      then that Chief

Superintendent             Nesbit       said,     "Try and        get    hold of some            blokes and try

and    coax    them all, .let’s try and                   get     ’em out and off the                     pitch," and

we    did,    and     they went,          there was        no trouble,           we d i dn *t have to e ven

speak     to a n y b o d y sharply,         they went          and   I didn* t e x p e r i e n c e           any

trouble       until       saw one       tall L i v e r p o o l    s u p porter     in a blue              shirt and          1

actually       heard him          saying,       "We ought         to have a riot,"                   He    said that a

a p p r e h e n d 'him or anything,             but w hen we          did go and speak                to him,        some

of his own s u p p o r t e r s          got hold of him,              probably he was                so upset

o b v i o u s l y he was angry and one                 can u n d e r s t a n d that,           but    he did       in

fact     listen to         his    own mates who we               spoke     to as well,           and       they went

and    1 d i d n ’t see         him again.

T d o n ’t know what             time    it was       but we      e v e n t u a l l y went and were               told to

go back       into       the    stand where        the    briefing         earlier      had taken            place.              1

injuries           or tragedy.          He went        a w a y an d came back and a n n o u n c e d to the

officers           that were          there that       this    had been done,             they were        doing       it

and that       p r o v i s i o n s were      being       made for           us to go to C l a y w h e e l s Lane.

We w e r e    d i r e c t e d to C l a y w h e e l s     Lane where            I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

B r o u g h a m of the T r a f f i c Division.                 I informed him that                 the major i t y

of R o t h e r h a m O f f i c e r s    had been        i n v olved        in the     removal      of    bodies      from

the    terrace and             that    I thought         they ought            to be taken         back    tb

R o therham.         Again       he was      very good,          I don"t          know where          he got       the bus

from or buses             but    he    certainly        got some           buses.      He told me         that he

would     provide         drivers       to take a n y officer                 home who       c o u l d n ’t drive and

we were more             or    less    bused away        back       to Rotherham.

It's    very hard             to describe       the     horrendous            scenes,      it's alr i g h t        three

days    later       being able           to talk       about    it and         I have     said that's what we

get    paid        for   but     I've seen the         effects           on the D e t e c t i v e s    that     I've

w o r k e d with.         I saw the        effect       on Kev Yarrow,              Steve Cook,         who at work

can handle any                situation      but    I saw the            effect     of that.          I didn't see

Joh n Charles            again,       I know he got           tied .'up in the           gymnasium,         it was .an

h o r rific    e xperience.             In 31 years           on the Police             I never       thought       that

I w ould w i t n e s s        the horrific: scenes              that we did meet                on entering          the

ground.        I would          like    to say that           every        bobby that        I wo r k e d with gave

ever y t h i n g    he'd      got,     did every t h i n g      he had to do,             and made me after

31 years       do u b l y     proud     that   I became         a    copper and          I know that          the more

I think about             it,    I thought         of young         lads,       probably      some w ith only one

or two years             in an d      I looked at them thinking                     a l t h o u g h my sons aren't

THIS RECOLLECTION HAS BEEN TRANSCRIBED FROM A TAPE

RECORDED ON THE 18TH APRIL 1989

MICHAEL JOHN TISSINGTON PS 182

SOUTH YORKSHIRE P O L I C E , STATIONED AT THE CRIMINAL

INVESTIGATION D E P A R T M E N T , ROTHERHAM POLICE STATION.




It is now Tuesday 18th April 1989,        just recalling the

events of Saturday the 15th April 1989, at the Liverpool

Notts Forest Semi final at Hillsborough.




Reported on duty at 8.30 a.m., at Main Street Police Station

Rotherham.     My serial consisted of Police Woman 3136 Sherburn,

Police Woman 3212 Nesbit,      Police Constable 1779 Williamson,

Police Constable 1981 Butler, Detective Constable 2790 Yarrow,

Detective Constable 1917 Cook,       Detective Constable 1477 Hill,

and Detective Constable 2293 Day.         All the Officers are from

Cl Division,    some from the uniform, and the rest from the

CID who had volunteered to work at the football match on

a Weekly Leave day.      There was another serial attached to

ours and in overall charge of the two serials was Inspector

Steve Ellis.     He has been recently promoted from the Traffic

Division.    We were bused to Hillsborough onto Pennistone Road,

near to the entrance of the gymnasium. We went into the main

stand where briefing was held by several officers who had

drawn up the plans for the match including CID Officers in

relation to crime and we were finally briefed by

Detective Superintendent Duckenfield from          'F' Division.
                        -   2 -



I had attended the previous match in 1988, at this ground

in similar circumstances,         and at that time I was in fact

at the Leppings Lane end controlling the crowds and on

the commencement of the match I was in the main stand with

the Liverpool supporters.          On that occasion there was no

trouble whatsoever,    I believe there was one or two arrests

but no disturbances or crowd trouble whatsoever.




After the briefing we proceeded to our duty which was at

Wardsend Road North,    that's on the junction with Halifax Road

and directly opposite the British Rail Station at Wadsley

Bridge.   Our duties were to park mini buses arriving down

Halifax Road from the motorway and advise supporters generally

the direction of the ground.




Located at the junction of Wardsend Road and Halifax Road

is Licensed premises called the Railway Inn, when I worked

in Sheffield I recall visiting these premises but it is some

years ago, but when we arrived at Wardsend Road,         I recall

PC Butler informing me that the Licensee of the premises

would like to see me.       I met the Licensee a tall chap with

a beard, he informed me that he was not opening the front

doors and'that the windows had been boarded but he intended

to open via the rear door in a small courtyard at the back

and allow certain supporters and obviously his regular

customers into the premises.          He stated that he had opened

in 1988 for the Semi final and that damage had been caused
to the toilets,   although there had not been any serious

trouble.   He asked that we direct any   'older end'   supporters

not the younger element who may cause trouble and damage.

I recall that he was quite friendly, asked us to keep an

eye on the place, and he would probably remain outside or

near to the door and we agreed that we would cover the premises

as well as our duties with the Mini buses.

I remember him offering to provide a pot of tea for the

officers and I agreed that 12.30 would be an ideal time

and that we'd split the officers up so that they could go

to the back of the premises and have a drink at about 12.30




Coaches started arriving   , I think the first coach arrived

somewhere in the region of about 11.30.      This was a Ford Transit

van and they'd improvised and placed some seats of their own

in the van, the lads in it were all in their twenties,      that

age group, they were in a good mood, these did not appear

to be drinking at all, they were joking with the officers,

there was no trouble,   they parked where we told them to

park, and I recall that this first bus load made their way

directly down to the ground.

Buses arrived afterwards but there was not a great number

of these Mini coaches. We parked them on the side of the

road and although the majority of the occupants were obviously

excited about the prospects of the match, they were generally

well behaved and good humoured.    We joked with them, talked

about the match, and they were generally in high spirits

and there was no problem whatsoever.
                         -   4 -



The coaches that were proper Mini coaches,    the drivers were

generally remaining with the coach and we did not see evidence

of a great deal of drink on this type of Mini coach.       Others

which were consisting of Company Vehicles,    Works vans, that had

obviously been borrowed had a considerable number of cans

of drink in them.     But again the occupants were no problem

whatsoever.     I recall one van load arriving and asking if they

could obtain a drink, they were mainly in the 30/35 age group,

and actually walked down to the rear entrance of the Railway

Public House,   told them to go quietly to the back door and

they were infact admitted by the Licensee into the

premises.     I did infact go into the premises later on through

the back door there was no problem in the Public House

whatsoever,   as I said before they seemed to be in high

spirits and quite good humoured as generally Liverpool fans are.




There was a steady flow of spectators walking down Halifax Road,

towards the ground,    and as every officer that was on duty

in that area will say the same thing, that the majority of

these fans, the younger element in particular were all carrying

cans of beer, or lager and large plastic bottles of drink

and openly drinking them as they walked along.     All the officers

were quite surprised that the weren't    just carrying one can,

they were carrying a half dozen cans at a time, and drinking

from them.    As some of the spectators left the Pub again

there was no problem, they even thanked us for informing

them and I saw one group of fans leaving the Pub thanking the

Licensee and shaking hands with him.
                      - 5-



Whilst we were at the location of Wardsend Road, and Halifax Road,

we were visited by Chief Superintendent Nesbit who was touring

the area in a Range Rover, he came and spoke to u s , I think

he would have spoke to us in any case but his wife was infact

in our serial which would have been some influence on him

visiting us. We were also visited by Superintendent Marshall

who was on foot, and he was checking the crowds.    This was early

doors,   I would say in the region of 12 o'clock time, he came

and spoke to me,    I do know Superintendent Marshall although

I've never worked with him,    I know him from a Social aspect,

his main concern was that no weapons arrived in these Mini

buses and nothing was taken down to the ground which would

cause any injury.     He also requested that we check as many

for tickets and advise those that hadn't got tickets not to

make their way down to the ground.




As the Mini buses started to back up Wardsend Road, we had

the use of a company car park,    and we did infact park a number

of Mini buses on this car park.     One thing I do recall is that

a Mini bus full of youngsters 20 years of age pulled onto the

car park, and when I walked up to this van they'd got the

sliding door open,    I believe two or three round public house

tables, and half a dozen pub stools and numbers of cans of

beer on the tables.     I asked them in a joking manner what

they were doing and they said that they knew that the pubs

would be shut so they'd brought their own mini pub.

Again they were no trouble I believe DC Hill just had to

warn one of these lads who was getting a bit stroppy, to

calm down, but in general we had no problem whatsoever with
                                                                       nsi IV-
                                                                          v“


                       -    6 -



any of the Mini buses that came.

I counted a total of only 17 Mini buses I expected that we

would be inundated with Mini buses and in the end would be

trying to find places to park them on both sides of the

road but this wasn't so. There were very few and I told

the officers in my serial that if there were late arrivals

with cars rather than send the cars to the ground where

they would cause a problem trying to park down there that

we could start parking a few cars as well on Wardsend Road.

I did infact radio through to the Control room where I spoke

to Sergeant Goddard.        I was in fact in possession of a

radio and informed him that there were very few cars and

buses arriving.   I recall the football special train arriving

I was stood at the end of Wardsend Road I saw the train cross

the bridge over the road,         I would say about 5/6 hundred fans

came off the train,    they walked down from the station, two

mounted officers were infront of them they just held them

for a short time, until they were altogether,         then they went

down Halifax Road towards the ground, again although they were

in high spirits, and were singing I did not see any that

tried to break away,       they followed the officers and went down

towards the ground.




Our brief was to remain at Wardsend Road, until kick off

time or shortly before if there was no other duty to

perform there, but I do recall as late as twenty minutes to
three, young men,    I would think that they were Liverpool

supporters running     up Halifax Road away from the ground

towards a shopping     precinct a short distance   some 20 or 30

yards further up, and obviously they were heading for

the Beer Off and the Supermarket and right up to ten minutes

to three or even later crowds of supporters were still

coming down Halifax Road and the significant thing was

that the amount of     drink they were carrying,   cans of beer,

although we didn't     have any trouble with them it was noticeable

at the time and I'm not just saying this in the aftermath

of what happened it was remarked on that why at this late

time were they going to the ground and having a considerable

amount of drink.     I have gone to football matches all my

life and big matches    I've always gone early, and wound't think

of going for a drink, thinking of being in the ground and

have having drink.     But this certainly struck me and I

related to my own two sons who are in their twenties,         and

every time I go to a football match with them we always

seem to meet in a public house.      But probably this is what

all the youngsters do nowadays,     and it was significant at

the time, and as I've previously say I'm not stating this

in the aftermath of what happened this is a fact and it

was noticed by quite a lot of people.




As we left Wardsend Road we left as a serial,      there were

still people walking down at approximately three o'clock or

just before and I am almost certain that I heard over the
radio as we got towards Claywheels Lane the match,   the

kick off had been postponed,   I was certainly aware of this

and another thing I recall shortly before I recall a

radio message and again I know Sergeant Goddard's voice, he

was in the control room, and I recall a radio message where

Sergeant Goodard in the Control Room was asking other officers

if they had seen the South Yorkshire Transport Liaison Officer

in the vicinity of the Herries Road garage.    I recall this

because he was asking for that officer to contact or at

least if officers were in contact with him to inform him

they had closed Leppings Lane because of the volume of

supporters and that the bus drivers should be informed of this.

We carried on and went and actually turned into Claywheels Lane,

where our brief was to obtain a meal, we had not had a meal

at this time, and as I walked with the serial into Claywheels

Lane I heard over the radio an appeal for officers to go

to the ground as there was some people in Leppings Lane,

trying to get into the ground.    I stopped my serial, told them

to turn round and we walked towards the ground.    I then

met Inspector Charles coming in the opposite direction away

from the ground.   As we met he asked me where I was going

and I told him about the appeal I'd heard over my radio.

We had a discussion,   I recall John Charles saying no our

instructions are to go to Claywheels Lane, and I recall

saying to him we'd check again, you check or I'll check, on

the radio, they want officers at Leppings Lane.    John Charles

did in fact go over the air he was in possession of his own
                          - 9 -



radio and he received the same instruction as me.




John Charles had got the equivalent of about five serials

and the only other officer with him I can recall was

Inspector Bob Meek,    there may have been somebody else I

can't recall,     I can't recall any other Sergeant or Inspector

Ellis or any other Inspector with us,       I can only recall

Inspector Charles,    Inspector Meek and myself, and we took the

serials and I believe we'd got five serials with us up            Leppings

Lane, and we could see then the volume of spectators as

we approached the gates to the ground.        We stopped the

serials at the junction with Veer Road, that's the last road

on the left before you come to the ground.          There was a

lot of traffic over the radio and were trying to ask for

further instructions./ Bob Meek went on ahead to try and

obtain information as a runner and Inspector Charles and I

then lined up the serials in their serials, and told them

not to move,    I looked after the serials while John Charles

was trying to get over on the radio.         I recall telling the

serials to follow Inspector Charles       and I and not to break

rank or move away     and to keep with    their individual   serials

so that we knew where everybody w a s .     I remember that we

doubled up in military style up to the gates of the ground, and

I recall turning round to make sure that everybody was with

us   , although we were winding our way through the crowds

of people, and as we approached the       first   set of big gates

the officers that were there formed       a kind of tunnel for us
                          -1 0    -



go through, and we momentarily stopped there and then an

officer I don8t know who it was,           it wa an officer of Inspector

or Superintendent Rank told us:           "Straight into the ground lads, go

straight into the ground they need some help."            We then went

through the concertina gate, the big blue concertina gate,

as you look at the Leppings Lane entrance it was to the

right hand side.     As we went into the area immediately behind

the stand I could see the tunnel in question that goes under

the main stand at Leppings Lane, there were supporters running

around, Milling around and then I saw both officers and

supporters carrying three people from underneath the tunnel

from the ground.     I am certain that all those three people

were alive, because they were giving them what first aid they

could and I recall forming a circle with the serials that we

had round these people, and saying:           "Look get these supporters

that are getting in the way, get them behind us so that

they can see to these casualties."            I'd no idea that there

was anymore,   it looked like a fainting situation and I'm

certain that these people were alive and we didn't realise

the enormity of the situation in the ground.

Other officers again with supporters came up the tunnel

with some more casaualties,           and I could then see that it was

a more serious situation,        they weren't    just needing their

ties loosening,    or air, the normal fainting situations,        and

three or four more were brought out as I say.            I recall then

a young officer running up the tunnel as they were bringing

some other people and I was stood more or less just inside the

tunnel and he was more or less screaming at me saying:           "Get some men

in here, come and help us, we need help inside as            many as
                                                                         "14-

                            -1 1 -



possible."     I just recall shouting to, or getting hold of

as many chaps as I knew,       I recall getting hold of Steve Cook

who was with me and John Hill and saying:         'Right get them

inside the ground they need us inside the g r o u n d 1 and we went

under the t u n n e l . We pushed our way to the front and as we got

to the front we were then faced with all I can describe is

a pile of bodies       that appeared just stacked on top of

one another to the level of the top of the wall, and several

feet back from the wall.         Officers and spectators alike were

just pulling at these bodies, at this stage I'm sure that

they weren't all dead, and we were just picking a body up,

I can't recall which officer,         and we ran as best we could

up the tunnel, out into the area we'd first come into on

the other side of the stand.          I think I did this something

like, eight,    nine   , ten times, with officers, and spectators,

the first body you picked up you ran out with him, and there

was officers carried on giving assistance I remember that

we tried kiss of life and heart massage on one chap who we

thought was alive for a considerable length of time and then

took him out away as people were falling over us on the

steps of the terrace, and we got him to the back.          As I said

this took place carrying bodies out, as far as I'm concerned

ten times it may have been more, and I can't recall which

officer,   I saw I can remember another Sergeant and I've

just thought of his name over the last day, a Sergeant

Whitelam who used to be at Rotherham,         I can remember carrying

a body with him on a couple of occasions, but the others,

I've no idea who they were.          I remember then that the entrance

to the tunnel appeared to become blocked, and I then

remember Superintendent Greenwood who was on pitch side
                         ■12



of this fence with a megaphone in his hand organising

a chain and the only way to do it was to take the top body

first.   We appeared to be just snatching at an arm, and a leg

and obviously it was trapped.       I remember at first I was

near the gate and there was I'm almost certain a man with

his leg trapped behind the gate support, or his foot, and we

were just standing on him and eventually somebody got him

out and that was preventing us getting through the gate.

Officers were trying to carry bodies through the gate and this

was impossible due to the width of the gate.       I remember

Superintendent Greenwood continually telling them "Form a chain,

form a chain, don't try and come through with the body, don't

try and come through."     We formed    a chain and we got some

assemblance of order,    if you can call it that in this situation

where we did in fact get a chain going.       I don't recall

now whether this came to me afterwards or at the time but

there was a man somewhere along the line screaming about

his daughter at first we tried to shove him away and realised

that he had got somebody there and he went through onto the

pitch.   One of the things that struck me was the colour of

the faces of the victims.      These were purple and you could tell

that they were dead,    there was blue areas on the body which

was obviously pressure and I recall some were frothing through

the nose and mouth,    there was either one, two or possibly more

people there who were obviously Doctors and I remember one

of these chaps saying on several occasions:      "Leave him,    leave

him" obviously he was dead to look for someone else.       I recall

also at this time the only other officer that I did see was

Chief Superintendent Nesbit and he with other officers were
tearing at the fence,     away from the gate some 10 yards away

from the gate, and they actually broke the mesh near to the

top corner and peeled it back, and thinking about it it

was like you peel a sardine tin back, and then he started

saying   . "Pass   'em through."   They ripped the fence out

and that fence was ripped out by hand, by brute force of

several Police Officers and as many others that could. They

ripped it out by hand and we started passing bodies two ways

then.    I remember hearing the sound of an ambulance coming,

which seemed ages, and I thought there was a fleet of them

and there was only o n e .




The orders were being given by Chief Superintendent Nesbit

as best he could trying to organise the men as best he

could, and certainly by Superintendent Greenwood.       My

memory of him it was as if he'd hung himself on the fence near

the gate, and was     just giving the orders to the lads to

pass these bodies in the chain.




The only other Inspector I saw was an Inspector from the

Training Department,     Rob and I forget his second name.

He was there and I believe there was Inspector Sykes there,

I can't recall now who I did see of the officer,       I remember

seeing Bob Gutcher, and several other officers.

    Eventually we got all the bodies from behind the wall, and

    they were on the pitch and were either being tendered to

    by Officers.     St.   John's,    Fire Service,   Oh I recall as we

    were getting a body out I recall that there were signs of life

    in this chap, a young man and we shouted and screamed for

    axygen and the Fire Service came and they got cylinders of

    Oxygen, and they then treat this chap with the oxygen whether

    he was dead or not I don't know.           The majority in that pile

    were dead obviously.        When we'd got the bodies out we remained

    in that enclosure. We hadn't time to think,            I wasn't conscious

    of the spectators around me, and I never gave them a thought,

    but after the bodies had been removed we in that enclosure

    then became very, very conscious of the spectators in the

    seating area above us, and for the first time I became frightened

    and I feared that the anger was going to be vented on us and

    I said:   "There's gonna be trouble,        I can see there's gonna

    be trouble."      They were really angry.         I did in fact speak

    to Chief Superintendent Nesbit and said:            "You know we're gonna

    have trouble here" and he then said          : "Get them out, get the

    Officers out onto the pitch." and I remember saying to

    Steve Cook and John Hill:          "Get those girls out" meaning our

    Police Women and I remember in particular having Police

    Woman Marsh,    Kaz Marsh,       Jill Donnelly,   and Julie Nesbit who

    were all extremely upset and in particular Kaz Marsh who was

    just shaking, and I remember telling Steve Cook and John Hill

    and Kevin Yarrow not to lose the girls,            in any event to look

    after those g i r l s .   John Nesbit then obviously appreciated

    the situation and saw that those fans, they were hurling abuse

at us,   I've got to be honest I didn't see anything thrown

at us, it was the verbal abuse, and you could feel the anger

that was being vented on us, and I don't frighten easily,

I've been in one or two situations,        but I was frightened,    and

I was wondering what we were going to do, whether we were going

to turn and run, because there was a crowd behind u s T h i s

was brought home when one of the Police Photographers Dennis Bond

came and he actually spoke to m e , I never gave it a thought at

that time, he was dressed in Civilian clothes and he came

and the next thing he was virtually surrounded by angry

supporters who were milling on the pitch and came away but

as I walked over I saw another crowd further over to the left

near to the control box surrounding another Police Photographer

I don't know his name,     I found out later his name was Spike,

and officers had to virtually drag him out.         I remember saying

to Dennis Bond in obscene language:        (What the fucking hell

they were doing)     and he told me he said:    "Well We've been asked

to get some photographs by an A.C.C." and I've got to say I

thought that was bloody      stupid, whoever had given him that

order, what the hell did we want photographs for at that

time.    The evidence was there, and they were nearly lynched

through i t .




I can't recall seeing anyone else getting hold of that situation

other than Chief Superintendent Nesbit, and Superintendent

Greenwood and there was a couple of the Inspectors there in

particular      this Inspector Rob and I forget his name from

Training, who I spoke to.         I can't recall any other officer
                         - 16 -



 coining until I saw   the A.C.C. Mr Jackson come. Whether he'd

 been there and I hadn't seen him I don't know, but he was

 the only one when we got all the bodies out.       It was in my

 book,   it was down to John Nesbit,    and Superintendent Greenwood

and all those lads who worked just bloody fantastically.




We then eventually got an order from Chief Superintendent Nesbit

to try and get the spectators off the pitch and to try and

get them from the ground.     Oh,    I'd previously heard an appeal

by   Dagleash which went down very well,      and someone else

said that the Notts Forest Manager Clough had been on the

pitch but we didn't see him.        But another thing that struck

me is that an announcement was made over the Police tannoy

by a Police Officer I presume asking the spectators to

leave, and when he was making it I was worried that that's

when we'd have some real trouble,      but in actual fact they

just went,   certainly out of the seating area, and it was then

that Chief Superintendent Nesbit said:       "Try and get hold of

some blokes and try and coax them all,      let's try and get

 em out and off the pitch" and we did, and they went there

was no trouble we didn't have to even speak to anybody

sharply,   they went and I didn't experience any trouble

until we saw one tall Liverpool supporter in a blue shirt

and I actually heard him saying:      "We ought to have a riot."

he said that a couple of times,      I think it would have bee*/

foolish to try and apprehend him or anything,      but when we

did go and speak to him some of his own supporters got hold

of him, probably he was so upset obviously he was angry and

one can understand that but he did in fact listen to his own
                        -   17 -



mates who we spoke to as well, and they went and I didn't

see him again.




I don't know what time it was but we eventually went and

were told to go back into the stand where the briefing earlier

had taken place.   I remember asking a Chief Inspector Beal

if anyone had thought to inform the Divisions that no Police

Officers were involved in any injuries or tragedy.      He went

away and came back and announced to the officers that were

there that this had been done,     they were doing it and that

provisions were being made for us to go to Claywheels Lane.




We were directed to Claywheels Lane where I saw Superintendent

Braum   of the Traffic Division.     I informed him that the

majority of Rotherham Officers had been involved in the

removal of bodies from the terrace,     and that I thought they

ought to be taken back to Rotherham.      Again he was very good

I don't know where he got the bus from or buses but he

certainly got some buses, he told me that he would provide

drivers to take any officer home who couldn't drive, and we

were more or less bused away back to Rotherham.

         It's very hard to describe the horredous scenes it's alright

         three days later being able to talk about it and I have said

         that's what we get paid for but I've seen the effects on

         the Detectives that I've worked with,       I saw the effect on

         Kev Yarrow,    Steve Cook, who at work can handle any situation

         but I saw the effect of that.        I didn't see John Charles again

         I know he got tied up in the gymnasium,       it was an horrific

         experience,    in 31 years on the Police I never thought that

         I would witness the horrific scenes that we did meet on entering

         the ground.     I would like to say that every bobby that I worked

         with gave everything he'd got, did everything he had to do,

         and made me after 31 years doubly proud that I became a

         copper and I know that the more I think about it,       I thought

         of young lads probably some with only one or two years in

         and I looked at them thinking although my sons aren't on the

         job they're my sons age and what a bloody marvelous        job,

         and also the Police Women.       Those Police women were absolutely

         terrific.     Obviously criticisms will be levelled at us

         and I'm sure we can take that, and I'm sure that the majority

         of officers can level criticisms back but at this stage it'll

         do no good whatsoever.     The main topic of conversation since

         Saturday has been that there was no command structure other

         than Chief Superintendent Nesbit, and Superintendent Greenwood,

         and I think that has got to be looked into and some questions

         asked there,   someone other than that,     there should have been

         three or four Superintendents at that end and whatever Senior

         Rank was at the ground should have been at that end of the

         ground,   that's where it was happening,     it wasn't happening on

         Pennistone Road, or anywhere else on the ground,       and t h a t 1s my
main feelings and criticism.   Thank God that Nesbit was

there and thank God in particular and I admire the man and I

don't know him from Adam,   Superintendent Greenwood was there

hanging on his fence.

               Liverpooi             fans.

               At about             11.3 0 a m         (1130)     with     the above        officers      I took    up    position

               The     turnstiles                  ope n e d   sometime      after     12 o'clock         <"iS00) and as a group

               in general                  giving        them advice        and directing           them to the       turnstiles        to

             which       their    ticket       was allocated.

             As    the a f t e r n o o n went        on    it became        clear       that    some    of    the fans       had

             a r r i v e d without       tickets          and they were           i n structed to        leave       the area to

             avoid       congestion.

             At    no time       during       this    exercise        did we form a human barrier                       in order

             to search every a r r i v i n g               fan,    it was more           or    less    left    to each

             individual          team    to select          at    random        fans    for    searching.         To    cordon

             off       the area      and search every fan w o u l d have                       been a mass i v e task.                 In

             fact a s i t g o t c 1o s e r t o X he k i c k o f f t he re wa s a n                      i n c r e a s e in

             a r r i v a l s and s e a r c h i n g    became       virtually           impossible.

             I can       recall    that       spare       tickets were           handed       to myself and members                    of

             my team and they                in turn were          ha n d e d    to fans without             tickets       and     I

             might       acid that      these were          selective,           one man with a young                boy     comes

             to mind,,        Overall         there was          little     problem on this             date and whilst                 it

             was       extremely       busy    the    fans were         inside         the ground at          kick     off    or

             just after          and    on    compl e t i o n of      this       duty    I,    together       with the other

             officers,        took      up a p o s i tion         in the L e p p i n g s Lane          stand during           the

             match.

             I can say on            this     date    the volume of fans was                   less     ana more well

             behaved       than      this year.

               Main Street Police Station Rotherham.




               On Saturday 9th April 1988 I was on uniform duty at the F.A. Cup
               Semi - Final Tie between Liverpool and Nottin^iam Forest FC at the
               Hillsborough Stadium.

               On that date I was briefed to be in charge of a group of officers to
               be engaged in Leppings Lane to carry out searches of fans arriving with

               a view to finding offensive weapons , banners,, alcohol etc}

               I can remember that deployed with me were:

               Detective Constable Hobson.
               Detective Constable Shelton.

               Detective Constable Hubbard.

               Police Constable Nesbit.

               On this day the Leppings Lane end of the ground was designated to the

               Liverpool fans.

               At about 11.30am with the above officers I took up position with the
               above mentioned officers prior to the entrance gates and turnstiles,

               close to the bridge in Leppings Lane.

               The turnstiles opened sometime after 12 o ’clock and as g   a group we
               carried out our designated duties of searching arriving fans and in

               general giving them advise and directing them to the turnstiles to which

               their ticket was allocated.
               As the afternoon went on it became clear that some of the fans had arrived

               without tickets and they were instructed to leave the area to avoid

               congestion.
               At no time during this excercise did we form a human barrier in order to
               search every arriving fan, it was more or less left to each individual
        select^         _                       ______   ___   _ _             ..   _
team to esist at random fans for searching. To cordon off the area and
search every fan would have been a massive task. In fact as it got closer

to the kick off there was an increase in arrivals and searching became

virtually impossible.

I can recall that spare tickets were handed to myself and members of my team

and they in turn were handed to fans without tickets and I might add that

these were selective ,one man with a young boy comes to mind.

Overall there was little problem on this date and whilst it was
extremely   busy the fans were inside the   ground at kick - off orjust

after and   on completion of this duty I,   togehter'with the other officers               j

took up a   position in the Leppings Lane   stand during the match.

I can say on this date the volume of fans were less and more well

behaved than this year.     '

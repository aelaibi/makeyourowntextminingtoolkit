                      representations to submit but we have already submitted Memoranda to the Attorney
                      General seeking a new inquest. I understand that Sir Malcolm Thornton, formerly the

                      passed on to your “Scrutiny”. Could you please let us know whether or not you have
                      them so that we in turn can decide on the nature o f the representations to be
                      submitted.

HILLSBOROUGH - MRS A W ILLIAMS




Thank you for your letter of 29 July on behalf of Mrs A Williams oi
I am sorry not to have replied before.

2.      You mention memoranda seeking a new inquest which you submitted to the Attorney-
General. We have extensive material of this kind which was submitted to the Attorney in
1992 concerning the deaths of Mrs Williams’s son Kevin and five other people. But we
understand from the Attorney’s office that they received a further such memorandum early
last year in respect of Kevin Williams only and I assume that this is the material you are
referring to.                                                  -

3.      The Attorney-General’s office are currently searching for this further memorandum,
but as things stand Lord Justice Stuart-Smith does not have it and I would suggest that you
prepare your representations on that basis.

4.        I hope this information is helpful.

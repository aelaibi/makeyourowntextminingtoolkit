                I am a Liverpool            supporter and have been for a number of years,

               On Saturday 15 April               1989,   I Attended the Semi Final at Hillsborough,

                I had a ticket for the ma'fc'Ch which I bought on the day in Sheffield.

                the morning of the match I travelled up to Sheffield by train I

                caught that from Manchester.                  I travelled with some frxends who d o n ’t

               wish me to give their names.

               The train left at about                12.30pm on time and arrived at Sheffield city

               at 3Nbout 2pm. We then caught a bus to the g r o u n d \

               When we\came out of the station we were ushered on to the bus by

                police everything was fine a good atmosphere.

               We arrived at the ground at about 2.20pm.                       The crowds w e r e n ’t too bad

            at the entranceVthen,     but I hadn't got a ticket so we went up to the

            b u s \iark I was abVp to get one and we went back getting there at about

 S©.£,      2.50p)*.     It was packed out at the entrance then it was beyond the

  U_L_      metal gavtes and into the road it was as full as in the ground you

            couldn't move.

            There were police about telling people to move back but there wasn't

            enough to control the'Nmmbers. I only^^aw two on horseback the horses
   A-r
 u u        were spinning and scattering the crowds they then tried to close the

            metal    perimeter railed gates.     I just got through as they were closing

            them,    the crowds were solid.     It was bad outside it felt worse than

            the Hop.

            I was trying to keep to the right to save getting pinned to the wall.

            I was going to stand round the side aTrni^wait till       it had died

              wn as I got to the right of the t u r n s t i l e ^ I saw the concentina

            gat£s were open.      I was one      the first there they were still      pushing

 oprre.     it open as I got there.      It was <=T policeman opening it there
  o
            were stewards standing about?       it must have been a couple of minutes
 CXOK/j)
  thl       before I could^hear \ h e   crowd cheering.

            The crowd around        ailment    through the gate,   I went through as well

            and the crowd massed in behind continious o n ce inside the gate I saw

            the tunnel     in front it was the obvious place to go I still had my

            ticket     in fact it was not asked for.

            I had got sp\Lit from my mates by now and went towards the tunnel

            people were coming out sweating and looking distressed.

TUstbl&L-   Inside the tunnel Kl wasn't too bad I got to the terracing end ok I

            made about five stepsT^em to the terrace which was packed.         Then

            without warning my feet w e V ^ o f f   the floor and I was pushed forward

5c^2j€3     from point Hi to point E7 wijN^h^ut being able to do anything,          it felt
  IN
Ct^OND      as if I was rolling;     I lost my feet my feet touched the floor and

            regained my balance.      I had been trapped against a barrier but had
                                                                                     PAGE      3

managed to make my way around                it.

After the first push I didn't                realise anyone had     been injured.     People

were just packed together it continued the pressure just built up and

people began shouting at the police.I was hossled and managed to work

my way to the front perimeter                gate as    I got a foot away from everyone

was jammed it was open but no                one could get out,     the police were

trying to pull people out but they were just entwined and packed so

tightly to§ether\they couldn't.

I couldn't s€N*\down\&ut could feel bodies arms or legs beneath me I

was caught by a body beneath and couldn't move.                     I was stuck from 3.

20pm till 3.30pm in that position the police were trying to pull me

out.    They coul4n't move me until about 3.30pm and it seemed to

        from b e h i n d s o m e o n e   pulled the lad off my back and I was able to

be pulled free I was pulled over the top of the fence onto the pitch

by the police.         ^V=r                                             C*£-

As it broke from behind and I was pulled clear the only way I can

describe     it is as a blizzard of people against the front wall all on


                                                                  aft
                                                                                    It was

awful there people everywhere                  .was looked after by a policewoman for

I think the problems could have been avoided,                   had the organisation

outside the ground been better.                    Even if the queues had been quarter

            ’( of a mile long there should havNs been two queues.

              When we got inside the ground the ^*pl ice should have known the pens

              behind the goal were full               directed us to the sides.   There were no
G0MH6J15 police          or stewards on the t urhft© 1 entrance.    This should have been done

              before the^gate was opened.

FboTfc/YLU The F -AV *hou^i have allocated more tickets to the Liverpool
^SSOCjAncWsupporters\they have a much bigger following?               I tried to get a ticket
'C £ m c i 5 < 5 - -------------
                  at Liverpool     but couldn't so I travelled in the hope of getting one

              which I did.         There    is such an interest people will go and try and buy

              tickets.

              To just clarify paragraph 1 page 4 I was actually stuck solid from

              3.05pm everyone was stuck no one could move it was between 3.20pm and

              3.30pm the police were trying to pull me and it was starting to clear

              behind.                      (sgd)

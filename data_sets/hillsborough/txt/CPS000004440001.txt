   Dear Mr Kennedy

   I enclose statements from Chief Superintendent Mole and Chief
   Superintendent Denton, South Yorkshire Police, which cover the areas we
   discussed at the meeting on Friday 20 April 1990.

   Detective Superintendent Taylor is pursuing the B0WNES statement and once
   that is received it will be forwarded.

   The statements enclosed are numbered for insertion in the relevant part of
   the file, Chief Superintendent Mole in Part II and Chief Superintendent
   Denton in Part V. Amended alphabetical witness lists are included with
   the statements to insert in each Part.

   Yours sincerely




  M J FOSTER

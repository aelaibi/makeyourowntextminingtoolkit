The    journey           North          took       approximately                       2    hours,          & we    arrived          in

Sheffield           at       12    noon       (1200).               Our       Club          was       met    by P o l i c e      Officers                at

the    Station           & we          were    taken          by       bus     to          the    Football          Ground.

I never        saw       any       disorder             or    drinking                 on       the    20    minute        drive       to       t he

ground.

As    we    neared           the       stadium          I noticed              Police             Officers          were        present             on

most       road     junctions,                just       standing              around.

There       was     no       particular             problems              everything                   was       good     humoured.

approximately                 1300       hours          (1300),           &    had          free       passage          through        into          the

                    increased               from          in    front          of     me      forcing          the          barrier             hard          up       against              my

                   two       members             of       our    supporters                   club       climbing                   into       Pen       2.        1 decided                 to

                   &    this          together             with       the       natural                sway    of          the          crowd       assisted                me

                   just          as    great          &    I started                to     climb         up    the          fence             in a n      effort A o

                   which          was       comparatively                      clear          of       supporters                   &    I    recovered                sufficiently

                   to    get          my    breath             back.           1 found             some       Club          members             & went             in       search           of,

During       the        time    I was       in     Pen       3, 1 n e w ? r w L t n e s s e d                  the    barrier               breaking.

My    injuries           consisted          of     my    leg (jffinor 8(ru1)sTng)                              (do    not       know        which

one)     was      trapped        as       I climbed           the       fence       &       I had          general          discomfort

around       my     chest.           I did       not     attend          hospital.                    The       discomfort              only

lasted       a    few     days.

I    later       went     onto       the    pitch        to       see    if       I could             assist          any        other          injured

fans.        I saw        one    man       lying        in    front          of    the          penalty          spot.            he    was

white,       5*11"        tall,       very       well        built       &    had       a       large          stomach,           he    was

wearing,          blue     jeans,          bare     chested.                 He    was          being          given       mouth        to       mouth

by a     woman.           I c a n ’t       recall        whether             she    was          Police          or    ambulance.

After       about       a minute           she     stopped          &    covered                the       mans       face       with        a    dark

\peice      of    clothing           or    blanket.               I then          found/ a            young          lad    of about                 16 —

He    was    lying        on    his       back     in    the p e n a l t y a r e a               struggling                 to    get       his

breath       &    in a     lot       of    pain.         Myself          <y                      took          hold    of        him    &

assisted          him     to    the       opposite           endVs/          the    pitch             &    under       t he       North          Stand.

We    handed       him     over       to    St     John       Ambulance             Brigade.                    On    our       way     back,          the

Forest       fans       were     chanting           obscenities                   towards             us.        I do       not        think          they

knew     what      had     taken          place     at       this       stage.              On    returning                to     the       Leppings

Lane     End      Police        Officers           requested             we       clear          the       pitch       area.

myself       then        went    &    sat    in     the       North          Stand          until          such       times        as       we

heard       an    announcement              to     leave          the    ground             in a n         orderly          fashion              &    to

allow       emerge ncy          v e h i c 1 e 5s    presidence.

1 would          say     the    main       factor        in       the    deaths             &    injuries             was        the    crushing

in    the    central           pen    area       due     to       too    many       fans          being          there.

I eventually              left       the    ground           at    about          1630          hours          (1630)       having              heard

the    announcement.

I never          witnessed           anything           which       I consider                   to       be    a Criminal

offence          b ut    myself       & another              fan    were          attacked                after       the        game       outside

             tha    ground       on     the       ijroute to        the       station       fay N o t t i n g h a m      Forest         fans.           I

             was    headbutted              p u n c h e d         but    nothing       which caused               me    any      great

             d i s c o m f o r t .I iatar          saw       a    Police       Officer          in t h e    street        bya     Police            van,

             They    stated          th e    best       thing       to    do    would       be    to    take       our    colours         off       &

             they    allowed          us     to    change          behind       the    Police          van.        I do    not      wish       to

             pursue       the    matter           as    I was       not       seriously          injured.

             My    views    &    observations                    after    the    match          was    stopped /re,              that     no    one

             knew    what       to    do.         The       Police       appeared          not    to    know/what          to     do.      I feel

             they    initially              treated          it    as    trouble       at       the    ground       not    realising            until

             later    what       a    tragedy           had       taken       place,

             * would       also       like        to    add       that    Police ^uts/ue                   the    ground        s h o u l d have

             been    checking           fans       outside          the       ground       to    ensure          they    were      in

             possession          of     tickets.

             This    did    not       appear           to    happen,           There       should       have       been    stewards            in

             Leppings       Lane,           directing             fans    where       to    go.

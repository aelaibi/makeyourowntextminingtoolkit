   INTRODUCTION

  1.1   The Hil lsb or ou gh Team came into e x is te nc e in July 1989.
        It was set up to provide a m e d i u m to long term response
        to the Hills borou gh Disaster.

  1.2    The t ea m' s establis hm en t was 12 Social Work er s and 2
          Senior Social Workers. The fourteen posts-i'permanent to
          the department/ even though it was a n ti ci pa te d the team
          would only exist for 2 years.

  1.3    This report and its a p p en d ic e s illustrate what the team
          have d on e since it ince ption and what it feels the
          future   response to  H il ls bo r ou g h and  related  issues
          should be.

  1.4    This     report  cqp&efitrates upon the social work team.
         M e nt io n is made of the H i l l s b o ro u gh Centre, but members
         will see that in many ways the Centre and team are two
          sepa ra te entities.

       d is a st e r (-and had, largely, no prior contact with the
       S S D . It was a n t ic i pa t ed that this was a trend which
       could continue.

  2.2     The     t ea m were aware of the value and importance of
          t ra d it i o n a l social work   methods.     However  they  were
          equa ll y aware that social w o r k has a poor public image
          both n a ti on al ly and loca ll y w h i ch might have made people
          re lu c ta n t to utilise the t eam's service.

  2.3    C o n s e q u e n t l y the team felt that it had to provide its
          s e rv i c e s in a way that w ou ld make it attr ac ti ve to the
        p ub l ic generally. A spin off from this was to give a more
          p os i ti v e       image of the City C ou nc il 's Social Services
          Department.

  2.4     The   t ea m have t h er ef or e used              a   v ar ie ty   of    means   to
           'advertise' what it provides.

M embers will be a ware that suit ab le a c c o m o d a t i o n is a
p r o b l e m for the SSD.- Wh i ls t the H i l l s b o r o u g h C en tr e is
by no m e an s spa ci o us and at times is b a re l y s u ff i c i e n t
for its purpose, it does p r o v i d e an a d d i t i o n a l r es o ur c e
w hi ch is avai la bl e for use both by the SSD and the
local community.

The C e nt re has b een and c o n t i n u e s to be used by m e mb e r s
of the d e p a r t m e n t as a s u i t a bl e v enue for a c ce ss and
some in house d e v e l o p m e n t and training.

Its e q u i p m e n t and       resources          are   a v a i la b le    for   use    by
the d epartment .

The C e n t r e is a lso used                 by    a    range     of      groups   from
o ut si de the d epartm en t.

The  Friends   of   S ta n l e y P a r k meet r e g u l a r l y in                      the
Centre.  They   are    a group         of  local p e op l e who                         are
seeking to c onserve and r e g e n e r a t e S ta n le y Park.

The s ec on d m e n t of a y ou th w o r k e r to the team had led to
the C e n t r e being used as a venue and base for a n um be r
of y o u th w o rk a ctiv it ie s.

Links w i t h the A lde r C e nt re (a c entre p r o v i d i n g s up po rt
for b e r e a v e d parents ) are leading to the C e nt r e being
used as a venue for some of their activities.

A g rou p of v ic ti ms of s ex ua l abuse, who o r i g i n a l l y met
t hr ou gh a group run by two w or k er s from the d e p a r t m e n t
has now b ec om e a self h el p group. They are p l a n n i n g to
meet m o n t h l y from O c t o b e r in the centre.

A C ar er s g r ou p b a s e d in the N orth End of the C it y                          are
to meet r e g u l a r l y in the c e nt r e also from October.

All of the above have i n d i c a t e d to the t ea m that the
l o cati on of the C e nt r e has helped to fill a large gap
in a ctual p h y s ic al r e s o u r c e s in the North End of the
City.

No staff time has b een i n v o l v e d in m ee t in g any of these
needs.         M a n y of these g r o u p s meet o ut s id e of normal
hours,         the g ro up s are t h e r e f o r e g i v e n free a c ce s s to
the b u i l d i n g and its f a ci li ti es . In over one y ea r of
o p e r a t i o n this has not p r e s e n t e d a ny s e c u r i t y problems,

  5.1.   The Major brief of the H i l l s b o r o u g h T e a m has always
         been     to pr ov id e social w o r k supp or t   for all those
         e f fect ed by the disaster.

  5.2    The past year and                a half h as seen a n um be r of                  key
         events which have                d i r e c t l y r e qu ir ed input from          the
         team.

5.2.1    The start of the 1989-90 f oo tb al l season, Live rp oo l' s
         F.C. r et ur n to H i l l s b o r o u g h in N o v e m be r 1989, Chri st ma s
         1989, the first anniversary, the i nq u es t s and the test
         cases (planned) regarding c o m p e n s a t i o n have all required
         a s o c i a l ' w o r k res po n se and pres en ce .

5.2.2    Other inc id en ts and events have s e rv ed as t ri gg er s for
         peoples' distress^ a T.V. d o c u m e n t a r y in F e b r u ar y 1990,
         the d e c i s i o n by the DPP not to p r o s e c u t e toget he r with
         other          significant    ann i ve r sa r ie s , d a t es and other
         p u b l i c i s e d disasters. None of w hi ch it was p o ss ib le to
         truly predict.

  5.3    This has g one a l o ng s id e           and    i nc re a se d   the   day   to   day
         work of the team.

5.3.1    No amount of therapy, h o we v e r skillful, can take away
         the p ain of H i l l s b o r o u g h or b ring b a c k a lost child or
         partner.

5 .3.2   Social w o r k e r s on -the t ea m are d a i l y involved with
         helping v ic t i m s of the d i s a s t e r to come to terms with
         what has h a p p en ed to them. I n c r e a s i n g l y it has resulted
         in w o rk b eing done with m e m b e r s of e x t e n d e d families,

          "Staying w it h q u e st io ns w h i c h have no a n s w e r s " .

5.3.3    W or k e r s use a wide range of t e c h n i q u e s and s kills in
         their u n d e r t a k i n g    of this task. Traditional                 social

    b)     The Future
   5.4     Pred ic ti ng   future     of      Hillsborough         related     n eeds is
           difficult.      No d e d i c a t e d d i s a s t e r t e a m has    continued
           b ey on d 18 m on th s post disaster.

   5.5      It is k nown that s e e m i n g l y i n n o c uo u s e v e n t s can t ri gg er

   5.7     The     recent    decision of    the   DPP     w il l require     the
           r e - op en in g of the inqu es ts at an as yet undecided,
           future date. This w ill have m a j or i m p l i c a t i o n s for the
           t eam in terms of the d em a nd s m ad e u p o n it.

   5.8     To date all of the tealms w o r k has b e e n very d e m a nd i ng
           in terms of staff time and c o m m i t m en t . This has b e e n a
           necessity. Ho we ve r it is h oped that p a r t of any future
           w or k will be to e n c o ur a ge a move t o w a r d s self help
           skills. This will h ow e v e r d e m a n d input f ro m the t ea m in
           terms of tra in in g and support.

   5.9     A sad fact         of life      is that a f u t u r e d i s a s te r will
           occur.       The   team    have   developed    certain       s kills     in
           r e s po nd in g to disas te rs . T he y have p a r t i c i p a t e d in a

           authorities.

       \   It is l ikely that any future d i s a s t e r s may result in
           r e q u e st s for the H i l l s b o r o u g h t ea m to provide some

         Briefly, h ow ev er the m a jo r input in this area of work has
         b e e n where death has o cc ur ed s u dd e n l y and v i o l e n t l y (eg
         murder),     w h er e an injury   has been c au se d   s u d d e nl y and

         of the n eeds of c h i l d r e n and young people.

5.11.3   In a d d i t i o n the team has twice been r e q u e s t e d           to r es po nd to
         v i ol e n t      inc id en ts o c cu r i n g in     the                 department's
         establishments.

    b)   The future

  5.12   The n umber of r e f e r r a l s in this area is an i n d i c a t i o n that
         t here is a c o n s i d e r a b l e g a p in t ra u ma t ic w o r k gen er al ly .

J.12.1   In the same way that H i l l s b o r o u g h r el a te d w o r k           is a m ajor
         p i e c e of p r e v e n t a t i v e m ent al h ealth work,  so            too is the
         m o re g en e r a l trauma work.

5.12.2   All      districts        and   h o s p it a l   teams      have     the    skills        to
         u n d e r t a k e this work. H ow e v e r they do not have the capacity,
         b ec a u s e of the s t a t u t o r y and service d e l i v e r y nature of
         t heir work. Also the a p p r o a c h of the H i l l s b o r o u g h Team,
         w h e r e b y u s e r s are m ade p o s i t i v e l y w e lc o m e and e n co u r a g e d to
         u t i l i s e their s e r v i c e s m akes people more p r o n e to seek
         t heir s upport rather than the d e p a r t m e n t s o t h e r field work
         teams.

5.12.3   If m em b e r s feel it to be appropriate, this is an area of
         w o r k the team w ould like to d e ve l o p in the future. Use of
         s ki ll s       developed   t hr o u g h    the  department's     r e sp on se to
         H il ls b o r o u g h , can   thus       be   used  in a p o s i t i v e  way  to
         c o n t r i b u t e towards the w el l b e i n g of the C it y g enerally.

  5.13   As well as u n d e r t a k i n g d ir ec t w or k in this area, the teams
         s k i l l s can, and ought, to be shared with o t he r groups of
         staff.        This  will    i nvolv e    the team in u n d e r t a k i n g some
         t r a i ni n g initiatives.

         S o u r c e of W or k

   6.1   Work   referred   to the team has come                        from a v ar ie ty of
         sources. A full b r e a k d o w n of r e fe rr al             a g e n t s is cont ai ne d
          in ( AP PENDIX^.

   6.2   It is of note that the m ajor source                        of   referrals       (       %)
          h a v e b een f rom family or f r i e n d s ,

   6.3   Clearly            therefore         the  team       have   b ee n s u c c e sf u l      in
          e n c o u r a g i n g m em b e r s of the p u bl i c to r efer to them.

   6.4   -In the c as e of H i l l s b o r o u g h w or k this is u n d e r s t a n d a b l e
          b e a r i n g in m ind the p u b l i c i t y the team have received. But
          19 r e f e r r a l s of the 45 non H i l l s b o r o u g h h av e also been
          either        self   r e f e rr al or     r ef e rr a l through  family        and
          friends.

                                                                              contd

   6.5   T hese        f igures do ind ic a te that even w i t h o u t a dv er tising,
         m e m b e r s of the public feel that the H i l l s b o r o u g h T ea m can
         o ff er        a s er vi ce to p e o p l e other t ha n t hose d i r e c tl y

         Size of F ut ur e Team

   7.1   The p re s e n t e s t a b l i s h m e n t of the team          is   12    Soci al    W or k
         p o s ts and two Senior S o c i a l Workers.

7.1.1    T here are in a d d i ti on 3 a d m i n i s t r a t i v e      and c l e r i c a l staff,
         1 s cale       5 a d m i n officer,   1 scale 1                c l e r k / t y p i s t and 1
         M e r s e y Temp.

  7.2    It      is      anticipated  that         the     d em an ds     upon       the    team's
         r e s o u r c e s will diminish.

 7.2.1   In     the        light      of  this     it    is     proposed     to  redu ce     the
;        e s t a b l i s h m e n t to 6 S o c i a l W o rk e r s and 1 T e a m M a na g e r with

         l oo ks at C l e r i c a l Su pp or t in g r ea t e r depth).

  7.3    It is          hoped that some of the input from o t h e r d i s c i p l in e s
         may       be     allowed         to   continue      (e.g. Y o u t h Worker,          E.W.O,

  8.1    The w o r k of the team has been all e m br ac in g. W o r k e r s have
         m i r r o r e d the e m oti ons e x p r e s s e d by v ic t im s . The effects
         upon        staff     have b ee n both        physically     and    emotionally
         d ra in in g, w h i l s t at the same time b eing s t i m u l a t i n g and
         c h a l l e n gi n g.

  8.2    G i v e n that it is p r o p o s e d to r ed uc e the size of the team,
         c o n s i d e r t i o n n eeds to be g iv en to the i m p l i c a t i o n s this has
         for staff.

  8.3    Some staff will need to move to a p o s i t i o n e i t h e r w it hi n or

8.3.1    For staff m o v i ng w i t h i n the d e pa rt me nt , p r e p a r a t i o n needs
         to be u n d e r t a k e n both witzh them and t heir f ut ur e sections.

8.3.2    All staff on the team will need                   some    support         and   training
         to m o v e into n ew areas of work.

  8.4    No one can ever lose s ight of the H i l l s b o r o u g h Disaster.
         N e v e r t h e l e s s for the e m o t io n al and p h y s i c a l well being of

3.    WORK WITH CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE

    As t h i s i s the f ocus of C hi l d r e n ' s S o c i e t y work, and a l a r g e part o f our
involvement h e r e , s ub- headings are a p p r o p r i a t e.

    The need to pay p a r t i c u l a r a t t e n t i o n to t h i s i s s u e was always apparent,
but was from our p o i n t o f view cent re s t a g e by August 1989.

INDIVIDUAL WORK

       By l a t e August s o c i a l workers were beginning t o i d e n t i f y y o u n g s t e r s in
f a m i l i e s who were g iv i n g some concern, s i m i l a r l y some s c h o o l s were c o n t ac t i n g
us f o r support and guidance,;

       I n i t i a l hel p was on an i n d i v i du a l b a s i s , some l i m i t e d d i r e c t work was
undertaken o v er t he f o l l o w i n g 3 months wit h young p eo p l e who could at t end the
Centre.           I n c r e a s i n g l y advice and c on s ul t a n c y was sought by workers from o t h e r
a u t h o r i t i e s and o r g a n i s a t i o n s . The l a t t e r led t o t h e e s t a b l i s h m e n t o f
monthly s t a f f development seminars, based in the C e n t re ,                           f oc u s se d on i s s u e s
o f trauma and bereavement as t hey p a r t i c u l a r l y a f f e c t e d c h i l d r e n and young
peopl e. These s e s s i o n s at t ended on a m u l t i - d i s c i p l i n a r y , pan-Merseyside basis
c o n s i s t e n t l y a t t r a c t e d 20 plus workers.

GROUP WORK

       As r e f e r a l r e q u e s t s f o r d i r e c t work i n c r e a s e d , to a p o i n t in November
where 14 young p e o p l e , aged 14-17 y e a r s , were i d e n t i f i a b l e , a d e c i s i o n was
made t o begin a Young P e o p l e ' s Group based a t the Cent re.                           With t he co- operat i on
and support o f c o l l e a g u e s on t he team a beginning was made in December 1989.
O r i g i n a l l y t he group members came c h i e f l y from Liverpool (2 from C h e s h i r e ) ,
and met on a f o r t n i g h t l y b a s i s . The nat ure of the group has changed c o ns i dera bl y
over t he peri od o f t i me, i n c l u d i ng in many f r i e n d s and r e l a t i o n s , as well as
encompassing j o i n t a c t i v i t y wit h a r e c e n t l y e s t a b l i s h e d group in Cheshire.
The group c o n t i n u e s to meet and plan a c t i v i t i e s from t h e Centre.

FAMILY / COMMUNITY WORK

       Where we have paid p a r t i c u l a r a t t e n t i o n to t h e needs o f c h i l d r e n and
young p e o p l e , indeed attempted to o f f e r them a p a r t i c u l a r v o i c e , i t has always
been done in t he c l e a r acknowledgement o f f a m i l y and community ( p e e r s ,
s c h o o l , y o u t h cl ub e t c . ) .

       Examples are t he c o - o p e r a t i o n wit h the Family Support Group in
o r g a n i s i n g day t r i p s f o r bereaved and s u r v i v o r s ' f a m i l i e s .   These have been
popul ar, p a r t i c u l a r l y f o r t h o s e f a m i l i e s with c h i l d r e n , as evidenced by the
153 people who r e c e n t l y v i s i t e d a theme part in D e r b y s hi r e .             Such a c t i v i t i e s
are open to a l l , and bring many from Merseyside and beyond in c o n t a c t with the
Centre f o r t h e f i r s t time.

       Another i s t he c o n s i d e r a b l e support o f f e r e d by the Centre t o the young
p e o p l e o f C a s t l e f i e l d s Youth Centre, Runcorn, in o r g a n i s i n g t h e i r own
S e r v i c e and Memorial Day on 19th April 1990. This day was attended by over
300 p e o p l e , t he v a s t m a j or i t y young people ( i n c l u d i n g a coach from the Centre),
anh nwrkpd a s i g n i f i c a n t c o n t r i b u t i o n to t h e i r community, "as well as the
OUTREACH

    Mention i s made o f t h i s wit h s p e c i f i c r e f e r e n c e t o work o u t s i d e the
Merseyside regi on.

       There has been c l e a r i n d i c a t i o n from some f a m i l i e s , t h a t d i r e c t c o n t a c t
from the Centre i s t h e i r p r e f er e d means o f support.                    In a n e c e s s a r i l y l i m i t e d
form some v i s i t s have been undertaken, and r e c i p r o c a l v i s i t s t o the Centre
r e s u l t e d , t i me , t r a v e l and f i n a n c e p e r m i t t i n g . Requests by outposted
workers f o r support have been in the main by phone, or l e t t e r .

    Outreach groups have been e s t a b l i s h e d . The South Cheshire / North Midlands
Group meets r e g u l a r l y at Knutsford, and has an e s t a b l i s h e d membership. In
May the Central and South Midlands Group had a s u c c e s s f u l inaugural meeting
in Nuneaton, Warwicks. These groups r e l v on the Centre f o r t h e i r support
and inf ormat i on.

     Likewise v i s i t s t o i n d i v i d u a l young p eo p l e o u t s i d e Merseysi de cannot
be s u s t a i n e d . In an attempt t o o f f - s e t t h i s lack o f a v a i l a b l e support a
t ype o f pen-pal scheme has been o p e r a t i o n a l , with i n d i v i d u a l s encouraged to
maint ain c o n t a c t w i t h one ano t he r by l e t t e r and phone.


CONCLUSION

       In c o n c l u s i o n , i t would be i mp o s s i bl e when r e f l e c t i n g on our involvement
a t the Centre to s ee i t as anyt hi ng but the f ocus f o r Hi l l sb o r o u g h work.

Kevin Williams

I have carefully considered the application for my fiat for a new inquest. The events
in question remain appalling even at this distance in time.

However, sympathy for the position o f Mrs Williams is not enough to justify a new
inquest 16 years after the events in question. I agree therefore with your
recommendation

Essentially there has already been an adequate examination o f the case of the death of
Kevin in the combination o f the mini and full inquest and the Taylor inquiry and the
Stuart Smith scrutiny o f evidence which dealt fully with the issues concerning the
principal point o f the time o f death of Kevin and the evidence o f PC Bruder and SPC
Martin. He held that there was no reason to grant another inquest and my
predecessors have three times taken the same view. The judicial determination on the
judicial review is also very relevant.

The interests o f justice would not served by requiring another inquest.

The proper interpretation o f Hurst is interesting and thank you for your analysis. But
at the end o f the day - and until the House of Lords says otherwise - McKerr stands
for the proposition that the HRA is not retrospective and therefore if there were an
inadequate examination (contrary to my starting point) the Act cannot be used to
order a new inquest.

Given the prospect o f JR you will need to be careful in the way that my decision is
expressed. If necessary use Counsel to assist as the case may go further

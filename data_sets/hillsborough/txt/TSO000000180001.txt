Dear Sirs,

                    Re: Hillsborough Stadium Disaster Inquiry

    The Solicitors for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club have indicated to me
that if there is to be disclosure of "Salmon" letters it should be on a mutual
basis i.e. each party who has had a Salmon letter should be given copies of all
such letters indeed to other parties.

                                  Yours faithfully,




                                  for the Treasury Solicitor

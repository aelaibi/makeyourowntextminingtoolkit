    From:              Chief Superintendent Wain                Station/Dept:    'C' Division

            SUBJECT:         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER CONTRIBUTION HEARINGS
                             - contested elements of the Taylor Reports



                       The Taylor Reports (in full) have now been considered by Chief
                       Superintendent Mole, Superintendent Bettison and myself. We draw
                       attention to just six areas of the Taylor Interim Report which
                       might be contested and which have either -

                       a) Not yet been underscored by Counsel or Hammond Suddards or

                       b) Amenable to greater emphasis

                       I offer these points for the consideration of the legal represent­
                       atives, conscious of the fact that they may have already been
                       considered and dismissed as insignificant.

                           TAYLOR'S INTERIM REPORT



                    ADDITIONAL POINTS OF CONTENTION




PARA 55 - "Evidence       did   not     suggest      a great    amount    of    alcoholic

           drink was bought (at the off licences)."



     The enquiry team remember that evidence was available of

      at   least    one    off-licence         (believed       to   be   Gateway)

      selling out of alcoholic               drink.    No statement can be

      found to this effect.            If this evidence is thought to be

     significant     then       it    will   be   found    - by     speaking     to

     Gateway staff if absolutely necessary.



PARA 82 - "Initially no (police) officer took charge."



       See transcript of Roger GREENWOOD'S evidence (day 12

       Page   41)   who    claims       to    have    taken    charge    at    the

       gateway to Pen 3-             Certainly this was done before the

       arrival of Chief Superintendent Nesbit at 3-12 pm.
PARAS 130 AND 135 - "Dr Eastwood had suggested (elaborate divisions

                       of    the       turnstiles)       giving     separate     access   to

                       each sub-division of the accommodation."



     Inspector Clive CALVERT, then the South Yorkshire Police

     representative         on        the    Officers      Working       Group     at

     Hillsborough had first suggested such division and gives

     evidence (see statement) that he submitted a rough plan

      to the Officer Working Group.                    The idea was formalised

      into working plans prepared by Dr EASTWOOD's firm.                         The

     rejection    of   the       plan       by   the   club may     be   found     at

     Minutes of Sheffield Wednesday F.C.                     22/5/85     (S.W.F.C.

     bundle).



PARA 170 - "The police were much better placed than the stewards (in

           the West Stand)."



      Parts of this paragraph have already been highlighted

       by Counsel.     However, by way of emphasis, there were

       stewards in the West Stand including a Chief Steward

       (with few other duties) who might have informed the

       Club's    security        or    Safety     officers,    or    indeed      the

       police who were nearby, of impending difficulties on

       the terrace.
PARA 190 - "the police should have realised that the Leppings Lane

             turnstiles and the waiting areas outside                    them would be

             under strain......       (this was), in my view forseeable."



      We     might     from   experience      have   been       expected       to

      highlight,        and   plan   for,     difficulties         of    access

      through        turnstiles.     The    simple       fact   is      that   no

      previous difficulties had been reported to the police,

      or witnessed by the police.             This despite the regular

      attendance of Liverpool supporters at Hillsborough for

      League and Cup matches.



      Furthermore, the club had posted stewards at the 1988

      game     (evidence      on   video)    to    monitor      and     control

       supporters entering the turnstiles and waiting areas.

      They did not report any problems at that game and,

       indeed decided not to deploy stewards to that area in

       1989.



       Finally,       the   Green Guide     puts   the     onus,      for such

       foresight      and contingency       planning,     firmly with the

       club.    See particularly paragraph 290 of the Interim

       Report where Lord Justice Taylor              hammers that point

       home.
PARA 195 - "Even if (pre-match entertainment had taken place) it may

              not have been an encouragement for many fans to enter so

              early."



       Lord     Justice   Taylor   might    be   hidebound   with   the

       concept    of local    schoolboy penalty     competitions    and

       the like.        For an event of such magnitude realising

       millions of pounds      in revenue for the F.A.       the club

       should have been encouraged to provide facilities for

       proper entertainment:       e.g.    youth team match between

       the Notts Forest and Liverpool clubs, skydivers, a top

       line musician/group etc. The alternatives were a cold

       hard terrace for an extra hour or an extra hour of

       drinking etc.

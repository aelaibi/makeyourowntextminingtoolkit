          Dear Sirs

          HILLSBOROUGH PRIVATE PROSECUTION -
          ADLINGTON v DUCKENFIELD

          T hank you for your letter of 26 November. I attach copies of the
          enclosures to the HFSG letter of 11 November. These did not, in fact,
          include a copy of the indictment.

          When we spoke, I had not quite appreciated how few the enclosures
          were, or th a t there is to be a hearing concerning the scope of the
          indictm ent on 20 December. I think in these circum stances, it is not
          necessary for you to have a further 10 days to prepare your response. I
          should be grateful if I could have your response by 6th December at the
          latest.

          I am copying this letter to HFSG.

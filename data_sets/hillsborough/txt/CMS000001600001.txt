    Dear Mr Beckett

^   SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS:     TWERTON PARK - PERIMETER FENCING

'*-■* Thank you for your letter of 4 December about perimeter gates in
      the pitch perimeter fence at Twerton Park.

    As recognised in Mr Bolton's letter of 6 December to Mr Pearce
    (which_crossed with yours) decisions relating to the terms and
    conditions to be contained in the safety certificate for Twerton
    Park are entirely a matter for your authority.      Our position
    remains unchanged in that we believe the recommendations of the
    Hillsborough Inquiry's Interim Report should be complied with.

      ^[U-ite understand that in the wake of an incident of hooliganism
    and attempted pitch invasion, your authority should feel that it
    is unwise to require the pitch perimeter gates to be kept open.
    The arguments for doing so are, of course, set out in paragraph
    311 of the Interim Report. No matter how confident one is about
    the efficiency of the arrangements at any particular ground the
    interim     measures   recommended   by  the   Inquiry   (including
    recommendation 8) are intended to provide that additional element
    of overall safety which, as perhaps illustrated by the incident
    at Ayresome Park at the weekend, is necessary if the public are
    to be properly protected. I hope your Licensing Authority will
    bear this in mind when it next reviews the safety certificate for
    Twerton Park.

    I am arranging for a copy of your letter and my reply to be
    passed to the Hillsborough Inquiry for information.           An
    additional copy of my reply has been sent to the Chief Executive
    direct.
                                             Yours sincerely




                                                              D J MOULD

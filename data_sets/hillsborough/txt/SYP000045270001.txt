    Scope and sta tu s o f th e G uide
    1.   This booklet provides guidance to ground management, local
    authorities and technical specialists such as engineers on
    measures for improving spectator safety at existing sports
    grounds. It is a voluntary code and has no legal force.

    2.     Guidelines on measures for improving the safety of
    spectators at sports grounds firs t became available on a more or
    less comprehensive scale w hen the W heatley Report on Crowd
    Safety at Sports Grounds was published in 1972. The recom m en­
    dations in the appendix to that Report w ere extended to include
    fire precautions and means of escape from an emergency situation
    such as a fire, and then form ed the basis of the Guide to Safety at
    Sports Grounds (which became known as the "Green Guide"). The
    application of those guidelines to football grounds over the fe w
    years w h ich follow ed revealed a need for the advice to be
    amended in certain respects. Furthermore, since the safety of
    spectators can be affected w hen crowds are disturbed by hooligan
    elements, the recommendations of the W orking Party on Crowd
    Behaviour w ere incorporated in a new version, published in 1976,
    w h ich w as aimed specifically at football grounds. Following the
    fire at Bradford City FC ground in 1985 in w hich 56 people died, a
    w orking party, established under the aegis of M r Justice
    Popplewell's Inquiry into Crowd Safety and Control at Sports
    Grounds, reviewed the Guide and produced a series of recom m en­
    dations w hich have been taken into account together w ith
    com m ents from others in producing this revised and expanded
    version.

ease of maintenance. A ll parts of viewing areas should always
have a clear unobstructed view of the playing area and designs
should take account of the need for effective stewarding, w hich
can play an im portant role in controlling crowd movement (see
Chapter 13).

21. A lthough controlling crowd numbers may serve to reduce
some risks to an acceptable level, remedial w ork is likely to be
necessary to overcome others. Obvious defects such as trip
hazards (especially at the head of stairs or steps), loose or weak
handrails on stairs, and obstructed exits or exit routes, should be
rectified as part of the general care and maintenance of a ground.
S tructures should be sound (see Chapter 3) and inspected by
suitably qualified persons (see Chapter 4). Design, layout and
signposting of exits and exit routes require particular attention to
ensure that they can safely cope w ith the number of spectators
w h o w ill use them at the end of an event or in an emergency (see
Chapter 6). Sim ilarly, the condition of terraces or view ing slopes
(see Chapter 8) and presence or otherwise of crush barriers,
correctly sited and meeting the strength tests of this Guide (see
Chapter 9), are im portant factors. Broken, uneven terracing causes
stumbling. Barriers not only serve to break up crowd pressures but
also assist in controlling movement off the terraces by regulating
the rate of arrival at exits to suit the ir capacity, and encouraging
the form ation of queues so th at spectators arrive at exits in an
orderly fashion.

22. Proper precautions against the risk of fire are vital (see
Chapter 11). Good ground m anagement is crucial in reducing or
elim inating the risk. Accum ulation of litter is a prime potential
source of fire but can be elim inated by regular and frequent
inspections, good housekeeping, ground m aintenance and by
taking particular care over the storage of flam m able materials. The
nature and type of materials used in the construction of covered
areas and stands w ill strongly influence the safety measures

Spectators should be admitted at a rate which is compatible
w ith the dispersal arrangements for them inside the ground.

44. W here admission to a ground or parts of it is controlled by
turnstiles, these, by their num ber and location, control not only the
rate of admission but, to a large extent, the dispersal of spectators

such num bers as to adm it spectators at a rate w hereby no unduly
large crowds are kept w aiting for admission and yet at no faster
rate than the arrangements for distributing spectators w ith in the
ground permit.

45. Dangerous overcrowding can be caused if spectators are
able to force their way into a ground already full to capacity by
scaling or breaking through boundary w alls or fences or the gates
in them . To avoid this danger such w alls, fences and gates should
be of appropriate height and strength, and hand- or foot-holds
w h ich m ight assist clim bing should be avoided. They should be
regularly inspected.

46. Contingency plans should be made to deal w ith situations
w here the available entrances at a ground have proved insufficient
to stop unduly large crowds from gathering outside. This may, for
example, include opening additional entrances, but local knowledge
of the ground, crowd patterns and advice from the police should be
taken into account in drawing up contingency plans. Larger
grounds should have intercom m unication systems and metering
systems at turnstiles (see Chapter 12), and installation of a
centralised com puter m onitoring system may be of assistance to
management in quickly identifying particular areas of difficulty.

order to achieve this it m ight be necessary to remove one or tw o
rows of terracing and to protect the w alkw ay from the terrace by a
continuous line of barriers, so designed as to discourage access to
the w alkw ay except at authorised points. The access points from
terrace to w alkw ay should be directly linked w ith the access points
from the w alkw ay to the pitch. W here a w alkw ay system is in use,
sliding gates may be installed at the access points from the
w alkw ay to the pitch, ie w here there can be no crowd pressure
against them (see Chapter 6, paragraph 65 regarding the use of
sliding gates elsewhere). A barrier to the pitch is usually
unnecessary where seating extends to the level of the playing area.

extreme, at a certain type of ground or small stadium used by very
few spectators, there may be no need for a perimeter fence or w all
at all; or if such a w all or fence exists it may need to consist of little
more than a rail to mark the playing area. A t the other extreme, at
some major soccer stadia, where restriction on crowd movement
form s a necessary part of the safety measures, it may be necessary
to have a fence w hich prevents access to the pitch in normal
circumstances (see also Chapter 14, paragraph 209) but allows for
access in emergency. Even at these grounds however specification
of the pitch fence may vary for different parts of the ground.

2 1 5 . For most major stadia, w hether used for association football
or other sports, the pitch perim eter fence w ill be required either to
prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to
discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates
or other access points (m inim um w id th 1.1 metres) should
nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency and, at those
grounds where a perim eter track is used as part of the exit system,
for the departure of spectators at the end of an event. Provision of
such gates or access points is particularly im portant to allow full
access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should
be properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access
to the playing area or perim eter track can be ensured.

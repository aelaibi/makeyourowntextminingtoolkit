                                                                          442
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             agree it is 10.12 am (1012)

                             and the date is the 12th of

                             June 1990 (120690).   At the

01.04                        conclusion of the interview

                             PC ILLINGWORTH I will give you a

                             notice explaining exactly what

                            will happen to the     tapes.   Do

                            you understand?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            On the 15th of April 1989 (150489)

                             a disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                             Football Stadium and 95 people died.

                             Following a public inquiry in report

                             the Chief Constable of South

                             Yorkshire Police consulted with the

                             Director of Public Prosecutions and

                             as a result the West Midlands Police

                            were requested to do a criminal

                             investigation.   This investigation

                             came at the same time that certain

                            members of the public decided to

01.38                       make specific allegations against

                            named Police Officers and you are

                            one of those officers and you have

                            already been been served with

                            Regulation 7 Notices dealing with

                            those specific complaints.      The

01.51                       nature of those ccnplaints and the

                            particular duty you were performing
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             at Hillsborough the 15th of April

02.00                        1989 (150489) does suggest that you

                            may have contributed to the deaths

                            of sane of those that died.       Also

                            that you may have failed to perform

                            your lawful duty as a police officer

                            on the 15th of April 1989 (150489) at

                            Hillsborough. I will explain

                            the specific allegations to

                            you in interview but do you

                            understand the nature of the this

                            interview which raises matters of

                            both the criminal and disciplinary

02.25                       nature.   Before you answer I need

                            to formally caution you.     You do

                            not have to say anything unless

                            you wish to do so, but what you say

                            may be given in evidence.    Do you

                            understand the reason for the

                            interview?

         PC417              I understand yeah.

02.37    DCS6930            Thank you.   I would remind you that

                            you're not under arrest, you

                            needn't remain here and in

                            addition you are entitled to the

                            Legal Representation that you have

                            with you at the moment.    Do you

                            understand that citing?

         DCS6930            Good.   Thank you.   Can I just
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             start off by sane agreements?

                             Firstly you did submit to the

                             to the West Midlands Police after

                            the disaster a written recollection

                            of your involvement at Hillsborough

                            on that day.     Is that right?

03.06    PC417               I submitted a report.

         DCS6930            Yes.

         PC417              At that stage I didn't know it was

                            going to the West Midlands.

         DCS6930            No.

         PC417              I I was told by my superiors,

                            supervisors to make a report,

                            I didn't know where it was going

                            to go to.

         DCS6930            Okay so you did a report that

                            at sane stage ended up in our

                            possession and in the possession

                            of the at Lord Justice TAYLOR'S

                            Enquiry?

         PC417              Yes.

03.32    DCS6930            Yes.    Thank you.   And I think also

                            at sane stage later you gave

                            evidence at that public inquiry

                            and a transcript of that evidence

                            was then made and do you agree

                            with that?

        PC417               Yes.

        DCS6930             Yes.    It it may be necessary at
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             seme stage to refer to that

                             report you made and to the

                             transcript evidence.

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            As we go through and again if you

                            wish to refer to that, we

                            can, there will be one available

                             for you. Okay.

         PC417              Yeah.

04.00    DCS6930            There are a number of photographs

                            and videos that show you on the

                            day, and before we actually do start

                             I would like to get the agreement

                            with you of the ones where you

                            accept that they are you in the

                            picture or on video?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Is that Okay?

         PC417              Yes.

04.20    DC6930             Right, if we can start with what

                            is Document 162.   Document 162

                            Photograph number 14 that PC

                            BROWN will now find and show you,

                            it's actually the one with the

                            blue dot on the one I'm showing

                            you and I think would you agree

                            that was yourself on that one.

                            You'll see in the it's timed at

                            14.52 (1452) according to the time
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             of that clock?

04.52    PC417               It certainly looks like me.

         DCS6930             It certainly looks like you.

                            Thank you.   The second one is

                             the same document, Document 162

                             and it is photograph number 17.

                             Do you see yourself on that?

05.10    PC417              Then again it certainly looks

                             like me.

         DCS6930            And where are you actually

                            pointing to.    Which one?

05.21    PC417               I would say, the first police

                             officer on track front the right.

         DCS6930             From the right, nearest to Gate

                             5.

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Thank you.     The next one is

                             Document Number 155, photograph

                            number 25, which shows a Police

                            Constable on the very right hand

                            side of the picture apparently

                            moving a supporter along the

                            track.

         PC417              Yes, again that looks like me.

         DCS6930            Thank you.   And the same document

                            Document Number 155, photograph

                            number 26 which I think perhaps

                            shows the same supporter with

                            the same police officer.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Thank you.     And Document 153,

06.18                       photograph number 8, where I

                            think there is a police officer

                            identified in the middle of a

                            large number of pblice officers

                            and supporters, around that area.

         PC417              I have seen that photograph before

                            I'm not.

         DCS6930            You're not sure?

         PC417              Convinced that that's me.     But it

                            may well be me.

         DCS6930            So can you put on record that

                            that's that's, we're not sure

                            about photograph number 8,

                            Document Number 153.     But that

                            isn't particularly something that

                            I was going to refer to.

         PC417              No.

         DCS6930            It was a matter of whether it was

                            going to help you at seme stage

                            later on PC ILLINGWORTH.

         PC417              It may be me or not.

07.00    DCS6930            Thank you.     Now on the video we

                            have a number of video shots

                            and if I can start off with

                            Document 109, which is timed

                            firstly at about 1458 (1458) to

                            1459 (1459).    Could you have a
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             look at this PC ILLINGWORTH and

                             as we come to around the 1459

                             (1459) mark would you fast forward

                             it to 1459 (1459) please.     I

                             think we'd find, two police

07.48                        officers by Gate 4.    Can you see

                             on the bottom left hand side, well

                             there's certainly one police officer

                             is it possible for you to say

                             whether that's yourself?

         FC417               No, it's impossible.     It could

                             possibly be me.

         DCS6930             Alright, but can we just take it

                             back now again just a bit more can

                             we slew it down as it comes, as the

                             camera pans back.     See if it

                             helps.     Can we take it back again.

                             (Pause).

08.43    DCS6930             For the benefit of the audio we're

                             still showing the tape at 1459

                             (1459) we're trying to slew it down

                             because it does show some police

                             officers in the left hand c o m e r

                             by Gate 4.    Can you stop it there.

09.10                        (Pause).    Would you agree that

                            you would have been somewhere

                             around Gate 4?

09.14    PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            At that time?
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            And I think it's it's possible

                             frcm there to say that it appears

                             that at that time Gate 4 appears

                            to be open because of the number of

                            supporters on the perimeter gate.

                            Would you agree with that?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            That's fine, thank you.    On the same

                            video, Document 109, can we go

                            through to 1503 (1503) and again

                            there is a police officer here, I'd

                             just like you to have a look at and

                            see if you can confirm whether it's

                            yourself.    Video's presently being

                             fast forwarded through to the

                            time 1503 (1503).    It's about

                            1503.30 (1503) and is what we

                            want. (Pause).

                            Can you go back to 1503.30 (1503).

                            Can you let that run now frcm 1503

                             (1503).   There is a police officer

                            in the top left hand c o m e r with

                            a number of supporters.    Is

                            possible for you to identify whether

                            that is you there?

         PC417              I'm not trying to be obstructive,

                            but it's very difficult to see.

         DCS6930            It is difficult yes.
IDLINGW0R3H        DAVID   ALFRED


         PC417               If it's me or not, it certainly

                             looks like me, it could well be

                            me.

11.00    DCS6930            Would you accept that you were

                             again somewhere near that Gate 4

                            at that time?

11.01    PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930             If you have a look now, there's

                            one or two police officers

                            caning round.     We're now at 1503

                             (1503) and 1552 (1552).

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Does that help in terms of whether

                            you can see yourself there?     If you

                            want to slow it or stop it or

                            reverse it, you can do.

         PC417              I can, may be that's me in the far

                            comer, maybe it's not.      He's got

                            the same clothing.

         DCS6930            Okay but the point is that you would

                            be somewhere about there?

         PC417              Certainly.

         DC6930             Okay thank you.    I'd like now to move

                            to Document 132, which is another

                            video at 1500 hours (1500) 3 o'clock.

                            (Pause).

                            So this is Document, can you take it

                            back oh to 40 1500.40 (1500).

                            This one actually shews the game
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            being in progress.    Can you now look

                            and see if you can see yourself on

                            there?

         PC417              That looks like me.

12.18    DCS6930            So the the police officer walking on

                            the left of the pitch on occasions

                            with his arm apparently out holding a

                            supporter, you think is probably

                            yourself?

12.27    PC417              It certainly looks like me.

         DCS6930            Can we take it back and have another

                            look, Mr ILLINGWORTH just to confirm.

                            If we can let it run, letting it

                            frcm 1500 and 38.

         PC417              I got a glimpse there, a split

                            second I would say it was possibly

                            me.

         DCS6930            Okay and can we move the same one on

                            to 1501 (1501) because I think

                            there's another view there.   Can you

                            look at that again for me and see

                            whether you can see yourself there.

                            Move it just back to, that's it,

                            let it run frcm 1500 and 53, 54.

                            That's a police officer there,

         PC417              Yeah. Yeah.

         DCS6930            Walking back.

         PC417              Again it certainly, it looks like me.

        DCS6930             It's possible?
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Thank you.    Document Number

                             135 is much the same time

                            at 1500 hours (1500) again and 46

                            nearly 1501 (1501).       Could you just

                            have a look at that again for me

                            and see if you can confirm if you're

                            the police officer in that picture.

                            On the left hand side when we get to

                            1500.46 (1500).     I think you'll

                            start caning to the picture now

                            you'll see a police officer walking

                            down, holding somebody walking away.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Is it possible that that could be

                            you?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            It is.    Thank you.     And the final

                            document I'd like you to look at,

                            sorry no one is that 1501, (1501),

                            sorry the same one, Document 132,

                            put that one back in and move on

                            to 1501 time (1501).      In that top

                            corner, again I know it's a long

                            distance, is it possible that

                            that's you in that top left hand

                            corner?

        PC417               It's certainly possible.

ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930             Can we take it back.

                             (Pause).

14.57    DCS6930             Just walking along there, putting

                             somebody into what appears to be

                             Pen 6 and calling people on?

15.05    PC417               Yes.    I agree.

         DCS6930             Thank you.    And the final one I

                            wish to show you is Document 110

                            which is timed at 1503 and 20

                             seconds (1503).    (Pause).

                             Can you feist forward it to 20

                             please. It shows a police

                             to, is that yourself there in the

                             middle of the picture and towards

                             the back?

         PC417               Yes.

         DCS6930             Thank you.    Is there any other

                             particular video or photographs

                             that you have in your possession

                             prior to this interview that you

                             particulary wanted to introduce

                             at this stage?

         PC417               Er.    This was something that I had

                             considered, I can try and explain

                             that these videos get me very very

                             confused.

                            that posting and how continous

                             it's been?

17.35    PC417              My recollection, I would think,

                            September 88 (000988) or could

                            be 87 (000087).

         DCS6930            September 87 (000087)?

         PC417              Yeah.    Certainly the last two and

                            a half years.

         DCS6930            The last twa.     Does that include

                            then the I think the 1987

                             (000087) FA Cup Semi-Final.

                            Would you have done that one?

                            That would have been earlier

                            then September 87 (000987) but...

         PC417              I was certainly on duty that day,

                            but I certainly weren't on the

                            track.

         DCS6930            You weren't on the track for

                            that 1987 (000087) one.    Okay.

18.14                       What about the 1988 (000088)

                            Semi-Final the same match then.

                            Would you have been on the track at

                            the Leppings Lane end?

         PC417              Exactly the same position yeah.

         DCS6930            Right.   The league matches inbetween

                            that have taken place at
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            Hillsborough over that period.       If

                            we say that there are in a period

                            of a season 21, 22 home league

                            games, for 19 between 1988 (000088)

                             89 (000089) season.   Hew many of

                            those do you think you would have

                            worked on that track at Lappings

                            Lane?

         PC417              Out of the 22, I would think

                            probably eighteen.

         DCS6930            Eighteen.    So er

         PC417              Only you see if it falls

                            and it's me day off...

         DCS6930            Yes.

         PC417              and it's a minor match I won't do

                            it.

         DCS6930            Right.

         PC417              But I will do the majority.

         DCS6930            So you've done a fair amount

                            at that particular end over that

                            period?

         PC417              The majority.

19.04    DCS6930            You've certainly done the 1988

                            (000088) Semi-Final of the same

                            match because I know you you've

                            specifically recalled seme events

                            frcm that.

        PC417               Yes.

        DCS6930             In your evidence and that was a full
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             capacity the     same as the 1989

                             (000089) game?

         PC417              Yes.

19.19    DCS6930            Do you recall working that

                            particular duty at Leppings

                            Lane terraces on the track with

                            any other full house or capacity

                            crowd for any other type of game?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Can you tell me what that might

                            have been?

                             (Pause).

         DCS6930            I'm talking now about before the

                            disaster on___

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            In 89 (000089)^as opposed to

                            since.

         PC417              Are you talking about a full

                            capacity house.

         DCS6930            Em.     Let's say that where Leppings

                            Lane terraces were probably at

                            capacity.

         PC417              At capacity yeah.     I would think at

                            the most times at a big event

                            such as Liverpool, Manchester United

                            maybe Newcastle,     I think it is

                            round about capacity level.     For

                            that section.     Not at the whole

                            ground obviously.

        DCS6930              Did you have any knowledge, and

                            again can you answer this in terms

                            of not present knowledge but

                            knowledge prior to the 15th of April

20.22                       Did you have any knowledge of the

                            problems that happened in 1981

                             (000081) when there was quite

                            severe crushing at that Leppings

                            Lane terraces that resulted in

                            various changes after that?

20.33    PC417              I had no knowledge at all.

         DCS6930            Nothing at all?

         PC417              That came out at the public

                            inquiry I didn't know anything

                            about it.

         DCS6930            You didn't know before hand about

                            it.     It had never ccme up in sort

                            of conversation?

         PC417              No.

         DCS690             Or otherwise?

        PC417               I wasn't there and I didn't know

                            anything about it.

        DCS6930             Thank you.    Within your division

                            which I think is the 'F' Division

                            isn't it?

        PC417              That's right.

        DCS6930            You have a Football Liaison

                            Inspector.
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


          FC417               Yes.

          DCS6930             Scroeone who looks after the

                              general duties of....

          PC417              Didn't know he was called Football

                             Liaison Inspector.

          DCS6930            That's probably a West Midlands

                             term, perhaps I shouldn't have

                             used that term.

          PC417               I know the guy who does the job.

          DCS6930            And who do you put that, who    who

                             is that as far as you're concerned

                             at the moment?

21.10     PC417              At the moment it's Inspector

                             SEWELL.

          DCS6930            Inspector SEWELL.     And he's been

                             doing that for how long, can you

                             remember?

          PC417              I would think he's probably been

                             doing it for 18 months.

          DCS6930            Eighteen months.    At any time either

                             with him doing it or previously,

                             other than actually knowing what your

                             duty was at the ground, have you had

21.33                        any other sort of divisional

                             training or anything to do with

                             the way in which you police football

                             matches?

21.41    PC417               I could go into this quite detailed

                             but the answers no.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            The answers no okay then.     Again

                            don't forget at any stage if you

                            do want to say additional, don't

                             just answer my question, please

                            go on and add anything else.

                            So nothing has happened shall we

                            say back on your divisional area

                            in terms of you gaining any

                            knowledge, additional to your actual

                            duty at the ground and attending the

                            briefing for a specific match?

         PC417              No.

                            Final that's the one, three years

                            running if you like, the first one.

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Did you actually go to that game

                            but in a different posting?

         PC417              Am I correct in thinking it was

                            Leeds and Coventry?

         DCS6930            I think it was.

         PC417              Yeah.   No I were in Town Centre.

         DCS6930            So you were you were on duty with a

                            different posting?

22.40    PC417              At the railway station.

         DCS6930            Thank you.   Although you weren't in

                            the ground, does that mean you

                            didn't go to the ground at any

                            stage during that particular match?

         FC417               I'm I'm quite certain.     I didn't.

22.53    DCS6930             There has been a suggestion frcm

                            people that have been seen that

                             there was a problem in terms of the

                            crowd an overcrowding at that

                            particular game, again not what you

                            might have heard since, but prior to

                             the 15 of April 1989 (150489), would

                            you have been aware of any problem

                             at that 1987 (000087) game?

                             Specifically about Leppings Lane

                             terraces?

23.16    PC417               I wasn't aware of that situation

                             after the 15th of April (150489).

                             That's news to me.     I didn't

                             know if there was a problem there.

         DCS6930             Okay.    Alright.

         PC417               I wasn't there.

         DCS6930             No.     It's only, I'm thinking now

                            whether anybody had mentioned it to

          DCS6930               No.    Could you explain to mo hew

                                you shall we say, you end up at the

                                situation of being somewhere around

                                Gate 4?

24.35         PC417             I initially, when I first joined

                                that crew, it was obvious to me

                                that there wasn't enough people

                                at that area of the ground.    That's
ILLINGWORTH         DAVID   ALFRED


                             why I decided to go there.

         DCS6930              I see.

24.50    FC417                Nobody told me to go there.

         DCS6930              If we talk about it being a sort of

                              well West, North, South and Spion

                              Kop area, so there are four sides to

                              that track?

          PC417               Yes.

          DCS6930             And those officers, are you saying

                              as far as you're concerned none

                              of those officers are specifically

                              asked to go to set sides of the

                              ground, that they they make their

                              own decision as to where they think

                              they're needed?

25.20     PC417               Certainly in my case.     I can't

                              speak for other peqple.    The

                              situation has been, as I understand

                              it, that that a regular group of

                              people, which would be community

                              bobbies were at their usual places

25.42                         but nobody as as I know has ever

                              been given specific instructions of

                              where to    go.

          DCS6930             Okay.    The fact is that on the 1988

25.53                         (000088) game you were in much the

                              same position as you were for the

                              1989 (000089) one?

          PC417               Yes.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            All be it by your particular

                            decision?

         PC417              Yeah.

26.01    DCS6930             Right, that 1988 (000088) game,

                             again there have been suggestions

                            that people were injured because of

                            overcrowding at the 1988 (000088)

                            game, do you have any knowledge

                            of that, either, either since you

                            nay have knowledge as a result of

                            the inquiry?

26/21    PC417               I've no knowledge as a result

                            of the inquiry.

         DCS6930            Right.    Have you any knowledge.

         PC47               Yes.

         DCS6930            Of injuries at all.

         PC417              Yes the only kid I can recollect being

                            injured, and I didn't see him, but

                            was one of the kids who jumped over

                            the fence and I think he broke his

                            leg or he injured his leg.

         DCS6930            Injured his leg.   That's somebody

                            that was climbing over the fencing

                            to get onto the tracks?

         PC417              No. No.

         DCS6930            Is that before the start of

                            the game?

         PC417              That was somebody who was climbing

                            over the fencing to get back into
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                              the ground.

          DCS6930             I see.

          PC417              Not to get out?

          DCS6930            Not to get out.

          PC417              Yeah.

          DCS6930            And that's the only injury you're

                             aware of?

          PC417              Yes.

          DCS6930            That obviously then was not due

                             to any suggestion of overcrowding

                             or wouldn't appeared to you to

                             be overcrowding because he was

                             going the other way?

          PC417              He certainly wasn't...

          DCS6930            He wasn't trying to get out he

                             was trying to get in?

          PC417              That's right.

27.10    DCS6930             I see.     Have you any knowledge of any

                             other injuries.

27.13    PC417               None at all.

          DCS6930            Occurring in that 1988 (000088)

                             game?

          PC417              There m y have been though but I

                             certainly know.

27.16    DCS6930             No.     Did you have any suggestion to

                             you that those pens in 1988 (000088)

                             whilst you were at that game, were

                             over-crowded or full and you had to

                             do anything about it?
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         PC417               I don't know if you're saying

                            crushing. Sorry.

27.33    DCS6930             During the 1988 (000088) game when

                            you were on that track, in the

                             front of shall we say Gate 4 or 3,

                            did any supporters intimate to you

                            that they were crushed or they were

                            overcrowded and they wanted to be

                            moved?

27.52    FC417              No.

         DCS6930            No?

         PC417              No.

27.55    DCS6930            Did you have any reason to

                            recognise that there was a

                            problem in 1988 (000088)?    Did

                            anything happen that made you

                            think that there was a problem

                             in those terraces?

28.08    PC417              No, no but if I can elaborate.

         DCS6930            Yes.

         FC417              I wouldn't put meself in a

                            situation on a football terrace

                            in a capacity crowd.

         DCS6930            Yeah.

         PC417              Right.   I think anybody who does

                            do is slate loose I wouldn't do

                            it.

         DCS6930            No.

         PC417              If they are prepared to put then
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                              selves in that environment then

                              so be it.

          DCS6930            Okay.      So nobody's bought that to

                             your attention, nobody in that crowd

                             has sort of escaped frcm, frcm one

                             side of the other and cone to

                             you and said, this is, this is

                             overfull and I'm getting.

                              (Interrupted)

          PC417              This is too much, no.

          DCS6930            No, okay.

                              (Pause)

28.51     DCS6930            Again, there was talk in 1988

                              (000088)    and both supporters and

                             frcm one or two police officers that

                             the tunnel was closed giving access

                             to those two central pens with the

                             names 3 and 4, again did you have

                             any knowledge of that tunnel being

                             closed, I accept you were on the

                             perimeter track, but again after­

                             wards did anybody say anything to

                             you about, you know, we have to

                             shut that tunnel off?

29.17     PC417              No sir no.

          DCS6930            Not at all you've no knowledge of

                             it?

         PC417               No.

         DCS6930             Whatsoever?
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


29.21    PC417               I have seen the tunnel closed.

         DCS6930             You've seen it closed?

         PC417               Yes.

         DCS6930            Would you explain to me in what

                             circumstances?

29.31    PC417               I've done various duties in

                             different places it's only in the

                             last couple of years that I've been

                             on the track, I have been in the

                             area which I think is now known as

                             the concourse.

         DCS6930            Would you say, do you call the

                             concourse between the, between the

                             turnstiles and the back of the

                             terraces?

         PC417               Yes.

         DCS6930             That they've ccme through the

                             turnstiles in that open part?

         PC417               Yeah.

         DCS6930             If if we looked at this big map

                             here, could you point it out for

                            me?

         PC417               That'll be the turnstiles.

         DCS6930            That's right.

         PC417              That's the tunnel.

         DCS6930            Yes.

         PC417               I w u l d say this area.

         DCS6930            That area there.

         PC417               Is what I think's regarded as the

                             concourse.

         DCS6930             Concourse, thankyou.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930             Yeah the officer PC ILLINGWORTH has

                             just looked at a very large map

                             of the ground and surrounding area

                             and pointed out what is known as

                             the concourse area.

         PC417               It's known to me as the concourse.

         DCS6930            Yes, I think we would accept that

                             that's what it's called.    Could you

                             go on then and explain you've seen

                             the tunnel closed?

30.26    PC417               I've seen the big blue gates of

                             the tunnel closed.     I don't know

                            what match it was I think I may

                            be seen it twice, but I have seen it

                            closed up.

         DCS6930            Would you know for what reason?

30.40    PC417              Er, I wDuld think the reason is

                            obvious that that section of the

                            ground's full.

         DCS6930            You would have thought it was

                            because the ground was full?

         PC417              Yes, I didn't shut, I didn't

                            shut the gates.

         DCS6930            No.

         PC417              But I I have certainly seen than

                            shut.



                                                                          470
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            Has anybocty, you said you thought

                            that, am I right in saying then,

                            that nobody has specifically told

                            you that they were shut because they

                            were full, it's your interpretation,

                            perhaps since, since this, you've

                            perhaps not thought about it before?

         PC417              I think I probably have thought about

                            it, before, yes, but....

         DCS6930            You've thought about it before and

                            it was you're saying that the place

                            was full?

         PC417              Obviously yeah yeah.

31.22   DCS6930             That's fine, thank you.    Can we

                            come on to the 1989 (000089) game

                            itself now and...

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            And you actually paraded for duty

                            where?   Where and what time?

31.33   PC417               The North Stand I think round about

                            ten o'clock (1000).

         DCS6930            The North Stand ten oclock (1000).

31.40                       And you had a briefing there?

         PC417              That's right.

         DCS6930            Can you tell me who did that

                            briefing?

31.42   PC417               Mr DUCKENFIEED.

         DCS6930            Mr DUCKENFIEED, that's Chief

                            Superintendent DUCKENFIEED?
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         PC417              Yes.

31.48    DCS6930            The briefing itself, did it in any

                            way specifically relate to your

                            serial or your task as a perimeter

                            track officer in any way that you

                            can recall?

32.02   PC417               Not in specific terms no sir.     No.

         DCS6930            In any terms?

         PC417              In any terms I'd say that's a bit

                            vague.   Loose, in't it.   I think Mr

                            DUCKENFIEEI), as I recollect

32.19                       certainly made a point of safety.

         DCS6930            You think he made a point of safety?

         PC417              I'm I'm quite sure he did.

         DCS6930            Right.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Of safety?

         PC417              He elaborated the spectators.

32.30   DCS6930             He elaborated and said about the

                            safety of spectators?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            When he said that, as regards a

                            duty of police officers to to look

                            for the safety of spectators?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Can you, can you enlarge on that in

                            any way as to what he was actually

                            referring to, was it a general

                            canment or was he specifically
ILLINGW0R3H        DAVID   ALFRED


                            endorsing any?

         PC417               I l l would say it was a general

                            cament but but but it was

                            certainly a comment he etrphasised

                            upon.

33.03    DCS6930            And for example, did he mention

                             safety alongside, shall we say the

                            possibility of overcrowding or is

                            that being too specific?

33.16    PC417              No that's fine, the word overcrowding

                             I think was never mentioned.    I think

                             I think that's fair to to everybody

                            concerned.

         DCS6930            Yes.

         PC417               I don't think that vrord was ever

                            mentioned.

         DCS6930            Thank you.     So really safety was

                            emphasised?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            You obviously heard it you were

                            aware of it.    What sort of things

                            would you at that stage of considered

                            that he was talking about if he

                            mentioned the safety of supporters.

                            What sort of areas cone into your

                            mind?

33.45    PC417              The the areas that come into my mind

                            are are that the event takes place,

                            nobody gets hurt and everybody goes

                             hone happy.

         DCS6930            Would there have been anything that

                            vrould have cxxne into your mind either

                             from what Mr DUCKENFIEED said or

                             from anything else for you to have

                            ever thought that people could have

                            been injured in those pens and that

                            they weren't safe?

         PC417               I'm sorry you've lost me again.

34.13    DCS6930            Was there anything that Mr

                            DUCKENFIEED said or anything that

                            had happened at any stage previously

                            to do with safety that vrould have

                            made you believe that people could

                            have been injured in those pens?

34.30    PC417              There's things been in my mind prior

                            to that date of people being injured

                            in in pens as you say or terracing

                            because I think its a dangerous place

                            to go.    Mr DUCKENFIEED didn't need

                            to emphasise it to me.

         DCS6930            Right.

         PC417              If that answsrs your question, I

                            don't know.

         DCS6930            Yeah.    So so you you you think

                            they're a dangerous place to go,

                            you've always, you've obviously

                            thought that over seme years?

         PC417              I've been there myself.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


34.54    DCS6930            And you've been there and you know

                             it's possible for people to get

                             injured?

         PC417              Certainly.

         DCS6930            So it's something you would have

                            been aware of?

34.58    PC417              Oh yes, very much so, the very

                            forefront of my mind.

         DCS6930            Good, thank you.

                             (Pause).

35.13    DCS6930            The duty that you do on the Perimeter

                            track, can you explain to me what

                            you feel your duties are when you're

                            there?

35.22    PC417              I I would suggest that overall it is

                            the safety of the public.

         DCS6930            Safety of the supporters that you're

                            looking after.       Did you have a

                            specific responsibility for the gates

                            in the perimeter fencing?

         PC417              As as regards instructions?

         DCS6930            Yes?

35.47    PC417              No.

         DCS6930            No instructions whatsoever?

         PC417              No.

         DCS6930            No.     Did you...

         PC417              If you mean, you look after

                            that gate, you look after that

                            gate and you look after that gate.
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


          DCS6930            Yeah.

          PC417              None at all.

 35.57    DCS6930            So nobody in any sort of briefing

                             ever said you've got responsibility

                              for Gate 4?

36.03     PC417              No.

          DCS6930            5, or 6 or something like that?

          PC417              I can elaborate on this again.

          DCS6930            Yes please.

          PC417              But I don't want to pass

                             responsibility on or pass the book

                             or be critical to what anybody else.

                             Do you understand?

          DCS6930            Yes.

          PC417              I used to do Brammall Lane.

          DCS6930            Which is the Sheffield United Ground?

36.20     PC417              Sheffield United Ground Brannall

                             Lane and worked the track.     At that

                             ground everytime when you did the

                             track, they said, You're on Gate A,

                             You're on Gate B, You're on Gate C

                             and went round, everybody knew what

                             they were doing.

         DCS6930             Yes.

         PC417               Right.   I got moved from the City

                             Centre, went to F division

                             ultimately ended up back on the

36.45                        track.   But that was it, no

                             instructions no nothing, just

                             sort yourselves out.

         DCS6930             I see. So...

         PC417              And that's the truth.

         DCS6930             Yeah.

         PC417               I'm not being critical or trying

                            to fob the issue but that's fact.

36.58    DCS6930             If if I show you, which is Document

                             194, for our purposes, this is the

                             the FA Cup Semi-Final 'F' Division

                             Operational Order for that 1989

                             (000089) game.    Would you have

                             seen this order prior to actually

                             going for the briefing?

37.17    PC417               Yes.

         DCS6930             You would.    Who would give you

                             that order?

         PC417               It came from a conference.

         DCS6930            Would come through addressed

                            personally to you?

         PC417               It probably came through like

                            that with me number written on

                            the top.

         DCS6930             I see and would that be a copy

                            of the full order?

         PC417              No it'd just be that sheet.

         DCS6930            Just for the part that relates

                            to you?

         PC417              Yeah.

                             hand c o m e r and the top of the

37.49                       page is marked Sub Sector 1

                            Appendix B?

         FC417              Well without reading it I would

                            agree with you there, yeah.

         DCS6930            Yeah.   You vrould think that it

                            would be one page, that would

                            identify as you are here number

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            You would then read that?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Well the question is did you

                            read it on that day?

38.11    PC417              I did read it yes, but I'm

                            quite familar with its contents.

         DCS6930            You're familar with its content.

                            Now specifically if we go to to

                            those gates and I am sure that

38.21                       it's relevant here, particular

                            attention should be paid to

                            prevent any person climbing the

                            fence to gain access to ground,

38.29                       the gates must remain bolted at

                            all times except when in use.

                            If those, what do you understand

38.40                       by the term 'remain bolted'. Do
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            you understand it to mean locked

                            or bolted in which case you can you

                            can open it or anybody can open it

                            walking along that track?

         FC417               It's written there in black and

                            white, or black and white and pink

                            there.

         DCS6930            Pink there.

38.57    FC417              It's quite obvious it means remain

                            bolted.

         DCS6930            Now is that bolted with a, is that

                            a bolt.       Is there a key system

                            as well?

         PC417              No.     No.

         DCS6930            There's no key of any kind that

                            you can unlock that bolt that gate

                            with?

         PC417              No, No.

         DCS6930            I got the impression that there

                            was a key system as well?

         PC417              Well I've never I've certainly never

                            seen anybody use a key you know.

         DCS6930            Okay, when you actually came to open

                            those gates which is___

         PC417              There's no, there's no mechanism

                            for a key.

        DCS6930             Okay then, so when you came to

                            actually open those gates later

                            on, all you actually did was
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             remove a bolt from the outside

                             and they open?

39.35     PC417              No, no, no no no.    It's a release

                             mechanism, it's quite simple.       It'

                             not a bolt.

          DCS6930            No.

          PC417              As such you wouldn't think, they

                             used to be bolted.

          DCS6930            Yes.

          PC417              Right but the system was changed.

          DCS6930            Well they changed it in the last

                             two years.    Is that right?

          PC417              Something of that nature yeah.

                             You used to slam a bolt at the

                             top and they've got a release

                             mechanism down there.

          DCS6930            Okay.

          PC417              Spring loaded kind of thing.

          DCS6930            Is it possible that there are

                             padlocks on there that are, that

                             lock them additionally before the

                             games or when the games are not

                             on?

          PC417              I understand what you mean nc m .

40.10                        The only time I 've ever seen

                             chains and padlocks on gates are

                             in sterile areas.

40.20     DCS6930            That would be for example

                             the section known as number 5
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            here which was sterile on this

                            particular game?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Something like that?

         PC417              Yeah, yeah and I've seen is

                            that the tunnel?

         DCS6930            Yeah.   PC ILLINGWORIH is now

                            pointing to the large map again

                            in the tunnel area and caning

                            out of the tunnel onto the

                            back of the terraces.

         PC417               I've I've seen the the gate here

                            see the maps not very good.

         DCS6930            Yeah.

         PC417              The gates here.

         DCS6930            The gates at the back....

         PC417              Of the radial fences.

         DCS6930            They run all the way (interrupted).

         PC417              I've seen the doors padlocked.

         DCS6930            Right okay.

         PC417              Perhaps I'm getting confused

                            with padlocks on there and padlocks

         DCS6930            Okay.

         PC417              I have seen padlocks on gates.

         DCS6930            If if we go back to it, and lets

                            leave the, the fact of the the

41.09                       locks or otherwise now, you had

                            no specific responsibility

                            for any perimeter gates?
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


41.16     PC417               I was certainly not given any

                              specific instructions.

          DCS6930            Right.

          PC417              But the people I'm not getting

                             critical to people in charge,

                             they know where I'll be and they'll

41.27                        know what I'll lopk after.     I

                             don't need instructions.

          DCS6930            If we looked at Gates 4, 5, 6

                             and 7.

          PC417              Yeah.

          DCS6930            There are four of them?

          PC417              'Hat's right.

41.37    DCS6930             Would you have said that you had

                             inverted conmas 'responsibility' for

                             those four gates?

41.43    PC417               Unfortunately yes.

          DCS6930            Yes.

          PC417              Yeah.    An unfair I think

                             responsibility.

          DCS6930            You think that's an unfair

                             responsibility?

          PC417              I can go on about this again I

                             don't want to be critical to

41.55                        anybody, but I told one of my

                             supervisors I would think a month

                             maybe more six weeks before that

                             kick off and I spoke to him on that

                             track and I said, 'You've got some
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             input obviously for the Order for

                             the Semi-Final' and he said

42.08                        'Yeah'.   I said 'Well you're going

                            to have to get some more men up

                            here for this time, because I said

                            last year it were chaotic.' He said

42.19                        'Don't worry about it we'll get

                            another serial in, they'll be

                            loads of bobbies'.

         DCS6930            Okay.

         PC417              And at the end of the match we're

                            gonna draft no end of people

                            in.

         DCS6930            Can you tell me (Interrupted).

42.30    PC417              The point of it is they were still

                            only me and Pete SMITH there.

         DCS6930            Can you tell me who that supervisory

                            officer was that told you that?

         PC417              No.

         DCS6930            Okay then.   But the fact is that

                            there was sort of four gates in

                            which you moved along or performed

                            duty in front of?

         PC417              Yeah.

42.44    DCS6930            And if they needed to be opened

                            in accordance with that order you

                            were the officer that would have

                            opened one of those four?

42.49    PC417              Only me there.
ILLINGWDRTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            Okay then fine.

                             (Pause).

43.01    DCS6930            You actually went for refreshment

                            at around two o'clock (1400)?

43.04    PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            For what I understand was a full

                            meal or a proper meal as opposed

                            to a snack?

         PC417              A cooked meal yeah.

         DCS6930            A cooked meal.     Is that unusual

                            to go at that time?

43.19    PC417              To go at that time, it's unusual

                            to get one.

         DCS6930            It's unusual to get a cooked

                            meal?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Is it unusual to go at that time

                            for a break, from your duty as a

                            perimeter track officer or do you

                            do you often go between shall we say

                            betwsen two (1400) and three (1500).

                            Do you often go or do you normally

                            eat before then?

43.40    PC417              I would say in normal circumstances

                            in a normal football match, you you

                            get a sandwich and a bag of crisps,

                            which eat on the hoof as it were.

                            You don't get so, you go and

                            have your meal, kind of thing just
ILLINGWDRTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             get a bite when you can.

         DCS6930            Okay then, would you normally, I think

                             it will be easier to finish the

                             interview at this stage because we've

                            come to the end of that tape.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            To start to another one PC

                             ILLINGWORTH.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            So if we can agree the time is

                             10.55 (1055) and the interview

                            is terminating to replace

                            audio tapes.     Thank you the video

                            will keep running and we'll

                            take on the next one as well.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            So if we can not sort of continue

                            any sort of interview at this

44.24                       stage alright.

01.24                     you, you and PC SMITH      went

                          at the same time?
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID ALFRED


          PC417             limit's right yeah.

          DCS6930           Was that at the request of

                            someone asking you to go for the

                            meal or was it because at

                            that stage you hadn't had the

                            chance for something to to eat?

01.37     PC417             It it was as a consequence of me

                            requesting to go for a meal.

          DCS6930          Thank you.    Because at that stage

                           you'd had no refreshment at al1

                           presumably from ten oclock (1000)?

          PC417             It it wasn't that I was particularly

01.52                      hungry, but I thought I should have

                           gone for a meal at twelve oclock

                            (1200) before things got, developed,

                            I thought that would be the

                           appropriate time somewhere round

02.02                      about then.    Rather than go at

                           two o'clock (1400) when when

                           there's a build up.

          DCS6930          Yes*    Were there any other

                           officers to your knowledge

                           given specific times to go for

                           refreshment any of the other

                           perimeter track officers for

                           example?

          PC417            I understand the point you're

                           getting to sir.   There was I

02.19                      had a request come over the radio
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                              from somebody we're going for a

                             meal or I'm taking some people

02.27                         for a meal.    Seme went for a meal

                             at one o'clock (1300) or round

                             about one oclock (1300) and I

                             thought I would be then told when

                             they came back to go and get

                             my meal but I wasn't, so by two

02.40                        o'clock (1400) I had to go and ask

                             somebody.   What's going on, why

                             haven't I been yet.

          DCS6930            Yeah, and you you were replaced by

                             who?

02.54     PC417              To be truthful sir, I don't know.

                             I just went.

          DCS6930            You just went?

          PC417              Yeah.

          DCS6930            Are you happy that a police officer

                             did replace you either you and

                             PC SMITH, are you happy that

                             somebody came to that track area

                             when you left. Do you....

03.12     PC417              Happy perhaps not the word.    I can

                             recollect certainly somebody being

                             where I was previously when I came

                             back.

         DCS6930             Can you recollect who that was?

03.18    PC417               That was PC HELLIWELL.

         DCS6930             PC HELLIWELL.    Thank you.

03.23                       Do you recall either Inspector

                             DARLING who I think was your

                            Serial Inspector or Sergeant

                            CHAPMAN being at your end of the

03.37    PC417              No.

         DCS6930            You don't.   Can you recollect the

                             first time that you would have seen

                             Inspector DARLING at any stage at

                            your end of the track?

03.48    PC417               I don't recollect seeing Inspector

                            DARLING at my at that end of the

                            track.

         DCS6930            You don't, and what about Sergeant

                            CHAPMAN?

         PC417              No, I don't recollect seeing him

                            at that end of the track.     I

                            did see him or both of them

                            obviously seme time during the

         DCS6930            Can you say which other officers

ILLINGW0R3H        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930             Can you recollect any other

                             officers that were on your side

                             of the track?

         PC417               If you'd of asked me and I've

                            not seen the videos or been to

04.29                        the public inquiry I didn't knew

                            that Fiona was was there.

         DCS6930            You say Fiona, can you tell me

                            her last name?

04.34    PC417              RICHARDSON.

         DCS6930            Police Woman RICHARDSON yes.

         PC417               I I you know, I hadn't looked to

                            that c o m e r I didn't know she was

                            there.

         DCS6930            So you can't really recollect

                            or help as to who was with you

                            on at that time?

         PC417              The only, it was certainly what what

                            stage are we talking about?

         DCS6930            Well shall we say, prior to you

                            going to refreshment at two

                            oclock (1400)?

04.54    PC417              To my knowledge there were only

                            me and Pete.

         DCS6930            Just PC SMITH?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Thank you.

         PC417              But it's only since seeing the

                            videos and talking to people that
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID ALFRED


                           I've realised that Fiona were

                           there.

                           (Pause).

         DCS6930           Can I now refer to your statement

                           or your report that you made, which

                           have you got a copy it?

         HOLROYD          We haven't got a copy.

         PC417             It's alright I knew what's in it.

                           (Pause).

         DCS6930           You actually came back, I think

                           according to your statement on

05.55                     your page 3 at around 2.45 (1445)

                           2.50 (1450) after your refreshment?

         PC417            That that was my original estimate I

                          didn't look at my watch on what

                          time it was.     I would guess it was

                          round about then.

06.12    DCS6930          Yeah.     And you saw the tvro centre

                          pens or you described seeing them

                          very full but the two outer pens

                          about half full?

         PC417            Yes.

         DCS6930          And I think you also say this

                          surprised you that there was

                          bad distribution according

                          to your....

        PC417             Yeah.     I would suggest that perhaps

                          surprised is is not perhaps a a

                          strong enough word.     I think I would
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID ALFRED


06.38                      say I was a little bit shocked, that

                           I thought that's bad management

                           then again I don't want to be

                           critical of anybody but it

                           looked a bad situation to me.

06.51    DCS6930           It concerned you?

06.52    PC417            Very much so.

         DCS6930           If it concerned you did you take

                          any action at that time, this is,

                           I presume now you're telling me

                          as you're walking back or as you've

                          arrive back, you've seen this?

         PC417             I walked down to the North Stand

07.09                     right and saw the build up and

                           it looked wrong, that's the only

                          way I can describe it.

         DCS6930          Did you compare that with 1988?

                           (000088).

         PC417            I I think I compared it with

                          every bloody football match I've

07.27                     ever been to.   There were nobody

                          in the outer pens, well couldn't

                          see n obod y in there, you know the

                          distribution was was bad.

         DCS6930          Did you speak to anybody about

                          that?

        PC417             No.

        DCS6930           Did you consider you should have

                          spoken to an yb od y about that?
ILLINGWORTH         DAVID ALFRED


         PC417              You mean on reflection?

         DCS6930            Alright, on reflection first yes?

         PC417              No.

         DCS6930            No.    What did you think, let's say

                            that you obviously recognise there

                            that there's a problem.    What did

                            you think would happen as people

                            came in?

         PC417              I would I thought they would

                            obviously, there was, to jjne can we

                            take this...

         DSCS6930          Yes.

         PC417              Back a little bit.

         DCS6930           Yeah.

08.15    PC417             The Notts Forest fans were in well

                           before the Liverpool fans, right,

                           the Notts Forest fans were out

                           shouting out singing the Liverpool

                           fans prior to two o'clock (1400).

                           That surprised me because in other

                           matches I have never ever seen that

                           I were there (000088) and and the

                           build up was was gradual.        It didn't

                           happen that year and I thought,

                           where is everybody, couldn't

08.40                      understand it.     I got back at

                           two oclock (1400) and looked two

                           almost empty sections of the

                           ground.     So to me there was
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             obviously a lot more people to

                            ccme.      You knew, they're not just

                             staying in Liverpool and gonna

                            watch TV.     They're obviously

                             gonna cane in with the centre

                             section being full logically to me

                             I thought that the fans would be

09.05                       directed to the outer wings I

                             think that's the fairest way I can

                             put it.

         DCS6930             Hew do you think those people

                             decide where they're gonna go if

                             if it is full in those tvro centre

                             pens, hew do you think they

                             decide to, shall we say move across

                             to other pens or otherwise.      As far

                             as you're concerned can they move

                            out of those pens if they want to?

09.31    PC417               It's very very difficult, they

                            do move out from the centre pens

                            outwards and in runs it's because

                            they climb over the bloody railings

                            quite often obviously they

                            can't do that en mass but but but

                            it's something that happens at most

09.48                       major matches.     The only other

                            way is go back down the tunnel or

                            go through the little gates at

                            the top of the radial fences.

         DCS6930             So you've obviously got previous

                            knowledge of that?

         PC417              Oh yeah.

         DCS6930            And it's happened before?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            So although you were, as you say,

                            quite....

         PC417              Perturbed.

         DCS6930            Perturbed or surprised at seeing

                            what you saw did it occur to you

                            that those, that quite full pens

                            that there was a problem, in terms

                            of the likelihood of people being...

         PC417              Injured.

         DCS6930            Injured or crushed as a unit?

                            Or did you expect them, if they

                            were in that situation just to

                            move across?

10.28    PC417              No, no I didn't I didn't expect them

                            to start climbing out.   I think I

                            had a a feeling of awe, can I put

                            it that way?   Over over the situation,

                            as soon as I walked back on the

                            track.

10.44    DCS6930            It would take you how long to

                            walk up to those pens then from

                            the North Stand?

         PC417              I would think it's probably

                            about 70 yards.

10.55    DCS6930            A couple of minutes?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            You talk about bad distribution

11.02                       whose responsibility do you

                            think it is, or have you have you

                            previously thought it was to

                            actually put that crowd in the

                            right place?

         PC417              Control Roans.

         DCS6930            Which Control Roan do you mean?

11.15    PC417              The Police Control Roan.

         DCS6930            The Police Control Roan.   To your

                            knowledge hew have they done that in

                            the past?

         PC417              I l l can't answer that question

                            cause I don't knew.

         DCS6930            You don't know.   But you've always

                            assumed that the the pens were....

11.37    PC417              Well I always assumed sir that

                            somebody is controlling, organising

                            the situation.

         DCS6930            Okay then.   And, but specifically

                            now about where the crowd go.

                            You've always believed that that

                            was in the hands of the senior

                            officers in the Police Control

                            Roan?

         PC417              Yes.

11.53    DCS6930            Did you ever consider it was a
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             responsibility that the club

                             took on, shall we say by the use of

                             Stewards?

         PC417               I think we're going on to a

                            broader issue now,   I know I

                            went through a public inquiry

                             I knew what you're getting at. I

                             I don't knew what the organisation

12.09                        is, I don't know what what

                            responsibilities stewards have and

                            whose percentage blame whatever it

                            it is and all that business, I can't

                            answer that one.

         DCS6930            Okay, if you recognised the problem

                            and you've said that even in sort of

                            retrospect, you still don't think

                            you could have said anything or

                            spoke to the Control Roan and

                            said, There's something wrong

                            here, it's not being distributed

                            properly?

         PC417              We keep caning tip with that

                            stupid word hindsight don't we, in

                            hindsight I could said at say ten

12.38                       to three (1450), after just coming

                            back to the situation that I'd not

                            been with for forty minutes right

                            I could have gone on the radio

                            and said, What you're doing
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             here, why is there so many

12.51                        thousand people in in the centre

                             section and nobody in the outer

                             section.    Nobody would take the

                             blind bit of notice of me.

         DCS6930            Okay, do you think that if you

                             hadn't of gone for refreshment, and

                            you'd have been on that track

                            all the time, do you think you'd

                            have noticed that build up being

                            as you described, wrong?       The

                            distribution being bad?

         PC417               It's it's a possibility sir.          It's

                             a possibility but then again, when

                            you're down on the track you've

                             got a different view point, right,

13.22                        I came in frcm the North Stand

                            and it hit me that it was, looked

                            badly distributed.        Had I been

                            perhaps on the track all the time

                             I perhaps wouldn't have recognised

                            it.

         DCS6930            I think you've said already again

                            in your statement that virtually

13.41                       as soon as you got back you

                            recognised that the supporters

                            were in trouble?     Is that right?

13.50    PC417              No.     Did I say that.

         DCS6930            If I, if I refer to to your
ILLINGWORIH        DAVID   ALFRED


14.05                        statement, you you are returning

                             at 2.45 (1445), 2.50 (1450) and

                            you found PC HELLIWELL standing

                            behind the goal.   You saw the centre

                            pens were full but the two outer pens

                            were only half full.   You say

                             say this surprised you as you'd

                             never seen the fans so badly

14.22                       distributed.   So it says at

                             first there didn't appear to be a

                             a serious problem and the fans

                            were swaying back and forth and

                             sane were climbing fran the pens.

         PC417              That's right yeah, yeah.

14.30    DCS6930            This is a ccmmon occurrence.     The

                             swaying and pushing became much

                            worse to the extent that females

                            were screaming and fans were

                            beginning to panick.

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            How, what sort of time is that, can

                            you say?

         PC417              It, it's very very difficult, I I

                            the only when you don't know what

                            time you start off, I, the only way

14.50                       explain it was, I'd been there a

                            few minutes, that's all, I'm sorry

                            sir, that's all I can say.     I can't

                            say it were two minutes, four
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            minutes whatever.

         DCS6930             So it's within a a short space of

                            time as opposed to straight away?

         PC417              Well what's a short space of time?

         DCS6930             I think what I was perhaps referring

15.11                       to was when you gave evidence at

                            the public inquiry, which was on

                            the 8th of June (080689), I think,

                            you were asked a question at seme

                            stage which said, did it appear to

                            get full, and you said, it

                            immediately all went wrong at the

                            front?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Are we talking about virtually that

                            same time then, within that, there's

                            a spell when everything seems to be

                            alright, and then all of a sudden

                            you get the screaming and the

                            shouting?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Is that what you're referring to

                            there, that it immediately all went

                            wrong?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            As opposed to coming back and it

                            all being wrong straight away?

         PC417              I I don't quite follow you there.

         DCS6930            Well...
ILLINGWOKIH        DAVID   ALFRED


         PC417               I'll, I will try and explain it.

         DCS6930            Yes.

15.53    PC417               I got there, met Hedley, Hedley

                            HELLIWELL, everything was hunky

                            dory.     There was no problem apart

                            fran my own opinion that I wouldn't

                            to put meself in that situation.

                            There was alot of swaying, pushing,

                            shouting, that kind of business

                            which was reasonably nonral and

                            it didn't over concern me, but it

16.22                       suddenly did concern me.     It

                            suddenly got to a point for me

                            where it was unacceptable.

         DCS6930            Right.

         PC417              If that clarifies it.

         DCS6930            Yes okay then.    Now you

                            obviously can't put a time on

                            that?

         PC417              I I can I can put a time on it but

                            it's a total guess.

         DCS6930            Give me the guess can you?

16.42    PC417              I I would think I got back

                            to my original position and met

                            Hedley at a guess, ten to three,

                            (1450).    Right. And I would guess

                            I had been there, at a guess,

                            four minutes.

          PC417              And that's total it's total guess

                             work.    Only I don't mean tied it

                             tying it down to it.

          DCS6930            No.     If we go back to those, some of

                             those photographs that we showed

                             you before.

          PC417              Yeah.

17.11     DCS6930            I think you you confirm actually

                             that you're you're back and I think

                             it's the ones that are timed at

                             2.52 (1452) 2.54 (1454) which

                             are frcm Document Number 162

                             photograph numbers 28 and 29.

                             We can't say whether that clock

                             is right or in any way accurate.

          PC417              What time's that one?

          DCS6930            Its, according to the natch one.

          PC417              Yeah.

          DCS6930            It's 2.52 (1452).    And then if you

                             look at the next one, photograph

                             29, it's 2.54 (1454).

          PC417              Yeah.

17.49    DCS6930             So the possibility is there that

                             you, you could have been back

                             between three and four minutes?

         PC417               Yeah.

17.55    DCS6930            And there's nobody on the the

                            trackside at that time.     Is that

                            right?
ILLINGWQKIH        DAVID ALFRED


         PC417             That's right, yeah.

         DCS6930           So which vrould tend to confirm

                           what you've said that when you

                           got back for that three or four

                           minutes things appeared to be.

         PC417             Normal for that time. I just can

                           see that that's a reasonable

                           normal build up.

         DCS6930           Right.   The the officer is

                           pointing to photograph number 29

                           and saying that....

         PC417             I would say the crowd there is is

                           apart frcm the bad distribution

                           is in in a normal state for a

                          capacity football match.

         DCS6930          Right, so the officer is pointing at

                          photograph number 29 saying

                          that that's quite nonrel

                          apart frcm the bad distribution.

                          You you're quite happy with the crowd

                          at that point?

         PC417            The people at that stage were

                          comfortable.

         DCS6930          Right.

         PC417            Well not comfortable perhaps not

                          the right word, but.

         DCS6930          Nothing out of the normal?

18.43    PC417            Nothing seriously untoward at

                          that stage no.
ILLINGWOKIH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930             Thank you.     If we look back,

                             I'm sorry to go back to it again,

                             if you look at a photograph which

                             is the the same Document Number 162

                             it's the first photograph number 1

                            but with the same time clock, this

                             is frcm a a very different position

                            and it's not a good photograph, but

                             it's timed at one minute to three

                             2.59 (1459).

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Does that give you any any

                            different impression or any

                            other impression of the crowd?

         PC417               I've I've seen that photograph.

         DCS6930            Yes.

         PC417              I don't think so no, I don't know.

         DCS6930            Okay thank you.

         PC417              Obviously by that stage things

                            had developed the crowd was in a

                            much obviously what's moved on frcm

                            54 to 59 you see five minutes

                            have progressed there.

         DCS6930            That's fine.     Now again in that

                            time frcm when you came back

                            to there, we we know I think if we

19.53                       can look at Document Number 150

                            which is a photograph, photograph

                            number 14 that is timed at the
ILLINGWOKIH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             same time at 2.59 (1459), I think

                             it shows, does it show Gate 4

                            open?

         PC417               I can't say looking at that

                            there's no numbering, or there

                            is a number but its....

         DCS6930            But it's the wrong way round.

                            Can you assist with the the

                            hoardings or anything to identify

                            that gate, and there are two

                            police officers there?

         PC417              Well there's three I think.

         DCS6930            Three is there.

         PC417              You mean looking at the whole

                            geography of the ground.

         DCS6930            Well firstly if we look at the

                            police officers by any chance

                            can you say whether one of those

                            could be you?

20.40    PC417              I wouldn't of thought any of

                            those were me.

         DCS6930            You wouldn't think so.     If you

                            look at the time it's very

                            difficult to work out but there's

                            seme red dots with the time on.

                            dots with the time on.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            I think it's timed at 1459 (1459).

         PC417              Yeah.
ILLINGW0R3H        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            And I think if you'll accept frcm

                            me that that is actually Gate 4.

         PC417              Yeah I'll accept that.

         DCS6930            Gate 4 open.     I think that's the

                            right one.     That's Gate 4

                            we've vrorked that out frcm the

                            position frcm the audience.

         PC417              From the audience.

         DCS6930            Right.     New there are other police

                            officers there.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            At that time.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            And what what I want to get at is

                            this that if that's the case I

21.20                       think you say at sane stage that

                            you were the one that opened the

                            gate, Gate 4, and moved a number of

                            people away?

         PC417              Yeah.

21.28    DCS6930            Hew long would you have said it was

                            before you were joined by other

                            police officers or other police

                            officers got to Gate 4?

         PC417              You you want me to say minutes?

         DCS6930            If if you can?

         PC417              I'm I find it difficult to say in

                            minutes.    For me it was a a

                            lifetime.
ILLINGWORIH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            Yes.

21.48    PC417               Right.   And I thought to meself

                            when is somebody going to turn

                            up here to the situation and

                             I couldn't understand why

                             nobody were turning up.     I

                            couldn't understand it.      I

22. 00                       thought surely to god people can

                             see what's going on here.       And

                             that photograph as good as it

                             is, is well, well into the event.

         DCS6930             Yeah, yeah well that's what I

                            want to get at, because what

21.13                        I'm trying to get at is if you

                             have, opened that gate and moved

                             people out, you have taken

                             them along to Gate 5 and sometimes

                            Gate 6.     Is that right?

         PC417              That's right yes.

         DCS6930            And put them in which is a

                            distance can you estimate

                             frcm four shall we say to six?

         PC417               I would say thirty forty yards.

         DCS6930            Thirty forty yards.

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Can you remember how many times you

                            did that.    Did you sort of walk up

                            and ccme back and walk up and

                            cane back?
ILLINGWOKIH        DAVID ALFRED


         PC417             I walked up and cane back and

                           walked up and cane back.

         DCS6930           Right.

         PC417             But I don't know how many times

                           I did that sir, I'm not saying

                           I went directly to the gate

                           every time.

         DCS6930           No.

22.58    PC417             I was going backwards and forwards

                           trying to usher people.

         DCS6930           Right, so but it does appear that

                           we've got a photograph 2.54 (1454)

23.04                     which shows everything alright and

                           the gate shut.

         PC417             Yeah.

         DCS6930          We've got a photograph with other

23.12                     officers at 2.59 (1459) there and

                          the gate open.

         PC417            Five minutes later.

3.16    DCS6930           Somewhere between 2.54 (1454) and

                          2.59 (1459) is when you've opened

                          that gate.     So it's it's....

         PC417            Yeah I know—

         DCS6930          It's it's certainly before 2.59

                          (1459).

23.27   PC417             Between 2.54 (1454) 2.59 (1459)

                          all hell broke loose

         DCS6930          Right.

         PC417            But I don't know what time it was.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930             But you you vrould accept that it's

                            well before kick off time shall we

                             say?

23.38    PC417              (Si, way, way yeah way before kick

                            off tine.   But nobody were looking

                            nobody noticed.

         DCS6930            No.

         PC417               I don't knew why, whether they

                            were reading the paper, or what

                            they were doing.

         DCS6930            And it would take you seme time

                            to walk from that gate to Pen 6

                            and back?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            And for other officers to actually

                            walk round to it?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Which would suggest that it's

                            certainly, probably, and I'm not

                            putting words into your mouth now

                            but 2.57 (1457) would not be

                            unreasonable looking at that as

                            a time for you to open the gate.

                            2.56 (1456) even 2.57 (1457)?

         PC417              I don't know whether you're trying

                            to put words into my mouth or not

                            you're trying to pinpoint me down,

                            I don't know sir.

         DCS6930            No.
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


          PC417               I don't knew.

          DCS6930            Okay thank you.

          PC417              But I can tell you by the time

24.21                        that photograph were taken and

                             those bobbies joined me at 58

                             was it, I'd been on me own for a

                             long long time.

          DCS6930            Okay, that that answers the question

                             really it it ccmes round.   Thankyou.

                              (Pause).

          DCS6930            You heard and you say referring

                             back to your statement at the

24.57                        middle of page three, you put a

                             radio message out, you you'd you

                             actually say females screaming and

                             shouting, and beginning to panic,

                             can you remember, this is difficult

                             w hen you say screaming and shouting

                             and you obviously realised there was

                             a problem.   Was it what they were

                             saying that made you realise the

                             problem or was it your visual look

                             that saw the condition?

         PC417               I l l would suggest it was both, sir.

         DCS6930             In that case can you tell me what

                             you can, anything you can recollect

                             them actually saying?

25.38    PC417               I can recollect words of 'Help'

                             certainly 'Help' sticks out, 'We're
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            being crushed here.' Words to to

                             that effect.

         DCS6930            Okay fine.      And when you say you saw

                             saw things as well that alerted you,

                            can you describe what you did see

                            that that alerted you at the sane

                            time?

26.02    PC417              I I would say the mood, the situation

                            at the front changed in a flash,

                             (clicked fingers), I don't know

                            why, frcm people in enjoying

                            themselves in a pretty relaxed

                            state to one of serious disccmfort.

         DCS6930            Right.    You then put out on your

26.27                       radio a message, and is this right,

                            again frcm your statement, scmething

                            to the effect, there is a serious

                            crush down here, it is serious?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            And that would have been directed at

                            the Police Control Room at the

                            ground?

         PC417              Well it was directed into my radio

                            but.

        DCS6930             Yeah.

        PC417               Core through yeah.

        DCS6930             That's who you would have been

                            talking to?

        PC417               Yeah.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


26.48    DCS6930             Did you get a response to that?

         PC417               I I don't knew sir.

         DCS6930            You don't know.

26.52    PC417               I certainly didn't hear a response

                            because either I didn't get one

                            or the volume went, I don't know.

         DCS6930            Can, can I just ask you about your

                            radio, do you have a separate ear

                            piece on on that duty or do you have

                            to rely on listening to the sound

                            from the radio itself?

         PC417              I haven't got an ear piece.

         DCS6930            You haven't got an ear piece so you

                            are, if you like, fighting amongst

                            alot of noise as well as the radio?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Can you describe for me the sort of

                            noise there was at that time frcm

                            the the the ground itself the

                            supporters?

                            (Pause).

         DCS6930            Other other, I'm not talking about

                            and the screams and the pain.

        PC417               No.

        DCS6930             I'm talking about the normal

                            football crowd noise.

        PC417               Yeah well I would suggest that you

                           must know yourself, I mean everybody

                           knows what its like.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            And can I say it's perhaps for the

                            benefit of the other people rather

                             than me.

27.45    PC417               I I can describe it on that day

                            and roost capacity football games,

                            it's a cauldron the the the

                            volume range is is I don't know

                            what decibel level it gets to I

                            don't knew.     It's....

         DCS6930            Do you normally have difficulty

                            with your radio in terms of hearing

                            what's going on?

         PC417              At a normal everyday football league

                            natch, no.

         DCS6930            If if on that day, somebody fran the

                            Control Roan was trying to call you

                            at that time?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Five to three (1455) seven minutes

                            to three (1453), would you

                            realistically have been able to hear

                            that call?

         PC417              Pot luck.

         DCS6930            Pot luck.

28.25    PC417              It's just pot luck whether whether

                            you you you pick it up or you don't.

                            I mean I'm not I'm not deaf

                            I've got quite good hearing but its

                            if you're there and theres all the
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             volume arranged, it's w h eth e r you

                             pick it up or you don't.     It's just

         DCS6930             Right.

         PC417               I can't describe it any better.

         DCS6930             No, that's okay.    You you say again

                             on page three that you recognise it

28.51                       was obvious that people against the

                             fence were in serious trouble?

         PC417               Yes.

         DCS6930             What did you do at that very time,

                             you've recognised people are in

                             trouble, you've heard people

                             screaming that they are being

                             crushed, what did you actually do?

29.09    PC417               Put the radio over, and did all all

                             I I could to do.

29.20    DCS6930             Can you tell me, was that the point

                             that you then opened the gate?

                             Gate 4?

29.27    PC417               Yes.

         DCS6930             Was there any delay whatsoever, did

                             you consider, lets if we go back to

                             Document, hang on a sec, Document

                             194 which, when we go back to those,

                             that that Order that came to you?

         PC417               Yeah.

29.46    DCS6930             In terms of your responsibility and

                             it says, on this page 1145, on that

                            Appendix B to the the match order, no
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            one is allowed access to the track.

         PC417              Yeah.

30.00    DCS6930            Did that in any way inhibit you

                            opening that gate at that time?

30.06    PC417              Not at all sir, no.

         DCS6930            Did it feature at all in your

                            thoughts?

         PC417               I never considered it I usually

                            break orders, but I never thought

                            about it.

         DCS6930            You never thought about it?       You

                            therefore are saying that once you

                            realised there was a problem, you

                            opened the gates, for what reason?

         PC417              To help people.

         DCS6930            To help people ccme onto the track?

30.41    PC417              It appeared to me, without a doubt,

                            that if the situation was to remain

                            for a minute, a short time longer,

                            that somebody was going to get

                            injured, right, that was obvious to

                            me and then there was no other

                            alternative than to evacuate them.

         DCS6930            Right.

31.02    PC417              Right.    I couldn't wait for a

                            senior officer as what it says in

                            there, it had to be done there and

                            then.    I wasn't frightened of

                            shouldering the responsibility
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             meself and I accepted it.

          DCS6930            So you moved a number of people out,

                             or they came out and you transferred

                             them across to the other pens?

 31.28    PC417              I opened the gate.   Right.   And

                             I can tell you the first kid out,

                             I don't know if you've seen him

                             or not, but I know, I can

                             virtually picture his face, he came

                             out no problem, he got a leg injury

                             I sat him on the wall, right so, I

                             my story's not gonna alter you can

                             question me until the cows cane

                             home but it won't alter.    Sat him

                             on the wall, other people kept

                             coming out, I tried to get them to

                             number 5, I opened number 5, I

                             couldn't get them in because the

                             people was ...raised, I don't

                             know if you know the geography.

         DCS6930             Yes.

         PC417               I couldn't get the people who

                            were stood behind the gate to move

                            back, so it was getting chaotic

32.10                       a little bit chaotic, but I thought

                             I was reasonably in control, I

                            thought the only place I can take

                            them now is down to number 6 which

                            is is the next avenue, as it were and
ILLINGWORTH         DAVID   ALFRED


                              I did get some people in there, but

                              as as people are following you, you

                              how many other people are behind

                              them.   Do you understand?

         DCS6930              Can I just clarify something you

                              said?

         PC417                Yeah.

         D5CS6930             You know you said Gate 5, was that

                              not the sterile empty area?

         PC417               Well it's where the radial fence

                              is.

         DCS6930              It's, it's the very small, w h ere?

         PC417                The tunnel.

         DCS6930              Gap.

         PC417                Yeah.

         DCS6930              Now there there was no no actual

                              supporters in there were there, in

                              that part?

         PC417               There there was some directly behind

                             the gate yeah.

         DCS6930             Directly behind the gate.     Had they

                              just got there themselves?

         PC417               Yeah.

32.53    DCS6930             I see yes that's okay.    So the end

                             result was you moved them all most

                             of them through to Pen 6?

         PC417               That that was the only option left

                             open to me.

         DCS6930             Okay fine.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


33.00    PC417               It concerned me that there was a

                             lot of people on the track that

                             I wanted to shift.

         DCS6930            When you were doing that, did

                            and again you you've explained the

                            difficulty over radio

                            conmunication, did you then

                            use your radio again to tell them

                            what you were doing and the reason

                            why again?

         PC417              No. No.

         DCS6930            You just got on with it did you?

         PC417              Yeah.

33.24    DCS6930            Right.     Did anybody cane and, or to

                            your knowledge did anybody question

                            why you were doing it?

         PC417              You mean police officers?

         DCS6930            Yes.     Senior Police Officers.

33.33    PC417              Well there was nobody there.

         DCS6930            No.     Again the difficulty if they

                            had been talking over the radio

                            asking you what you were doing it's

                            unlikely presumbly you would have

                            heard it anyway?

         PC417              Probably no.

         DCS6930            Okay.     It it brings me on really to

                            the the specific allegations that

                            some of those supporters have made

                            against against you and the first
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             one I'd like to mention is Mr

34.03                        LEIGH.   He says that together with

                             other supporters he was shouting at

                             a policeman walking along the

                             perimeter track to open the gates

                             and that the police officer really

                             should have helped the supporters.

                             He specifically says that the

                             officer turned to them and

                             appeared to mouth the words,

34.26                         'Shut up you dickheads'.   He

                             does actually describe you by

                             saying, middle aged, well built

                             with a grey full moustache, greying

                             hair.

                             Did you in any way say anything

                             like, 'Shut up you dickheads'

                             towards those supporters?

          PC417              No.

          DCS6930            Is it possible you could have said

                             anything that could have been

                             misinterpreted as that?

         PC417               I've given these complaints some

                             thought, obviously.              v

         DCS6930             Yes. ;

34.57    PC417               That particular complaint I've

                             given a a small percentage of me

                             thoughts to because I don't really

                             think it's worth taking on board.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             But I have given it some

                             consideration and I've thought

                            why is this man saying this

35.14                       cause I know I didn't say that.

                            The only slightest thing I've

                            thought about that I would

                            think he's a reasonable bloke

                            not making a wild accusation,

                            that I may at seme time, I was on me

                            own, right and I was getting

                            perhaps a a little bit annoyed and

                             frustrated, not with the people,

                            with the control of the situation

                            and the only recollection, I'm

                            not saying that I did this or

                            I didn't do it, the only thing

                            I can recollect that he may have

35.51                       misinterpreted I might have

                            said to him, 'Look I'm doing me

                            fucking best' right, if he said

                            I said, 'Shut up you dickheads'

35.59                       I I didn't say that.

         DCS6930            You didn't say that.   But what

                            you're actually saying is the

                            intensity of the situation

                            you were partly annoyed with the

                            the way things were turning out?

         FC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            And an immediate reaction.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


36.15    FC417               I certainly didn't say, 'Shut

                            up you dickheads.'

         DCS6930            You certainly didn't say that?

         PC417              No.

         DCS6930            Okay.

         PC417               I was trying to help the people.

         DCS6930            Have you ever heard that phrase

                            before?     Dickheads?

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            You have?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            You, I mean can you explain it

                            to me then or for the benefit

                            of others, what do you think it

                            means?

         PC417              Dickhead? (laughter). Are you

                            serious?

         DCS6930            Well it helps in terms of other

                            people that that may be reviewing

                            what we're talking about who...

         PC417              Dickheads?

         DCS6930            Perhaps explain that you have

                            some knowledge of it.

         PC417              What what, you want me to explain?

        DCS6930             Where would you have, where do you

                            think it comes from?

        PC417               Who originated it, I haven't got

                            a clue.    Dickhead, it was a

         DCS6930            A man called Mr Carrott is it?

         FC417               Jasper Carrott.

         DCS6930             Jasper Carrott.

         PC417               I think he perhaps did it originally.

37.03    DCS6930             Okay fine.    Thats, I only just

                            wanted to know whether you'd ever

                            heard the phrase before.

37.06    PC417              Yes I have.

         DCS6930            Good, thank you.     (Pause).

37.14                        In fact Mr LEIGH makes another

                             allegation and this isn't directed

                             at you at all but I'd I'd just like

                            to know whether you can help with it.

                            He does say that when he finally

                            got onto the pitch, he was picked

37.25                       up by two police officers and

                            thrown against some hoardings.

                            Can you recollect anything like

                            that taking place in your presence?

         PC417              No for me.

         DCS6930            And I can't, I know there's alot

                            of people on the pitch, but does

                            that in any way....

37.39    PC417              No, I've no recollection of that

                            at all so I can't help you at all.

         DCS6930            To your knowledge have you ever met

                            or spoken to Mr LEIGH?

         PC417              No.

 IlilNGWDRTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                              of people on that track and on that

                             pitch at seme stage but it for no

                              reason he doesn't appear to have

                             communicated with you?

37.56     PC417              The name LEIGH doesn't doesn't mean

                             anything to me.

          DCS6930            No okay then, fine.

                             The second allegation that was

                             that was made specifically against

                             you was in fact made by a man called

38.14                        Mr SPEARRITT, and what he has said

                             relates around the death of his son

                             Adam and his own injuries and he

38.33                        really says that you you failed to

                             open Gate 4 despite his loud

                             appeals to you.    You were in close

                             proximity to him and that your

                             failure to act, had a direct bearing

                             on the death of his son and his

                             injuries.   There there are other

                             people that have said that the police

                             officer on that gate didn't seem

                             to appreciate the problem as

                             explained to me, already, that as

                             soon as you recognised something

                             was wrong, you acted.    You

                             particularly mention female

                            be able to pick out in shouting

                             assistance or help?

         DCS6930             Is there, is there any way in which

                            you feel that you didn't act quickly

                            enough.    Is there anything that you

                            can you can say pinpoints to the

                             fact that you were hesitant or

                            withdrawn about actually opening

                             those gates and helping people out?

39.54    PC417               I I would say quite the contrary

                             sir.   I I acted immediately frcm my

                            view point.   I acted very well,

                             I did extremely well and if I had of

                            not acted when I did, there would

                            certainly have been more people dead.

40.12                       If I'd have stuck to my instructions,

                            my orders, then more people would

                            difficult and I only want to, if

                            we can, if we can go through it as

         PC417              Leppings Lane Terrace.

         DCS6930            Yeah.

41.11    PC417              There could be somebody at the back

                            of the terrace shouting for help,

                            but I couldn't hear it.

         DCS6930            So there is a chance that because

                            of the noise, that these people that

                            thought that you could hear them,

                            that because of where you were

                            there is the possibility that you

                            couldn't hear them because of the

                            noise?

         PC417              It's a possibility but where was

                            the guy, where was he?

         DCS6930            Well he was in Pen 4.
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


         FC417               Yeah, where abouts?

         DCS6930             So he's he's more or less towards

                             the front side of Pen 4.

         PC417               Yeah, near the goal or towards,

                             I don't know, I haven't got a clue

                            where he was.

         DCS6930            No, no I accept that, and what I'm

                             trying to say or what I'm trying

                             to say is, there there is a lot of

                             noise there, and alot of people, a

                             number of other people have said you

                             know they were shouting and it

                             didn't appear to register.      What

                            you're saying is, if I understand it,

42.01                        the first time that any, that it

                             registered with you that people

                            were shouting for help, you you

                             acted.     You did something?

42.10    FC417              Yes.      Of me own volition.

         DCS6930            Of your own volition.      I mean can

                            can I say this.     What what I'm

                            trying to say is this, there is for

                            example I think there's there's a

                            photographer behind that that

                            goal, that's fairly close to you,

                            and I think you've seen him there

                            on numerous matches, who actually

                            refers to you and says you did a

                            tremendous job, you you were there
 ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                              late on in the day and worked very

                             hard and a lot of people have said

                             that about police officers, and in

                             his position, it appears he didn't

                             hear people shouting for help,

                             maybe he was concentrating on

                             different things.    It really is

                             just a matter of of trying to work

                             out with the amount of crowd noise

                             etc as to whether it was reasonable

                             that you would have been able to

                             pick out specific pleas for help.

43.00     PC417              I understand what you mean sir yeah,

                             can explain it, if you've got,

                             I don't know how many hundreds

                             of people shouting, they can't,

                             it's impossible to pick out one

                             individual voice.

          DCS6930            In relation to those specific

                             complaints then you are saying that

                             you acted as quickly as possible

                             once you recognised that people

                             vrere in distress?

43.30    PC417               I acted, not good on that day,

                             not very good, I acted brilliantly.

                             Tate it from me I I can't take you

                             back through time I have not got

                             it on video, I did very well and

                             how anybody can make an allegation
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             against me is I find it very

                             difficult to accept.

                             (Pause).

         DCS6930             If we can finish at that point

                             there's not too much to go

                            afterwards.    Can I time that

                            now at 11.41 (1141).

                            That's the termination of the

                             interview and if you can

00.10    DCS6930            This is the continuation of an

                            interview at Fumival House with

                            Police Constable ILLINGW3RTH,

                            the time is 11.44 (1144) on the

                             12th of June 1990 (120690).     I am

00.44    DCS6930            Thank you.    Can I remind you
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             again, you you're still under

                            caution.

         PC417               Yeah.

         DCS6930             PC ILLINGWORTH thank you.     You helped

                             and I think gave first aid to a

                            considerable number of people after

                            opening those gates and letting than

                            out.      Is that right?

         PC417               I wouldn't say I gave first aid to

                             a considerable number of people,

01.09                        I helped out a considerable

                             number of people.

         DCS6930             Yes.

         PC417              And perhaps gave first aid to sane.

01.18    DCS6930            And you remained at those Leppings

                             Lane terraces.     Can you give me any

                             idea of length of time that you that

                            you remained helping people?

         PC417               No.     I'm sorry I'm not trying to

                            be obstructive.

         DCS6930             No.

         PC417               I just don't know the time.

         DCS6930            No.      But I think it's it's fair to

                             say that you you did help a

                            considerable number of people with

                            with other officers and...

         PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            St Johns Ambulance and and others.

                             (Pause).
ILLINGWORIH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            You at sane stage ware involved in

01.56                       what is really a a a rescue

                            operation and you have said

                             specifically, if I can refer

                            to the last page of your

                             statement, the statement that

02.16                       you made or the report that

                            you made.   You actually make

                            the point at the very end

                            that you didn't feel that

                            anybody control?

         PC417              Oh I thought that piece

                            had been taken out.

         DCS6930            Well I don't whether it was

                            taken out or hew it was

                            taken out but the, the fact

                             is that the document that

                             I have got actually specifically re

                            specifically refers to you

                            saying that you don't think

                            people took control.    Can can

                            I ask you....

         PC417              I made an an original report

                            I was asked to do it,

                            nobody gave me any instructions

                            or nothing, that that were my

                            original feelings at the time.

         DCS6930            Yes.

02.59    PC417              Right and submitted it.    I got a
ILLINGWORIH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             typed copy back with that

                             last sentence taken out.

                            So I didn't know you'd you'd got

                            the original.

         DCS6930            Right.   Well do you agree that

                            you actually said that?

         PC417              (Si yeah, yes.

         DCS6930            Was that something that you you

                            still feel now?

         PC417              Yes.

         DCS6930            Can you just explain to me what made

                            you think that at the time, and I

                            presume you're talking, and this is

03.35                       presumption, are are you talking

                            about senior police officers not

                            taking control?

03.38    PC417              Yeah.

         DCS6930            Can you explain to me in what

                            format you mean that?

         PC417              Well, from the original, you see this

                            event for different people, starts at

                            different times, it's when it

                            registers to them that something is

                            amiss.   Do you understand?   People

                            said to me why weren't they started

                            by quarter past three (1515). For

                            me it started early.

         DCS6930            Yes.

         PC417              And I couldn't register that to
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             anybody else.   Do you understand?

         DCS6930            Yes.

04.16    PC417              Over that period that I felt that

                             somebody should have taken control.

         DCS6930             I see.

04.24    PC417              At an early stage.   Once into the

                            disaster I can only describe it as

                            mayhem and I don't think anybody

                            could have taken more control than

                            was done.

         DCS6930            Than was done.   So you, the

                            clarification then is that you say

                            that you felt there was a a a lack of

                            control between when you first had

                            your problem which you recognised

                            and you were doing something about

                            it and you were on your own if you

                            like?

         PC417              Yes.

04.51    DCS6930            That that nobody recognised the

                            problem and did something about it?

         PC417              You've got it, yeah there's that

                            was perhaps what made me put that

                            last sentence in.

05.03    DCS6930            I see, yeah, that, I understand.

                            Superintendent GREENWOOD was your

                            Superintendent in terms of control

                            of that area of the ground.    Can

                            you recall the first time that
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            you actually saw him?

         PC417              No.     Mr GREENWOOD is not a nan

                             that I'm familiar with, he's never,

                            you know, been my boss and I've

                            never worked on his division or

                            anything like that I don't know

05.29                       the fella.    To be honest I have no

                            recollection of seeing him on that

                            day.

         DCS6930            Can I go back then to Inspector

                            DARLING and to Sergeant CHAPMAN?

         PC417              Yeah.

05.38    DCS6930            After you've opened the gate, Gate

                             4, and the incident is then

                            developing, do you recall and I

                            think your answer before saying

                            you couldn't remember seeing at

                            any time, but I I ask you again,

                            do you remember seeing Inspector

                            DARLING at any time after the

                            opening of Gate 4?

05.54    PC417              No.     I'm not saying he wasn't

                            there but I don't recall seeing

                            him.

         DCS6930            Do you ranember seeing Sergeant

                            CHAPMAN?

         PC417              No.

         DCS6930            No.

06.00    PC417              I'll tell you something that might
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             clarify it, I can't remember

                             seeing anybocty specific as an

                             individual.    Do you understand?

         DCS6930             Yes.

         PC417               I know I was there were policemen

                             there but I never sort of said,

                             well are you or that kind of thing, I

                             didn't recognise anybody it's

                             like a blur.   Difficult to

                             explain.

         DCS6930             This is going back a little bit

                             now but can can I just go back to the

                             original briefings, it's going

                             right to the back of the back to the

                             start of the game if you like, you

                             had a briefing off Chief

                             Superintendent DUCKENFIELD?

          PC417              Yeah.

06.36    DCS6930             Did you have a briefing off anybody

                             else at all?

         PC417               No.

         DCS6930             Not from Superintendent GREENWOOD?

         PC417               No.

         DCS6930             Not from Inspector DARLING?

         PC417               No.

         DCS6930             Is that normal?

         PC417               Yeah.

06.49    DCS6930             You would have one briefing and

                             then your duties you would take
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                             up as you've already discussed

                            with me?

06.56    PC417               Yes.

         DCS6930             Did that happen, saying, accepting

                             it wasn't Mr DUCKENFIEUD but it was

                            Mr MDLE in 1988 (000088).   Was that

                             the same format?

         PC417              At my recollection, yes Sir.

                             (Pause).

         DCS6930            We've been through a number of

                            photographs now and a number of

                            videos and a number of points, all

                             of which have concerned your your

                             duty on that day, and the action that

                            you took, and I've bought out a

                             number of things that people have

                             specifically alleged, and it is

                             fair to say particularly, that a

                            number of other people have said

                            how well, and hew tremendously well,

                            police officers, including yourself,

                             for example, the photographer there,

                            specifically mentions yourself and

                            the way in which you reacted and

                            what you did.   Is there anything

                            else that you would wish to say to

                            me now, in respect of the

08.15                       allegations that have been made by

                            Mr LEIGH and Mr SPEARRITT or any
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED


                            other aspect that you would wish

                             to bring up?

         PC417               I think so possibly, yes 3ir, but

                            whether it's in, it needs to be

                            obtained, I don't know.   Sane

                            things I would like clarifying.

         DCS6930            By all means .

08.38    PC417              Do you accept that I opened Gate

                             4?

         DCS6930            You have said to me you opened

                            Gate 4.

         PC417              Yes, but do you accept that I did,

                            you've done, I don't know 15

                            months investigation?

08.48    DCS6930             It it appears to me that you

                            opened Gate 4.

         PC417              And what time do you think it was?

         DCS6930            Well that's one of the areas that

                            we're trying to to cane round to on,

                            but it appears, and it's evident

                            that it's before three oclock (1500)

                            before 2.59 (1449).

         PC417              Yeah, that's that's as near as you

                            can get it to?

         DCS6930            At the moment which is why we've

                            pursued that particular point with

                            the other two police officers being

                            there, to try and bring it.

         PC417              Yeah.
ILLINGWORIH        DAVID   ALFRED


         DCS6930            Within a few minutes, yes.

09.18    PC417              Well I I can assure you that it was

                            well before 59 (1459).   I don't know

                            what time it was as I've said and I

                            can only emphasize the point, and

09.28                       it's me last chance that I did very

                            well on that day, if I hoi not done

                            and took response meself I think more

                            people would have died and it

                            amazed me intensely that I haven't

                            had a bit of thanks, nothing,

                            except criticism, since it

                            happened, and it's wrong.    That's

                            hew I look at it.

                            Did you contact the first kid out

                            of the gate with the leg injury?

         DCS6930            Well it it's fair to say a

                            number of people have been seen,

                            that have described the sort of

                            actions that you and other people

                            have taken.

         PC417              Forget other people, I'm not

                            bothered about other people.

         DCS6930            I know but lets, I'm talking about

                            yourself and the actions that

                            you've taken, and I know that

                            you've been of great assistance to

                            the inquiry in terms of those

                            people, I can't tell you at this
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED                                      98


                             time whether that particular person

                             that you refer to has been traced,

                             it's not something that is there.

                             If you wish at the end....

         PC417               Sorry, what do you mean it's not

                             there?

         DCS6930             It's it's not within my, I can't

                             actually tell you that at this

                             particular time here, I can stop

                             and I can find out later and we

                             can, I can discuss it with you.

         PC417               Yeah, sorry sir.       I weren't trying

                             to be difficult.

         DCS6930             No.     That's okay.

         PC417               You don't know, is that it?

         DCS6930             I I can't tell you off the top of

                             me head at the moment.

         PC417              At this time, that's fine.

         DCS6930             Yeah.

         PC417               Yeah.     I think that's about all.

                             I can you knew, there's people

                             I, questions that I would like

                             answering that are irrelevant

                            to the ccmplaints.

         DCS6930            Okay.

         PC417              So it it's pointless proceeding with

                            them.

11.06    DCS6930             Is there anything else you wish

                            to say?



                                                                            538
ILLINGWDRIH        DAVID   ALFRED                                  99


11.10    PC417               Not at this stage no.

11.13    DCS6930             Okay fine.   In that case the

                             situation is this, the facts will

                             be reported to the Director of

                             Public Prosecutions now and it's a

                            matter for him to decide whether

                             there are any criminal offences

                             that you m y have committed.     Do

                            you understand?

11.27    PC417              Wonderful. Yes.

         DCS6930             Thank you.   The interview is now

                             terminated at 11.55 (1155).     If

                             we can switch off the audio

                            deal with the discipline aspects

                             Thankyou.     And is that your

                             signature?

                             the complaint by Mr LEIGH with that

                            notice?

         PC417              Yes.

01.19    DCS6930             It is right that I should say to

                            you that there is a warning on

                            this that you're not as the

                            regulation explains, obliged to

                             say anything concerning the

                            matter, but you may if you wish

                            make a written or oral

                             statement to me or the Assistant

                            Chief Constable.      You are however

                            warned that if you make such a

                            statement, the statement may

                            be used in any subsequent

                            disciplinary proceedings.      Do

                            you understand that?

01.44    PC417              Yes.

01.46    DCS6930            You do.      If you agree   I would like

                            to use the questions and the

                            answers that we've already gone

                            through in the criminal interview

                            as the questions for the discipline

                            interview.     Do you agree to that?


                                                                             541
ILLINGWORTH        DAVID   ALFRED                                  102


         PC417               I agree.

         DCS6930             In that case I have no further

                            questions to put to you.     Is

                             there anything that you would

                            wish to add in respect of the

                            discipline side, before we

                             finish?

         PC417              No Sir.

02. 12   DCS6930            Thank you.     The final thing then

                             is that the facts will be

                            reported to your Chief Constable

                            and it will be for your force

                             in consultation with the Police

                            Complaints Authority to determine

                             if you should face any

                            disciplinary offences.     Do you

                            understand?

         PC417              I understand.

         DCS6930            The interview is terminated

                            shortly.     This is a notice I have

                            to serve on you which is in relation

                            interviews that we mentioned

                            earlier.    The interview is now

                            finished at 12.03 (1203).    If

tickets        or       to     carry        out     any      searching.                 Th e     c r o w d was       pressing            forward

to    such a degree                   tha t      I was       pi n n e d      to    the       w a 11 at       the     side        of    the

t u r n s t i 1 e u na b 1 e t o m o v e „




Fortunately              I being            at    No    1 t u r n s t i l e,         n ext       to G a t e      A on      the        SWFG      map

I was     able          to    force         my way          out    and       go    towards            Leppings        Ln where              there

were    Mounted              Officers            and    inform          them       of    the      position.               The      Mounted

0 f f 1 c e r s came            t o t h e f r o n t o f t he                 q ue ue     a n d f o r c e d t he           f a ns      ba c k i nt o

some     sort       of       o r d e r but        still          not    sufficient               to    search        or    check         ticket*

p r o p e r 1y .



There     was       a    1a r g e      amount          of    f a ns     that       had       the w r o n g       t i c k e t s for          the

out    causing           more         problems.              Without          any       more      real       problems            the     game

was    started and                I and                                 stayed          at     our     t u r n s t i 1 e u n 1 11        ha 1

t j.m e for        any        late c o m e r s .        There          was     a moderate              amount         of    these.              I

recall       there            were several youths                      who     had      no     tickets         and       they were

trying       all        sorts         of    tricks          to    get       in.     Producing               h alf    tickets,            t hat

had    obviously              already            been       used       to    gain       entry         and    by s o m e        means        had

been    b r o u g h t out        of        the    ground.              Despite          f a ns    wishing           to     get        in,e v e n

to    pay,     none           w e r e a l l o w e d in w i t h o u t           the      requisite            ticket.




At    haIf     time          I e n t e r ed       the       ground          and    stood         at    p o int      S on       the     map.




There     was       no o t h e r           incident          worthy          of    note        that     I can        r ec a l l .        1 was

right     at       the       b a ck    of     the      crowd       u n til        about        10 mi n u t es        before           full      ti m e

             covered         stairways        and     it wa s      apparent           that       there   was     a    lot    of    banging

              Further          to m y       report        dated 5.6.89              ( 0506 89)        re F A       semi    final       Liverpool,

              v Notts          Forest          Saturday          9th April          1988        (090488).




              Th e      ingress          of m o u n t e d    police        officers             assisted        greatly          in a l l e v i a t i n g

              the       crushing          at      the    turnstiles            where       I w as      present,          although         it

              continued             to    be      tightly        p ac k ed .



              I      could     not       g i ve    an    indication            t h at     the    problem        wa s     short       lived.        1

              would       liken          the      crowd     to    th e   flow       of w a t e r      from a tap w h i c h              then     ran

              down       the       plug     hole.         The     flow     became          greater        and      the    turnstiles            could

              not       cope,       ie the         basin     would       fill       up.         It wa s     only wh en           the    flow     of

              supporters             to     the     stiles        slowed        that       the     position         e a se d ,    that       to my

              recollection                was     a few m in u t e s           before          kick   off.

             only,     it was       apparent    t ha t    the   crushing    in    1 9 89 wa s     far,     far    more

             severe      and    sustained      than      in the   previous       year     of    1988.

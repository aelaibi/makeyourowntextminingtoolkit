                          Liverpool v Nottingham Forest
                               F. A. Cup Semi-Final
                                  15th April, 1989


         In your memorandum, reference              you ask for the
    observations of relatives or friends who attended the above match.

         I obtained tickets for my Cousin,               and his young
    son, and they sat in the seating behind the Terraces <*Â£. the Leppings
    Lane End of Hillsborough.

         They reached the ground at approximately 2. 40 p. m., and at that
    time there was the beginning of a rapid build-up of spectators
    outside.   The Police asked the crowd on several occasions, through
    loud hailers, to be patient.   Some fans were trying to scale a
    wall into the ground.

          Whilst approaching the ground, my Cousin was asked on two
    occasions by Liverpool fans if he had any spare tickets.    Friends
    of his said they were asked the same question at least a dozen
    times.

         At around 4. OO p. m. Liverpool fans were seen to be pilfering
    from a refreshment bar at the Leppings Lane end.

           My cousin has told me also, but he cannot confirm that: -

           1)   A train arrived at Wads ley Bridge    at 2.00 p.m., but
                the occupants were not allowed to     leave the station
                until 2. 30 p. m.

           2)   Gatemen were being offered money by ticketless fans.

                     At about     11 am on Saturday 15th April         1989 I left my home address     in

                                       to make the Notts Forest Liverpool match in Hi 1lsborough

                     Sheffield.

                                    In my    car                    and another guy whose

p    t       M   *    name   I can't remember they are friends from a local            pub.I support

                     Liverpool FC and I got the ticket for the match from Anfield

                      because    I am a season ticket holder there and         I paid £6 face value for

                      it.

                     We d i d n ’t stop on the way to Sheffield and we t ravelled along the M62
                                                                  Vv ^ ■         7
                     all the way there were quite a few hold ups during the/way but they

                      only held us up for about 20 minutes at a time but of course we were

                     travelling down fairly early.
                                                                           PAGE      2
                                                                           S I 724

We arrived in Sheffield at about          1.30 pm A n d we parked outside the

Police Station at I think Halifax Ro                nearby.We   came through the

i_iverpol end of the ground and saw a number of

supporters outside^J?ut they seemed to all quiet and there were quite a

few drinking f r o m \ a n s   outside   in the street but there were no

disorderly incidents.

I didn't have any Police directions or escorts to the ground but I

nemember seeing groups of Police about 6 or 7 or more Poli cemen

standing along Halifax Road up until the ground itself.I got to the

outer gates at about       1.20 pm a nd there were hardly any

people queuing to get in only about 7 or 8 at the turnstiles.

There were Police searching fans entering from the outer gates and

once you were      inside through the turnstiles but there were no Police

directing the queues outside or inside.

I d i d n ’t see any Police on horseback at this time or do I r ec al 1

seeing a stewards.

All my friends had stand tickets and I had a terrace ticket but we all

went out through the terrace turnstiles and met up inside the ground.

I had no trouble getting         into the ground and when I was through I

couldn't see and signs directing me anywhere nor were there any

stewards or Police giving directions on where to go.There ware gates

open to my left as I went         in passed the turnstiles to the west Stand

turnstiles . / \

I d i d n ’t see anyone climbing any walls at this time or climbing on the

fence.

My ticket was taken but I kept the counter foil           (details taken on

quest i onnai r e).

As 1 entered the ground all         I could see was the tunnel     in front of me
                                                     \ A
and the aoal mouth and the pitch.  I walked down the tunnel and went
                                             7 ^  ------------
towards the right hand pen which was no 3 . ( There were no Police men
                                                                              PAGE      3
                                                                              S 172 4

or stewards on duty in the tunnel or at the entrance.

All    the    crowd at that time was quiet and 1 could not see anyone

dr i nk i n g .

I went outside again          after waiting for a while to geta cup of tea

and something to eat          at about    2 pm.   I came   back into the Pen and

stood at the same place.

While     I was standing there the crowds started to build up and

eventually I was pushed right over to my/right and ended up in Pen 3

by the fence separating Pen 3 and PenV

It was about 2.55 pm when the             pressure from    the crowd got that bad

that    I jumped over the fence          into Pen 2 w ere there was loads of p o m .

I stopped where I was in Pen 2 watching the crowds building^uj/^Tn Pen

3.     I c ouldn’t see any crowd surge there was a gradual build up of

pressure from the people pushing at the back.

I wasn't          injured getting   over the fence or inthe     crush.

I was     looking at the crowds       in Pen 3 and there was people jumping over

the fence         like I had quite regular one and sometimes three at a

time.

I remember seeing one old man about 70 years o Id about               10 feet from

the front of the fencing on to the pitch he was stuck halfway up

trying to get over and I saw the pain on his face.

I could n’t do anything about this and I could see the railings

enbedded into his          chest and I think this man m ust have d i e d .There were

people       climbing over onto the pitch a nd one of the first

was a lad who was pushed            back by the Police.

They must have thought          it was    a pitch invasion at first but then a lot

of the crowd starting shouting and swearing then more and more started

climbing over onto the pitch then people began to realise what was

going on.

I saw the crowd pushed forward towards the fencing all of a sudden
                                                                          PAGE      4

this must have been when the barrier broke         but I d i d n ’t see it go.

There was just blind panic after this and there was screaming and

shout i n g .

Just before the game started and all this was going on I heard the

tannoy announcing something but I couldn't/make out what it was            it was

so garbled when Kenny Dal gli sh came on arya made an appeal       I co u l dn ’t

hear what he said either.

The pressure got that great in the pen that        people were unable to get

over and climb into my pen.,        I saw people dying in front of me

and I couldn't do anything about        it.

There was       panic on tyhe pitch and I saw some Liverpool   fans r i pping

down the hoardings /and using them as stretchers and ripping the

fencing away to let the people onto the pitch.The gates at the front

were being opened and then closed again and

only letting a few out at a time and when they realised what was going

on and the gates were        left open I think they were unable to get out

because of tb£ crush anyway.

I saw as.Poyiice Sergeant and a fan run over to the referee and then the

match was       cancelled.

It took about an hour before the crush was stopped and people were

pulled out or climbed on to the pitch.

I jumped over the fence again back into Pen 3 ajp*dT looked around in

disbelief at what had happened.

I eventually walked out from the ground through the tur                At about

4.30 pm a nd I met up with my friends back at the c a r .

I went to the match last year^ K d ^ I could remember      it was still     packed

but the crowds were forced to queue into lines,         it was still   crushed

and I know it was a bad ground and that was why I didn't          really want

to come back this year.

All   I want to say is when I went through the turnstiles all          I could
                                                                            PAGE      3
                                                                            S I 724

         see was that tunnel    in front of me and if that was all   I could see at

         that time what chance would people coming after me have at about 3 pm.

         That end of the ground was just not up to the standard required for

         that number of people us ing it.

         It was a lot of things that went wrong to cause this tragedy and I

         realise that if one thing had been done rLght this would never have

         happened it was very bad organisation a 1 y round.

                                                                            SIGNED

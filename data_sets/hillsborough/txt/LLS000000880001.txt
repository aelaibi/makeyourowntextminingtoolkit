                                     D.S. Moore.
           On Saturday, 15th April, 1989, I attended the F.A. Cup Semi-Final at
■Hillsborough.       My ticket was for the Leppings Lane Standing area, Entrance 'B1,
and    I   was accompanied by eight of my friends who all had similar tickets.


           We arrived at the turnstiles at 2.30p.m. -to meet and    exchange a Stand Ticket
with a middle aged family friend.At this time            there were a large number of
supporters trying to get into the ground through the four turnstiles           'B' directly
facing Leppings Lane.


       The police were making no attempt to supervise queuing for these turnstiles
and a good deal of pushing and jostling for position was going on, but, I would
stress, not more than you would usually expect.          A mounted policeman to the right
of the gates (as you face towards the ground) then drove his horse directly into
the crowd - he had       merely been positioned among the crowd before this - causing        a
rush to get out of       the way.


       We entered the ground at approximately 2.AO p.m.         However, myself and my friend
had become separated from the rest of our group and decided to wait in between the
rear of the turnstiles and the covered tunnel onto the terraces to see if we
could rejoin our friends.           Within the space of a couple of minutes we were joined
by ______________      who had travelled with us.     It was approximately .2.45 p.m. at this
time


       We decided to continue waiting for our friends and were surprised when the
side concertina exit gate was opened, it appeared to allow policeman in.            Within
minutes the gate had been opened again and between 100-200 came in, several falling.
One man stumbled in front of us and we helped him to his feet, then found a
policeman and told him he thought it was unsafe to open this gate in view of the fact
that some people had fallen - at no time was any disrespect shown and the policeman
abused him and ordered us away.


       We began to make our way towards the covered tunnel onto the terracing when the
gate was opened again and several hundred people poured in.           I would stress that they
were forced to rush into the ground by the pressure of supporters outside once
inside, i.e. through the concertina gate, but before entering onto the terraces this
rush subsided considerably.


       We took up our position on the terrace at 2.57         p.m., I can be sure of this    time
because I checked my watch.          Although the terrace was very crowded   at this time we
still managed to pass comments on the Liverpool Team changes.


       Within the next few minutes it became clear to         us that the ground was becoming
overcrowded - I did not experience any sudden rush.


                then turned to me and asked me to help him support a girl who appeared to
us to be fainting, at this stage we had lost sight of our third friend


        There seemed to be slight relief of pressure on us for a few seconds (this
must have been when the crash barrier broke).           We then tried to manoeuvre the
girl to safety but she had turned blue and had died.           I tried to keep hold
of A i f c ’tT pn-oftJ   hand but he was drawn down into the, by now, dead and dying people
and his hand slipped from mine.


        We shouted at policemen on the crash barriers at the front of the terrace
that people were dead, also dying, but the small "escape" gate at the front remained
closed.       Some people were trying to climb over the fence and were being pushed
back by the police.            However, once the police realised the extent of what was
happening they started helping people over the barrier, one policeman I saw was
sitting astride the barrier flattening the spikes with his bare hands.             The front
gate was open by now and                and I carried an injured fan towards it.    Police
by that time had climbed over the side wire fences (separating 1B ’ Section from
'A1 and ’C 1) but several of them, most particularly the younger officers, did not
seem to know what to do, we physically dragged two policeman to help us carry the
injured man over the dead bodies at the front of the stand out onto the pitch.


        At this point both              and I looked around and saw the extent of the dead
and injured and broke down into tears, we were incensed at the apparent number
of police who were just milling about.           We decided to help as best we could,
we forced our way past the police back onto the terraces, and became separated
from each other, I was about two yards from the point where the crash barrier
collapsed and could see the dead and dying lying about 5 or 6 deep for a width
of about 15 yards!,            I began checking for a pulse on the necks of people who were
not obviously dead (I appreciate I am not qualified in pronouncing people dead
but the ones I classed as dead were blue grey in the face, lips were blue and
vomit filled their mouths and noses).           I helped supporters and police pull injured
out of the heap of bodies and gave the kiss of life to about 10 or 12 people
(J        land   I   had now found each other again) one of whom recovered quickly and
asked the whereabouts of his son, we had to slap him to find out where he had been
standing,        but when we eventually found the boy he was dead.    We dragged a policeman
to us and told him of this and he took the man away.           We carried the dead boy out
on advertising hoarding to the far side of the ground into the hall where the
bodies were taken, at this time there were about 5 or 6 other bodies in the hall.


       We continued to carry dead people from the terrace to the hall, we must have
carried about another A or 5, and tried to go back onto the terracing to help but
were told by police that there were no more injured or dead in there


       We then had a drink of water from trays of cups that were being passed round
However, I saw several people who were injured still lying near the edge of the
pitch and went to see if I could help.      I knelt beside one man who had been crushed
so badly he appeared flat (without a rib cage), there was blood coming from the
corner of his mouth, no one else seened interested and I dragged a St. John's
Ambulance man over who examined the man, started crying and said there was nothing
he could do for him and left.      The injured man then regained consciousness and
said to me "I’m going aren’t I", I replied "I’m so sorry mate, I think so".        I
shouced and shouted for a doctor but when I looked down again the man had died.


     I found |     [again and we then pushed our way back into the ground and
tried to look for our friends, I sat on the terrace where we had been standing
prior to the game and saw hundreds of shoes and scarves, articles of clothing,
spectacles and cameras.


     We then made our way out of the ground and eventually rejoined our friends,
at no time did we see evidence of any other than correct behaviour from other
supporters.   Afterwards there were angry outbursts at the police, most of which
were ’’where were you before” .    I feel that if more police had been present prior
to the kick-off to control the queues outside, and that if these queues had been
started away from the turnstiles, i.e. in Leppings Lane itself, and more stewards
had been present in the ground to direct people to the correct standing area -
when the concertina gate was opened everyone went to the nearest entrance - but
most of all if the gate had not been opened, then this tragedy would have been
avoided.   The police simply      had to postpone the kick-off if they were concerned
about safety outside, it ismy belief there       were insufficient to do this.


     I cannot pass comment on whether there were fans without tickets but on our
way to the ground we passed       people who were offering tickets for sale - surely
if fans did not have tickets these      would have been snapped up.


     I am prepared to swear that all of the foregoing is true and will travel
anywhere and put myself at the disposal of anyone if I can help in any way with
an enquiry or investigation.

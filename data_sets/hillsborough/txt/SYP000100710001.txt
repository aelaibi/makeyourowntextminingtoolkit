                I commenced               duty        on Saturday,                 15 A p r i l ,

                I was          detailed          to     serial          28    i/c       Police       Sergeant          Wilson            f r o m A1

                Doncaster,

                We        arrived         at    Hillsborough                 at    9.40am         <0 9 A D )    and    paraded            in     the    North

                 stand         for       briefing         at      10am       (10 0 0 ) .

                 On       completion            of     th e      briefing          we     remained          in t h e N o r t h           stand     where      we

                    consumed         a    packed         meal.

                    At    11am     (11O O )            Ic o m m e n c e d    duty        at t h e    junction          of    Leake          Road       and

                    Leppings         Lane            in c o m p a n y    with      DC      E399 Wren.             The       p u r p o s e of      our     duty

                    was    to    prevent          non-residents                   from      entering           Leake     Road        and        non­

                    residents            cars     from        parking          in t h i s       street.           Barriers           were         placed

                    across       the      junction            to    restrict             access.

                    For    the       first       hour       or     so    things          were       quiet       but    by a b o u t        1E.30pm

                    (1230)       fans          mostly       Liverpool             were      walking            along    Leppings                Lane   towards

                    the    ground.              The     fans       were      well        behaved        but      a significant                   number      were

                                                                    . + t >.      _ t- t,h r-%p nr          c i d e r . SoftiG w e r 6             standinQ

                          was    also          noticeable           that          many     having        reached         the     ground           were

                                                                                                                                             RE60

walking       back        along       Leppings           Lane       asking           directions                for       the          coach

parks.        These         fans      were        wanting          tickets.               They       were          also       approaching

other       fans     asking          fo r    'spares’.

By    Eo'clock           (1400 )      the        flow    of    fans          along        Leppings             Lane       was

continuous           and       traffic           was    having          difficulty              making             progress.

I    could    see        from       the     faces       of    the       fans        as    they       passed          that             many     were

the    worse        for    drink.            They       weren't           falling          down        drunk         but          had

obviously           been       drinking.               I thought             to m y s e l f      at     t he        time          it    seemed

that       many     of    these       supporters              had       tried        to    get       'as m u c h          ale'          as

possible          down     their          necks        before       the        start       of    the m a t c h .

Opposite          the     junction           of    Leake       Road          and     Leppings           Lane         is       a       small

alleway       that        leads       to     some       bungalows              and       following             a    complaint                that

supporters           were       using        the       alleway          as     a    toilet,          I positioned                      myself

at    the    mouth        of    it    to     prevent          further              nuisance.               Whilst I was

standing          here     1 saw          one     youth       stop           in L e p p i n g s      Lane          a n d he           began       to

urinate       openly           in    full        view    of    everyone.                  I moved          towards                h i m bu t      he

ran    off    his        actions          cheered        by    other           supporters.

During       my     time at          this        location          I was           visited       by m y            serial             sergeant

Police       Sergeant           Wilson           and    also       my    serial           Inspector                whose          name       I do

not    know       except        that        he    was    based          at W o o d s e a t s .          He         spent          a    fair

amount       of     time       in    company           with    us.

I was       not     in    possession              of a       radio           and    was        surprised             to s e e          Special

Constables           who       were       patrolling           in       pairs        each with             the       latest             pers.o na 1

At    3 o ’clock         <150 0 )     the        crowd       had    dwindled              to    just       a       few    but          up    to     3pm

(1500)       th e    flow       of    supporters              had       remained           continuous.

At    3.05pm        (1505)          together           with my          serial           Inspector             I began                 to w a l k      to

Claywheels           Lane       for       lunch        leaving          DC     Wren       on    th e    junction.

As    we    walked        along       Leppings           Lane       I could              hear    messages                on       his       Police

radio       but     couldn't          hear        what       was    being          said        but     it w a s          obvious             by     the

                                                                                                                                      R260

tone     of    what       was     being       said       that        there       were     problems              somewhere             a n d we

listened           carefully.            We       then     heard          a message        to       t he      effect           that

everyone           was    required           on    the     running          track.

On     hearing       this        we    immediately              turned       round        and       began           to    walk      quickly

back     to    the       Leppings        Lane       end        of    the    ground.            Whilst           we       were making

our     way    back       the     Inspector             attempted           to    contact           Police             control        for

instructions              but     could       not       g et    through.            The    messages                 that       were    being

transmitted              sounded        to    me    to     be       very    badly       garbled.                I saw          that    other

officers           were    also        hurrying          along        Leppings          Lane        on     foot          and    in vans.

On     reaching          th e    Leppings          Lane        end    of    the     ground          I saw          a     large      number

of     officers          waiting.            Instructions                 were    given        to    form          a     cordon       across

the     Leppings          Lane        entrance.

There      were      very        few    supporters              about       at    this     time          outside           the

ground.            These        supporters          were        ushered          outside        the        cordon          line .

At     this    time       no     one    knew       what        was    happening           or    what          had        happened,

some     officers          knew        that       the    game        had    been       stopped           as     I heard          them

tell     supporters              this.

Whilst        I was       standing           on    this        cordon       I overheard              a     conversation                to

th e    effect       that        there       were       casualties           inside        the       ground              and   even

people        dead.        As     I seemed          to     be       serving       no    useful           purpose           together

with     PC    2127       Smart        I made       my way           into    th e      Leppings            Lane          end   of     the

ground        by w a y     of     the    turnstiles.                  On making           my    way        across          the      open

concrete           area    I saw        people          lying        on    the    ground        apparently                 unconscious

being      tended         by     others,          also     others          who    appeared           to       be       injured

sitting        up.                                                                                              *

It w a s      my    impression           that       there           had    been     some       sort        of      fight       between

rival      fans.

I made        my    way    onto        the    terracing              by w a y     of    the     tunnel             under        the W e s t

stand.         This       tunnel        was       clear.         Together           wi t h PC        Smart             I cleared          a

way     down       the    terracing           to    th e       fence,       dividing           paddock             41     from      the

                                                                                                                     R260


pi t c h .      I saw no           casualties           in this        paddock         but       was    subject        to a

certain         am o u n t     of a buse         from    the    crowd.

On     reaching          the    a rea     at the        rear    of the          goalmouth           in front of the

West     Stand,          I saw      that     there       were     a number            of bo d i e s      l ying      all       over

this     area.           I realised          then that          something             of an e x t r e m e l y        serious

nature        had     h a ppened.

There        were     a large         number       of c i v i l i a n s    on        the    playing       area,        some

attempting            to r e s u s c i t a t e     unconscious            people,           other       evacuating

people        by    using       boards       torn       from    the     edge     of pitch.

The     situation            was    absolute        chaos.         I saw        at     this       time    approximately

15     bodies       lying       in the       area at       the     rea r        of    the      goalmouth.              I then

went     to     the      gate      that    gives        access     from         the     pitch       to p a d d o c k      31

where        I could         see    bo d i e s   lying     towards         the        bottom       of the       terracing.

Together           with      other      officers        I helped          to re m o v e          these    bodies

through         the      gate      onto    the r u n n i n g      track.         T his        evacuation            was    done

by     officers          carrying         the    body     to the        gate     where           myself       and    some

other        policemen          too k     the    body     and m a n o e u v r e d          it t h r o u g h    the     gate.

Th e    bod y      was    then r e m o v e d       by ot h e r s       away     onto        the    pitch.

Whilst        this       was    going      on c i v i l i a n s    were        screaming           a buse      at some

officers,           oth e r s      were    just     wandering           about        clearly           distressed.

There        was    no d i r e c t i o n     or cont r o l        at    this     end        of    the    ground,          the

whole        t hing      was    just      out of c o n t r o l         wit h    peo p l e        picking       up bodies,

putting         them ont o          bo a r d s   and    carrying          them       away.         We had no           idea

where        the    casualties            were     being       t aken     to.

There        was    a point         when     the    spectators            in    the W e s t        Stand       began

jeering         and r o a r i n g       and I feared            that      there        would       be a full           scale

pitch        invasion.

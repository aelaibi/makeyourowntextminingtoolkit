 Dear Sirs,

 F.A.   Cup   Semi-Final

I would like to bring to your attention the facts below which may help
with the enquiry into the tragedy which took place at the above last
Saturday.

Admittedly, my son and I did not have tickets but went on the offchance
of purchasing these outside the ground - this is not uncommon for people
to do this on major sporting occasions.

We purchased tickets outside the Lepping Road end at 2.45 p.m.

I must complain about the harassment experienced with police on horseback
who were forcing fans towards the turnstiles. As we didn't have tickets
we spent a lot of time avoiding these "wild horsemen" trying to get fans
stood in an orderly still position to go to the ground, I'm sure some
of these so called policemen would be more at home at Sheffield cattle
m arket!

When we tried to enter the ground at 2.50 p.m. there was chaos at the
turnstiles - the police had no orderly queues.

We stood on the bridge over the stream; and we agree that the police
had no option but to open the gates to avoid traqedy outside the
turnstiles.

However, when we did enter in a reasonably orderly manner the policemen
who let us in only looked at the ticket and did not take the counterfoil
(see copy of ticket attached)


                                                     /continued        2
Once in the ground there were no directions by stewards or police__ and
thank God my son and I did not decide to go up the 'fatal tunnel'.

There was obviously no communication between the police and officials, since
the kick-off was on time and no consideration given to fans who had paid
good money but couldn't get in the ground due to disorganized police arrange­
ments - unlike the Arsenal v Liverpool at Highbury in October which was
delayed because of crowds trying to enter the ground.

Also, looking back on the situation, it was amazing that the two sets of
policemen led by so called leaders could 'walk' along the touchline to the
scene when people were lying injured and dying     surely communication
equipment reached beyond 70 yards!

I have just heard on TV tonight (Tuesday) police accusations about drunken
fans - there is a big difference between cheerful fans (who were the main
nucleus of what I personally saw on the day) and drunken fans.

I have attached   my business card if you wish to contact me for any further
comments      I   do feel very strongly about the police on horseback, parti­
cularly the one   with gold-rimmed glasses, who, in my opinion, acted worse
than any cattle   drover!!

Lastly, I have enclosed a diagram giving my viewpoint of the situation at
the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
Yours faithfully,

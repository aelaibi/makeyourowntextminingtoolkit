Note for fencing file   -


I understand that there is a FIFA ruling that grounds
which host international matches must have safety
fencing around the terraces where supporters stand.


The "FIFA Vtorld Cup 1990 Regulations" booklet has
no reference to fencing. Ihere mast be seine other
FIFA docurrent specifically related to security at
grounds.

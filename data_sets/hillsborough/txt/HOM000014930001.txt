HILLSBOROUGH: LETTER FROM MRS SPEARRITT


As requested I attach a draft reply to the letter from
Mrs Spearritt whose 14 year old son died at Hillsborough.

Our enquiries of          local   authorities have resulted in an
encouraging overall      response.    This is reflected in the draft
reply.

Safety certificates are not issued annually because the 1975 Act
is framed in such a way that once a sports ground is designated
by the Secretary of State the ground occupier must apply for
rather than hold a safety certificate.    The local authority is
under a duty to issue one.    It is then the safety certificate
which, by imposing terms and conditions, is intended to achieve
reasonable safety at the sports ground.    Local authorities must
arrange for inspections of the ground at least once a year.

FI are content with the paragraph of the draft reply covering the
point about senior officers of the South Yorkshire police.

(FULL POSTAL ADDRESS)                             (FULL ADDRESSES, IF NECESSARY

               LETTER DRAFTED FOR SIGNATURE BY ...PS to S of S ...........
                                                  (NAME OF SIGNATORY)


               The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you for your letter
               of 20 September and to say how very sorry he was to learn
               that you lost your son at Hillsborough.


               You asked whether there were any plans to make Lord Justice
               Taylor's recommendations   law.   I should explain that the
               present recommendations are interim recommendations.  Lord
               Justice Taylor is expected to complete his report at about
               the end of the year and the Government will of course
               consider whether any changes in the law are necessary in the
               light of his final conclusions.


               In the meantime the Home Office has been monitoring, through
               the police, the Fire Service and the local authorities
               responsible for safety certificates, the extent to which
               those interim recommendations which Lord Justice Taylor
               regarded as urgent have been complied with. The information
               which we have indicates that in the great majority of cases
               those recommendations have already been implemented. We are
               exploring with the local authorities concerned any cases of
difficulty and t&xt it seems unlikely that, at least in the
short term, any change in the law will be necessary.


Safety certificates for sports grounds are not like MOT
certificates.   They are not issued annually because each
certificate is a detailed document containing terms and
conditions needed to secure reasonable safety for the number
of spectators who are permitted to enter the different parts
of the ground to which it applies.      Each certificate is
different.  Provided the circumstances of the ground remain
unchanged,   the certificate     remains relevant.     Local
authorities are nevertheless required by law to inspect each
designated football ground at least once a year and clubs
are under an obligation to notify the local authority of any
proposal to make changes to the ground which may affect
safety of spectators.   It is quite possible, therefore, for
a safety certificate to be amended more often than once a
year.


The Home Secretary has noted your views on the position of
senior officers of the South Yorkshire Police.   As you know
a number of matters arising from the Hillsborough incident
are still under investigation.  The Chief Constable offered
his resignation but the South Yorkshire Police Authority
declined to accept it.  This was entirely a matter for the
South Yorkshire Police Authority and is not one on which
I can comment.

                               ^   :

  Peter Lloyd has drawn my attention to the report of the
  adjournment debate about the Taylor report on the ’24 January
  during which you made a number of points about the legal
  procedures  which   followed the Hillsborough  disaster   and
  particularly the inquest.


  I thought it right before our meeting next Wednesday, together
  with Gerry Bermingham and Peter Kilfoyle, that I should set out
  the extent of my powers and responsibilities in relation to
  inquests, in view of the perception that I am able in some way
  to initiate a review of the handling of the Hillsborough inquest.


  The overall policy responsibility for the law relating to
  inquests, including the statutory framework within which they are
  held, is ,.a matter for the Home Secretary.     But the office of
  coroner is a judicial one, and coroners are wholly independent
  of Ministers in the discharge of their responsibilities.    Their
  conduct of particular cases can be scrutinised by the High Court
  by two means:      first, on application under section 13 of the
  Coroners Act 1988 for an order requiring a fresh inquest, and
  secondly by means of an application for judicial review made by
  a properly interested party.     The former can only be made with
  my consent and the latter requires the leave of the Divisional
  Court.   Section 13 applies where an inquest has been held if 'by
  reason of fraud, rejection of evidence, irregularity of proceed­
  ings, insufficiency of inquiry, the discovery of new facts,
  evidence or otherwise' it is necessary or desirable in the
  interests of justice that another inquest should be held.


  It is no part of my duty the function from the consent provision
  contained in section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 to scrutinise
  an inquest generally, with a view to considering whether any
  grounds exist for the making of an application to the High Court.
  It is, however, for the applicant to identify a ground upon which
my consent could be given or in respect of which the institution
of further enquiries would be justified.           Very careful
consideration is given to such cases.


The position so far as the Hillsborough inquest is concerned is
that nobody has come forward with any material suggesting that
the criteria set out in section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988 is
fulfilled.   The ordinary time limit for judicial review has now
expired.    I understand that some relatives are still taking
legal advice, and that a formal application may yet be submitted
to me.   I accordingly keep an open mind.


I hope that this clarifies the position and look forward to our
discussion on Wednesday.

Peter    Lloyd    has    drawn   my    attention      to    the    report        of   the

adjournment debate about the Taylor report on the 24 January

during   which     you    made   a    number   of    points       about    the     legal

procedures       which     followed     the    Hillsborough             disaster      and

particularly the inquest.



I thought it right before our meeting next Wednesday, together

with Gerry Bermingham andjj^PKilfoyle, that I should set out the

extent of my powers and responsibilities in relation to inquests j

in view of the_,         eption that I am able in some way to initiate

a review of the handling of the Hillsborough inquest.

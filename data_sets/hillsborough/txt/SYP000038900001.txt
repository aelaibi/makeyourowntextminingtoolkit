                           for the West Midlands Police.
 01.01    DCS6930          Thank you.   At the conclusion of

                           the interview Mr MURRAY I will

                           give you a notice explaining

                           exactly what will happen to the

                           both the audio and the video tapes.

                           On the 15th of April 1989 (150489)

                           a disaster occurred at Hillsborough

                           Football Stadium and 95 people

                           died.   Following a public inquiry

                           and report the Chief Constable of

                           South Yorkshire Police consulted

                          with the Director of Public

                          Prosecutions and as a result

                          West Midlands Police were, were

                          requested to do a criminal

                          investigation.   This investigation

                          came at the same time that certain

                          members of the public decided to
01.37                     make specific allegations against

                          named police officers.     You are




                                                                     918
 MURRAY             BERNARD D


                            one of those officers and you

                            have already been served with

                            the Regulation 7 Notice dealing

                           with specific complaints. The

                           nature of those complaints and

                           the particular duty you ware

                           performing at Hillsborough cm

                           the 15th of April 1989 (150489)

                           suggests that you may have

                           contributed to the deaths of sorre

                           of those that died.   Also that

                           you may have failed to perform

                           your lawful duty as a Police

                           Officer on the 15th of April 1989
02.09                      (150489) at Hillsborough.    I

                           will explain the specific

                           allegations to you in the interview

                           but before we go any further it is
02.16                      right that I caution you and say

                          that you do not have to say

                          anything unless you wish to do

                          so but what you say m y be given

                          in evidence.   Do you understand

                          what I've just said?

          BDM             yes.

02.27     DCS6930         Thank you.   I voald remind you

                          that you are not under arrest,

                          the legal representation and

                          Mr MANNING your solicitor is

                          present.     If you did require

                          it, there is the legal aid

                          notice available for you, do

                          you understand what I've just

                          said?

         BDM              Yes.

         DCS6930          Perhaps to start with, can we

                          agree that you, shortly after and

                          I think for the purpose of the

                          public inquiry, you submitted

                          a statement which actually came

                          to the West Midlands Police?

         BDM              Yes I did.

         DCS6930          Thank you.    You also gave

                          evidence at the public inquiry

                          and a transcript of the evidence

                          that you gave was produced?

         BDM              That's correct yes.

         DCS6930          Have you seen that transcript

                          and you agree with it?

         BDM              Yes I have.

         DCS6930          And you agree with it?

         BDM              Yes sir.

         DCS6930          Thank you.    Also I have here a

                          an incident log that was corrmenced

                          by yourself and again referred to

                          at the public inquiry and handed
 MURRAY              BERNARD D


                             to the West Midland Police.    That'

                            your incident log which finishes

                            at 1421 (1421)?
           BDM              Yes, that's correct.
           DCS6930          Okay.   And I think also a set of

                            briefing notes that you actually

                            used for the purposes of the

                            match on the 15th of April 1989

                            (150489)?
           BDM              Yes, those are my notes.
           DCS6930          Thank you.   I I think you

                            mentioned actually at the start

                            your present posting but could

                            you just tell me exactly what

                            your present role is with

                            South Yorkshire Police?
04.03     BDM               My present role is I am a

                            Sub-Divisional Corrmander at

                           Rawmarsh Sub-Division, in

                           Rotherham Division.
          DCS6930          And what service, Police

                           Service have you now got?
04.13     BDM              I joined the Police Service on the

                           15th of November 1965 (151165) so

                           I shall have completed 25 years

                           on the 15th of November 1990

                           (151190).
          DCS6930          You, you do mention in your

                           statement your experience of
MURRAY   BERNARD D                                    7


                policing football matches and I

                think it's relatively extensive

                over a period of time.    Could you

                perhaps analyse it a little

                bit closer in terms, specifically

                in relation to Hillsborough as to

                shall we say your role there from

                about 1980 (000080) onwards?
04.48           I've checked in my sort of pocket

                books and records and prior to

                1982 (000082) I can only find one

                occasion when I worked at

                Hillsborough, which was in 1977

                (000077), and that was a semi­

                final tie between Leeds United

               and Manchester United.     At that

               time I was a Sergeant. On, in

               September 1982 (000982) I worked

               at Hillsborough for the occasion

               of the football match between

               Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds

               United and on that occasion I was

               an Inspector and I've not worked

               at Hillsborough again until the

               19th of March 1988 (190388), that

               was the first occasion that I

               worked as a Superintendent

               following the posting to FI

               Sub-Division.   (Pause).
 MURRAY              BERNARD    D


 05.44                          I work out that I've worked

                                nineteen matches between the 19th

                                of March 1988 (190388) to the

                                5th of April 1989 (050489), and

                                then the semi-final on the 15th

                                of April 1989 (150489) and three

                                further football matches following

                                that.

           DCS6930              Thank you.     So to summarize that

                               particulary in terms, shall we

                                say of semi-finals, that will

                                feature later on when I talk to

                               you.     You would not have been

                               present during the 1981 (000081)

                               semi-final when there was seme

                               problem with crushing at Leppings

                               Lane?
          BDM                  No.
06.18     DCS6930              And you wouldn't have been present

                               at the 1987 (000087) Semi-Final

                               which i think was Coventry against

                               Leeds?
          BDM                  No I wasn't.

          DCS6930              But you were there for the 1988

                               (000088) one?
          BDM              Yes I was.

          DCS6930          In fact in the same role?
          BDM              Yes.

          DCS6930          Thank you.        Out of those other

                                refer to there, would any of those

                                have been specific local derbys

                                or alternatively shall we say

                                capacity crowd situations?

                                I know at Hillsborough has been a

                                semi-final.   There have been larger

                               crowds for occasions such as

                               Liverpool, Manchester United, but

                               nowhere near reaching capacity.
           DCS6930             Nowhere near reaching capacity.

                               Okay.   We know that in 1988

                               (000088) you were in the same role

                               as, as 1989 (000089), in the

                               Control, the Police Control Box.
07.13                          Had you had experience prior to

                               that of the Control Box and its

                               running or operation?
07.23     BDM                  I worked two football matches prior

                               to that semi-final, within the

                               preceeding three weeks.   One

                               against Portsmouth and one against

                           West Ham United.
          DCS6930          And what sort of crowd would you

                           have had for those two?
          BDM              I can't recall what the crowds

                           were but they, I can't recall.
          DCS6930          Well would it be true to say I

                                doing too well and, are we

           BDM                  Certainly nowhere m a r capacity,

                               no, but I can't recall the exact

                               figures without referring to...

                               you can recall that would have

                               caused you a problem?
           BDM                 No.

           DCS6930             No, okay.    Each of those you

                               say to me was in the Control Box

                               situation.
08.11     RDM                  Yes, the the first match was on

                               the 19th of March 1988 (190388)

                               against Portsmouth which was the

                               first match I worked at at

                           Hillsborough, in that role, and

                           the second one was on the 2nd of

                           April (190388) against West Ham

                           United.

                           before I joined that Sub-Division.
08.41     DCS6930          Thank you.    Would you explain to

                           me any specific training in terms

                           of football training that you've

                           had in the Police Service that you

                           you would be able to recall or

                           particularly pin point?
         BDM               I don't recall of any training

                           whatsoever apart from on the job

                           training.    There nay have been

                           input on football matches at

                           on training courses that I've

                           been on but I can't recall.
         DCS6930          Have you ever had any training

                           in terms of the recognition of

                          crowd behaviour or crowd capacities,

                          anything on that line?
         BDM              No sir.

         DCS6930          You've obviously been involved in

                          various public order situations

                          over the years which have featured

                          extent of being associated to

                          football events, but has any of

                          that been of value to you or has

                          given you any sort of training to

                               look at a normal crowd, the build

                               up of a crowd, capacity crowds,

                               monitoring of crowds?
          BDM                  Not that I can recall.    We

                               sometimes try and assess numbers

                               so far as crowds are concerned

                               but with no sort of, with no

                               specific expertise at all.      It's

                               just a, purely and simply an

                              estimate.

                              place in your experience at

                              Hillsborough or indeed any other

                              football experience, whereby

                              type of disaster has occurred

                              that would have given you some

MURRAY             BERNARD    D


                              particularly shall we say to do

                              with Hillsborough and as you've

                              said on a few occasions, the

                              policing of football matches.
11.04                         There is an F Division Policy File

                              on football, would you have had

                              access to that file?

11.13    BDM                  I could have had access to the file

                              I don't recall seeing the file,

                             the, when I joined the Division,

                             the football matches were conmanded

                             by the Divisional Commander or

                             his Deputy.   It wasn't the role

                             of the Sub-Divisional Superintendent

                             to ccrmvand football matches.

         DCS6930             Not to canmand them, would you have

                             had a role in them though?
         BUM                 I was told the, the Superintendent

                             worked in the Control Room

                             environment and that was where I

                             would work.

         DCS6930             That's where you would work.     That

                             went there, with the view that you

                             may be doing football matches, did

                             you think it important to read

                             that file or go through it?
           BDM              Well the Sub-Division I'd come

                             frcm was also had a football

                            ground, and I was well aware of

                            the, the files that were in

                            relation to that football ground

                            and so I was aware of instructions

                            that eminated from ACPO level,

                            down to football match Commanders.
           DCS6930          Yes and presumably that would

                            include your force policy file

                            which would, if it did distribute

                            matters on football, would

                            distribute them both to your

                            previous appointment and to the

                            present one?

          BDM               Yes.

          DCS6930          So, what you're saying to me is

                           you felt you would have been up

                           to date and there was no...
12.40     BCM              I would have been up to date,

                           I had a copy of the Force

                               seen it?

                             role as a Superintendent in the

                             Control Room and past problems if

                             bring you up to date?
         BDM                 As I recall he told me that

                             football was a very successful

                             venture in F Division, they were

                             very proud of their performance

                             in relation to football matches,

                             that they felt that they were

                             one of the leading outfits in

                             the country in dealing with

                             football and it was a very

                             successful operation, that he

                             would take ccmmand of football

                         matches, in his absence his

                         deputy, and I would be as the

                             environment, where I would over­

                            see the match under his corrmand.
           DCS6930          Just, just going back to that

                            document that I mentioned to

                                years ago and we're talking of

                                an incident nine years previous.
           DCS6930              Sometime.   I mean were you aware

                                for example, and I think you've

                                actually answered this by saying

                                you weren't, but were you aware

                                that those changes really resulted

                                from the problems of 1981 (000081)?
          BDM                   Not...

          DCS6930               Was it that apparent at the time?
          BDM                   Not entirely no.
 16.06    DCS6930               Okay, thank you.   We, you mention

                                that you weren't actually there in

                                1987 (000087), there has been a

                               suggestion and it is only a, it's

                               not, it's not well documented, but

                               there is a suggestion that there

                               was a problem at the semi-final in

                               1987 (000087) whereby there was the

                               suggestion of overcrowding.    Did

                               you have any knowledge of that?
          BDM                  No.

          DCS6930              Going on to 1988 (000088) when you

                               were there as the, in the Control
16.40                          Room situation with Mr MOLE, again

                               there is some evidence that people

                               were injured on those terraces in

                               an overcrowding situation.    Was that

                           ever bought to your attention?

          DCS6930          Not at all?

          BDM              Not at all.

          DCS6930          No.   If it, if that situation had

                           occurred, if people had been injured

                           on those terraces, what normally

                           would happen at Hillsborough Football

                           Ground, shall we say that somebody

                           suffers sprained wrist, broken arm

                           and he's taken out.    Would you

                           expect to know about it?
          BDM              We, Red Cross Tent or...

          BDM              St Johns is immediately next to the

17.25                      the gymnasium.    Obviously one

                          expects some people to be injured

                          through either fainting or or a

                          multitude of different things when

                          you've got a large crowd of over

                          50,000 people and the odd person

                          being taken away for treatment is

                          is really no cause for concern

                          at all.     If there had been several

                          people injured, particularly in

                          one location, then I, yes, I would

                          have expected to have known about

 17.59   DCS6930             Would they keep a record to your

                             serials do may well comment on it

         DCS6930             Yes.   If, is there any instruction

                             for them for any injuries to

                             actually inform the Police.     Is

                             there anything that you know of

         BDM                 Not that I'm aware of, but of course

                             if if there was serious injuries

                             I would think they would get in

                             touch with us straight away for

                             warning relatives etc.

18.38    DCS6930             Okay thank you.   You obviously were

                             present at the debrief, for the 1988

                             (000088) game.

         BDM                 Yes.

         DCS6930             And I think from what you've said

                             it's evident that nothing actually

                             came up to suggest that there was

                             an overcrowding problem?

18.50    BDM                 There was no suggestion of an

                             overcrowding, I'd noticed several

                               areas myself where I thought we

                               could improve, but there was no

                               suggestion of overcrowding or

                               people being injured through

                               overcrowding.

          DCS6930              But when you say that you noticed

                               yourself, was that to do with?
          BEM                  That was nothing to do with

                               overcrowding.

          DCS6930              No.   Does that relate, if we, we

                               ask you now, I that in your

                               statement and I'll come to it

                               later on, you actually refer to

                              a number things that you actually

                              put into operation to change from

                              the year, was that what you were

                              referring to?
          BDM                 Yes.

                                I think you you may have already

                                said that you had no knowledge

                                of that.   Is that correct?

                                various enquiries that have been

                               made and shall we say through

20.08     DCS6930              There has been a slight suggestion

                               that the tunnel is closed for

                               example, according to PC

                               ILLINGWORTH, he he thought he,

                               that the tunnel had been closed

                               when he's done concourse

                               duties and his reason behind

                               it was he always felt and not

                               through anybody told him, but

                               he felt that the reason must

                               have been because the centre

                           pens were full.      Would you suggest

                           that that's probably mistaken then?

                             access to the terraces on one

                             particular occasion to be difficult

                             from anywhere at the back and the

                             officer in charge had to bring

                             people through the gates at the

                             front, but I've never known the

                             tunnel be consciously closed.
           DCS6930          The incident you've just referred

                            to, can you tell me when that was?
           BDM              It was the Manchester United

                            football match on the 11th of
                 »



                            February 1989 (110289).
           DCS6930          In 89 (000089)?
           BDM              Yeah.

           DCS6930          And that's when officers...
           BDM              That was when...

           DCS6930          You stopped people coming down

                            the tunnel?
21.36      BDM              It was nothing to do with closing

                            the tunnel it was the fact that

                               as occasionally happens at football

                               matches, people stood at the back

                               and there was lots of rocm at the

                               front and it was impossible to

                               get anyone into any part of the

                               Leppings Lane terraces on the

                               perception that the officer was

                               in charge of that end of the ground

                               and he actually brought people

                               through the North Stand along the

                              track and fed them into the, into

                              the front, through the gates.
          DCS6930             You're not saying there was any

                              actual blocking of the tunnel?
          BDM                 No, no there was no blocking

                              by the Police, it was just by by

                              the number of people presumably

                              who were there, the fans could

                              not get in and so they turned

                              round and went elsewhere, could

                              not get in, and couldn't get

                              onto the terraces.
22.24     DCS6930             Did that raise it's head that

                              there was a capacity problem of

                              of any kind?

          BDM                 It didn't raise it's head to me,

                              I think on that occasion there was

                          several thousand places still

                          available on the terrace.      I don't




                                                                          939
 MURRAY              BERNARD D                                  25


                            think it was a capacity problem

                            more on a packing problem, that

                            there was tremendous space at

                            the front but there wasn't at the

                            back.

           DCS693Q          Did anyone pick that up in terms

                            of perhaps talking to the Club

                            about it or?
           BDM              The Club actually spoke about it

                            and were not in favour of the

                            tactic that had been employed

                            and it was something that we

                            were to bear in mind in the

                            future that we made sure that

                            people, whenever possible, moved

                            down to the front of terraces to

                           make rocm at the back.
23.24     DCS6930           I pursue it because I I knew that

                           the view has always been held

                           by, and I think you've said it and

                           if not please correct me, that

                           people find their own level on

                           the terraces.
          BDM              Yes.

          DCS6930          What you seem to be saying is

                           that that wasn't possible, you've

                           got capacity there but for seme

                           reason the the level wasn't

                           finding itself.




                                                                     940

            BDM               It was, it was an occasion where

                             people stood back I think it was

                             unexpected that the numbers of

                             people who attended on that

                             occasion were far more than the

                             intelligence suggested and we we

                             we had, we expected x number of

                             thousand visitors and we got a

                             lot more.
 24.07      DCS6930          But there was no injury problem,

                             no overcrowding problem, nothing

                             that you are saying that really

                             should have perhaps alerted you

                             to the fact that there was a

                             problem with a big crowd there?
           KM               There, there were no injuries.

                            There were no injuries and

                            there, and there was no real

                            problem.
           DCS6930          Can I just confirm the date of

                            that, you said it was Manchester

                            United on the?
           KM               I I've got it as the only

                            Manchester United game I attended

                            and-1 think that was on the 11th of

                            February 1989 (110289).
24.41      DCS6930          Thank you.   Can we move on to

                            1989 (000089) and your role at the

                            1989 (000089) game.   You have said




                                                                       941

                            that you attended a number of

                           briefings and I think actually

                           went to a number of briefings,

                           sorry actually did a number of

                           briefings yourself.   The first one

                           that I think you referred to was

                           in fact on the 14th of April

                           (140489)?
          KM               The two briefings yes.
          DCS6930          One on the 14th of April (140489)

                           and then one on the 15th (150489)

                           on the day of the game.
          BDM              Yes.
25.31     DCS6930          Now the 14th of April (140489)

                          briefing which was given by Mr

                          DUCKENFIELD firstly to Inspectors

                          and above?
          KM              Yes.

          DCS6930         Can you tell me how that related

                          in terms of the issue of safety.

                          Can you tell me what content on

                          safety was in that briefing?
25.58     KM              I can't remanber, I can't remember

                          but certainly Mr DUCKENFIELD did

                          his briefing from a typed sheet

                          I think, he mentioned safety,

                          he definitely mentioned safety

                          and I think he finished his

                         briefing by saying to, that




                                                                      942

                              safety was important, but I can't

                             remember the exact content of it.
            DCS6930          Would there have been anything

                             specific in that briefing to do

                             with the packing of the crowd, the

                             monitoring of the crowd or over­

                             crowding purposes?
            KM               No.

            DCS6930          No.     You're definite that that

                             wouldn't have been talked about?
            KM               Well I feel, I feel that it

                             wouldn't have been talked about

                             yes.

           DCS6930           Okay.    Cane back to that in a

                            minute.     Perhaps if we can

                            refer to the statement that you

                            actually gave to us, your own

                            statement.
           KM               Yes.

           DCS6930          And go back on the the area that you

                            spoke about where you made seme

                            changes.
           BDM              Yes.
26.58      DCS6930          You actually talked in terms of a

                            manpower reduction for 1989 (000089)

                            based on what you've learnt from

                            1988 (000088), and I think

                            actually the reduction, or a lot

                           of the reduction was done by




                                                                        943

                              reducing the serials from one

                              and ten to one and eight?
            KM               The outside serials.
 27.17      DCS6930          The outside serials.    Now the other

                             thing that you actually mention

                             is the refreshments and providing

                             a hot meal.    Was that new?
            KM               Yes the, the previous year there

                             had been two cold meals, two packed

                             meals, which really is insufficient

                             for officers who may be working up

                             to twelve tours and I I wanted to

                             be able to provide the officers

                             with a hot meal, because the event

                            was being held in April and what

                             the weather was going to be like

                            was, was totally unknown of course.
           DCS6930          Yes. in terms of that how were they

                            designated times to go for those

                            refreshments?
           KM               The times were written into the

                            order.
           DCS6930          Into the Order?
           BDM              Yes.

                            let's talk particularly of PC SMITH

                            and ILLINGWDRTH who were if, if you

                            like on the trackside closer to the

                                 pens 3 and 4.     They actually didn't

                                 go for their refreshment 'til about

                                 2 o'clock (1400).     Was that, if you

                                 want to refer to the order, I've got

                                 a copy here.    Was, was that the time

                                 that they were allocated from what

                                 you can recall?
 28.30     BDM                   I think, I think that was down to

                                or the Sergeant in charge of the

                                serial to stagger the meal breaks of

                                of the trackside officers, frcm what

                                I can recall.
            DCS6930             Do you want to have a look at the

                                order...
           BDM                  Yes.
           DCS6930              to refresh yourself?
           BDM                  Yes in fact I've got my own copy

                                here.

           DCS6930              Okay, fine.     I think this is

                                in there actually, Document 194

                            the match in the gym.
           DCS6930          Thats, where you actually now

 29.43     DCS6930          And where are you actually finding

                            that.    Meal staggered before gyro

                            match in gym.
           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930          Right.    So there are no actual

                            allocated times?
 29.57     BDM              No that is down to the, the Track

                            Inspector and, and Serial Sergeant

                            to, to designate when the officers

                            will take their meals.
          DCS6930           Would that have been the same in

                            previous, say in the 1988 (000088)

                            semi-final?
          BDM               I would think so.
          DCS6930          Was it the same for most matches?
          BDM               I I would think so.
          DCS6930          Okay.
          BDM              Sorry not for most matches, for

                           for most of the league games they

                           would take their meal before they

                           went onto the track, where the duty

                           is not as lengthy as, as a semi-final.
30.37     DCS6930          I see.    The reason I ask is because

                           the, the two officers shall we say

                           with those trackside duties are

                               important time and I, I wondered

                               whether any consideration was

                               given to that aspect, in the

                               planning or in the briefing?

 30.57    KM                   Not unless it was given by the

                               the Inspector in charge of that

                               serial, because the the briefings

                              that were given to all officers

                              were obviously of a very general

                              nature and it was down to the

                              Sector Superintendents and Serial

                              Sergeants to brief their officers

                              to their specific duties.

          DCS6930             If i, hindsight's been used a

                              great deal here, but and perhaps

                              I'm going to assume later on that

                              you, in your briefing side, that

                              perhaps the, frcm what you've said

                              Mr DUCKENFIELD that overcrowding

                              or monitoring of packing of pens

                              was not perhaps an issue that was

                              talked about. If it is now a matter

                              that is talked about, at football

                              matches, if it is now something

                              that's briefed, would you give any

                              reconsideration to trackside

                              officers having meals between

                              those times?

32.00     KM                  Absolutely.    I I think now at




                                                                         947

                               certain grounds it's necessary

                               to keep the gates open all the

                               time and obviously to keep the

                               police officer presence there

                               all the time that there are

                              people on the terraces.   So

                               that would have to be looked at,

                              with hindsight yes.

                              you you also talk about, and can

                              you confirm that this was one of

                              your changes, you talk about non

                              3 of your statement.    You actually

                              say something like, just past half
32.37                         way.   We're now looking at a

                              to locate and remove?
          BDM                 Yes.

          DCS6930             Is that part of your changes for

                              1989 (000089) from 1988 (000088)?

                              the situation was similar in 1988

                               wait and see how   m arry   there were.

                               There were a small number of

                               people who were entertained I think

                               at the, at the rear of the South

                               Stand, with a radio listening to the

                               match in 1988 (000088).       It's very

                               much a question of how marry you're

                               going to get, if if it's a very

                               managable number you can keep them

                               outside the ground in immediate

                               confines.   If it's going to be a

                               large number, it wasn't an

                               expected large number it was just

                               something in case.

33.47     DCS6930             Do I take it then you were in

                               1988 (000088) it happened and you

                              did something at the time without

                              a contingency for it, but in 1989

                              (000089) you were making a

                              contingency for it?

34.00     DBM                 In 1989 (000089) we were looking

                              at the possibility of fans turning

                              up without tickets and keeping

                              separated and the contingency was

                              there, although it wasn't officially

                              written into the order.

          DCS6930             No.   I think you talk about it in

                              your briefing in any event at some

                              stage?

                                Quite possibly.
 34.25     DCS6930              Yeah, if, where were they actually

                                going to go, I can't, it says

                                locate, remove to and you've got

                                Park, Liverpool to Coal Road.     Can

                                you explain where Coal Road is?

                                who arrived at the railway station

                                and go down this short stretch

                                of road, and then make their way

                               to the ground.     It's on the

                               Liverpool side, if you like, the

                               Liverpool arrival side of the

                               we can keep our eyes on other

                               people without them causing any

                               problems.

          DCS6930              Can you say how marry you had in

          BDM                  I can't, I don't think, I don't

                               know.

          DCS6930              Were they, I mean if they went

                               presume that they were easily

                               managed and were willing to go?

           BDM              Yes I think it was just one of

                            the Inspectors who, who found the

                            This is only hearsay, and hearsay

                            fairly recent.

35.41     DCS6930           How would you expect to get them

                            there?

          BDM               Not easily.    By sort of using the

                            foot officers and just trying to

                           persuade them to go there.    There's

                           no suggestion that we, we could

                           try and force them there.

          DCS6930          Is there any...
          BDM              It is by persuasion and by sort

                           of by hope as much as anything.

          DCS6930          To your knowledge is there any law

                           or anything that gives you the power

                           to do something with them?

                           only, the only power that we could



                                                                        951

                             use of course is, if we expected

                            an immediate breach of the peace,

                            but that very much depends upon

                            the behaviour of the people that

                            we've...

           DCS6930          But the ordinary non ticket holder

                            that's doing nothing wrong other

                            than looking for tickets?
           BDM              No.

           DCS6930          You really are saying that you

                            were hoping to persuade them

                            to, or move them at half a mile,

                            and con, contain them and presumably

                            set up some sort of ccmnunication

                            so that they could listen...
          BDM               That's right,

          DCS6930           or otherwise.
          BDM              That is what we would have liked

                           to have done.

36.45     DCS6930          Did that result from 1988 (000088)

                           on its own or did you have any

                           additional intelligence that non

                           ticket holders were going to be

                           a problem that made you think

                           differently?
          BDM              There was no intelligence, I mean

                           obviously we expect some people

                           to come without tickets, there

                           was no intelligence to suggest




                                                                        952

                              that there would be large numbers

                              or small numbers it was purely

                              a contingency if it occurred.
37.18    DCS6930              Okay.   Can I just go to a meeting

                              that you had now, moving away frcm

                              that, on the 13th of April (130489)

                              with Mr MACKRELL the Club Secretary?
         BDM                  Yes.

         DCS6930              And you went to that meeting with

                              one of the Inspectors I think?
         BDM                 Yes I did.

         DCS6930             Can you briefly tell me what that

                             meeting was for?
37.40    BDM                 Well the meeting was just to, just

                             to to sort of exchange information

                             and to find out several matters

                             that I wanted to bring to the

                             attention of the Club and probably

                             seme matters that they wanted to

                             bring to my attention.   I was

                             concerned about the, the gantry

                             that the television cameras were

                             being mounted on over the West

                             Stand, and whether it was safe.

                             I was concerned about where

                             exactly Mr CLOUGH was going to

                             sit because I think he'd been

                         banned fron the touch line and

                         there was several matters that
 MURRAY              BERNARD D                                   39


                             I wanted to discuss with the

                            Club where they were going

                            to site betting booths, what

                            vulnerable property they had, who

                            the referee was and and matters

                            in general.

           DCS6930          It's a sort of final mop up, make

                            sure everything's right before

                            the day?
           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930          And the Club man frcm your, your

                            point of view.
          BDM               Yes, yes that's the way I look

                            at it.
38.47     DCS6930           Did the, did you actually have

                            anything to do with the, the

                           tickets that were produced or

                           printed for the game?
          BDM              No, no I didn't I know that

                           Chief Superintendent MOLE had

                           asked them to be slightly bolder

                           colour than they were the year

                           before, but that, I had no

                           involvement with the tickets.
          DCS6930          Do you know why Mr MOLE asked that?
39.12     BDM              I think they were sort of pastel

                           shades which it was difficult to

                           decide which was brown, which was

                           red and he asked them to be a




                                                                      954

                             darker shade, and I think they

                            were made a darker shade for the

                             89 (000089) final.
 39.28     DCS6930           Is that because there was a problem

                            with 88 (000088) in terras of

                            people knowing where they've been

                            going?

           BDM              I think it was generally a problem

                            that it wasn't clear frcm the

                            tickets yeah, which was the brown

                            queue, which was the burgandy queue,

                            which was the red queue, whatever

                            the colours were.

          DCS6930           Do you know where that related to

                            was it, was it in general throughout

                            the ground or specifically Leppings

                            Lane?

          BDM               I don't know whether it was anywhere

                            specific, ray impression was that it

                           was generally throughout the ground

                           that the colours were similar.
          DCS6930          But you had no cause yourself to

                           take any part in the, the colouring

                           of those tickets or the...
          BDM              No.

40.06     DCS6930          Or the, what about the inspection

                           of them, to see that you were

                           happy with them that they in

                           fact accorded with the turnstile




                                                                        955

                                numbers or lettering?
           BDM                  I think, I think we received

                                copies of the tickets.   I I don't

                                I didn't inspect them personally.
40.24      DCS6930              It, I mean it has been suggested

                                that the tickets either by colour

                                or lettering caused confusion in

                                the 1988 (000088) 1989 (000089) semi­

                                final.   Would you agree with that?
          BDM                   I would agree with having read and

                                heard what I've heard since the

                               event.

          DCS6930              Mn.

          BDM                  At the time I didn't know.
40.47     DCS6930              You didn't know.   I mean would

                               you give any opinion on Whether

                               you think it was a considerable

                               factor or a factor of any kind

                               in the problems that occurred

                               outside the turnstiles in 89

                               (000089)?
          BDM                  I don't know the extent of it

                               but I I I feel sure it must have

                               been a factor, if someone turned

                               up at a wrong turnstile and was

                               turned away, then obviously

                               it's inpairing the efficiency

                           of the turnstiles and it was very

                           important that those turnstiles
  MURRAY              BERNARD D


                              kept turning, putting people into

                             the ground.
 41.20      DCS6930          So what you're actually saying

                             really is it would appear at

                             88 (000088) there was a, some

                             sort of problem because Mr MOELE

                             acted on it and asked them to

                             to use bolder colours?
            BDM              Yes.

            DCS6930          Which suggests that there was a

                             slight problem of some sort.
            BDM              Yes.
            DCS6930         And that the Police actually did

                             something about it and tried to

                            rectify that problem?
           BDM              Yes, yes.
41.41      DCS6930          But to your knowledge there was

                            nothing wrong with the or nothing

                            suggested that there was anything

                            wrong with the the printing or the

                            numbers to cause confusion other

                            than the colouring?
           BDM              No.

41.56      DCS6930          Thank you.   Moving back now to

                            the actual briefing on the

                            14th of April (140489).   You've

                           mentioned Mr DUCKENFIELDS and we've

                           been through that and I think on page

                           5 of your statement you refer to
 MURRAY              BERNARD D                                     43


                            to your briefing that you did to

                            the Inspectors and above?
           BDM              Yes.

 42.21     DCS6930          Would you be able to tell me

                            whether anything was specifically-

                            said frcm you in terras of safety

                            of any kind?

           BDM              I don't think there was, I think the

                            safety aspect was covered by the

                            Match Commander and I concentrated

                            on specifics.   I have a copy of the

                            briefing notes here.

           DCS6930          Would you just like to look through

                            your briefing notes and see if

                            there's anything that?
          BDM               The, the main one is and the one

                            that I always emphasise at any
42.59                       football matches is the emergency

                           evacuation procedure which is

                           of course a safety measure, the

                           major safety measure, as far as

                           we're concerned, and that would be,

                           that was something I would never

                           leave out at my, my briefing notes.
43.19     DCS6930          So in fact there was a safety

                           input frcm yourself in that

                           briefing on the 14 of April

                           (140489)?
          BDM              Yes.




                                                                        958
MURRAY              BERNARD D

          DCS6930          And that would have been

                            specifically to do with the

                           evacuation of the ground in an

                           emergency situation?
          BDM              That is correct.

          DCS6930          In view of the fact that the,

                           we've just had the, the warning

                           signal, can I terminate this

                           part of the interview now and the

                           time is 11, twelve minutes past

                           interview with Superintendent

                           on the 25th of June (250690).    I

00.35    DCS6930          Could I just remind you Mr

                          MURRAY that the caution still

                          applies.

         KM               Yes.

         DCS6930          Your briefing that we were just

                          talking about in the previous part

                          of the interview.     You actually

                          said that you discussed with Mr

                          MURRAY at the conclusion of....

         KM               No.

         DCS6930          Sorry.     Mr DUCKENFIELD, my

                          apologies.

         KM               Yeah.

00.58    DCS6930          You actually say in your statement

                          that you discussed with Mr

                          DUCKENFIETD after that, cutting

                          down your input on the briefing

                          presumably the following day?

         KM               Yes the full briefing was given

                          to the Inspectors, I had to cut it

                          down for the following day, it was

                          taking too long.    The, the officers

                          just would not give their attention

                          to a briefing of that length.

01.23    DCS6930          Can you tell me, in terms of cutting

                          it down, can you tell me what you

                          cut out?

         KM               Well I can, I cut out if from my
MURRAY             BERNARD D                                     46


                           briefing notes, I cut out the, the

                          details of television and video,

                          the train arrivals and departments,

                          departures for the travelling fans,

                          prisoners and ejections, alchol,

                          the call signs, the administrative

                          pieces, carmuneations, of what to

                          do with property, ground regulations

                          tactics that we've decided upon and

                          some other information that was

                          useful to officers working the

02.17                     event.   All these could be given

                          by the Serial Sergeants and

                          Inspectors to the respective

                          serials, but I didn't cut out the

                          emergency evacuation procedure,

                          which I've always considered is the

                          most important part of my briefing

                          to officers at all events, and I

                          had to keep in something about

                          inflatables which had received a

                          lot of press and media coverage

                          over the last two or three days.

         DCS6930         Do I take it that, that in fact

                          if we look at your briefing notes,

                          that in fact the ones that you've

                          taken out are the ones with a

                          line through?

         BDM             That is correct yes.




                                                                      961

 03.08     DCS6930              Thank you.    When you talked about

                                the, the evacuation, your briefing

                                of the evacuation, does that

                                involve any talk on the the

                                major incident plan that is in

                                existence for your force?
           BDM                  No, the the emergency evacuation

                                procedure is just the way we would

                                evacuate a section of the whole

                                of the ground, if an emergency

                                arose inside the ground.
03.50     DCS6930              Would there be any input to

                               any of the Inspectors and above on

                               the way in which you vrould implement

                               the major disaster plan?
          BDM                  No.

          DCS6930              If, if that plan was to be put

                               into effect on an event such as

                               Hillsborough, how would it be put

                               into effect?
04.25     BDM                  Well the, the officer in charge of

                               the event would possibly call

                               Operation Support, ask for a

                               Major Incident Box to be forwarded

                               to the stadium and take what ever

                               action he considered necessary.

          DCS6930              The, the officers that are at the

                               stadium doing shall we say football

                               duties.

           BDM              Yes.

 04.58     DCS6930          Are they given any designated tasks

                            should a major incident disaster

                            plan be put into effect?
           BDM              No their tasks that they are given

                            which are written into the Order,

                            are in relation to an emergency

                            evacuation which one could say

                            does run hand in hand with a

                            major incident or a major

                            disaster.    Those duties are are

                            specific in connection with

                            evacuating the ground and seeing the

                            people safely away from the stadium

                            but not for a type of incident

                            that occurred on the 15th of

                           April 1989 (150489).
          DCS6930          And the officers there, are you

                           saying are aware of their duties

                           in terms of evacuation?
05.46     RDM              Absolutely the Serial Sergeants

                           are instructed at every event

                           to make the officers aware of

                           their duties for emergency

                           evacuation.    In fact twice

                           during the, that current season

                           the, the emergency evacuation plan

                           was tested to my knowledge and

                           possibly once more.

 06.14     DCS6930          Thank you.    The intelligence

                            briefing that followed your

                            briefing on the 15th of April

                             (150489).   Was there anything

                            in that briefing that would have

                            made you reconsider the Match

                            Order that you'd actually put

                            out or been involved in for that

                            game?
           BDM              No, I, seem to recall that the

                            intelligence was made in relation

                            to pick pockets who were expected

                            to travel from Liverpool as they

                            had done the previous year.      There

                            was no intelligence that I can

                            recall that would have altered our

                            existing plans.

          DCS6930           You'd no additional information on

                            non ticket holders?
          BCM              No.

07.02     DCS6930          Nothing additional on the suggestions

                           that people were going to drink

                           later in public houses or anything

                           like that?
          BDM              No.

          DCS6930          So you were quite happy, as and

                           when you did that briefing, and

                           you heard that intelligence, that

                           your, your match plan was in order




                                                                          964

                           and didn't need any last minute

                          change?

         BDM              No the plan seemed, seemed good.

                          There were no last minute changes,

                          except that copies of the public

                          houses were given to all outside

                          Sergeants showing them which ones

                          were closed, which ones were open,

                          which ones had back doors sales

                          etc.

07.43    DCS6930         Thank you.   Can we move on now to

                          your actual role on the day.      You

                          actually I think say that you had

                          responsibility and overall command

                          of the Control Room?

         BDM             Yes.

08.03    DCS6930         Can you actually explain that in

                          relation to the role of Mr

                          DUCKENFIELD in the Control Room?

         BDM             Well Mr DUCKENFIELD was in overall

08.17                     command of the event.   My job,

                          as I saw it was in the Control

                          Room, overseeing the event, making

                          arrangements for reception of all

                          communications and acting on the

                          information received.   Mr

                          DUCKENFIELD had informed me

                          before the event that he would

                          be taking up his position as
MURRAY              BERNARD D                                    51


                           Canmander in the Control Roan and

                           where as Mr MOLE, the previous

                           year had not.
09.00     DCS6930          Yes, you, I think you actually

                           said to the Public Inquiry that

                           Mr DUCKENFIELD if you want to

                           look at it it's on Page 68 of the

                           transcript and I'll read it out to

                           you, I'm reading page 68 of the,

                           of your transcript.

                           You were asked the question, say

                           you were with Mr DUCKENFIELD or

                           intending to be with Mr DUCKENFIELD

                           for the match itself, and you

                           actually say, Well Mr DUCKENFIELD

                           took up the role which I expected

                           to take up...
         BDM              Which I expected him to take up,

                          that should be.

         DCS6930          What Mr DUCKENFIELD...
         BDM              Which I expected him to take.
         DCS6930          So it's while Mr DUCKENFIELD took

                          up the role which I expected him

                          to take up, which was in the

                          Control Room.

         BDM              That's right.

         DCS6930          Because that makes a completely,

                          that makes a very significant

                          difference to the interpretation




                                                                      966

                          of of that.

09.44    BDM              No, Me DUCKENFIELD didn't take ny

                          role he took the role I expected

                          him to take, because he had already

                          told me that he would be spending

                          most of the time in the Control

                          Roan.     He saw the Match Commanders,

                          that being the Match Commanders

                          position.

         DCS6930          I mean the the question that would

                          come from anybody reading that

                          would be that you you appeared not

                          to be sure of your role because

                          he was actually taking on your

                          role but that's not right?

         BDM              That's not right.

         DCS6930          No.     I mean, had you seen that

                          before in your transcript and

                          realised?

         BDM              I I feel so I think that's, that's

                          why I was so quick to recognise

                          to explain.

10.29    DCS6930          Okay.    So, the year before then,

                          Mr MOLE really had taken a

                          different method?

         BDM              Yeah, their leadership styles

                          were very different.    Mr MOLE

                          did the whole of the briefing

                          himself.    He operated mainly on
MURRAY             BERNARD D


                           the ground and moved around alot,

                          came to the Control Rocm, visited,

                          was in radio contact all the time

                          but didn't spend the whole of

                          the event in the Control Roan.

                          I think Mr DUCKENFIELD saw his

                          position as supervising the

                          event from the Control Roan

                          environment.

11.08    DCS6930          Right, now in terms of the

                          control that you have exercise

                          within the Control Roan.     You are

                          obviously in control of the

                          the officers within that room?
         BDM              Yes.

         DCS6930          Radio comrauncations, decisions

                          being made at that stage caning

11.28                     in requests being made.    Do

                          you put yourself even with

                          Mr DUCKENFIELD in position as

                          the person who responds or makes

                          the decision to agree to, for

                          example a request for the Landrover

                          that that went with the tannoy?
         BDM              If the request is to do with

                         movement of manpower, vehicles

                         and specific request then yes,

                         that's down to me.

         DCS6930         And that's what you performed on
 MURRAY              BERNARD D


                            that day?

           BDM              Yes.

 11.55     DCS6930          Were there any, was there the

                            occasion within that Control

                            Roan environment where the

                            command structure was difficult

                            because Mr DUCKENFIELD was with

                            you?

           BDM              I don't think so.   There there

                            were certain sort of requests

                            that came in which would have

                            been referred to him, whether

                            he'd been in the Control Roan

                            environment or elsewhere and I
12.25                       refer specifically to sort of

                            opening of the gates which is

                            not a decision that I would have

                            taken at the request of a fellow

                            Superintendent.
12.37     DCS6930           So if, if Mr DUCKENFIELD hadn't

                           been, we'll ccme onto it later

                           on, but if he hadn't been in the

                           Control Room when that sort of

                           request made, you would have

                           contacted him, told him the problem

                           and asked for his decision on that

                           matter?
          BDM              Yes.

          DCS6930          That sort of area?
  MURRAY             BERNARD D


           BDM               Yes.

           DCS6930           So are you.
           BDM              Unless circumstances were such that

                            it was impossible to do so.
 12.58     DCS6930          So you are happy that you were

                            clear in your role on that day?
           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930          And there isn't the confusion or

                            or the suggestion that you

                            weren't as in that transcript?
           BDM              No.

 13.16     DCS6930          You produce a log of events...
           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930          which we already referred to and

                            looked at and I think there has been

                            seme suggestion and I know that

                           Mr MARSHALL has intimated that the
13.31                      area of 2.17 (1417) and the

                           request that he made then for the

                           closure of Leppings Lane, that

                           he always felt that was a little

                           bit later.   Are, and I know this

                           was brought up in the public

                           inquiry with you.   Are you still

                           happy that 2.17 (1417) was the

                           time?
13.49      RDM             I'm I'm reasonably happy because

                           of the fact that there was an

                           entry following that at 2.21
MURRAY              BERNARD    D                                        56


                               (1421).   My own impression was that

                               it was later.    I know that there is,

                               is an error somewhere in the log

                               in relation to numbers, but I'm

                               reasonably happy, as I can be,

                               that 2.17 (1417) was the time.
          DCS6930              What watch or clock would you have

                               used for that?
          BDM                  Probably my own, my own watch.
          DCS6930              Your wrist watch. Does it show

                              minutes or...
          BDM                 Minutes.

          DCS6930             Or is a ...
          BDM                 It's not a digital it's, but I

                              can't I can't recall what I was

                              wearing at the time.     I can't

                              even recall whether there was

                              a clock in the Control Roan.
         DCS6930              Neither can I but I daresay

                              we'll see it in a bit.    But if

                              you can't, if you don't know that.
         BDM                  I don't know that I...
         DCS6930              You certainly can't see the...
         BDM                  No.

         DCS6930              The match, digital...
         BDM                  The one that is is is out of

                          view of the Control Roan.
         DCS6930          Thank you.        Can we move on

                          perhaps back now to your your




                                                                             971

                              statement area.   I think you

                             you've gone to the Control Room

                             quite early and you're in
  15.04                      position there. I want to move on

                             perhaps around I think it's

                             about page 6 time, at about

                             12.30 (1230) where you refer

                             to I think supporters drinking and

                             mobile units checking them.      Would

                             that be about right?
            BDM              Yes.

            DCS6930          It's right in the bottom of the

                             page.
            BDM              Yes.

            DCS6930         And moves on to pjage 7 of your

                            statement.
            BDM             Yes.
           DCS6930          At that particular stage, 12.30

                            (1230), you've still got two

                            and a half hours to go, and you

                            talk about mobile units checking

                            them.    Now the they're actually

                            under your control now at this

                            time?

           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930          Cause you, Mr DUCKENFIELD isn't

                            in the box with you anyway?
           BDM             That's right.
15.47      DCS6930         Can you tell me what actually




                                                                           972
  MURRAY          BERNARD D                                     58

                         you tell them to do at that

                          stage?

            BDM          All we can tell then to do is

                         monitor them.    It's not a question

                         of checking them, it's a question

                         of monitoring these public

                         houses and keeping their eyes

                         on them.   There's very little we

                         can do as as you know.    We can't

                         go in and turf them out of the pubs,

                         and we can't step them going into

                         the pubs, we can't close the public
16.13                    houses down.    It's just something

                         that we really should be aware of

                        it happening and units to keep their

                        eye on them, know what is happening

                        in different pubs, because its

                        there's every likelihood they're

                        going to have to respond to them.

                        Would you say that you're trying

                        to gather intelligence at that

                        point?
16.33      BDM          Well, we we we're trying to sort

                        of, we're trying to make sure

                        that, that we get information

                        about what levels of drinking

                       there are, and whether they're

                       going to cause us problems later

                       on, whether they're good humoured,




                                                                     973
MURRAY             BERNARD D                                    59


                          whether they are all supporters

                           from one particular area, I mean

                          the majority of the public houses

                          here were in what we saw as the

                          Nottingham Forest sector tut that

                          didn't particularly mean that they

                          were Nottingham Forest supporters

                          and obviously we we're trying to

17 •06                    keep our segregation policy going.

         DCS6930          In that period shall we say frcm

                          then 12.30 (1230) that you mention

17*15                     onwards.   Was there anything that

                          gave you cause for concern in

                          terms of drink becalming a problem?

                          Did you get any intelligence back

                          or anything that was out of the

                          norm?
         BDM             No.     No more than the previous

                         year.    We, try try as we may, we

                         cannot stop people drinking and

                         attending football matches. There

                         was no suggestion that huge

                         numbers of people were drinking

                         huge quantities of alcohol.      It

                         was the sort of reports that I

                         would expect and the sort of

                         intelligence I would expect from

                         the Tango units.    I wouldn't

                         expect them to drive past the

                            Nottingham Forest supporters and

                            say nothing.    They they would let

                            us know.
18.07      DCS6930          So, nothing unusual at all,

                            nothing that would make you

                            reconsider again your, your

                            plan or your, your, the way in

                            which you were going the police

                            the event prior to kick off?
          BDM               No from my recollection of the,

                            of the year before, we we again

                            had similar calls of this nature,

                           which didn't result in any

                           particular problem.
18.34     DCS6930          Can I perhaps go back and let's

                           look at non ticket holders at

                           the same time.    In this checking

                           of pubs or general patrol that

                           the officers are doing.   Are they

                           given any specific instructions

                           on the checking for non ticket

                           holders?
          BDM              Not particularly the, the Tangos,

                           but we do post serials out at

                           known arrival points on the

                           motorways and on the major roads

                           seme considerable distance away

                           frcm the ground, seme miles, who




                                                                       975

                              check coaches arriving, and check

                              that people have got tickets, and

                              that they're not carrying alcohol.
 19.18      DCS6930          Does that information get fed back

                             to you in the Control Room?
            BDM              If it, if it's of interest to us

                             yes.

            DCS6930          Well non ticket holders...
            BDM              Absolutely.

            DCS6930          would be of interest.
            BDM              Well what, what they were trying to

                             do well if it was a bus, if it was

                             a coach load of non ticket holders,

                             the instructions were to turn than

                             round and escort them back up the

                            motorway.   Obviously if it's half
19.46                       and half there is a problem, but

                            we didn't get any information on

                            the day that people were travelling

                            without tickets.
19.52      DCS6930          So you would have expected officers

                            one to have done that because

                            that's part of the briefing and

                            the plan is to actually stop

                            coaches and that?
           BDM              Yes.
20.01      DCS6930          I know that secondly there is a

                            situation where individual

                            officers will stop people out and

                             about in Leppings Lane for tickets.

                            Would you expect shall we say

                             individual stop checks to be

                            reported anywhere to assess the

                            build up or is that, I mean let's

                            say you've got fifty officers all

                            doing that.     Is that an impossible

                            task to cane back for you in the

                            Control Roan.    Would you expect them
                            to do that?
 20.27      BDM
                            I don't expect them to do that, not

                           officers on on public order, but

                           officers who have seen coach

                           loads of supporters in will probably

                           do that.   I mean each Inspector will

                           brief his, his serial in the way

                           that he feels they can best carry

                           out their duties.
20.46      DCS6930
                           I mean it has been suggested that

                          non ticket holders eventually were

                          were part of the overall problem in

                          the last few minutes.     I think

                          there's been various estimates.

                          What I'm trying to find out is, was

                          there anywhere that the officers

                          have obviously been briefed to go

                         and look for them at the different

                         locations and to find out, but

                         is there, is there any way in which




                                                                          977

                            that was coming together from outside

                           where somebody could have come to

                           you and said, I think vre've got more

                           of a problem than, than perhaps we

                           had last year.    Or is it really

                           just a matter of, they deal with it

                           on the grounds they do it, they

                           send them back, but they don't

                           actually tell anybody perhaps

                           until the debrief later on that,

                           Oh I stopped x number of coaches?
          BDM              I don't know.    I honestly don't
21.31                      know.   I would expect to, I would

                           expect to get seme information if

                           we had a a problem with with non

                           ticket holders, but I didn't

                           get any information on the day

                           and I wouldn't expect to know

                          that they'd turned a car load

                          back or a van load back until

                          later.

21.48     DCS6930         So, in that case there would

                          have been nothing to make you

                          feel prior to kick off time that

                          if non ticket holders were a

                          problem that in fact it was

                          building up that way?

                            recall him making any comments

                            about the difference in the build

                            up of supporters inside the ground,

                            that the Nottingham fans were in

                            quite early, but there seemed a

                            problem with the Liverpool fans?
           BDM              I can't recall it, he may have, but

                            I can't recall it.

 23.20     DCS6930          It it, I mean it suggests that he

                            he noticed a considerable difference

                            and he, if you like, brings out

                            a concern at around that time?
          BDM               He say's this?

          DCS6930           Yes.   Well I'm I'm saying that

                            that's, that's what I believe

                            that he said in the Control Box or

                           made seme corment about, you you

                           have in fairness said you don't

                           recall it, but from your point

                           of view, this is the question,
23.46                      was there any concern at that

                           time from you that there was a

                           problem with, with people in the

                           stadium and, and a different

                           build up?
23.58     BDM              There was certainly a lot less on

                           the Liverpool section of the ground

                           than there were Nottingham, there

                           were a lot more Nottingham Forest
 MURRAY             BERNARD    D


                               supporters in.    I don't know whether

                               it was concern but I was, I was

                               hoping that they were going to

                               be here very quickly and in fact

                               it was very shortly after that

                               that they did start to, to arrive

                               in larger numbers.

24.22     DCS6930              As you say, perhaps not concern

                               but, you, you were certainly

                               alive to the difference?
          BDM                  Absolutely. Yes.

          DCS6930              So it perhaps wouldn't have been

                               an unusual thing for Mr JACKSON

                               to have said?

          BDM                  It wouldn't have been, because if

                              it was, it was apparent at that

                              stage that there were far more

                              Nottingham supporters than

                              Liverpool.

          DCS6930             Was Mr JACKSON there for the 1988

          BDM                 I don't know.
24.47     DCS6930             You don't know.   The, the next

                              one is, is really in relation

                              to Mr CREASER.    I know you were

                              asked this at the public inquiry

                              over the suggestion that and I

                              think I've got it right that

                              you don't recall this happening
 MURRAY             BERNARD D


                            about how do we, how do we fill

                            up, do we fill these pens up one at

                           a time until they're full and go

                           on, and in fairness you've said

                           you don't remember that conversation.

                           In 1988 (000088) was it done that

                           way?
 25.17                     No 1988 (000088) it was the

                           terraces there, let them find

                           their own level was the term,

                           let them come and and go where

                           they want.
          DCS6930          Am I right in, in saying that on

                           sane league games you in fact do

                           do that system where you you

                           slowly fill up, going along

                          and perhaps would would keep

                          them within say pens 1 and 2 if

                          they weren't too many supporters?

                          Yes, we we do it, we do it
25.50                     deliberately.   It it's an attempt

                          to estimate from the intelligence

                          the number of away supporters

                          that will be arriving and to make

                          a section of the ground available

                          for them, if we think they can

                          be confined in the centre two

                          pens and they will be the ones

                          that will be used, because they're
  MURRAY              BERNARD D


                              the furthest away from, from the

                             visiting, from the home supporters.

                             If however the intelligence is

                             that they're going to need three

                             pens or four pens then they will

                             made available prior to the start.
            DCS6930          Has Mr CREASER got experience of

                             that?
 26.24     RDM               Well Mr CREASER has worked before

                             I came to Hamilton Road, he worked

                             along officers at Hillsborough.
           DCS6930           So he he would have been used to

                             that system?
           BDM               He may well have been used to that

                             system.
 26.36     DCS6930          And that, I mean that I presume

                            there is every possibility that

                            because he's used to league

                            matches or seen it that would

                            have been perhaps a reason why

                            he would have bought it up,

                            not because it was a plan or?
           BDM              It's not a a, it was never a

                            deliberate sort of venture at a

                            league match, to say well we

                            will fill pens 2 and 3 and when

                            they are full we'll fill pen

                            1 and when that's full we'll we'll
27.01                       fill pen 4.   It was an estimate

                               as to the number of supporters

                               that would come and space they

                              would require.    On some matches

                              we may get two thousand visiting

                               fans and make space available

                              for them on the terraces and

                              they all decide to sit down.

                              At other matches nobody decides

                              to sit down and stand and they

                              all come on the terraces and

                             we've then got to make more

                             space available.    But I've

                             never, it's a question of saying

                             well we'll give them pen 2.
            DCS6930          M n.

           BDM               We don't close one and fill

                             another one, we just open an

                             ajoining pen.
           DCS6930          Again out of interest going

                            back to what we said earlier

                            about the tunnel gates.     If you

                            if you're just going to use 1 and

                            2, how do you actually...
           BDM              2 and 3 do you mean, 3

                            and 4 whatever we want to call

                            th a n .

           DCS6930         Which ever, well let's say that

                           you didn't want to use 3 and 4.
27.50                      How would you stop them going




                                                                       984

                     down the tunnel?
                                         f

 BDM                 I've never, we've never failed to

                     use 3 and 4, we always use 3

                     and 4.    We always use the ones that

                     are first away from the home fans.

                     There is a gate to stop people

                     caning down the tunnel which I

                     found about, I didn't know which

                     way it opened, which way it

                     closed.   But there is a gate there

                    where the tunnel can be sealed off

                    but i think that is purely a

                    security gate for the Club to

                    stop people.
DCS6930             To stop people getting into the

                    ground.
BDM                 getting onto the pitch.
DCS6930             Okay then fine thank you.    Again

                    moving through your, your statement,

                    you do say that about, I think

                    about quarter past two (1415), 2.15

                    the Kop area was, was filling up

                    quite nicely and I think you've

                    already intimated that you've

                seen a slight difference with the

                Liverpool supporters side caning

                in.      So you've seen a little bit

                of a difference,        it it's around

                this quarter past two time (1415)
  MURRAY             BERNARD D


  28.52                      time or 2.17 (1417), that you

                             actually made this log about the

                            problem or the the request from Mr

                            MARSHALL.      If we just, perhaps we

                            can just remind ourselves on the

                            video of the view in 1989 (000089)
 29.09                      and it's Document 109.     At at 2.17

                            (1417).
           BDM              Yes.

           DCS693Q          I only want to try and clarify a

                            little bit if you, I think you've

                            looked at the monitors when the

                            request came through.
           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930          If I recall.
           BDM             Yes.

           DCS6930         And you've probably looked at

                           these a number of times since, but

                           if we look at 2.17 (1417) which is

                           ccming on to now, if you see the

                           bottcm left hand corner shows

                           1416 (1416).     Does that help in

                           any way of confirming your 2.17

                           (1417) and the other question

                           I'd ask is, going back to how you
29.45                      took the time.     Would would that

                           time of been apparent to you on

                          there and could you have used

                          that clock for example?
  MURRAY              BERNARD D


            BDM               I think that time, whether it's

                             on the actual monitor, I don't

                             know, it may well be on the

                             recording, I wouldn't look at the

                             at the monitor that was actually

                             recording at the time, I would

                             look at the five fixed TV monitors.
            DCS6930          Mn.

            BDM              And which would in front and near

                             to my left but not the recording

                             machine which is to my right.
           DCS6930           If we just, can you just put that

                             on play and if you want to stop
 30.21                       it at all, I, I mean the crowd

                             is, is fairly considerable there,

                            at that stage, and going back

                            up towards Leppings Lane, again

                            for the benefit of the audio, we're
30.32                       looking at Document 109 timed at

                            1416 (1416) and I think it flits

                            about now.   Can can you say now

                            whether that was the sort of view

                            and crowd that you would have seen

                            at that time?
           BDM              I can't, I can't recall but I I

                            can recall sort of about 2.15 (1415)

                            about that time, thinking well,
30.56                       good there's plenty of people

                             45 minutes to go yet, they're

                            starting to come in, a lot

                            quicker than they were before,

                            this is what we want.     There's

                            plenty of room in the ground and

                            let's get them in.

                            we've got Mr MARSHALL'S request

                            saying close it off, but really

                            that's because of the, the

                            traffic situation, to close the

                            traffic off?
           BDM             Yes.

           DCS6930         Are you quite happy with the build

                           up of the crowd at that stage?
           BDM             Yes.
31.29      DCS6930         There's no, there's nothing that

                           caused you alarm then?
          BDM              There's nothing unusual there

                           are alot of people to come, that

                           are caning, and and there's plenty

                           of time.

                           you can switch that off now, we're

                          video.    Mr DUCKENFIELD is with

                            Mr DUCKENFIELD discuss that request?
             BDM            I I can't, I can't honestly recall

                            it.    I can't I can't recall whether

                            we discussed it or not.    We may have,
 32.14                      I may have said to him, we're

                            going to have to close Leppings

                            we're going to have to close it,

                            if Mr MARSHALL wants it closing,

                            that sort of conversation may have

                            taken place but I can't, I can't

                            recall turning round to him and

                            saying, such, Do you want me to

                           close it.
32.32      DCS6930         No.    So you, who actually, did

                           you actually say okay close it

                           and gave the instruction?
           BDM             Yes.

           DCS6930         I know there was again a bit of a

                           delay in it actually happening.
           BDM             I I think so, I think so, but

                           I can't be one hundred per cent

                           sure, but I (to recall looking at the

                           video and thinking, well fair
32.55                      enough, I don't think it's too

                           bad in lappings Lane but if Mr

                          MARSHALL wants it closed then he's

                            it closed.
 33.05    DCS6930          Would either, would Sergeant GODDARD

                           or one of the other officers, would

                           they have done that without your

                           authority?
          BDM              Em.

          DCS6930          I mean could it have happened

                           agreeing it?

                          tremendous local knowledge which

                          I haven't of the area and if a

                          unit is requested at a particular

                          area, he knows exactly where it

                          is and he knows a unit on stand,
33.40                     that is near.   If Sergeant GODDARD

                          gets an instruction from outside

                          or a request from outside and he

                          autanatically sends someone,

                          by that unless I agree otherwise.

                         And if he did something that I

                         disagreed with I would tell him

                         and say no or we'll do something

                            at the situation, to see whether

                            it wanted another look to see

                          of the event and to go to the toilet

                          which we don't have.   But for

                          at half time briefing to the

                          officers.

35.22    DCS6930          Okay.   Did you ask at any time

                          following that request for any

                          of the officers shall we say

                          outlying areas whether the crowd

                          was a problem, whether there was

                          a bigger build up ccming at all?

         BDM              No I I don't think I asked.

         DCS6930          Any reports caning in that you

                          could recall that, from people

                          saying, I've still got people in

                          coaches or I've still got, you

                          know, they're aren't as many

                          coaches here as they should be,

                          anything else to warn you that

                          you know well I'm going to get

                          additional crowds caning over

                         would expect?

         BDM              The only, the only information

                         was that at one public house there

                         was a lot of people in and there

                         were urinators outside, as far

                         as I can recall, there was no

                         information, no, no information




                                                                      992

                                on those lines.
 36.11     DCS6930              The number of officers actually

                                in and around Leppings Lane,

                                did you at that stage consider

                                yourself or discuss with Mr

                                DUCKENFIELD the, the possibility

                                of sending any additional resources?
          BDM                   Not at that stage.    As far as I

                                can recall, there was forty odd

                                PC'S on foot outside the turnstiles

                               together with the horses and no

                               at that stage I didn't see a

                               need for extra officers and

                               I hadn't had any requests for extra

                               officers.
36.52     DCS693Q              Was there anything here that

                               made you consider that it was

                               different to 1988 (000088)?
          BDM                  It was different to 1988 (000088)

                               in as much as we were closing

                               Leppings Lane.   That was the

                               major difference.     There was,

                               there was not as many people

                               in the stadium on the Liverpool

                           side, I wouldn't have thought

                           as there were in 1988 (000088),

                           but I still considered that at

                           that stage with so long to

                           go before the kick off that

                                  time was on our side.
 37.28       DCS6930              I mean would you recall looking

                                  at it that the 1988 (000088),

                                  the numbers of people in

                                  lappings Lane in 1988 (000088)

                                 would you have looked at the

                                 monitors in 1989 (000089) and

                                 thought, this is different.       I

                                 knew, I knew again that this

                                 was asked of you in the public

                                 inquiry, and I knew you said you

                                 can't, you couldn't really

                                 recall or remember?
37.47      BDM
                                 I I can't recall.     I have an

                                 impression that there were more

                             people in the stadium in 1988

                                 (000088) at 2.15 (1415) than

                             there were at 2.15 (1415) in

                             1989 (000089).     So far as the

                             actual distribution of people

                             outside I can't recall.       Vie

                             didn't have a problem in 1988

                             (000088) so there was nothing

                            for me to sort of really remember

                            and hang on to.
          DCS6930           The, the situation at that stage

                            was that you you had access to

                            the turnstiles counts in the

                            Ground Control Room?

            BDM              That's correct, yes.
            DCS6930          And again, I think emphasising

                             the public inquiry side, that you

                             you couldn't recall actually

                             using that facility or, or

                             checking it.   But in fact I

                             think you were told, and I think

                             it's right to say that somebody

                             in the Control Roan, in your

                             Control Roan, was actually on

                             three or four occasions monitoring

                             that situation.    Is that correct?

                            What I've just said there?
38.46      BDM              So far as I'm concerned, I never

                            made contact with the Club's Control

                            Rocm to find out numbers inside the

                            ground and I cannot recall

                            at all anybody giving me any

                            information that there were x

                            number of people inside the ground

                            and I do know that the Club

                            Control Roan have said that they

                            were given that information to

                            someone in the Control Roan.

                            If that is correct fair enough,

                           but that information never, was

                           never given to me.
          DCS6930          Is it something in the experience

                           that you've had in there, is it

                             not because there's a need or a

                             an urgency or anything else just

                             in general practice?
            BDM              No it it's a nice little facility,

                             because we we find out at the

                             end of the day just how many

                             visiting supporters we've had.
            DCS6930         Mm.
            BDM             And what the crowd is and generally

                            the, the, that's the only time we

                            use the facility to find out the

                            total number of visitors for our

                            records.
39.58      DCS6930          So you have never had to use that

                            facility in terms of an operational

                            difficulty with a crowd getting

                            into the ground?

                            No, I I haven't used it in the

                            past.
40.13      DCS6930         And you have, have you ever had

                           an operational difficulty with the

                           crowd getting into the ground in

                           the past?

         BDM              No.

         DCS6930           So there would have been no, there

                           is no precedent for you, if you

                           like, to have learnt that that

                          was available to you for that

                          reason?

         BDM              That's correct.

         DCS6930          Thank you.   You you did estimate

                          I think at one stage the number of

                          people that you thought were outside

                          a little bit later on.   Did you

                          know the turnstile counts per hour

                          system.   Were you that well informed

                          that you would knew that, out of

                          those 23, of 23 turnstiles at

                          Leppings Lane that x number of

                          people could come through per

                          hour?

40.53    GEM              No, I I was given a general sort of

                          break down in turnstiles as a

                          thousand an hour for an event

                          of this nature, where there's no

                          money changing hands it's merely

                          tickets and a thousand a minute

                          so far as the ground overall was

                         concerned.    I I accept that that

                          it was very rough figures, but the

                         point that was being made to me

                         when they were given was that




                                                                       997

                            this ground can shift ten thousand

                           people, all the way round, and I

                           have seen in fact huge numbers of

                           people, accomodated in the five

                           or six minutes before a kick

                           of at Hillsborough.
41.43     DCS6930          Who who actually gave you that

                           sort of information.    Was it

                           the Club?

                           I can't remember whether it was,

                           whether it was the Club, Mr M3LE

                           or one of the Liaison Officers,

                           it was just given as, as sort of

                           rough figures to to work on.
         DCS6930          General information?
         BEM              Yeah.

         DCS6930          Not again am I right in saying,

                          it's not because you had experienced

                          any concern or problem, it was

                          really just general information on

                          that?
         BEM              It was more of on one occasion

                          standing looking around and

                          someone saying to me, either from

                          the Club or the Police side, I

                          can't recall which.    Don't worry,

                          we can, we can get a thousand a

42.26      DCS6930           I mean would you have known to

                            the extent that they can actually

                            identify and again I think this

                            came up at the public inquiry,

                            specifically the group of

                            turnstiles and the count

                            differences for those turnstiles?
          BEM               I...

          DCS6930           Was that within your knowledge?
          BEM               I know that they can give the

                            information on every specific

                            turnstile, I don't know how

                            difficult it is to, to group

                           turnstiles, turnstiles together

                           and whether it is more difficult

                           than we are using recognised

                           turnstiles for one part of the

                           ground to the other.    But I

                           knew that they can give you

                           that information, I don't

                           know whether it would be, whether

                           they'd be able to give it at

                           the drop of a hat or whether it

                           would be a lengthy process.
         DCS6930           I knew that the tape is going

                          minutes, I think it's perhaps

                                  talk about, by 1435 hours (1435)

                                  the Control Room was busy and

                                 perhaps it's my interpretation

                                 to says its concern at that time.

                                 Did you have concerns around

                                 that time?
 01.29      RDM
                                 Yes, I had I had concerns, I had

                                 a hint of concern about 2.30 (1430)

                                 when I looked at the crowd and

                                 I looked at the time we had

                                 available and in my own mind I

                             was satisfied that we would get

                             the crowd into the stadium in time

                             for 3 o'clock (1500) by 3 o'clock
02.00
                                 (1500) and did make comment of

                             that to Mr DUCKENFIELD.       We were

                             getting busy in the Control Roan

                             shortly after and the crowd was

                             beginning to, was increasing and

                             people were still arriving.

MURRAY              BERNARD D


                           you've said it was quite a large

                           crowd there and then by 2.30 (1430)

                           2.35   (1435) there is this concern

                           enough for you to talk to Mr

02.50     DCS6930          And again I know at the public

                           inquiry you were then questioned

                           in terms of the discussion about

                           the delay kick off and the

                           reminder that Mr DUCKENFIELD

                           said, remind me of the, the

                          reasons, which you did that.     Can

                          you tell me why that conversation

                          came up at that time?
          BDM             I don't know the reason but it

                          was, it was a straight question

                          from Mr DUCKENFIELD, just remind

                          me what we said about delaying

                          kick off.   There were no hard and

                          fast rules about delaying kick off

                          and the sort of reasons that I had
                                                     a
                          reiterated to Mr DUCKENFIELD some

                          days earlier at a meeting were

                         the same as I'd heard Mr MOLE say

                         the previous year.
         DCS6930         I mean the, the impression would

                         be that because of the concerns
MURRAY             BERNARD D                                    88

                           that you had identified that the

                           reason to talk about a delay kick

                          off was, was because in fact you

                          felt you couldn't get the crowd

                          in.    That seems the logical

                          reason to, to talk about delay, but

                          do do I take it that that wasn't

                          a part of the consideration at that

                          time that you couldn't get the

                          crowd in?
04.11     RDM             No it it, it wasn't a part of

                          consideration to me, I took it

                          as as Mr DUCKENFIELD saying well

                          tell what we'd said about delaying

                         kick off, presumably in case

                         we have to do it.
         DCS6930         But, but the events are not

                         connected as far as you're

                         concerned?
         BDM             The events weren't, weren't

                         connected, no.
         DCS6930         Certainly not in your mind or?
         BEM             No.

         DCS6930         obviously you can't speak for

                         Mr DUCKENFIELD'S mind at that

                         time?

         BDM            No, it it wasn't a straight sort

                        of, there was a big crowd out

                        there tell me what we said about




                                                                     1003

                              delaying kick off.   It was more of

                              a statement from me to him saying

                             there are a lot of people there but

                             I feel that we'll get them in for

                             3 o'clock (1500).
 04.50      DCS6930          Just out of interest what was the

                             practical way in which the kick

                             off would have been delayed I

                             mean lets, lets just say that at

                             that time you'd have said, well

                             we can't get them in, we've got

                             to delay the kick off.    How how

                             was it in fact to be done?
           BDM              What I would have done was radioed

                             the Track Inspector, or a Serial

                            Sergeant in respect of Serial,

                            Serial 1, whose instructions were

                            during the whole of the event

                            there should be one of them at the

                            players' tunnel entrance to go

                            and inform the referee and

                            officials that we would be

                            delaying the kick off.
05.26      DCS6930          Mr GREENWOOD a part of that

                            plan or?
           BDM              They, they were under Mr GREENWOOD'S

                            control and the radio system

                            that operated in respect of

                                                                         1004

                             messages were on talk through

                              so that all radio messages were

                             both ways should have been heard

                             by everyone with a radio.
            DCS6930          And Mr GREENWOOD other than

                             being heard would he of actually

                             been informed?
 05.53      BDM              Well Mr GREENWOOD would of been

                             informed.   Yes he would of been

                             informed the kick off was to be

                             delayed.
 05.58      DCS6930          And, and what is the next stage

                             on frcm that, having got the

                             referee told, I mean is there a was

                             there a plan by which either you or

                            Mr DUCKENFIELD wDuld actually

                            go and tell him the reasons?
           BDM              There was no, there was no plan.

                            There was no sort of set plan

                            for, for delaying the kick off.

                            It would then have of been the

                            Club would have been informed.

                            The Managers of the two sides

                            would be informed by the referee.
           DCS6930          Mn.

           BDM              And then if necessary the crowd

                            would be informed obviously by

                            the public address system.
06.29      DCS6930          I I think you've just said it

                                wasn't really a rigid policy.
           BDM                  It wasn't.

           DCS6930              On terms of the only reasons

                                you would, you would delay.

                                The, the other Superintendents

                                there in particular, were they

                                all aware of the, shall we say,
06.45                           the reasons why it would have

                                been delayed, that you actually

                                reminded Mr DUCKENFIELD of?
           BDM                  I can't, I can't honestly say.

                                I don't know whether that was,

                               I don't think that was ever sort

                               of approached at a, at an official

                               meeting,   it may have been brought

                               up at the, at the first meeting
07.08                          which happened about the 20th

                               20th of March (200389) or 21st

                               (210389), 22nd of March (220389).

                               Mr MOLE might have brought it up

                               at that meeting but unfortunately

                               I can't remember everything that

                               that took place.
          DCS6930          Would you say it was ever that

                           rigid that someone like Mr MARSHALL

                           if he'd have felt that he wanted

                           to do it, vrould it, wxLLd it have

                           ever been that rigid that he

                           couldn't ask?




                                                                          1006
  MURRAY              BERNARD D


  07.32      BDM              It wasn't rigid.   It was not rigid

                             at all.    it was just, if you like

                             a, a contingency for a certain

                             set of circumstances.     If people

                             were late arriving then obviously

                             this is what we would do.    Wte

                             would delay the kick off.
 07.50      DCS6930          At around 2.40 (1440) you have

                             the Inspector on the mounted,

                             Inspector HANDS DAVIS requesting

                             assistance to Leppings Lane.       Do

                            you recall that?
           BDM              Yes I do.
           DCS6930          And I think it's Police Sergeant

                            GODDARD that actually sends or

                            request Sergeant SOULSBY who

                            was a Mounted Sergeant?
           BDM              Correct.
           DCS6930          To send all available horses

                            to Leppings Lane?
           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930          Did, did you question that request

                            in any way?
08.19      BDM             No I accepted that that Inspector

                           HAND DAVIS is a very experienced

                           mounted officer and he wanted more

                           mounted officers round there, if

                           there were any available.     Sergeant

                           GODDARD picked the message up
MURRAY              BERNARD D


                            imrtediately and and sent it straight

                           out to, to Sergeant SOULSBY which

                            I was in full agreement with and

                           it was, it seemed a sensible thing

                           to do.

          DCS6930          Did Mr DUCKENFIELD corrment on it?
          BDM              No I don't think so.

08.54     DCS6930          Again I know that almost as a

                           result of that or at about the

                           same time, Serial 20 was

                           despatched...

         BDM               That's correct.

         DCS6930           from the gym as a, I think you

                           term it back up or it's just

                           contingency?

09.09    BDM               Obviously at that time the

                           mounted officers were asking for

                           assistance.    There is obviously

                           a problem in Leppings Lane.     I am

                           looking at what I've got available

                           to send there if they require

                           further assistance and the only

                           spare serial that is available is

                           the one reserve serial that

                          remains, the other one unfortunately

                          had been deployed elsewhere.

         DCS6930          Yes, that's the only one that you

                          knew was, well the only one that

                          was available at that time?

            BDM                  Yes.

            DCS6930              I know later on you talk about

                                 sending 5 and 50...
            BDM                  That's correct,
           DCS6930               but those officers weren't

                                 actually available at 2.40 (1440)?
           BDM                   They, whether they were or not I

                                 don't know.
           DCS6930              Well, they, they weren't part

                                of your.
           BDM                  Their plan makes them available

                                from after 2.45 (1445) on time.

                                So they shouldn't have been.
           DCS6930              They shouldn't have, they they

                                would not have been officers

                                that you knew were available to

                                you?
          BDM                   No.
10.05     DCS6930               You sent all available officers

                                at that time?
          BDM                   I have sent the one available

                            serial I I have, obviously if

                            I had received information that

                            there, there were other officers

                            who were available that might have

                            affected my decision.
          DCS6930           Okay.       You actually made that

                            decision and gave that instruction

                            to do that?

                             what I could see, that the crowd

                             was starting to to ccnpact and that

                             but did you in any way either

                            what the problem was?

 10.56     DCS6930          Did yourself and Mr DUCKENFIELD

                            at that time enter into any

            DCS6930          Sorry, 2.35 (1435), 2.17 (1417)

            DCS6930          Eighteen minutes, around that
 11.45                       eighteen minute period, did you

                             at any time discuss between

                             you whether there was anything

                             else that you could do to assess

                             the situation?
            BDM              I don't think so.   Bearing in

                             mind that there was other things

                             happening, but Leppings Lane

                            would be demanding most of my

                            attention obviously because of

                            the circumstances that were
1 2. 12                     there.   I don't recall sort of

                            discussing what else we could do.

                            The public address system was

                            PC RYAN was asked to use the

                            public address system to stop

                            people, tell people to sort

                            of move back, and stop pushing

                            and about what time it was

                            that the radio collapsed on us

                            I don't know.
12.38      DCS6930          Okay, did you give any specific
 MURRAY              BERNARD D


                             instructions to that Serial 20

                             that you, you asked to go, were

                             they given any specific instruction

                             as to what to do when they got

                             there?
            BDM             No I didn't give them an

                            instruction, they were told

                            to go to the Leppings Lane end
12.55
                            and assist.    I I didn't give them

                            a particular instruction.
           DCS6930          I mean at that point, they would

                            of, they could of expected in

                            any event to see certainly one of

                           the Chief Inspectors or Inspectors

                           already on the ground?
           BDM             Wall the main thing was, they

                           would be there, I mean the

                           gymnasium is a considerable way,

                           distance frcm the Leppings Lane and

                           the main thing was that they would

                          be up there and available.
          DCS6930         Now that's actually coming frcm

                          the gymnasium along the side of

                          the back of the North Stand,

                          and actually inside the ground?
          BDM             Inside the ground.    I would

                          think that would be their approach.

MURRAY             BERNARD D


                           the ground?   Now I don't know at

                           that point whether you would have

                          known that, or whether it was the

                          fact that they perhaps couldn't

                          get out into Leppings Lane,

                          perhaps that thought didn't

                          enter your head but was there

                          any way in which you could have

                          sent other deployed officers to

                          the outside of Leppings Lane?
          BDM
                          If there were officers to deploy

                         and obviously the mounted going

                         to the outside of Leppings Lane,

                         if there were officers to deploy

                         there there are ways round,

                         depending on where they're coining

                         Plus the fact that there, there

                        were a large number of officers

                         in Leppings Lane or as far as

                        I was concerned, as far as I

                        was aware, there there were

                        several serials actually in

                        Leppings Lane.
•22      DCS6930        And Mr MARSHALL at that point

                        had had he made any other

                        requests for additional resources

                        or or anything like that?

           BDM             No.     The the only request I

                           can recall was a request for the

                           the announcements over the tannoy

                           and a loud speaker vehicle to

                           Leppings Lane.
 14.43    DCS6930          That was the PC BUXTON?
          BDM              Yes, a vehicle came up a few

                           minutes later.
          DCS6930          If we take it that the the Police

                           Control Box is what, how far

                           from the turnstiles about a

                           hundred yards?
          BDM              Fran the turnstiles to Leppings

                           Lane?

          DCS6930          Yes.

          BDM             Yes, possibly less.
          DCS6930         Possibly less.    Did either and I I

                          accept that you've just told me

                          that you would never leave that
15.08                     Control Box, was it ever discussed

                          that perhaps Mr DUCKENFIELD should

                          go and try and assess the situation

                          on the ground, bearing in mind the

                          fact that the monitors and the

                          television give a restricted view.

                          Taking into account the build up

                          of of problems that are just

                          perhaps itemised. Was that

                          ever discussed?

15.35      DCS693G
                            Was there any conversation with

                            Mr GREENWOOD in terms of any

                            problems within the concourse

                            area that you could recall.     That'

                            the when I say the concourse areg

                            perhaps we'll all agree I I'm

                            talking about the area between the

                            shall we say the back of the

                            turnstiles and the West Stand

                            area?
          BDM              Yeah, I don't recall having any

                           problems there at all.
          DCS6930          And I think you've just said as

                           well and I I think it's right to

                           to bring this in at this point,

                           that this is only one area of the

                           ground and you've got some, you've

                           got problems there but there were

                           three other areas of the ground

                          that you were also policing and
.15
                          had responsibility for.   Did you,

                          can you recall any specific

                          problems elsewhere in the ground

                          at this time?
         BDM
                          The main concern to me was the

                          was the Kop, over and above

                          lappings Lane and the situation

                          on the Kop where we'd ear marked
BERNARD D


        a sterile area for Liverpool

        fans who we knew would soon obtain

       tickets for the Kop.     They'd

       been some arrests there round

       about 2.15 (1415).     It was

       beginning to fill up, we were

       obviously going to get more

       fans, it was a question of some

       contingency being made to

       receive and house that overspill

       and I know that Mr GREENWOOD at

       seme stage, but I don't know

       when, was asked to look at that

       and decide where he was going to

       put any of the Liverpool fans

       that, that came in.    So far as

      the North Stand and the South

      Stand are concerned, everything

      seemed to be going okay there

      and it wasn't an area that we

      particularly expected problems.

      There was of course other things

      happening outside the ground and

      not in the vicinity of the ground,

      the, there was some report of

      Middlewood Road in the vicinity

      of the park of youths with sticks

      gathering, there was also still

      the frustrating question of the
 MURRAY              BERNARD D


                             of the unit that wanted a

                            breathaliser kit, we didn't have

                            a dragar, it was something that

                            had never been requested in the

                            past and had never been planned

                            for, this meant that we had to

                            bring it frcm the host station

                            Harrmerton Road, meant that they

                            had to call a car in, pick up

                            a dragar, fight their way through

                           the football track, just because

                           someone wanted a a breath tested.
18.10      DCS693G
                           I mean for people who aren't police

                           officers that, what I want to

                           try and do is get some description

                           of, of a Police Control Rocm

                           because on the ground, firstly

                           the recording or the the radio

                           transmissions that you do there

                          are not taped or kept are they?
          BDM             No.
          DCS6930         You have both conversations

                          of Police Officers inside the

                          ground on a talk through

                          situation which is all, you can

                          over hear presumably and if it's

                          on a talk through is it correct

                          that that talk through is both

                                 say Police Officer to Police

18.50       DCS6930              So you have that situation within

                                 the ground.    You you still have

                                 at this point outside the ground

                                 on all four sides of the ground

                                a number of Police Officers there

                                are in ccmmunication or giving

                                you reports, for example what

                                you've just said breathalisers,

19'10                           at that time.    I mean is that

                                radio constantly in use in that

                                Control Box, we're talking around

                                and can you describe to anybody

                                listening to this how that

                                radio's I mean is it just the odd

                                call or is it call after call

                            after call?

          BDM              Well it's continuous, if if i can

                            paint a picture for you, you've

                            probably seen the Control Box which

                            on the photographs looks larger

                            than it is.

 19.45    BDM               No.   We sit three abreast which

                           covers the whole width of the

                           Control Room.    Myself on the left,

                           Sergeant GODDARD with the radio and

                           his map in the centre and PC RYAN

                           on his right.    PC RYAN has a couple

                           of telephones in front of him, he's

                           also got the PA system.     Now behind

                           us is PC BICHARD with his controls

                           for the, CCTV and on this occasion

                           Mr DUCKENFIELD was standing on the

                           raised area with him.
          DCS6930          Behind you?
20.20     BDM              Behind me.    Consistently calls were

                           being received by radio, calls were

                          being received by telephone some of

                          them requiring no action except the

                          telephone being answered, there are

                          two telephones there.    At that time

                          PC RYAN was trying to speak

                          continously into the tannoy system.

                          Sergeant GODDARD is trying to

                          respond to messages, PC BICHARD is

                          trying to find out what he should

                          be videoing and I think that you'll

                          find that the majority of it was

                          on the actual Kop because that is

                          where we thought the problems might

                 occur where we might have to seek

                 the evidence later.   People are

                 asking for different things,

                 your train of thought is going from

                 one subject to another as somebody

                 wants an answer to a telephone call,

                 somebody wants something from the

                 radio and then as all this is

                 going on and you can see a situation

21.29            outside deteriorating we then get

                 a message that the radios are

                 going down and we're not being

                 received and we're not receiving

                 messages frcm outside.    Again

                 any train of thought is immediately

                 destroyed and it's necessary to

                 try and contact the Communications

                 Officer, fortunately for us he's

                 been listening to the transmissions

                 and he's heard that our

                 transmissions are breaking up and

                 off his own initiative he finds his

                 way to the Control Roan while we're

22.00            still trying to find him.   He

                 arrives, it's necessary for him to

                 get under the desk, move everybody

                 out of their places, totally

                 disrupt the Control Rocm.   At this

                                being received, we can't respond

                                to them, we can't ask people what

                               they want, we can't give than what
     22.23                     they want, and to my mind that

                               was one of the most devastating

                               moments of the whole afternoon up

                               til then and sort of incurred a

                               feeling of helplessness I think

                               that just when we wanted radio

                               comiunications had gone.    Now

                               how long that situation lasted

                               I don't know, it may have, I've

                               no idea, it may have been a

                              minute, it may have been two

                              minutes, it may have been longer,

                              but it was certainly enough to

                              destroy the thought patterns and

                              the, the logic of me, of Sergeant

                             it cuts out an awful lot of

                            requests that came in from

                            Leppings Lane.    I think they

                            were to actually tell the crowd

                            to, to move back?

23.49      DCS6930          Do you remember who, who asked

                            for that.   Was it Mr MARSHALL?
          BDM               I don't know whether it was

                           whether it was Mr MARSHALL,

          DCS6930          And I know it's around this

                           time that you actually had that

                            on by anybody who heard it and

                            whether PC RYAN did start to pass

                            the messages without my say so

                            or not I don't know.     He he possibly

                            did.     I did, I did tell him to

                            keep talking, just to keep talking

                            keep passing the message over and

                            over again.

           DCS6930          So you did tell him to keep going...
           BDM              Yes.

           DCS6930          as opposed to, to actually knowing

                            whether you said, yes do it or or

                            whether he asked you if he could

                            do it?

          BDM               I he, I don't think he would ask

                            me if he could do it.    I wouldn't

                            have expected him to.    I would

                            obviously have given permission to

                           do it straight away but I did

                           tell him rather than just pass one

                           or two, to keep passing the message.

                           already mentioned, the 2.17 (1417)

  DCS6930          Again did yourself or Mr

                   DUCKENFIELD discuss any other

                   option yourself that you could

                   do to alleviate the problem that

                   appeared to be facing you?
 BDM               I don't think so.     I I don't think

                   there would be discussion at that

                  you did it, and I suppose the

                  question is, was there anything

                  that you could have added to that

                  or anything you could have done

                  in your role as a, as a Control

                  Rocm Commander, additional to what

                  was being asked for.    Was there

                  anything that, even in hindsight

                  afterwards that comes to mind?
BDM               I l l would be thinking there

                          the camera focusing on a police

                          horse, I don't exactly know where

                          that horse was, but that horse

                          was surrounded by by people,

 30.03      BCM             It was my decision, it was

                            was after the first request

                            had been received for the gates

                            to be opened.    With it the

                          stage that the gate was open

                          and people were caning in.    I

                          had, I didn't know whether the

                          gate had burst or whether the

                          gate had been opened or really

                         which gate it was but it was a

         DCS6930         Can I ask you this,   I mean there

                         they're quite big concertina gates

                         aren't they?

                         I would think so.
         DCS6930        Are you sure that was the gate,

                        after Gate C's opened there is an

                        iron perimeter gate near to the

                             do if you actually responded to

                             the request that was coining

                            to open the gates?

                            No, I think, I think that I would

                            only be thinking that Mr

                            DUCKENFIELD may have made a

                            comment that, why are they

                            still asking for the gates to be

                            opened if they've burst, or words

                            to that effect.

                           we say on an operational basis

                           that made you think that if we

                           do anything else we should pit

                           sane more resources or get more

                           stewards to to receive the influx

                           No, I I was just hoping that

                           that would relieve the the obvious

                           problem outside which was

           DCS6930          The the five and fifty that you'd

                            sent for, that again were coning

                            from the gym, would have actually

                            gone along the back, do you know

                            if they did go along the back of

                            the North Stand...
          BDM               I don't,

          DCS6930           to Gate A?
          BDM               I don't.
          DCS6930           I mean was there any instruction

                            given to them as to where they

                            should go to other than Leppings

                           Lane?
          BDM              No.

          DCS6930          I mean you may know now but would

                           it have occurred to you then that

                           in fact they would have been

                           restricted to the back of Gate A

                           because they've probably, well they

                           couldn't as I understand it, get

                           through to come behind where B

                           and C were anyway.
         BDM               Well I'm sure that there's an

                           opening gate there that they

                          can get through.
         DCS6930          Yeah.
         BDM              But I don't know whether they

                          got to the back of the Leppings

                                Lane terraces or whether they

                                North Stand or whether they

                                even came along the track.
           DCS6930              I mean is it something that,

                                is there any reason why you

                                would have given that any

                                thought?
36.50      BDM                  Not really because Police

                                to go to a part of the ground

                               they get there, some have got their

                               own routes that they may have

                               a particular route that they

                               pursue, I certainly wouldn't

                               say to them, I want you to,

                               unless I have a specific,

                               specific duty for them to do.
37.11     DCS6930              No one discussed for example

          HUM                  Well I I think five and fifty

                               with the serials were actually

                               a Sergeant and eight so it's a

                           and I think that they actually

                           sent seven serials.

                                 didn't arise?
            BDM                  No.
  37.42     DCS6930              Okay.   I know that in your

                                 statement at page 12 you

                                 actually refer to Gate C

                                opening at 1449 (1449), this

                                is the main opening of Gate C

                                I think, but we are aware now

                                it was 1452 (1452).
            BDM                 Yes.
           DCS6930              Can you explain to me again how

                                1449 (1449)?
           BDM                  Again it it's purely and simply

                                working from some fixed time

                                it's not, I didn't look at the

                                clock and say now it is 1449 (1449)

                                this is just a, my estimate of

                            of of the timing of events which

                            I I fully accept may be several

                            minutes out either way.
           DCS6930          The the reason I ask that is

                            because if if we go back to the

                            1417 (1417) incident, and Mr

                            MARSHALL thought that it was a bit
38.30                       later.       I just wanted to, to sort




                                                                            1036

                              of get clear that there is no

                             possible, or perhaps there is a

                             possibility that if it was 1449

                              (1449) there and we know it was

                             1452 (1452), is it possible that

                             1417 (1417) could have actually

                             have been 1420 (1420)?
            BDM              I don't think so, I think the, the

                             1417 (1417) was a time written

                             down in a log, the 1449 (1449) is

                            merely my own recollection.
            DCS6930         Through looking at different

                            things?
           BDM              Through looking at different

                            things and trying to fit

                            events into a time space.
           DCS6930          Right so we'd say 1417 (1417) is

                            precise, 1449 (1449) well we

                            know is is three minutes out...
           BDM              Yeah.
           DCS6930          Fran what we know and that explains.

                             that request?

            BDM              1 I don't, I don't think there was

                            a discussion, I I was, I was doing

                            things at the time, very difficult

                            to recall what, but I was doing

                            things at the time.     I know

                            there was no discussion about

                            there was no real discussion at

                            all.     I was trying to, I was trying

                            to get these, these serials

                            initially I was trying to get the

                            Club Safety Officer on the Club

                            Radio.

           DCS6930         That's Mr LOCK?
 40.10     BDM             That's Mr LOCK. There were

                           several things happening and Mr

                           MARSHALL'S requests were caning in.

                           I was hoping that the situation

                           might have been retrievable, I

                           was looking at the, at the video

                           and I I was seeing whether there

                           was a possibility that we could

                           get away without opening the gates

                           but eventually it got to a stage

                          where because of the, the urgency

                           in Mr MARSHALL'S voice I was
40.43                     satisfied that the gates had to

                          be opened, that the situation

                          wasn't recoverable and that we




                                                                           1038

                             had to do it then and asked

                            Mr DUCKENFIELD you know, are

                            we going to open the gates and he

                            thought about it for a few

                            seconds and said yes.
           DCS6930          I think you actually said

                            you've got to make that decision

                            now or words to that effect?
           BDM              I said he was behind me I recall

                            turning round to him and saying,

                            Mr DUCKENFIELD are we going to

                           open those gates and he said

                           Okay open the gates.
41.26     DCS6930          Open the gates.   I think you've

                           assessed that the, I mean there

                           have been suggestions that it

                           was up to five minutes between

                           the the sort of request and the

                           decision and I think you've

                           actually suggested that it's

                           more like three to three and

                           a half minutes.
          BDM              I think I said that at the,

                          the hearing I I don't I don't

                          know how long it was, but it

                          wasn't a long time and

                           short time.

41.58    DCS6930           i j mean you've explained what

                          you were actually doing following

                          their request you you've sent

                          other officers, you, so you are

                          responding to try and assist.

                          Was any other option of any kind

                          did you think of any other option

                          of any kind?

                          Did I think of any?    I I didn't,

                          I didn't think of any, I I I

                          was, there was a situation there

                          that was obviously becalming more

^ *26                     serious it was obvious that

                          people were in distress that

                          people were being crushed against

                          the wall of the turnstiles, or

                         whatever and and my    my   only sort

                         of thought process then was

                         that we'd we'd got to relieve

                         that situation, we'd got to

                         get those people out of that,

                         out of that danger and if the

                         only way of doing that which

                         it was, was to open the gates,

                         then we'd got to open the gates

                         and relieve the pressure and and

                         get them free and save their lives

                         or save them from injury.

                                  to come to an end so I think

                            possibility of any option that hoi

                            gone through and then we came onto

                            the suggestion of three to three and

                           a half minutes situation.     Did you

                           want to expand again on anything on

                           that particular point?
           BDM             I don't think so, merely to say

                           that again, it it's only an

                           estimate it seemed a very short

                           period of time between receiving

                           the initial request and the final

                           request that was acted upon.     I

                           don't really know how long it

                           was.
01.23     DCS6930         Was anything done to inform, I think

                           the the Police Officers who are

                          allocated to those gates A, B and

                          C as well as stewards, is that

                          right?
          BDM             No.

          DCS6930         Not at all?
          BDM             That's not correct no.
01.37     DCS6930         There was some suggestion that

                          Police Officers went to those

                          gates and I think in one point

                          Gate A one of the Police Officers

                          said if the gates aren't, if the

                          gates aren't opened it's it's

                          going to be forced in.    Would




                                                                         1042

                            er officers then of just

                            happened to be at those gates if

                            they were there as opposed

                           to posting?
           BDM             I don't think so, I I I would

                           have hoped that we had a, we had an

                           Inspector and Sergeants on the

                           inside of the concourse with radios

                           who would be listening to everything

                           that was taking place and would

                           position themselves in position to
02.15                      to open the gates.    Certainly

                           there was no no one deliberately

                           sent to Gate A, Gate B or Gate C.
02.25     DCS6930          When the order goes out, to to

                           open the gates, who is that directed

                          to?
          HUM             That wasn't directed at a serial

                          I do recall open the gates, open

                          the gates and and I saw fron the

                          CCTV a few seconds later that, that

                          a gate was opened and people started

                          to come in.
02.50     DCS6930         But no no specific officer is

                          actually contacted to to do that

                          job or to pass that message to

                          the stewards on the gates.
          BDM             No specific officer was, was told

                          to do that.    It was obvious I
  MURRAY              BERNARD    D                                    129


                                 think, I think it was obvious

                                 fron the picture that we were

                                 looking at which happened to

                                 be Gate C that Police Officers

                                 were imnediately behind the gates

                                 and obviously, it was obvious to

                                 me were waiting for for for a

                                 decision or or otherwise.
 03.26      DCS6930              Again we know now that certainly

                                 there was some delay in Gate A

                                being opened and Gate B was

                                opened perhaps for a short time.

                                I don't think you could see

                                either of those on your monitor

                                is that right?
           BDM                  Gate B we cannot see at all on

                                Gate A we can.   From my point of

                                view the gates at Leppings Lane

                                means the gates to the Leppings

                                Lane enclosure and not the gates

                                to the North Stand.   I don't think

                                I would have expected the North

                                Stand gates to be opened.    In

                                fact I would have been concerned

                                if they had been opened.
           DCS6930          M n.

04.03      BDM              I would, I was expecting the gates

                            to the concourse at the rear of

                            the West Stand to be opened.

            DCS693G           So you would, the ones you would

                              have expected to be opened were A

                              and B?

            MM                Yes.

            DCS6930           I mean at that time did you know.
            BCM              Sorry B and C.

            DCS6930          Sorry.
            BCM              B and C.

            DCS6930          Rectify that you would have expected

                             Gates B and G to have been opened?
            BCM              Yes.

            DCS6930          I mean did you know that they

                             were actually called B and C then or?
           BDM               N o.

           DCS6930           You only learnt that in hindsight?
           BCM               I didn't know they were called B

                            and C.

           DCS6930          So there's no way in which you

                            could have actually nominated them

                            by, shall we say by by letter?
           BDM              That's right.

           DCS6930          Did it...

           BCM              I think there is a possibility

                            that someone in the Control Room

                            may have but but I certainly

                            didn't.

04.51      DCS6930          You didn't.   Did anyone at any

                            stage consider checking if you

                            couldn't see Gate B, did anybody
MURRAY             BERNARD   D                                     131


                             check to see whether in fact

                             that instruction had been carried

                             out?

         BCM                 No.

05.05    DCS6930             I mean you've explained the reason

                             and I think before that you would

                             have expected people to be

                             listening to what was going on

                             and in response to the request

                             that officers in that concourse

                             area would have done and made

                             sure those gates were open?

         BDM                 I think there was a sense of

                             security by by watching a picture

                             on a television screen albeit it is

                             at one particular gate that

                             when an order is given, that

                             gate opens and people come into

                             the ground, would perhaps tend

                             to make me feel, well what's

                             been requested has been done.

05.45    DCS6930             Has been done.   You haven't

                             actually got direct contact with

                          and the Security Officer and

                          several others have and that's

                          the contact we have with the

                          stewards.    I'd never ever

                          spoken to a steward on a radio

                          and the only person I would

                          speak to on the Club's radio

                          would be the Security Officer

                          Mr LOCK and ask him to get

                          Stewards to do, to do what we

                          want.

06.27    DCS6930          I know you said earlier you you

                          were trying to get hold of Mr

                          LOCK and I, you couldn't do it.

         BDM              I was.

         DCS6930          Can you explain the reason for

                          that.    Was that in response to

                          these requests to open the gates?

         BCM              No it wasn't.    It was, the reason

                          I wanted to get hold of Mr LOCK

                          was because, as far as I was

                          concerned, there was something

                          wrong with the turnstiles, or

                          there was something wrong with

                          the flow through the turnstiles.

06.53                     We had a large crowd and the crowd

                          seemed to be getting larger, but

                          it wasn't dissipating the people

                          were not caning into the stadium

                           at the rate that I would have

                          expected them to and I wanted

                          to get hold of Mr LOCK and draw

                          his attention to it for whatever

                          action he could take I I didn't

                          know.

07.15    DCS6930          There was no way in which the

                          request to open the gates and your,

                          and the decision that was made,

                          there was no way in which it was

                           felt necessary to inform Mr LOCK

                          at that stage, there's nothing

                          there's nothing he could have

                          actually done?

         BOM               I don't think he could have done

                          anything.

         DCS6930           In the urgency of the situation?

         BCM              Obviously if I'd got him in radio

                          by radio and and we'd of maintained

                          radio contact I would have told

                          him.

07.41    DCS6930          The question's been put to you

                          before in terms of and I know

                          that the decision to open the

                          gates was Mr DUCKENFIELDS and

                          the, the quickness of time by

                          which you had to open those gates,

                          because I think it's fair to




                                                                      1 048

                           say that you were told that

                          people would be killed outside

                           if you didn't.

         BCM              Yes.

         DCS6930           I think that was the situation

                          you were faced with.     Is that

                          correct?

         BCM              That's correct yes.

08.10    DCS6930          Did that give you any time to

                          consider where those people

                          would go or how to receive them?

         BCM               I don't know whether it, I don't

                          know how much time it gave me,

                          but it it certainly didn't didn't

                          give me time to sit down and

                          think calmly and quietly as to

                          where they would go. I thought

                          they would come into the ground

                          and I thought they would be

                          absorbed by the concourse.     I

                          thought they would go all over

                          the terraces.     I thought they

                          would be up in the stands, where

                          the, where the seats would be

                          taken.     I expected them to, to

                          go all over the place.

         DCS6930          I think we've, we've looked

                          and you've seen the, the

                          situation on the terraces which




                                                                    1049

                             is shall we say, I don't know

                             whether you agree with me that

09.02                        has shown the two centre pens

                             three and four, shall we say

                             full, or...

                             quite a lot of capacity on the

         BCM                 Yes.

         DCS6930             Was that any part of your

                             thoughts on that crowd?

09.18    BCM                 No it was, it was clear to me

                             from the Control Room that

                             certainly there was quite a

                             lot of rocm in the pen imnediately

                             below the, the Control Box and

                             the two centre pens there was a

                             lot of people in but there was

                             nothing, there was no thought

                             process that said well those

                             people should be directed to

                             a particular area.    It didn't

                             occur to me at the time, I I

                             I think it may have been a

                             dangerous strategy to to

                             employ anyway but it was not

                             something that occurred to me

                             at the time.




                                                                        1 050

         DCS6930             It would have been dangerous

                             to actually try and control them?

         BOM                 I I think to try and and and put

                             that amount of people in one

                             particular area no matter where

                             it was, may have lead to, to, to

                             a calamity somewhere else.

         DCS6930             When basically looking at the

                             numbers, I think you estimated

                             two to two and a half thousand

                             in your statement out there...

         KM                  Possibly.

         DCS6930             at one stage prior to the

                             opening of the gates and I know

                             that there's been estimates

                             of far higher than that but did

                             you, did you have in any events

                             of sufficient Police Officers to to

                             have made any control of those

                             people caning in?

10.34    BDM                 Once the concourse area outside

                             the turnstiles had become

                             compacted and the way it was,

                             I I don't see how we could, we

                             could of released that pressure,

                             I don't see how we could of,

                             I know an attempt was made by

                             closing the perimeter fences...

         DCS6930             Perimeter gates.




                                                                         1051

         BDM              Outside perimeter gates and I'm

                           sure that helped but once they

                          were compact I don't know how

                          we could of, especially as I

                           learn afterwards that officers

                          had actually been withdrawn

                           from that area, which of course

                          we did not know at the time.

         DCS6930          But having made the decision

                          to to put then into the concourse

                          area and into the terraces, I

                          mean, perhaps the the question I

                          was trying to get at is, that

11.27                     did you really have sufficient

                          Police Officers in the concourse

                          and and that area to actually

                          control at least two thousand

                          two thousand five hundred?

         BDM              People, once they come through

                          the gates.

         DCS6930          I mean could you actually, could

                          you actually of fed them into

                          different pens.     Did you have

                          enough Police Officers for that?

         BDM              Like I said it wasn't, it wasn't

                          anything that, that crossed my

                          mind at the time.     I've thought

                          about it since and I've I've

                          thought about putting a line




                                                                     1052

11.59                        the tunnel.    I I can't see a

                             a line of Police Officers across

                             the tunnel with the number of

                             people caning in, in the numbers

                             that they did, would have been

                             effective.    It would have been

                             alright the first ones that

                             came up to the, to the line,

                             the Police Officers would have

                             been able to ccmnunicate with

                             them, but you know as well as

                             I do that people will not just

                             do as we tell them, they they

                             stand and they argue and they

                             say no, and the more I think

                             about it, the more I could think

                             about a, a build up behind then

                             which would break the line and

                             I I would see a situation

                             occurring that's occurred before.

                             possibly have had enough Police

                             sufficient there at the time.

         DCS6930             And I think in fairness you you

                             have said before that the tunnel

                             in any event never entered your your

                             thinking or thoughts at that

                             the match clock at 2.52 (1452) and

                             2.54 (1454).     It's photograph number

14.29    DCS6930             Is there anything there that

                             a very different view to what

                             see that this one is timed at

                             1454 (1454) and it's a very

                             similar photograph.    Again the

         BCM                 I think it looks, it looks

                             previous photograph.

         DCS6930             How would you describe the crowd

                             as you're concerned prior to

                             the decision to open those gates.

                             Was there anything on those

                             terraces that gave you cause for

                             concern at all?

         BCM                 No.

16.13    DCS6930             We we've mentioned them before

                             of the turnstile area and I think

                             you've just said that you, you

                             know that at one point they were

                             actually closed off and at some

                             success in, in controlling the

                             crowd outside.     Did you actually

                             see that take place at the time,

                             the closing of all those iron

         BCM                 I, I don't think so.

16.44    DCS6930             Was it discussed at all, as a,

                             as a measure that had been taken

                             seeing it at the time.

         DCS6930             Was it ever bought to your

         BDM                 No I don't think so.

17.26    DCS6930             The the opening of the gates

                             do it.    We know now that a number

                             of people came in from the area

                             between those iron perimeter gates

                             and the turnstile area.

         DCS6930             It's also evident from the

                             appears to be evident that that

                             not the other gates and the people

                             also that the additional crowd

                             from outside were caning in?

                             one for the time being, we we

                             it shuts is about 2.59 (1459) some
19.04                        seven minutes . Can you tell me

                and Mr DUCKENFIELD immediately

                saying open it and I think

                asking for the remaining serials

                from the gymnasium to be

                into the seats which were all

                chaos and I was watching the

                North Stand and I was watching

                the West Stand and I was watching

                the terraces and I I didn't, I

                don't think I gave a conscious

                thought to saying right enough

                was enough, we've eased the pressure

                there and he was excercising some

                control over people going through

                          up of the crowd on which of those

                          gates are open, be it 1, 2 or?

         BCM              I think there there may have been

                          the perimeter gates for the

                          Sheffield Wednesday it's the

                          edge of their property and and

                          they delegate the the end of

                          Sheffield Wednesday's property.

                          I've never known them be, be

                          closed.    I've, as far as I can

                          recall and I stand corrected

                          they're always sort of opened

                             and left in the open position.

         DCS6930             Is that all of them?

22.07    BDM                 All of than.   I've never, apart

                             from the ones that lead down,

                             actually down to the road at

                             the South Stand and then

                             again, I can't remember

                             whether they closed or not,

                             but I've I've never noticed

                             the gates have never featured

                             in any plans or strategy, they're

                             just there, they just happen to

                             be perimeter gates.

         DCS6930             Are they manned by Police

                             Officers?

         BDM                 No.

22.33    DCS6930             The the reason I bring it up

                             is because in eighty, people

                             have said that in 1988 (000088)

                             the the queuing was better.

         BCM                 Yeah.

         DCS6930             Now what I'd like you to do is

                             just have a look at a piece of

                             video from 1988 (000088) that

22.54                        shows those those gates, because

                             it does seem evident and it's

                             not very clear but if we, it's

                             about 2.45 (1445) and in fact

                             if you'd accept that it, it's

                             There is in fact only one of

                             those iron perimeter gates open.

                             give us a few minutes just to

                             find it, there, if we can, that's

                             shaking a little bit.     Can you

                             see that across there that it

                             appears that most of the supporters

                             are coming in one gate.     It's

                             not very good, it's a freeze

                             one at the minute and that the

                             the other gates appear to be

                             closed.

         BCM                 Is that the actual position of

                             the gates, I thought they were

                             further back than that?

         DCS6930             Yeah, they are along there

         DCS6930             Can you run it, I know it's going

                             to jump away very quickly and

                             you'll see it miss it can we

                             particular sector decided, you

                             see I I thought that the gates

                             ran parallel, almost parallel

                             these seem to be.

         DCS6930             Well there's a map here if that

                             helps.     It's actually there in

                             terms of...

                             possibility that a few are

                             actually coming in through that

                             second gate and it appears to be

                             perhaps it's partly open.

25.10    BDM               I don't, I don't know of any

                          policy of closing those perimeter

                          gates or using them as a, as a

                          crowd control or a crowd screen.

                          Whether the, the officer who was

                          who was on the ground there,

                          decided to do it on that occasion

                          I don't know.   I must admit that

                          I I never noticed it at the time.

         DCS6930          I mention it because the, the

                          suggestion has come from a number

                          of supporters that the queuing

                          was better and the filtering was

                          better and I just wondered whether

                          because it was the same supporters

                          the year before whether that

                          created a better impression of

                          queuing as opposed to more gates

                          being open and more free, free for

                          all sort of situation.

         BDM              No I would think that scrneone who

                          arrived last year and found that

                          there was only a sparse crowd there

                          with forty, with the same number

                          of Police Officers, forty four,

                          forty five Police Officers and

                          (000089) when the crowd was very

                          dense they would no doubt feel




                                                                      1065

                             that there were more Police

                             Officers that they were, they

                             were better coordinated, pare

                             and simply because there would

                             be much higher profile along

                             a smaller crowd.

         DCS6930             Okay. Thank you.   Can we

                             move on then back now to 1989

                             (000089) and the situation perhaps

                             in respect of monitoring the pens

                             that we've already spoken briefly

26.41                        about.   I think you told the

                             public inquiry that you felt the

                             the monitoring of the crowd was

                             both a Police and a stewards

                             responsibility or role?

         KM                  Yeah. The general safety

                             considerations similar to

                             everyone that's at the event and

                             I don't think the, I don't see

                             it as a, I didn't see it as

                             necessary to give a specific

                             actually talking about monitoring

                             it for, for packing purposes, or

                             for overcrowding or, what has

                             been your view of, of why you

                             would monitor those pens?

         BDM                 I'm not, no I wasn't talking

                             about packing or overcrowding, I

                             was talking about a a serious

                             situation which comes, comes

                             to the attention of anyone and

                             I I can only, there's no

                             specific, we never gave any

                             specific instructions for anyone

                             to monitor pens, but if there

                             was a serious problem I would

                             just expect to be notified of it

                             by anyone.

         DCS6930             So what you're actually saying

                             to me is that, that shall we

                             say that questioning around

                             point.   What you're really saying

                             the pens is you're looking at thorn

                             for any sorts of incident, be it

                             on terraces and and that

                             possibility?

         BDM                 I I don't, I don't know what you

                             look for.   I would I would be

                             observing the crowd, I would be

                             observing the crowd and it's by

                             observing the crowd that you see

                             anything and everything.   I don't

                              know whether I would be looking

                              for anything particular.   I recall

                              I've seen it years ago where

                              children always used to go to the

                              front and sometimes they they

                             were in distress and the policeman

                             would lift than out and relocate

                              them somewhere else.   Ill

                              certainly don't think I would

                              be standing there looking to see

                              how how dense the crowd was if if

                              I could, if I could sort of

                              figure it out.   I would just be,

                              I would be looking at the people,

                             looking at the crowd and looking

                             for signs of anything and

                             everything.

30.21    DCS6930             So there would, from what you're

                             saying there would be not need

                             for individual perimeter track

                             officers to be specifically

                             briefed by yourself or Mr

                             DUCKENFIELD or indeed Mr

                             GREENWOOD about that inside

                             responsibility on the need to

                             look for that, that potential

                             problem?

         KM                  I would have thought not.

                             Obviously in the light of




                                                                          1069

                             circumstances I think it's

                             completely different now.

         DCS6930             Now you would do it?

         BDM                 Absolutely.

         DCS6930             Yes.   But nothing had happened

                             previously from what I think

                             you've said for you to have

                             been involved in that sort of

                             situation?

         BDM                 No I I I would find it very

                             difficult to say to a Police

                             Officer, well look at the crowd

                             and if you see anybody who's

                             sort of obviously suffering

                             severely, do something about it

                             it's part of his his job, his

                             duties, he's highly trained.

         DCS6930             While we're on the perimeter

                             track side, the postings of

                             those officers, and perhaps the

                             the plan that was put into

31.30                        effect.   They're not specifically

                             posted to set perimeter gates

                             are they?

         BDM                 No.

31.35    DCS6930             Can you tell me what the, the

                             thought behind that is, in terms

                             of how those gates are even

                             monitored by the Police Officers
MURRAY             BERNARD D                                         156


                          or are given any sort of

                          responsibility?

         BDM              Each each individual officer is

                          given a a perimeter gate in case

32.01                     of an emergency, evacuation.     They're

                          not given specific gates to look

                          after and they're there, or they

                          weren't at that time and it's

                          down to the, again to the the

                          Track Sergeants and the Inspector

                          on the track to post his men as

                          he feels they are going to be

                          most effective.

         DCS6930          So if there was a situation that

                          required evacuation.

         BDM              Yes.

32.24    DCS6930          Officers are, know that they have

                          to go to a set gate?

         BDM              Yes.

         DCS6930          And they're given that posting

                          separate to the order or within

                          the order?

         BDM              Can I see if it's within the

                          order?

32.37    DCS6930          Certainly yes.    We're just

                          looking at Document 194 again

                          which is the, the match order.

         BDM              It's not specific in the order

                          but I would have expected them




                                                                           1071

                           to be given that, those

                           instructions by their, by their

                           Serial Sergeant, as to which

                          gates they look after, in the

                          case of an emergency.

33.03    DCS6930          The the evacuation that you

                          talk about, the evacuation, of

                          the ground is there a separate

                          order or plan for that particular.

         BDM              No.

         DCS6930          system.     So it really is a,

                          a verbal briefing and set of

                          instructions built up over

                          experience and time?

         BDM              Yes it's a, in the event of

                          the emergency evacuation

33.30                     procedure arising, PC'S at

                          either end of the ground will

                          take up positions at the fence

                          gates, and these gates will

                          only be opened if the specific

                          message to evacuate is given.

         DCS6930          So when it talks about procedure

                          there isn't anything actually

                          written down that, that goes

                          that far?

         BDM              That says PC so and so will

                          be responsible for Gate 3, no.

         DCS6930          Thank you.    It's fair to say




                                                                     1072

                             that in fact I think the

                             reason I've pursued that is

33.58                        that certainly PC ILLINGWORTH

                             didn't seem to be aware of

                             a responsibility on him to

                             man any particular gates and

                             I think from what you've said

                             is that would be right.      That

                             he wouldn't...

         BDM                 Yes.

         DCS6930             perhaps be given a set

                             responsibility.   The only

                             further point I I'd put to

                             you on that is, it was

                             suggested by that officer that

                             indeed that he had suggested

                             some four or five weeks before

                             to a senior officer that more

                             track officers ought to be

                             employed with the big game

                             coming up.   Was that ever

                             considered or was there any

                             knowledge of that within your

                             knowledge?

34.37    BDM                 I don't know whether PC

                             ILLINQORTH had suggested it

                             certainly the track serial

                             is slightly increased in the

                             year before and there were
MURRAY             BERNARD D                                   159


                           twenty PC's I think in the

                           track serial, where as the

                          year before there were

                           either sixteen or eighteen and

                           that was for the whole of the

                          event.

         DCS6930          Yes.

         BDM              And the track was to be

                           increased at the end of the

                          match and I don't know whether

                           that was when PC ILLINGWORTH'S

                          doubts or fears were going to

                          be materialised.

35.10    DCS6930          So you actually did increase

                          the size of the perimeter track

                          serial from the following year?

         BDM               I increased the size of the track

                          serial and arranged I think

                           for a, a further four or five

                          serials to support it before

                          the end of the game which was

                          on my own observations from the

                          year before.

35.41    DCS6930          Okay.    Moving now to the, after

                          the gates had been opened and

                          a number of people had ccme

                          into the ground.    I think you've

                          already said that you expected

                          them to go to various places




                                                                     1074

                             where there was space and I

                             take it from that you didn't

                             really foresee any problem of

                             any kind occurring once those

                             gates had been opened?

         BDM                 Well I I wouldn't say no

                             no problems at all.

         DCS6930             In terms of people being

                             injured?

         BDM                 In terms of the injury no, I I

                             thought we may have problems

                             I thought that people would be

                             going all over the, that end

                             of the ground where they

                             shouldn't have gone and they

                             would, many would head for the

                             seated areas where there

                             wouldn't be seats and we we

                             would have problems of that

36.24                        nature but I didn't, I didn't

                             foresee any crushing problems.

36.33    DCS6930             It it's evident that certainly

                             both PC SMITH and PC

                             ILLINGWORTH opened the

                             off time.

                           statement, it's just after,

                           it's about three minutes

                          past three (1503) before you

                          recognised a problem on the

                          on those terraces. Would that

                          be correct?

         BDM               I don't, I don't know what the

                          time is.

         DCS6930          Sorry no at 14, sorry at

                           1458 (1458) on your page

                           12 you you became aware of

                          something happening behind

                          the West Stand but couldn't

                          see what it was, but the

                          police constable was opening

                          either Gate 3 or Gate 4, so

                          it's actually just before

                          3 o'clock (1500).

         BDM              Yes.   It was it was before

37.11                     it was before the kick off.    Frcm

                          what I can remember it was

                          before the kick off that, that

                          I became aware that something

                          was happening behind the goals.

         DCS6930          And are you still unable to be

                          sure of which gate you've

                          actually seen being opened?

         BDM              Yes.

         DCS6930          Because you say they're either




                                                                      1076

                           3 or 4.

         BDM               I don't know which one it

                          was.

37.28    DCS6930          We've got, it seems that

                          certainly PC ILLINGWORTH

                          opened his gate some

                          minutes before, probably

                          some minutes before 1459

                           (1459) and moved people

                          out and took them up towards

                          pens 6 and 7 and it's also

                          evident that at some stage

                          PC SMITH did the same and I

                          I think you refer to the Police

                          Woman or...

         BDM              Yes, it was it was the people

                          who were caning towards where

                          we were that I noticed that,

                          I didn't notice any movement

                          towards pens 6 and 7.   The

                          movements I was hoping for

                          was towards the one in front

                          of the Control Box.

         DCS6930          So if you hadn't noticed that

                          movement certainly from Gate

                          4 which PC SMITH was was

38.14                     dealing with, it's evident

                          that you wouldn't particularly

                          have been concerned with that




                                                                  1077

                             end of the ground at that time

                             and wouldn't have perhaps

                             sent any resources to it.     I

                             know that some resources did,

                             were sent there, because they

                             came round, can you remember

                             how that occurred, or the

                             thing that made someone send

                             for those resources, the first

                             initial recognition you

                             needed more people there?

         BDM                 Not really no I can't I can

                             I can't remember where they

                             came from or whether they

                             were just to support the

                             track serial on that side

                             cause people were coming

                             onto the track.   I can't

                             remember.

38.54    DCS6930             But at that point you're

                             not particularly concerned,

                             you you've got you can see

                             that there's something

                             happening but there's

                             no concern for people's

                             safety.

         BDM                 No I I think the, my thought was

                             that one of the officers had

                             opened the gates to help one or




                                                                      1078

                           two people out who perhaps being

                          pushed or, or crushed or when I

                           say crushed I mean in the mildest

                           form..

         DCS6930          Mm.

         BDM              they they were uncomfortable that

                          he was going to help them out and

                          relocate them which seemed a

                          sensible idea to me and and and

                          because there was room, room in the

                          wings.

39.30    DCS6930          Did you, did you request radio

                          ccmnunication with either officer

                          to see what the problem was at that

                          stage?

         BDM              I was trying to get hold of

                          unfortunately PC, WPC...

         DCS6930          ROBINSON was it?

                             Sergeant GODDARD was calling PC

                             SMITH and ILLINGWORTH, I couldn't

                             be sure but I'm sure that they

                             weren't receiving and we weren't

                             receiving them they were

                             transmitting to us.

         DCS6930             Can, can you tell me who actually

                             sent for the other officers to

                             come round and assist?

         BDM                 No.     I can't,   I can't recall. It

                             might have been, it might have

40.34    DCS6930             At that particular point again did

                             you and Mr DUCKENFIELD discuss what

                             was taking place, that you can recall

                             now?

                             a number of people spilling onto the

                             track area and as you've said Mr

                             a time that you estimate because

                             perception was that the match had

                             been played perhaps for about two

                             minutes, when I was informed that

                             it had been going on for six

                             minutes I found it difficult to

                          going back to what we were talking

00.54                     about earlier which was the, the

                          spilling out onto the pitch and

                          that recognition by you and I

                          think you actually talked about

                          some in your statement at page 13,

                          some pushing and crushing, but I

                          think you, you've actually said that

                          when when you say that it wasn't

         BDM                 No, no it was merely a perception

                             that there must have been some

                             people in some discomfort at the

                             front and the officers were trying

                             to relocate them.     It was also my

                             perception that other people were

                             taking advantage of the situation

                             as I would expect and were getting

                             out onto the track for a, for a

                             better view of events.

         DCS6930             You say that because, has that

                             happened before?

         BDM                 It's nothing, it's not that I've

                             known at Hillsborough but I I do

                             know that when I've been to

                             Football matches, both as a Police

                             Officer and as as a spectator

                             that people do take advantage

                             of any situation to gain themselves

                             a better position to, if they feel

                             sometimes they're helped onto the

                             track for, for a reason, once that

                             reason's gone they they stand about

                             and watch the game.

02.14    DCS6930             So there was no association in

                             you you recognising or thinking

                             about crushing.    There was no

                             association with that thought and

                             the fact that you had opened the

                           come in.   The two didn't at that

                           stage go together?

         BDM               No, not at all.

02.34    DCS6930          Not at all.   You eventually having

                           heard I think Sergeant GODDARD

                           saying, stop the game, stop the

                           game which is on the bottom of your

                          page 13 of your statement, you

                          actually grabbed your hat and

                          Mr DUCKENFIELD said, yes stop the

                          game.   You grabbed your hat and

                          and went down from the Control

                          Rocm at that point?

         BDM              Yes.

02.58    DCS6930          Did yourself or Mr DUCKENFIELD

                          ever discuss or consider going

                          down any earlier to see what the

                          problem was with people coming

                          out or did you feel you knew what

                          the problem was?

         BDM              Well there was no discussion,

                          but I I think Mr DUCKENFIELD and

                          possibly other officers thought

                          we were going to have a a pitch

                          invasion, I didn't, I couldn't

                          see a reason for it, at that

                          particular stage of the proceedings.

03.31                     I was pleased when the game was




                                                                       1084

                  stopped, I was pleased that we

                 were going to stop the game and

                  then we could see exactly what

                 what's happening.

DCS6930          Now I'd like you to look at

                 Document 153 which are, which is

                 actually sane photographs and I

                 think there are two photographs of

                 you on the perimeter track which

                 is photograph, first one is

                 photograph number 4 which is

                 actually timed at 1507 (1507)

                 and would you agree that that is

                 yourself, I think near to the

                 photographer with a number four on

                 his back?

BDM              Yes that's me.

DCS6930          That's you.    Does that in any way

                 assist you in terms of, of saying

                 what you've just been doing or had

                 just done?     I mean I know that if

                 if I can just say that, I know

                 your statement says, on returning

                 to the Control Room at about five,

                 1505 (1505).

BDM              Yes.

DCS6930          And again I'm sure the same thing

                 applies with the, with these times

                 that that's, you didn't perhaps
MURRAY             BERNARD    D                                      171


                              have the advantage of that at

                              the time, but are you there making

                              your way back do you think?

04.43    BDM                 The photograph takes me a bit by

                              surprise.    I, it's obvious looking

                              at the time and looking at the

                              number of people who were actually

                             behind the goals that this is

                              straight after I attempted to stop

                             the game to attract the linesman's

                             attention and must have walked

                             across the comer of the pitch

                             to sane position roughly where I

05.12                        am there.    It's clear to me that

                             I'm making my way back to the

                             Control Roan on both photographs.

         DCS6930             That's both, both photograph 4 and

                             photograph 5 which shows you

                             closer to the Control Box.     Is

                             that right?

         BDM                 Yes, I think there are only two

                             seconds difference, I'm walking

                             from that position back to the

                             Control Box.

         DCS6930             And I think it's fair to say

                             I I, nobody can guarantee

                             exactly how accurate that

                             time is, it depends on how

                             it was set at the time?




                                                                           1086

05.40    BDM                  No I I don't, I don't, I don't

                              know the time but looking at the

                              number of people who were actually

                              behind the goal it is almost

                              immediately after the game has been

                              stopped and players have been taken

                              off.

         DCS69330             I mean you are quite close

                              certainly in the first photograph

                              to, to Gate 3 I think, or seem to

                              be coming from the direction of

                              Gate 3, did you actually look...

         BDM                  I think...

         DCS6930              at the problem then?

         BDM                  I think that is Gate 2 actually.

         DCS6930              Gate 2 sorry.

         BDM                  This is the weak pen.

         DCS6930              Did you get close to Gate 3 and

                              Pen 3?

06.07    BDM                  I had, I had no idea at that

                              stage what was happening.     My

                              intention had been to go down, stop

                              the, stop the game and get straight

                              back to the Control Rocm which was

                              my allocated spot.

06.29    DCS6930              Okay.    Thank you.   Do you recall

                              at that point having seen

                              Superintendent GREENWOOD at that

                              end of the ground?




                                                                          ■1037

         BDM                 No.   I saw, I saw Mr GREENWOOD

                             immediately before we requested the

                             game should be stopped because he

                             signalled from the fence and I

                             interpreted his signal as meaning

                             stop the game.   As I got onto the

                             track and approached the linesman

                             he ran past me and I set off after

                             him and as I set off after him I

                             saw Mr GREENWOOD on the pitch,

                             stopping the game by the referee.

07.07    DCS6930             You didn't have any ccmnunication

                             with Mr GREENWOOD?

         BDM                 No.

07.10    DCS6930             Did you have any cornnuncation with,

                             with anyone on that track, I know

                             Chief Inspector McROBBIE had gone

                             down earlier and was down there.

                             Can you recall whether you had any

                             conversation with any other

                             officers?

                             I thought I came, prior to seeing

                             those photographs, my perception

                             was that I I came inroediately back

                             and I obviously went a bit further

                             than, than I I remember, but I

                             I don't recall speaking to anybody.

                             that we will cane to later on was

                             that you were slow to respond to

07.55                        set up a rescue operation.    When

                             time, can you think of anything you

                             specifically did or you felt

                             necessary to do in response to

                             my intention was to stop the game

                             and stop it via the linesman,

                             having failed to do that I my my

                             intention then was to get back to

                             the Control Roan as swiftly as

                             possible.

08.23    DCS6930             I mean did it, did it cross your

                             mind at any time then to, to stay

                             there and find out what the problem

                             was or was there anyway in which

                             you think you could have at that

                             stage recognised that, that maybe

                             it was a serious problem?

                             I could recognise it was a

                             if I'd gone further and gone up




                                                                         1089

                             for myself that it was a serious

                             problem but at that time I had

                             no idea, still thought that we'd

09.13    DCS6930             You then came back up into the

                             Control Box and PC RYAN was

                             passing various messages over the

                             public address system I think

                             you say in your statement, and

                             Mr DUCKENFIELD then again asked

                             you to go back down onto the field

                             and try and clear people from the

                             goal area?

         BDM                 That's right.

         DCS6930             Is that virtually you coming

                             back in and going straight back

                             out again?

09.36    BDM                 Almost, I I came up to the Control

                             Roan via the South Stand, I still

                             had my coat on, I stood at the

                             door, I seemed to think that




                                                                          1090

                          Mr JACKSON was there at that time

                           or immediately after me and before

                           I could take my coat off I was

                           asked to go down and to clear the

                          pitch.

         DCS6930          Okay.    No do those two photographs

                           that we've just looked at.     I mean

                          bearing in mind that you've been

                          down twice.   Certainly they appear,

                           it appears to be that you're

                          walking back to the Control Box...

         BDM              I think...

         DCS6930          could could have been the first

                          the first occasion.

         BDM              It was the first occasion.

         DCS6930          Are you quite sure about that?

         BDM              I'm almost sure because there

                          were more people on the pitch

                          when I went down the second

                          occasion, they they were spilling

                          out towards the penalty areas.

         DCS6930          It's only just to, I didn't want

                          you to to feel that, that was

                          definitely right.     There is the

                          option that it, it could have

                          been the later one.

         BDM              I can't remember being there

                          that, I'm I'm satisfied that

                          was the first occasion.

10.39    DCS6930           Okay.   When you went back down

                           you, you saw a lot of people as

                          you say in your statement that

                          were shocked and dazed lying on

                           the ground and then you saw

                          people apparently jartmed hard

                          against the fence?

         BDM              That's right.

         DCS6930          And actually graphically describe

                          the fact that they were starting

                          to discolour?

         BDM              Yes.

11.02    DCS6930          Can you tell me what you actually

                          did at that particular point?

         BDM              Yes, went for a radio.   I needed

                          a radio, when I left the Control

                          Rocm on the second occasion nobody

                          in there gave me any hint that

                          they knew that people were

                          seriously injured.   In fact as I

                          left I recall PC BICHARD who had

                          the job of also conrtunicating with

                          force ops room asking for an

                          ambulance to be made ready for

11.39                     standby.   When I saw those people

                          hard against the fence, and at

                          the same time someone lying on

                          the track being sick, vomiting

                          discoloured, I realised then we

                had a a serious problem and there

                was probably going to be a lot

                of people who were injured and

                 I wanted to make sure that we

                were going to get sane ambulances

                down there and enough ambulances

12.08           and I wanted a radio.     I didn't

                have a radio, my own radio had

                been taken out of me jacket of

                me coat pocket when the radios

                had gone down.    I always used

                to carry my personal radio in my,

                in my anorak in case I I had to go

                out for a reason.    When the radios

                went down and we were using

                personal radios and I took it

                out and put it on the desk for

                use as a radio.     I had to get

                a radio, I looked around saw a

                couple of officers to my left and

                went to than, spoke to one of

                them, it was a PC, he didn't have

                a radio, I I realised that that

                the one of the Sergeants would

                have a radio, saw a Sergeant,

                made my way to him, took his

                radio actually off him and and

                passed radio messages to, well I

                asked to be acknowledged first




                                                             1093

                             and I was acknowledged by Sergeant

12.56                        GODDARD.     I asked for, for a

                             fleet of ambulances. I asked for

                             tannoy messages to tell people to

                             get back because it was my

                             perception then that it was the

                             force of the crowd at the back that

                             was injuring these people at the

                             front.     I think I asked for, for

                             bolt croppers I can't remember

                             if I, if I asked for than, if I

                             didn't ask for them, it was

                             purely and simply because the guy

                             next to me said I've already asked

                             for them, but that was, that was

                             what I wanted.    I I wanted mainly

                             I wanted to make sure that we'd

                             got ambulances on route and that

                             we we did what we could to get

                             people to move back.

13.33    DCS6930             I mean you've, you've recognised

                             now that you've got a serious

13.49    DCS693G           It, I mean it again in relation

                           to the specific ccmplaint against

                           you that revolves, revolves around

                           the slowness to react to that

                           developing tragedy.   Can you

                           tell me what specific

                           organisation you did down there,

                           organisation of Police Officers,

                           organisation of stewards, any sort

                           of organisation at all?

14.11    BDM               In the initial stages I knew Mr

                           GREENWOOD was, was at the fence

                           I could see that officers were

                           absolutely thick around the

                           gates so it was impossible to see

                          what was happening inside the

                           gates.   There was no way that

                           that I could have been any

                           assistance there in my role as

                           a Superintendent unless I'd have

                           thrown my hat off and got stuck

                           in and and pulled people out.     I

                          didn't think that was my job.

                           It was something that I wanted

                          to do and would have been the

                          easiest thing in the world to do

                           I felt however that, that my

                          role was different from that.

                          MR GREENWOOD was really the the

                           give me a word, he was leading,

                           he was leading the the...

         DCS6930           Rescue.

         BDM               rescue, the rescue of people from

                           the fence.   I I looked at the crowd

                           I asked for the tannoy messages, I

                          watched the crowd, I listened,

                           I don't know whether I could

                          hear the messages or not, I

                          don't know whether the PA system

                          would, would have been heard by

                          me on the pitch or whether it would

                           just be directed at the, at the

                          people.    I saw no movement whatso­

15.30                     ever at at the back.    I I kept

                          asking for the tannoy messages

                          and then decided that the only

                          thing to do was to get round to the

                          back, find out what officers were

                          in the concourse and see what

                          inroads we could make into

                          actually getting people out of

                          the, out of the back to get the

                          weight off the, off the people at

                          the front.

15.50    DCS6930          Right, so you, you've made the

                          decision that Mr GREENWOOD is

                          there and is organising the

                          the Gate 3 problem...

         BDM                 Resue operation.

16.00    DCS6930             Were you aware of the same'

                             problem in Pen 4 then?

         BDM                 I wasn't, all I was aware of was

                             that there were officers around

                             the gates and I was aware that

                             people were, were crushed and

                             what they were trying to do was

                             obviously get in and get them

                             out.

16.15    DCS6930             But there was nothing else that

                             you felt you could do constructively

                             on that pitch by those pens that

                             wasn't already being done by

                             Mr GREENWOOD and the other

                             officers?

         BDM                 That's correct.

         DCS6930             So you you made the decision

                             because you felt that people

                             at the back of the pens weren't

                             responding.     Is that what you

                             said?

         BDM                 That's right.

16.36    DCS6930             To go to the back and see

                             what officers were there and

                             see what you could do from the

                                                                          1097

                              I I know and you actually go

                             through the central tunnel area.

         BDM                 Yes.

16.47    DCS6930              In that time there did you see

                             Mr MARSHALL?

         BDM                 No.

         DCS6930             You, so you you went into the

                             back of the tunnel area and was

                             that by, did you take officers

                             with you or did you meet officers?

17.03    BDM                 No I went there and there was

                             two or three PC's and an

                             Inspector and I said to the

                             Inspector, lets get everybody

                             out of the tunnel.    There

                             weren't many people in the

                             tunnel.    I estimated it at

                             fifty, but I I I don't, I don't

                             know   whether that is a realistic

                             figure or not.

         DCS6930             Is that injured people or...

         HIM                 No no.

         DCS6930             just people milling about?

         BDM                 Just just people standing around

                             swearing, being abusive towards

                             the Police Officers and we did

                             actually shift them out of the

17.33                        tunnel. The Inspector said to

                             me well we've got, we've got




                                                                        1098

                           them out, we've got them all

                           out.    I thought he meant the

                          people in the tunnel, people from

                           the back.    I don't know, I don't

                           know whether he, I can't even

                          remember which Inspector it was

                           I spoke to, so I don't know

                          whether he was talking about

                           injury or whether he was talking

                          about, about just people standing

                          there.    He did say to me, we've

                          got them all out, they were all

                          drunk again I don't know who

17.59                     he was relating to.       But we

                          cleared who there was in the

                          tunnel and I got to the front of

                          the tunnel.     The crowd was still

                          standing there but as I got to the

                          front I was able to see down and I

                          was able to see that, in the well

                          behind the goals that Police

                          Officers were now either side

                          of the fence and there was a gap

                          behind the wall.

18.20    DCS6930          So there were Police Officers in the

                          terraces at that point?

         BDM              Yes.

         DCS6930          Certainly in in 3?

         BDM              I I don't    know   which pen it was I I




                                                                           1099

                           I it was the one in front of me, it

                          was the one where I had seen the

                           it was the one where I had seen the

                          people trapped.     It was the one that

                           I was was aiming at.

         DCS6930           So you you would, would you agree

                          now that was pen 3 from where you,

                          that's the one nearest the Control

                          Box?

         BDM              Possibly.

         DCS6930          Possibly?

         BDM               I I don't, I don't, I don't know

                          which pen it was.

         DCS6930          But certainly there were police

                          officers in the, the back of those

                          terraces...

         BDM              Yes.

         DCS6930          assisting and and doing a job?

18.57    BDM              As far as I was concerned that

                          meant that the pressure had come

                          off.     That the pressure had come

                          off because the officers had been

                          able to get in and actually sort

                          of were in there. There was a,

                          there was a space between the

                          the wall, and the and the police

                          officers.

19.15    DCS6930          Right.    Was there anything else

                          that you organised or did at the




                                                                          1 100

                             back of those terraces?

         BDM                 Not at the back not at the back

                             once I'd seen that I was satisfied

                             that the, the pressure was off and

                             that it was not necessary to get

                             anymore people out of the way.

         DCS6930             You then went back I think to the

                             pitch itself?

         BDM                 Yes I did.

         DCS6930             Did you see Mr MARSHALL on the way

                             back at all?

         BDM                 No.

19.36    DCS6930             On the way back which would have

                             been out back through the tunnel

                             presumably and round towards the

                             Control Room...

         BDM                 Yes..

19.46    DCS6930             area.     Did you see or have

                             dealings with any injured or

                             supporters in any way?

         BDM                 No.     I didn't see any injured

                             people.

         DCS6930             You didn't see any at that stage...

         BDM                 No.

         DCS6930             there.

         BDM                 I didn't see any injured people

                             at all after leaving the pitch

                             until getting back there.

20.02    DCS6930             So you went back onto the pitch




                                                                         1 101

                       and I think is it right that

                       you actually organised the

                       shall we call it a buffer across

                       the, the half way line of Police

                       Officers?

20.18    BDM          No I didn't do that, I I spoke

                       to a Fire Officer who said it,

                       he they intended taking seme of

                      the injured out through the South

                      Stand and I I got a couple of

                      officers and and members of the

                      public who agreed to help to keep

                      that part of the stand open and and

                      available so there would be no

                      hinderance of the, of the injured

                      being taken out.   I I then saw

                      that there was a large number of

                      officers along the North Stand

                      track and also a large number on

                      the Kop side.   I knew the problems

                      we'd been having in communications

                      in the Control Room, I wanted to

                      identify different key officers

                      who I knew that the Chief

                      Superintendent could contact in

21.09                 different areas.   I went to the Kop

                      side and I saw that Mr CHAPMAN,

                      Superintendent CHAPMAN was on the

                      track and asked him if he was




                                                                   1 102
MURRAY             BERNARD   D


                             staying there and he said yes and

                             I went to the North Stand, the only,

                             I couldn't find the Chief Inspector,

                             the only officer I could find was

21.29                        Inspector WALLACE and asked him if

                             he would stay there, he said yes,

                             which gave me the two contact

                             points.   But I also saw then

                             supporters were were encroaching to

                             the half way line, that some of them

                             were in an angry mood and I just took

                             one serial from the North Stand and

                             redeployed that on the South Stand,

                             just to prevent clashes there because

                             there were no fences or no walls

                             there and and sorted that out.

22.03    DCS6930             By this time was Mr NESBIT present?

         BDM                 I think Mr, I think Mr NESBIT was

                             there on the track, I don't know

                             whether I I can't remember whether

                             I recall seeing him personally

                             at that stage.

                             concerned now, you got Mr

                             GREENWOOD if not Mr NESBIT...

         BDM                 Mr GREENWOOD.

         DCS6930             in charge of the, the operation

                             on the terraces.

                             GREENWOOD is in charge of the

                             operation at the back of the

                             goal rescuing the, the injured

                             people.   The Superintendent who was

                             in charge of the deployment of

                             officers in front of the Kop and

                             an Inspector in charge of of the

                             deployment on the North Stand and

                             I've got a Sergeant who is known

                             to me with his serial on the South

                             Stand, looking after that side of

                             the ground.

22.50    DCS6930             So everything that you felt was

                             a problem area you have either one

                             got a situation where the

                             Superintendent is dealing with it,

                             Mr GREENWOOD?

         BDM                 Mm.

         DCS6930             You've gone to the back of the,

                             the terraces because you

                             recognise the problem but when

                             you get there you're happy it's

                             being dealt with?

         BDM                 Yes.

23.12    DCS6930             You then recognise that you need

                             contact points with Mr DUCKENFIELD

                             at the Kop end and at the North

                             Stand end and you identify Police

                             Officers for that?

         BDM              Yes.

         DCS6930          You then use the Sergeant and

                           his serial as what I call the

                          buffer to stop the...

         DCS6930          the problem that you then saw.     Frcin

                          that point on is it then that you

                          then go back to the Control Room?

23.38    BDM              More or less.   There there were

                          one or two things that obviously

                          you can't ignore as we're going

                          about they they are different

                          people being abusive or being

                          insulting or or needing a very

                          quick helping hand that any

                          Police Officer would give that

                          sort of attention to, but then it

                          I I make my way back to the

                          Control Roan to to see what, after

                          all my brief really was to clear

                          the pitch which which very quickly

                          I realised was an impossible and

                          unfeasible task anyway.

         DCS6930          Right, did, before you actually

24.17                     get back to the Control Room.    Did

                          you at any stage either the first

                          occasion you went down or the

                          second occasion when you've gone

                          down and done what we've just

                             gone through see Mr JACKSON

                             on the pitch?

         BDM                 I didn't see him, I didn't see

                             him until I got back into the

                             Control Room.

24.32    DCS6930             So you got back into the Control

                             Room and did you then, I think you

                             briefed Mr DUCKENFIELD...

         BDM                 Yes.

         DCS6930             about what you'd done, what you

                             found.    Is that right?

         BDM                 Yeah I told him what I'd what I'd

                             done and what I'd seen and that

                             we'd obviously got a lot of

                             casualties.

24.54    DCS6930             And Mr JACKSON was present at that

                             stage?

         BDM                 I can't remember sir.

         DCS6930             Okay.    At seme stage Mr JACKSON

                             came into the Control Room?

         BDM                 At at some stage he was there, he

                             was certainly there when when Mr

                             DUCKENFIELD said he was going to

                             the Directors Lounge.

         DCS6930             I mean you've said that you

                             think you you got back to the

                             Control Room again and I know it's

                             your time, you've estimated

                             probably around 3.35 pm (1535).




                                                                        1 106

                           Can you be any more precise as to

                          when Mr JACKSON was present in that

                          Control Room?

25.40    BDM               I can't.   I know Mr JACKSON was

                           there when I, when I went down

                           on the second occasion.    I can't,

                           I can't remember whether he was

                           in the Control Room when I

                           returned or whether he came

                           afterwards.

         DCS6930           But, but he certainly was there

                           at some stage?

         BDM              He was there at some stage because...

         DCS6930          And and we're talking around that

                           3.35 (1535) mark?

26.04    BDM              Well, whatever time it was it was

                          at the time when Mr, when Mr

                          DUCKENFIELD went to the Directors

                           Box because he said I'm I'm going

                          to the Directors Lounge to to

                          tell them what's happened and Mr

                          JACKSON followed him a few

                          minutes later.

26.17    DCS6930          Went with him.     Did you give any

                          brief to Mr JACKSON on the events

                          that had occurred at that

                          particular time?

         BEM              Well I don't even know if he

                          was there so I I can't remember




                                                                        1 107

                             I would give my I would give my

                             brief to Mr DUCKENFIELD.

         DCS6930             No I mean, going going back to

                             what you've just said, you said

                             you knew he came back in...

         BDM                 Oh yes.

         DCS6930             at some stage.

         BDM                 Yes.

         DCS6930             If we forget when he was, when he

                             was there but certainly before

                             he went with Mr DUCKENFIELD.      At

                             that time did you brief him in

                             any way shape or form about

                             any events?

         BDM                 No, I I don't think so.

         DCS6930             Not personally?

         BDM                 Not deliberately or not

                             personally I would tell Mr

                             stopping the match.

         DCS6930             This is the first time?

         BDM                 Yes.

27.28    DCS6930             Now on that occasion did you

                             give, did you give Mr JACKSON

                             any brief of any kind then?

         BDM                 No I I know he asked what's

                             what's happening and Mr

                             DUCKENFIELD said I'm I'm

                             to that effect.

                             knew that you'd opened the gates

                             he's looking at the pitch and

                             he's he's talking about the

                             people sort of who were on the

                             pitch and certainly if he'd

                             said that to me instead of

                             Mr DUCKENFIELD and said what's

                             know the people are coming

                             pitch for some reason.    I feel

                             that that was what he was getting

                             at.    He wasn't sort of after an

                             overall picture.

         DCS6930             He's obviously there quite

                             quickly...

         DCS6930             in terms of, he was originally

                          occurred.

         DCS6930          Now in that case if the question

                          had been asked to you what's

                          happened, you've just said I

                          think you would have said,

                          the same thing because you

                          didn't relate the two events?

         BDM              No I thought, well I thought

                          Mr JACKSON was talking was was

                          asking about the people on the

                          why has the game been stopped in

                          the tracks and I think that when

                          sure yet I think he was he was

                          saying exactly what he thought

                          he knew that something was

                             never saw him at all.

         DCS6930             As far as you're concerned

                             you you were not present then?

         BDM                 No I didn't see them afternoon.

30.12    DCS6930             Did Mr DUCKENFIELD at any time

                             in that first meeting when

                             Mr JACKSON was there or when you

                             came back and before they went

                             to the Directors Meeting.    Did

                             Mr DUCKENFIELD or yourself

                             mention to Mr JACKSON about the

                             gates, you opening the gates

                             and the reason why?

         BDM                 Not that I can recall, not that

                             I can recall, but I mean, Mr

                             JACKSON was only in the Control

                             Room for a very, a very few

                             seconds or a minute at the most

                             initially, when I, when I saw

                             him initially.

         DCS6930             That's that's just after, that's

                             around the seven eight minutes




                                                                          1112

         BDM                 When the game has been stopped.

         DCS6930             What about the second occasion?

30.54    BEM                 And the second occasion I seem

                             to think that as I went into

                             the Control Room Mr DUCKENFIELD

                             was was ready to walk out

                             straight away and more or less

                             sort of, had been waiting for

                             me if you like, before he went

                             to the Directors Lounge.

31.10    DCS6930             So you heard no conversation

                             then or any briefing frcm

                             Mr DUCKENFIELD to Mr JACKSON

                             on the opening of the gates

                             and the reasons for it?

         BDM                 No.

31.22    DCS6930             Again, can can we go back to Mr

                             MARSHALL.   Did Mr MARSHALL come

                             into the Control Box at any time

                             that you recall up until that

                             point of when Mr DUCKENFIELD and

                             Mr JACKSON went to the Directors?

31.38    BDM                 I can't recall seeing Mr MARSHALL

                             at all.

         DCS6930             No okay then.   Not at all at the

                             briefing or otherwise to the, well

                             either to Mr DUCKENFIELD, Mr

                             I don't think I don't think I

                             saw him at all.

         DCS6930             Which briefing would that be?

         BDM                 I'm talking about the briefing at

                             in the morning.

         DCS6930             The following morning?

         BDM                 No before the morning of the

                             of the match.     He may of, he may

                             of come into the Control Room at

                             seeing him at all.

32.38    DCS6930             There was a, you had a debrief

                             did you after this?

         BDM                 Oh yes we had a number of...

         DCS6930             That night.     Did you have a

         BDM                 Not that night.

         DCS6930             Not of any kind?

         BDM                 I didn't have a debrief, I think

                             there was one at Headquarters

                             one.

32.47    DCS6930             Okay.    So from your point of

                             view then, from that point on

                             from the time that Mr DUCKENFIELD

                             and Mr JACKSON left to go to the

                             Directors Box, you were then

                             back in control of the...

         BDM                 I was back in the Control Room,

         DCS6930             of the incident?

         BDM                 Yes.

         DCS6930             Right.     And at no point had

                             there been any conversation to

                             do with the opening of the gates

                             and the reason why in your

                             presence?

         BDM                 Not that I can recall.

         DCS6930             Not that you can recall.    Okay.

                             Were you actually in the, we

                             need to go back just a little

                             bit now.

         BDM                 Yes.

                             was requested of Mr JACKSON?

         BDM                 No.

33.51    DCS6930             Your view of Operation Support,

                             Operational Support, what what

                             does it actually do in South

                             Yorkshire Police if you ask for

                             Operational Support?

         BDM                 What it does is it asks for all

                             all officers, all available

                             officers except absolute minimum

                             manpower requirements to attend at a

                             given rendezvous to assist with

                             with seme sort of incident.

34.16    DCS6930             Is it correct to say that it is

                             for a, it's a public order

                             Operational Support Document as

                             oppposed to a, a Major Disaster

                             Document?

         BDM                 I think, I think that is the

                             general idea it is a, it is a

                             it would generally be used for

                             a public order situation.     It is a

                             question of getting as much

                             manpower as possible to a site

                             as quickly as possible.

34.41    DCS6930             I mean, I mean if you were in the

                             situation of being in the Control

                             Box and knew you had a disaster

                             taking place as opposed to a




                                                                           1116

                          public order.   What would you

34.53                      actually implement. Would you

                           implement Operational Support

                          or would you implement your

                           Force Major Disaster Plan?

         BDM               I think you've got to look

                           at the Force Major Incident

                          Plan.

35.04    DCS6930          Major Incident Plan.   Who would

                          take responsibility for setting

                          that Major Incident Plan into

                          operation.

         BDM              Well the decision would be

                          given by the Senior Officer

                          present and I think it would be

                          normal to request the Detective

                          Chief Superintendent to, to ccme

                          out and take over the incident.

35.42    DCS6930          But in any event you weren't

                          present when this situation

                          was set up and taking place.

         BDM              No.

         DCS6930          If, I think you've said that

                          you didn't think it was a

                          pitch invasion or a problem

                          area when it first happened.

35.49                     Was there any discussion from

                          Mr DUCKENFIELD at that time that

                          he, he felt that it was a public

                             order situation or did you get

                             the impression from him that he felt

                             it was a public order situation?

         BDM                 I I can't recall any conversation

                             and I can't recall whether I

                             made I made comment but I as if

                             to say well I think there's

                             something wrong, I can't remember

                             whether, what was said, but

                             certainly when I went down onto

                             the pitch for the second occasion

                             I think my brief was quite clear

                             was to to sweep the people off

                             the pitch onto the wings which

                             I think inferred to me Mr

                             DUCKENFIELD probably did think

                             it was, there was a possibility

                             of public order from the, from

                             what was happening.   In fact it

                             was my intention to do exactly

                             what he'd told me until I got

                             down there and and then realised

                             that that I couldn't do that.

36.50                        We weren't, we weren't dealing

                             with people who were just out to

                             cause a nuisance.

                             time to the Control Room had

                           requested by then?

         BDM               Not that I know of, I don't,

                           I I don't know, not that I

                           know of, but I wouldn't have

                           thought so.

         DCS6930           But the logical thing for the

                          would have been to send

                           for Operational Support if

                          he felt he had a public order

                          situation?

         BDM              Yeah, if if he felt he had a

                          situation I would say where he

                          needed a a a large input of

                          manpower over and above what he'd

                          got.

37.24    DCS6930          When you came back up and at seme

                          stage recognised that you had a

                          disaster type situation, were

                          you aware that the Major Incident

                          Plan was then actually taking

                          place.   Do you know how it started?

         BDM              I I've no idea.       I had to try and

                          pick up the pieces when I came

                          back to the Control Room because

                          I'd been away for half an hour

                          or more and the first thing, I that

                          triggered in me was that some

                          Humberside officers asked if they




                                                                         1 M9

                           could be of assistance.

38.00    DCS6930           So how would you effectively find

                           that the Major Incident Plan had

                           actually been commenced?

         BDM               I I think I picked, I don't know,

                           I don't know how I picked it up

                          but I picked it up that we were

                           on a Major Incident situation.

38.19                      Bearing in mind that when I returned

                           to the Control Rocm I still didn't

                           know the extent of what we were

                           dealing with.    I was able to tell

                           Mr DUCKENFIELD that I I felt we

                           we'd got alot of injuries and

                           possibly seme fatalities but I

                          was certainly not thinking that we

                           had the type of incident that we

                           had.

         DCS6930          What's going on is being

                           monitored in the Force Control

                           Rocm.    Would that be right?

         BDM               At that, at that stage once I

                           think, once Operation Support had

                           been, had been called then the

                           Force Ops started to monitor I

                           think.

39.00    DGS6930           Now then in terms of Command of

                           the Incident that's taking place.

                          As far as you were concerned
MURRAY         BERNARD D                                      206


                      who was actually in charge of the

                       shall we call it the disaster, the

                       rescue operation.   Was it Mr

                       DUCKENFIELD or Mr JACKSON that

                      was making the decisions?

         BDM          Well as far as I was concerned Mr

                       DUCKENFIELD was the officer who was

                       the officer who was in charge of

                       the events and of course from

                       seven or eight past three (1507)

                       (1508) until 3.40 (1540) I I

                      was away from the Control Rocm.

39.40                  I returned to the Control Rocm

                       and I was told that there would

                       not be any public announcements

                      on the PA system until it was

                       specifically given by the ACC

                      Operations I think, cause I

                       recall Mr NESBIT calling up and

                      asking for me to give a public

                      address announcement to all the

                      stadium to tell them that the event

                      was going to be abandoned and calling

40.19                 back to him and saying well I want

                      Mr JACKSON'S authority and Mr

                      NESBIT saying well he's standing

                      next to me and when I looked I could

                      see he actually was and so I gave

40.29                 the announcement. So at that stage




                                                                    1 121
MURRAY             BERNARD D                                     207


                           I was satisfied that Mr JACKSON

                          was the officer who was going to

                          give that particular instruction

                          anyway.   As to who was, who was

                           in charge of and at what particular

                          stage I don't know.    Certainly the

                          event was Mr DUCKENFIELD's and there

                          must have been a stage when Mr

                          JACKSON took over.

40.53    DCS6930          Who for example can you recall

                          said we want the temporary mortuary

                          set up, we want the Incident Rocm

                          Box, the Major Incident Plan, the

                          Qnergency Box.   Who made those

                          decisions?

         BDM              Well I wouldn't be in the Control

                          Room I don't think when those

                          decision were made?

         DCS6930          Okay that's fine.    Can I move

                          perhaps finally onto the specific

                          allegations and I've covered most

                          of them but it's an opportunity

                          for you, through what we've

                          been through and what we've said

41.26                     Mr HICKS has made specific

                          allegations against you and the

                          first one is that you failed

                          to prevent a dangerous build up of

                          supporters outside the gates.     Is




                                                                       1 122
MURRAY         BERNARD D                                       208


                       there anything you wish to add

                       to that allegation as a result of

                      what we've said today?

         BDM           I don't think so.   I I think you've

                       gone through it and I think that

                      on the circumstances that prevailed

                       that the time limits that was

41.58                  available that that we did everything

                       that we we thought was possible to

                      prevent that build up, bearing in

                      mind that there were all sorts of

                      other factors, the the weather which,

                      was unusual at the time, the the

                       familiarity of the fans with that

                      particular area having ccme the

                      year before and obviously arriving

                       later, the layout of the ground

                      which which doesn't beccme apparent

                       until after something like this

                       has happened, the number of

                       turnstiles, the ticket coding,

                       the signing actually inside and

                      outside the ground, the fact that

                       a barrier collapsed, the attitude

                      of some of the people that were

                      there, the fact that many had

                      drunk alcohol, the fact that our

                      communications went down.      I

                      think there were so many factors




                                                                     1 123
MURRAY             BERNARD   D                                      209


                             that that helped to to create this.

42.56    DCS6930             He makes two other allegations

                             that you failed to control the

                             movement of supporters subsequent

                             to the opening of Gate C and that

                             you failed to respond to the

                             developing tragedy and was

                             slow to effect a rescue operation.

                             Is there anything that you wish

                             to add to those other two specific

                             allegations?

         BDM                 No except, all all I would say that

43.13                        my aim and and as far as I was

                             concerned was to remove the danger

                             that existed outside the ground and

                             to relieve the pressure and the,

                             and the, the obvious hazard to those

                             people who again reports of were

                             being crushed outside the ground

                             and the opening of the gates

                             obviously relieved that but

                             caused secondary problems that

                             that I didn't foresee at the time.

         DCS6930             And is there anything else of any

                             other nature that you wish to bring

                             up with me at this point?

         BDM                 No I don't think so I would say

                             that pure and simply I I'm a Police

                             Officer I do the job as best I can

                             I'm not a Superman, I'm not a,

44.01                        I thought I I could handle anything

                             and everything and as a result of

                             these, I now know I can't.     I lean

                             on my experience and my experience

                             has never brought me up against

                             anything like this before.     I've

                             always tried to my job properly

                             and I continue to do so.

44.20    DCS6930             Thank you.   The final thing that

                             I need to say to you is that

                             the the facts will be reported

                             to the Director of Public

                             Prosecutions and it will be a

                             matter for him to decide whether

                             any criminal offences have been

                             ccmnitted.   Do you understand?

         BDM                 Yes.

         DCS6930             Thank you.   The interview is now

00.10    DCS6930          This is an interview taking place

                           at Fumival House, Sheffield.     It's

                           a discipline interview with

                           Superintendent MURRAY, South

                          of June 1990 (250690).     I am

                           Superintendent, West Midlands

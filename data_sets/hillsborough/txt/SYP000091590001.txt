                    I am a single man                    live at the above address with my parents,                          I

                    support Liverpool                  ball Club and have held a season ticket for the

                    Anfield Road stand at Anfield for the past three seasons,                                  My season

                    ticket expired at the end of the 1988-1989 <000088>-<000089)                                   football

                    season and I did not renew it.                   The     reason I did not renew my season

                    ticket was as a result of the disaster that took place at

                    Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield on 15th April                          1989 <150489),           I went

                    to some games following this tragedy but have not went to a football

                    game since this new season started.                       I feel   that the events of 15th

                    April   <150489)       last have put me off attending football matches.

                    Prior to this disaster,              I would attend all Liv er po ol ’s home

                    fixtures,       but not many away games.

                    On Saturday 15th April              1989 (150489), Liverpool were to play
                                                                                     PAGE         2

Nottingham Forest         in the semi-final          of the F .A. Cup competition.         This

game was to be played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield .                       I have

been as a spectator at this ground twice before this qmrie T the last

time was the semi-final of the F.A. Cup involving tfre same clubs in

1988 (000088).         On that day I was in the Leppin gy Lane terrace and I

found it bu s y , but not as bad as the game on IS^i April                 1989 (150489)

   I was a season ticket holder at the t                        obtained a ticket from

Liverpool F.C.       for the F             Cup semi-final. / The tjHfket cost me £6.00p

and was for the terracing area at the Le ppangs Lane end of

Hillsborough Stadium,             this being the Li/erpool      supporters end of the

g roun d.

I travelled to Sheffield with my fr/ends in a c a / belonging to

                who is a policeman in Liverpool                         lives at

                                      dso     in the c                     of

                                                  andva friend of                called

                 t know his last name / r where he lives.

                          called at m y house very early on the morning of the

match,      I ’m not sure of th        ,   ime,    We then collected
                     fsj3 S C L
lad called Peter GARRETT/of

finally)        |.                drove directly to Sheffield,         we did not stop on

the way.       We were not subjected to traffic delays.                We arrived in

Sheffield about 10.30am             (1030).       I remember thinking we were very

early and there was          lots of time till the game would start.

             parked in a pub car park, between the football               ground and a

railway station.          I d o n ’t know the name of the public house,            it was

closed on our arrival and I think it was all boarded up.                        This was

only about a ten minute walk from the ground.

We then bought a football from a local shop and then had a kick

around,      behind this pub.

After a while we walked to a supermarket and to a “chippie" at the top
                                                                                        PAGE          3
                                                                                        S3585

      of this road, for something to eat..          A T. the sup ermarkal^we met two

      local    lads from            that we knew,            —
                                                             arrlcf                     o -r



      We all had something to eat, ojre or two of the lads bought a can of

      beer from the supermarket rot I d i d n ’t bother.

      After a while we all walked down to the ground together.                    The streets

      were by now getting busy.         I never saw any trouble at all.             Everyone

      was    in a happy mood.

      It was a pretty warm day and dry.When we had                been playing football

      we just had our       *T’ shirts on.

      As we walked towards the ground I saw a few policemen in the area.                         We

      were never stopped by the P o l i o ^ a n d asked to show our tickets.

      We got to the turnstiles           the Leppings Lane end of the ground about


<&>   Z om   (1400) .

      turnstiles,
                        As I waJ^fed freely past the outer ga t es , 1 eadi ng to the

                        it appeared to me that everyone was looked at by the

      Police,    who wo^ld stop every 3th        or every 10th person       tosearch     them.

      Our group was not stopped by the           Police.

      The    position outside was quite normal,       people were standing around

      outside in groups.        There was no bother getting           into the ground,        there

      was no crush outside.
                                                                          c*rf.
                   had left us outside as he had a ticket for the North Stand.

      I c a n ’t remember    if ______ was in the terrace,     I think he had a stand

      seat.     Peter G A R R E T T ’s parents we knew were travelling to the game and

      would be in the West Stand,       directly abj^e the centre of the Leppings

      Lane terrace,

      I entered the ground through a Jmrnstile and the turnstile operator

      tore the stub off my ti ck et j € r \ d gave me a portion of it

      Once    inside my friends aofG I joined up and walked                        tun ne 1

      leading to the terracing.         I thought this                 only way into the

\     terracing.        Even later, when I was    in pe        I still thought that
                                                                                                      PAGE

           where the.people were at the sides with lots of room,                         that they must

           have different tickets to the one that I had.                        I never saw any signs

           directing you to go around                     sides of the terracing.              There was

           no Police or Stewards^              ie area of the tunnel entrance to assist the

           fa n s .

           The tunne 1 was£jprot busy aodT I had a free passage along to thj

         ^•t-eTTaciTTg-r~~~^t tj^g          cinq we entered an area knoujjH-^as^ pen 3, this

           would be about/s^.J>5pnj/ (1415).          We all moved f^fward into this part of

           the terracing J?crtr''would not get too far^is                it was tightly packed.

           From this p j f i i tion I could see ovp// the top of the nearest goal area.

           This was not a par t i cular ly j^te fa d spectating area.

           Pen 3 continued to fill                with people and it was becoming quite

           uncomfortable,       stand,irng there.      The    crowd was surging forward and

           pushing backwards.         I was being pushed about,                it was^arfTno^ing more

           than anything else to me at that time,

           As I looked around               me,    I could see that terrace to m^ left                was

           not as busy as the area I was in.                 & fle r   about    15 to 20 minutes of

           being in pen 3 we all        climbed oy & r       a metal fence to our left that

           sectioned the crowd off into/areas and went                    into pen 4. It was a bit
     J
           better in 4 but it         was s y f l l   busy and still filling up.            Pen 3     was

           "chocka".
    or     We took up a posit Lon central             in Pen 4.        I had a good view.        As the

           crowd continued to build I could see that again the area to our left

           was very quiet on the terracing.

          peter GARRETT,        being the smallest        in our group, about 5*4 t a l 1 , left

           us to make his way towards the front of this Pen 4 .                         This was about

           2.30pm     (1430).

           After about 10 minutes         in Pen 4, my group,            except forVPeter GARRETT,
    of
v          climbed over the metal fence to our left side ijpto^en 5 j( a narrow

           area which we immediately climbed out of into P                         6.    j>rot many

                                                                                S33S5

others were   climbing out at this time.         It was a high climb and the

dividing fences had spikes on top end.

Once we got into the area referred to as pen 6,               it was great.     We all

moved up close to the back towards the adjoining area of pen 7.                   I was

surprised at the room we had in this area,             there was just steps and

steps in front of us, with no-one standing there.                I thought that

these people must have had different tickets from mine to get in there

As the teams prepared to kick off,        I decided to walk towards the front

of pen 6, to try to see Peter GARRETT and tell him he would get a good

view of the game beside us.       As I made my way towards the front,             the

game kicked off, a tremendous      cheer went up and even if I could see

Peter, which I could n’t past two dividing fences,              there was no way he

would have been able to have heard me,           I returned to my friends to

enjoy the game.                                        _
                                                                                 -UL
The next thing    I remember   is the game s t u p i n g 4 n^ fans s^ri 1 Ming ove r

the perimeter fencing,    onto the p i t ; a r e a .       The Police were trying

to keep them in.     I w a s n ’t sur^/exactly what was happening.            A fan who

walked along the track frp*fi behind the goal,             entered our section off

terrace through the perimeter gate,        this man was        crying his eyes out

and he was aged about 25 years.        This man was saying that his friend

had died in front of him in the terracing.              I remembe^ the players^

leaving the pitch.

We were all worried about Peter GARRETT and/made our way to the

perimeter gate in Pen 6 to try to get c^fto the pitch but the Policeman

on the track at the gate would not y^Tt us onto the pitch.               About

3.25pm   (1525)                        pr o d u c e d his warrant   card to the

policeman on this gate,    ex plaimi ng that we were worried about our

mate that we knew was in thir terrace,        behind the goal and he then

allowed us to go onto the ^»itch a r e a .

Once on the pitch we spL&t up to try to find Peter GARRETT,               but we
                                                                                      PAGE        6

couldn’t find him.       Peter GARRETT's      parents had seen                        and

On the pitch I met my cousin,                       _r   of

I'm not sure of his address but can get it fs^T you,                            who is

about 16 stone,     pointed out a slim poll ce/fan with glasses to me, and

said to me,    "If it wasn't for him I w o j g l d be dead by now", and he told

me that this slightly built man had/phys i cal ly pulled hiprfjut of Pen

3 .On the pitch I saw a lad from mj? old school, Neil F ITZMAURICE,                       w ho

told me he had been car ryi ng parople on boards across the pitch.                        Ne i1

lives at

I don't know the street nuiper,           he is a drama student.

After a while we went to L x \ area behind the North Stand,               there was a

Policeman or a St. John Amfmlanceman seated at a desk in the corner,

in the open, and we supplied Peter G A R R E T T ’s details to this official

We met all up,    I'm not sure if             was with us, we couldn’t find

Peter,   so left the ground about 4pm         (16QQ)     and returned to the car,

which we sat in with the radio on.

1 did not carry any dead or injured inside the ground.                   I d o n ’t

remember seeing any dead persons.

After a while                and I went to locate a telephone box,                  but

ended up telephoning from someone's house.                Phoning             ho u se ,

told his sister we could not find him and asked her to telephone our

families to let them know we were all al r i ghj/*’'                and I went back to

the car,          and his brother left and             nt to their coach,

We then decided to visit local hospitals,              a policeman gave us

directions to two hospi tal s.       T h e ^ r a f f i c was extremely h e a v y .     We

first went to the Northern G e n i a l       Hospital     in Sh ef fi el d.    People were

crying in the hospital,       therce were    clergymen in attendance.             We gave

P e t e r ’s name to hospital jrtaf f .

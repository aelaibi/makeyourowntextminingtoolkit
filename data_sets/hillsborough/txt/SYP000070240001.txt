                    and me from Blackpool                 at about      ten O ’clock,              he had a l re a dy

c ol lected                                We    i mm ed ia te ly     left B lackpool               to go to

Sheffield.           I think we        tr av el le d on the M55 onto                   the M6 then onto              the

M52 and M61 and onto                  the M1.       We m is s ed our       turn off on the Ml and had

to travel           an extra     16 miles        to get         back to the turn off.                 There were            no

signs at all            on the m o t o rw a y       indicating        that       this was          the turn off           to

get to H il ls bo ro ug h.           A l t h ou g h we were        not s u b j e c te d to any major

delays        on     route to the game           I did see a number                   of    roadworks      that w ould

cause        delays     had the       traffic       been heavy.        We s t op p ed once on route                    to

the    ground at some            services        on the M62,          this was             to go to the         toilet

and we only s t op pe d for about                    five minutes.

Once     in S h e f f i e l d we a p p r o a c h e d H i l l s b o r o u g h along           the A 6 1 . I d i d n ’t

see or notice any signs                  or direc ti on s          to the gr ou nd or to any                    parking

all    the side         road were       bloc ke d off with            borders          and a couple            of P ol i ce

were     preventing           cars    going     into      these    roads        to    park.    We    parked         in the

same    place as we have               done on our          two    previous           visits,       on a side         road

approximately              ten or fift ee n m in ut es walk              from the ground.                 We    parked

our    car at about           ten to one at w h ic h time                there was a fair amount                       of

traffic about              but we     had no great          d i f fi c ul t y    in parking,           this     being

                    mainly      due     to our k no w le d ge        of the area             from our        previous        visits.       I

A fter      speaking      to him for a short             time we      c ontinued on to the            entrance

to the ground off L e p p in g s              Lane.    As we    reached       the entrance

at about         ten to two,         I saw three m o un te d fPjBl i emen waiting                 by the

the Police at all.

My friend                had a ticket           fo the N or th S t a nd seats and the other

three      of us had tickets            for the terracing.             Because      of this we w a n d e r e d

•around the entrance a r e a for a short                      time    trying     to find

s om eb o dy who w ould swop a terracing                    ticket     for his seat ticket.                As we

did this,         I was a p p r o a c h e d   by a number       of    people.     I would        say as many

as a d ozen asking             if    I had a ny spare         tickets.       Whilst a tt em p ti n g       to

swop              ticket,      I became       detached      from my friends and as                this

h a p pe n ed    one of the m o un t e d Police           officers      a sk ed me what          I was     doing

and whet he r        I was     going    to go     into the ground.            At this      I made my way

to the turnstiles a l t h o u g h             I was    given no direct           order    by the officer.

I went       thro ug h the      t urnst ile      at about      two o ’clock       I saw no stewards                or

Po li ce    outside      the turnstiles,             a l t h ou g h this a re a was      empty and         I had

no d i f f i c u l t y at all        find ing    the turnstile         or getting        thro ug h    I handed

my ticket         in at the         tur ns ti le and as       I left    the    other side         there were

a b ou t   four     or five     office rs       in a line s e ar ch in g        people,     as    they

               the    tunnel         and no signs          d irecting    fans    to the      terracing areas.

               D e s p i t e my two       previous         visits    to that     terracing,         I thought      that      the

               tunnel         was the only       route          to the viewing     areas.       The a re a betw ee n         the

               turn st i l e s and tunnel             was       free from    c on ge s ti o n wit h only a small

               number         of    people m i ll i ng around.

               I bought a programme                  and went       to the toilet       before        entering     the    tunnel

               at all.         The    toilet    is s it ua t ed      immedi at el y    next     to the tunnel          and     is

               well     sign        posted.    This    fact may draw          people    towards        the tunnel,        if

               they need the toilet,                  Wjilt^ou^T realising        it. H av i ng       been to the        toilet

               I w a l k e d along       the    t u nn el /t o     the terracing.       I    had a comp le te ly free

               passage         down the tunnel             until    I reached the       back step of the              terracing

               where a number            of fans       had stood so that           they      could get a view of               the

               match.         Over    the front       fence.       Because    of these       people     stand in g     here       it

               looks,         from the     tunnel,         as    though the     t erracing is full            however     I know

               from     previous        e xp er ie nc e     that the ter ra ci ng           can be empty apart

               from these            people at       the    back.    I had no d i f f i c u l t y     in filtering

            regain our original                  m a tc h viewing       position.

            Following           this    there was       the usual        jossling      as the a tm os p he r e       grew and

            the    teams        ran onto       the    pitch.

            At about           four m in u te s      to three,     I felt a second surge                from the       back

            again      pushing         us forward,          this time we were          unable     to    push back and we

            the    other        side    of    the    front    fence     right    in    front    of us. All the

            aeople a ro u nd me were                 shouting,     "Get us o u t ” but          the    p olicem an     looked

            P o l i c e m a n and he b egan to shout               into the       crowd,       "Get back,       push back

            there's a kid here" We were                       uanble    to   push back at all            because       of the

            crush from beh|/nd a nd the P o l i c e m a n then said,                       "Too       late,    she's    gone.'

            After      t h i ^ ^       s t ar te d to talk       into his      personal        radio    but still       did

            nothing, 'V/could hear                   people    screaming       out a pp e al i ng      to Bruce

            G r o b e l a a w to get         the Police       to open the       gate and to get us out.                 All

            the    time        people were        shouting and begging             to be       let out.

            I could feel            people       climbing      up from the back           of me an d standing            on my

            shoulder           to get onto        the   fence and over.           I felt myself          being    pulled

            and forced down and                  reach ed out and held onto the                  front    fencing,       I

            felt     petrified.              I s h ou te d out    for    people    not    to    panic and       thought

            that     because        I was at         the front     people w o u ld       climb over me          to get       out

            and    I w ould be hurt.                I saw a young       boy,    about     twelve years          old with

W C O T .   blonde      hair w e a ri ng        a red L iverpool          shirt fall       down just          be hi nd me and

            di s a p p e a r    into the       crush.

            I saw a man who was                  in front      of me who was          in serious        trouble,       choking

and screaming.           This m an was         in his twenties                                                    He

had I                                              and was w e ar in g a light           coloured       jacket

and    tee shirt.        The    last    I saw of this man he was               choking

                          he was       in a bad w a y .

Throughout        this    time    1 was       in pain and just          couldn't      breath wit h my

chest     being    crushed.       I think that had             I not    had my arm up holding                onto

tine fence       it w o u ld have       been worse.

I didn't       see any gates           in the front        fence    being     opened at all        before          I

 as able       to get     out    of the P en by standing               on somebody       in front       of me

and    pulling myself           over    the    fence.    One   of my feet got          caught as        I got

to the top of the              fence    but somebody        u nh oo k ed    it and    I was able        to get

onto    the    running     track,       this being       i ndicated        by the number 2 on

exhibit           1.

Once    on the     running       track     I began to get my breath back,                  I still          had

t er rible     pains     in my    chest and sat for a short                 time at      the    side    of the

pitch.     After a short          time     1 walked across         the      pitch where        I was

approached        by three       s te wards who      I am sure         had just      put the     jackets

on.    As the     three a p p r o a c h e d    one of them a s k e d what was            going    on    I

couldn't       believe     this and said,           that    people were        dying at w h i c h the

stewards       looked g e n u i n e l y    shocked as though            they didn't       have a clue

what was       happening.

After     this    I went       back    to the    side    of the     pitch where        I met     up with

           and             |l don't       remember      leaving    the     ground at all,         I think          I

must    have     been    in shock.        Before    leaving     the     ground we met          up wit h

                         and all       lift together at a bout             half   past    four    I think

Comparing        last years       game w ith this years            I can      remember     that    last

year    there was a m uc h            larger Police        presence ar ou nd the          ground

checking       people     had tickets and didn't               have an y drink.          This year          there

was    no o r g a n i s a ti o n of the       fans and no      checks      for tickets.

I feel     that    the    complete        lack of signs        inside      the ground a nd the              fact
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S 1450

that      there were        no Police       or stewards,          telling     people where        to go

r es ulted       in people       thinking,       as   I did,      that     the tunnel    was     the    only

way to get to the terracing.

| also      feel     that    the   c o mm u ni ca ti on between the Police               outside       the

g round and those            inside must         have      been very       poor.   If there were         so

m an y    fans waiting        to get       into the ground then the kick                  off    s hould have

been dela y ed        so that      the    people      could get       in    safely.

I   cannot       u nd er s ta n d wh y Liverpool           were   given     the    smaller      end

c onsidering        the average          a tt en da nc e    is over 3 9 , 0 0 0 a week w h er ea s

N o t t i n g h a m Forest    only get 20,000.              I blame      the FA for this and hope

that      lessons will        be   lear ned this time.

I feel      that    the     des ig n of the Leppi ng s Lane                t erracintg    needs       to be

altered.         There was       no w ay for fans to spread                 out sideways        beca us e of

the side fences and once                  the    crush had begun            the front     fence stop pe d

people      getting       out.

The      gates    in the     front   fence were            not opened q ui ck ly enough.              If the

gates      had have       been opened earlier               people w o ul d not have         p an icked so

muc h and        began    climbing       on top of each other               causing   complete

confus i o n .

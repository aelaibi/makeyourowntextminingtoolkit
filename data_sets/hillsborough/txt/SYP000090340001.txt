            that         we a r r i v e d       in S h e f f i e l d at    12 noon.           <1200)             We went           to a

was    relatively            easy.          1 went       through         the     last t u r n s t i l e on th e right,

there were          Police          officers        present            and a     couple         talking       to    stewards.

I was       not    c h a l l e n g e d at a n y         time     or     searched          by    the    officers.




No    one    gave     us     directions            as    to w h i c h w a y        to go        but    I recollect               that

from    going       to     last      years        similar        match         we w e n t         through          th e    tunnel.I

thought        this      was    th e    only way             into      the     terraces and             therefore           took        the

same access           route         this     yea r .         Access      was     easy      through       th e      t un n e l .

I saw       no P o l i c e     or    stewards           at    t h is    access      point.            Having       got     to     the

bottom       of    the     tunnel       there       was a        large        volume       of    people       to    the      rear       of

the    pen.        All     three       of    us    tried       to m a k e       headway         but    it w a s      impossible.

 We were          subsequently              forced       to    go      sideways       and move          to    the     rig h t         into

which       I believe          is    called        pen 3.           W h e n we     finally        stopped          it w a s

directly          next     to a      right        hand       fence,      towards          the    back    of     the* pen

almost       halfway         down.          The    crowd was            so    dense       it w a s     impossible            to

move.        We    tried       to    edge     our w a y        ou tw ar ds and moved about                      two       yards1

sideways.           We     couldn't          move       back     so     brad to     be     s a t i s f i e d as      to w h e r e we

were.        Once we         had stopped            I recollect                looking            at m y w a t c h a n d              saw

It    really       became       uncomfortable                 and      I iecame       concerned          for       myself         as    I

officers            were       shouting          for    the       fans       to go       back       but       there was            no w a y

you     c o u l d go       back       it w a s     absolute              chaos,         coupled with                 th e    fact       that

no body was              aware       of w h a t    was       going          on.      After         some       time       but      I don*t

know       ho w     long       it w a s     the    pressure              seemed         to    lessen and              I was        able       to

move       of m y        own    volition.              I recollect                seeing                  in f r o n t         of me,         I

turned around                  to    see    if    I could           see             , but      I c o u l d n •t .            We    both

waited a while and                               came       back       to    us a n d        confirmed             t h at    people       ha d

die d .        I had a s s u m e d          that       they       ha d      earlier          because          of     the     predicament

I had       been         in.               suggested           to      go    down and          help       but        there        would       h av e

been       nothing         we       could    have       done,          we w a l k e d a c r o s s         th e       p en    towards          the

tunnel         and       stood adjacent                to    it a n d        looked          towards          the     pitch.            I just

saw a          mass       of    people       lying          near       to    th e    perimeter            fence          some      were

being       passed         out       through       the       gate and             some       over       the    f e nc e .         A man       came

passed         us    carrying             a young       b oy      in his a r m s ,            he    could          not      have     been

more       than 8 - 1 0 - 1 4                years,          he w a s          b lu e    in the          face an d           his     b o d y wa s

quite       limp.          We w a l k e d        through          th e      tunnel       into       the       concourse.                I guess

this       must      have       been about             3.30       pm     <1530)         3.40       pm    <1540).             T h e re

appeared            to    be a n u m b e r        of    fans        assisting            injured          people            in t h i s are a ,

there was a P o l i c e                   presence          but     they       did      not a p p e a r        to     be     doing much

at all.             There appeared                to    be m o r e a c t i v i t y            on the          pitch area             i n s t ea d .

I did       not a s s i s t          anyone       myself.              I eventually                left       th e    g r o u n d at a b o u t

twenty         to    four.          <1540).        After          informing             relatives             we     left      for      our

respective               cars.




At    no    t im e       prior       to    the     match,                   I d i d not w i t n e s s a n y           drunkenness              or

violent           behaviour.               The     rapore                   was     usual      for       the S a t u r d a y       football

match.            I did        forget       to m e n t i o n      that        as    I wa s     by        the       turnstiles            I saw

a    l a rge      blue     gate       being        opened                   on m y r i ght         for    just a s e c o n d and

someone           leave,        no    one    entered           this         gate.

                                                                                                                                    S3460

        I feel       that      the    choice        of    venue        for     the    football          m a t c h was    a wrong           one

        and    once      chosen       the    Liverpool              supporters           were     given     the w r o n g       end.

        Because       of    th e     difficulties              of    getting         from Liverpool              to S h e f f i e l d      it

        was    inevitable            that    the      fa n s    were      going       to    be    late a n d      due     to    the

        sheer    volume         of    the    f a ns      they       s h o u l / have       been given           the    en d    that       was

        more    accesible            at    the    end     of    the jfay.            I also       feel     the F A w e r e          in the

        wrong    for       the a m o u n t       of a l l o c a t i o n      of    tickets.         The P o l i c i n g        before

        t he m a t c h     incomparison             to    last y e a r         was    i n e f e c t i v e , at    last        years
CoJ-\
        match    there was            a ticket           search and a filtering                     s y s t e m for      the        fans,

        but    this      year      there     was      nothing.




        After    the       disaster         had     been       realised           everyone        did    everything            they

        possibly         could       to a s s i s t .      I cannot            condemn       the P o l i c e      as    once        the

        incident         had    occurred          there was           nothing         that       could     be    done    to     stop       it.

        Once    the      realisation             came     they were            very      effective.




        I assume         there was          close        circuit        television           in the        ground and           it w a s

        obvious       that      the       centre      pens w e r e        becoming          packed and an              obvious        sense

        of    emptiness         either       side,        that       I cannot         understand why              someone           did    not

        observe       these        factors        earlier           on a n d      then     take    the     initative           to    direct

        fans    to    the      other      side      of    the       pens.

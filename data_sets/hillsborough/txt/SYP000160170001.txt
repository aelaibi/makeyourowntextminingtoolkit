Dear

Thank you for your letter regarding your concerns over the compensation paid to a former South
Yorkshire Police officer in respect of the Hillsborough Disaster.

The letter has been passed to me to reply in my role as the Hillsborough Disaster Archivist.

The settlement to                            vas made by our Employerâ€™s Liability Insurers and has no
impact on the financial resources committed to operational policing. Secondly, the decision to make
the out of court settlement was also taken by the Insurers, based upon the legal advice they received
and the likely cost of defending the action.

I hope that you can share our view that it is good to close another chapter of this tragedy.

Yours sincerely




Mr A M Hepworth
Hillsborough Archivist

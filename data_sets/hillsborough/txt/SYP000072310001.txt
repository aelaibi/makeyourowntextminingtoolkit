which       is located           on the         corner,    between     the West S t a n d and the N orth

I walked          to    the    right an d through an opening                      in the      brick wall        which

divides       the area           be h i n d the West Stand.              I cannot           say    if there were            or

were     not Pol i c e         or S t e w a r d s    on the      opening.         Once      through    I bought a

programme          for    the m a t c h         from a seller and then went                   into    the gents

can     remember         prior      to going         in were a s s i g n near             to each back       stair way

at    the    rear        of    the West         Stand which       i n dicated      it was         that way for

seating.           I     cannot recall             the exact wording.



As    I wa l k e d       into     the    tunnel       I was   flicling        thro u g h the        match    programme

On emerging            onto      the    terrace       1 noticed a f a n e                          an from the

of the      tunnel.



Q uite     soon after            I arrived         I saw some          fans     come    out from the            tunnel

and    climb onto          the wall         behind me and then try to get                          up    into    the

seats      of the West Stand.                     I saw ™ i i c e m e n        in the     front     of    the    seating

area     come across             and    prevent       th/se fans          climbing        up.      After a minute

or so the fans             stop p e d      trying      to get       up.

At about        2 .50    pm      (1450 hrs)         the     two opposing            t © 4 m s , Liverpool        and

        the    terrace.        This    seemed        to be one        continuous          movement        until    I
yLtt.   s t o p p e d about    three       quarters     of the way down the                     terrace and about a

        quarter       of the w i d t h      in from the fence            d i v iding Pen 4 and the gangway,

        P e n 3.



        I still       had no    control       over my movement,            an d       I was       held    in this       corner

        p o s i t i o n for about      one minute at the most.                       I just wan t e d to get             out

        and    back    through the          tunnel.      By now        1 was    frightened.              Ar o u n d me       I

        could hear         people     s c r e a m i n g and shouting.           The a t m o s p h e r e was        of

        general       panic.        1 was    turned     partly facing            back up t/te terracing and

        all    I could see was a mass                 of faces.         I could see p e opIe at                the      back

        of the      terrace     being       lifted an d p u 1 led u p into                 tt/e West      stand s e a t i n g

        By now      I had     lost    sight     of the       pitch and any            loud speaker

        a n n o u n c e m e n t s , if there were any were              drowned           out    by the shouts and

        I was      then m oved across           the    terrace        in more        or    less a straight-            line

        back    towards       the    d i v iding     fence     between Pens 3- and 4 .                   I stopped

        When      I came    to a stop        the     bottom     left    side    of my           rib   cage was     being

        pushed against          the    crush       barrier      in front       of me.            I could feel          the

        pain      in my side,        but    1 was     c o n c entrating    on keeping my head up,                       so

        that    I could breathe.              A r o u n d me    I could see           people,/the          same as

 I knew the        two ways        out were          the    tunnel      behind or the open gate                           on the

          the       blue     tint     in her       lips.     Someone           on my    left       handside       said   “There's

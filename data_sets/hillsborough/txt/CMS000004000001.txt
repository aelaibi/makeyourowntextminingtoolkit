    Thank you for your letter of 26 October about Lord Justice
    Taylor's Interim Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. I
    will send you a copy of the final report when it is available
    which we think will be in January.
    You will by now have received a formal letter from out people in
    HMSO regarding Crown copyright.   I can now tell you that HMSO
    will not charge you any copyright fee assuming that you do not
    charge for the translation or that you do not sell it at a
    profit.  It would still be helpful, however, if you could write
    to HMSO with the information they have asked for.    I apologise
    for the formality involved.
    Thank you for sending me copies of your very interesting report

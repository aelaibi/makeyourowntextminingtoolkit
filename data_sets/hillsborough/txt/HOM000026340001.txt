In the days prior to the match various sources
indicated a prescription for trouble from different
elements likely to congregate in Glasgow. Most of
these were rumour and speculation without firm basis.
In additional most information was as a result of
conversations overheard, supposition or second/third
hand accounts of possible intentions of groups and
individuals.

However it was clear from Friday onwards that, as in
previous years, and as earlier intelligence had
indicated, sizeable numbers of supporters would be
travelling from England utilizing various means of
public and private transport.

The pattern emerging indicated fans would arrive in
Glasgow from late on Friday gradually increasing in
volume as kick-off time approached. This was borne
out by events with supporters arriving

a)   on Friday with accommodation arranged;

b)   on Friday with no accommodation arrangements;

c)   from trains arriving during early hours of
     Saturday morning;

d)   in private cars, buses, vans etc throughout
     Saturday from early morning until „early
     afternoon.


                          SUMMARY

The following is a summary of the main events which
unfolded during the day.


     DIVISION

 Many English supporters made their way to the
 Barrowland area where licensed premises open at 0800
 hours

      0730      -    150 English fans awaiting public
                    house opening.

      0800      -    300 English fans in Barrowland.

      1000      -    400 English fans in vicinity of
                    Barrowland.

      1005      -   Disturbance in Norma Jeans Public
                     House (Eighty between English fans
                     no arrests).

      1025      -   Disturbances at Saracen Head Publi
                     House (All in order).
                           2

During the rest of the morning, 3 males (all English)
were arrested for Breach of the Peace in the east end.

English supporters began to drift back towards the
city centre or towards Hampden Park, and by 1400 few
English supporters remained in the area.


'A' DIVISION    PRE-MATCH ACTIVITIES

Throughtout the morning there was a steady build up of
fans - mostly Scottish - in the City Centre. These
fans were mainly arriving at the Central and Queen
Street Railway Stations. They were generally well
behaved although it was evident that substantial
amounts of alcohol were being consumed. The police
response to the fans was to keep them on the move and
encourage them to get to Hampden Park as early as
possible. As the day progressed there was sporadic
outbursts of disorderly behaviour which were quickly
dealt with by the police resulting in 37 arrests. A
problem did arise around 1400 hours when it was
learned that English fans were no longer being allowed
to enter Central Railway station for trains to Mount
Florida. The effect of this was that many English
fans had to walk to Hampden Park which caused several
large group disorders on the various bridges leading
to the south side of the city and no doubt exacerbated
the situation there. By 1500 hours the City Centre
was mainly clear of football fans and there were no
instances of disorder during the course of the match.

It is worthy of note that many English fans did not
have tickets for the match but indicated that they had
read that tickets would be on sale at Hampden right up
until kick-off.

'F* DIVISION   PRE-MATCH

From 0900 English fans began to arrive at Hampden to
purchase tickets. From 0900-1345 the division was
reasonably quiet with steady build up of fans
purchasing tickets. From 1345 until 1458 there were
17 serious disturbances recorded in approach routes to
Hampden - Victoria Road, Cathcart Road, prospecthill
Road, Queens Park, Aitkenhead Road, Myrtle Road,
Norfolk Street. There were 4 Code 21*s in Coplaw
Street, Langside Road at Langside Drive.

Arising from these incidents    arrests were made.

HAMPDEN PARK - INTERNAL POLICING

At 1405 hours English fans in possession of tickets
for Scottish Sections were identified and transferred
to 'P' Section.

At 1515 hours the East Reserve was committed to police
the fence between ’O' and ’P' Sections to prevent
confrontation between rival supporters. It was
noticeable that many English fans were not interested
in watching the game but taunted Scottish supporters.
Many of the Scots reciprocating had East of Scotland
and Edinburgh accents. There was constant movement
within sections of the terracing.
                           3

At 1558 hours disturbance in 'P' Section (English) led
to several arrests.

At the end of the match the English support was
delayed to allow the Scottish support to disperse.
Police resources were deployed in adequate numbers to
control this operation. The English fans were advised
in advance and accepted the situation.

At 1716 hours 'P' gates were opened and the English
support escorted to Mount Florida Railway Station
without problem.

At 1810 hours remaining resources at Hampen were stood
down.

There was a total of 96 custodies processed at Hampden
Park Police Office, 62 from inside and 34 from outside
the ground.

The Divisional Commander considers this was basically
a normal policing exercise within the ground without
significant incident during the match.

                      POST MATCH

'F' DIVISION

There were 7 large scale disturbances reported in the
vicinity of Hampden Park mainly caused by
confrontation resulting from Scottish fans lying in
wait for English supporters leaving the ground.


'A' DIVISION

All Anti-Disorder Patrols were in situ by 1630 hours
to await the arrival of fans from Hampden Park. The
majority of fans returned to the City Centre at
Central Railway Station and made their way through a
heavily policed area to Queen Street Railway Station
for departure to elsewhere in Scotland. On the
arrival of the first train carrying English fans at
the station there was a serious disturbance within the
station resulting in numerous Strathclyde Police
Officers entering the station to assist the British
Transport Police.

The problem of English fans returning to the City
Centre manifested itself on the arrival at around 1800
hours of approximately 700 fans on foot who were
intent on entering the Central Railway Station to
catch trains to the south. However, mainly due to the
fact that these fans had been held back by the police
at Hampden, their trains had already left. The
British Transport Police would not let them enter the
station.

Around the same time parts of Queen Street Railway
Station were closed causing some confusion amongst
mostly Scottish fans and about 1000 began to
congregate in and around George Square. Despite/
                            4

Despite the heavy police presence several spontaneous
outbursts of fighting between rival fans occurred
particularly in the Buchanan Street and St Vincent
Street/Place areas. With the assistance of Mounted
Branch and other available police officers a
containment exercise was brought into being and about
700 English fans were held within Royal Exchange
Square. They were segregated into those destined for
Central Railway Station and those with other means of
transport. Those not going to the Railway Station
were dispersed in small groups.

Around 1900 hours the remainder - approximately 600 -
were escorted by the police to Central Railway Station
where relief train had been provided to take them
south, departing at 1930 hours. This operation passed
off without incident. During the post match
activities 44 arrests were made and all Anti Disorder
patrols were "stood down" at 1915 hours, although many
were retained after that time with specific on going
incidents and arrests.

The main incidents of note within 'A' Division during
the day in addition to the sporadic outbreaks of
disorder were as follows

(a)   About 1230 hours a group of about 15 English
      supporters were refused entry to the Jack Diamond
      Public House, 259 Argyle Street (under Central
      Railway Bridge). Their response was to throw a
      "Thunderflash" explose device into the doorway of
      the Public House. This caused a loud bang and
      gave off a quantity of thick black smoke. Three
      tenders from the Fire Service attended but were
      not required. No damage was done to the premises
      and no persons was injured. The culprits were
      not traced.

(b)   About 1500 hours in Clyde Street two 16 year old
      Scottish youths approached a taxi carrying 3
      English supporters and threatened them with a
      hand gun. A chase by police officers ensued
      resulting in one youth being arrested in the
      grounds of the Nautical College. The other youth
      entered the River Clyde near to the High Court
      and began treading water in mid river - refusing
      to come out. Mr George Parsonage was summoned
      and after accidently hitting the youth with an
      oar eventually succeeded in getting the youth
      aboard his boat and thereafter into police
      custody. The handgun, which it transpired was an
      air pistol, was recovered.

(c)   About 0005 hours on Sunday 28 May a serious
      disturbance took place in Hope Street at Argyle
      Street, following an attack on a 29 year old
      Derby football fan who lost his right eye when he
      was struck on the face by a bunch of keys on a
      chain. He is presently detained at Gartnavel
      General Hospital. A 23 year old Scottish man has
      been arrested in connection with this incident.
ADDITIONAL COMMENTS

The following points emerge from the overall
operation:

1.   The creation of a Football Intelligence Unit
     proved to be a valuable initiative in the
     co-ordination, collation and dissemination of
     information. The FIU became a focus for
     operational divisions and units as well as
     establishing profitable links with other agencies
     and forces. The FIU was able to assist with
     provision of developing information, particularly
     from Friday onwards. This involved close liaison
     with "A", "E" and "F" Divisions, British
     Transport Police, Traffic Department and Support
     Unit as well as CID Specialist Services and Force
     Information.

2.   There is considerable scope for developing,
     expanding and improving the scope of a Unit of
     this nature for major events. The FIU was
     sufficiently flexible to adapt to changing
     demands, moving from purely
     intelligence-gathering to resource provision in
     conjunction with Operations. Events in the
     post-match scenario suggest further extension
     into an "Information Bureau" concept to act as a
     clearing-house for enquiries, to undertake
     collation of all related data and ease the
     pressure on divisional resources and force
     control.

3.   The police operation was resourced and managed in
     accordance with well rehearsed plans, based on
     long experience of such events. Positive action
     was taken to deal with outbreaks of disorder as
     the pattern of arrests indicates. Preventive
     action was effective and while the number of
     arrests was high this served to

     a)    indicate a positive approach to deal fully
           with disruptive behaviour;

     b)    remove troublemakers at an early stage
           perhap preventing more serious incidents
           later;

     c)    break-up pockets of disorder preventing
           large group reforming with serious
           repercussions.

4.   The value of close liaison with British Transport
     Police was highlighted in the provision of
     advance information about train arrivals,
     passenger complement and attitudes and by the
     ability to arrange a relief train to convey
     supporters who arrived in the City Centre after
     Special Trains had departed. However, closer
     collaboration to synchronise timing of trains to
     relate to traveller movements after the match
     would be appropriate. This would ensure the
     consequences of tactical action in one area are
     assessed in terms of their impact on other
     schedules.
There was a clear and distinct pattern
discernible from the travel patterns and
transport modes of English supporters. By
avoiding public transport and relying on private
and hired vehicles, it was possible for many to
escape police surveillance prior to their arrival
in Glasgow. Events on Saturday confirmed earlier
intelligence that several groups had pre-arranged
plans to meet at certain venues in Glasgow. This
indicated a degree of co-ordination and
organisation designed to frustrate police
resource planning. Police resources and plans
were, however, sufficient and flexible enough to
respond to developments.

The level of casualties recorded by hospitals
does not appear to be abnormal for an event of
this magnitude. Inside the ground 35 persons
were treated compared with 33 in 1987. Hospitals
treated about 300 casualties said to be football
related but typically this is difficult to
confirm.

The assistance provided by "spotters" from other
Forces was useful to both this Force and the
officers concerned. However, this is an aspect
which requires to be considered in the future to
maximise their potential. Some of the officers
are normally deployed in uniform whereas they
were fulfilling a surveillance "low profile" role
on this occasion. The officers made their
presence known to groups they identified and
several pieces of useful intelligence were
collected regarding individuals, activities,
vehicles etc.

The sale of tickets at the ground has been
criticised in several newspapers. From a police
standpoint, however, this was an advantage as a
deterrent to disorder by ticketless groups
roaming the streets adjacent to the ground. The
intention to sell was not widely publicised in
advance and 1,550 were sold to English supporters
on Saturday. It must therefore be assumed this
number would have arrived in any event and
presented a more worrying policing problem had
they not obtained access to the match. This is
perhaps consistent with the English syndrome of
turning up without tickets as happened at
Hillsborough. A total of 2,319 English
supporters occupied Section P.

In comparison 3,000 approx Scottish supporters
purchased tickets following local publicity
advertising availability on the day of the match.

TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT

The Traffic Department mounted a large scale operation to deal with traffic
direction, and route supervision to and from Hampden Park. Traffic officers
were engaged on a variety of duties including Road Patrol and Motor Cycle
Patrol.   The following officers were deployed within the city centre under the
command of Chief Superintendent Gilmour:-

CH SUPT   SUPT           C/INSP            INSP           SGT                 CONST    TOTAL

In addition, patrols operated on the M/A74 to deal with the heavy volume of
holiday traffic, including football supporters travelling to Hampden. The main
aim of this exercise was to relieve congestion and render assistance as
necessary to the travelling public.

On Friday evening and Saturday morning buses carrying English supporters were
stopped and checked on the M74 at the Truck stop, Lesmahagow. Drivers were
issued with a pass and route map to Hampden Park. The number of officers
involved in this exercise is not shown separately as they were not exclusively
dealing with the International Match.

BRITISH TRANSPORT POLICE


ACC MacKenzie coordinated the arrangements made by British Transport Police for
the International. This included the supervision of mainline stations and
escorting both Service and Special trains travelling in and out of Glasgow and
between Mount Florida and Central Stations.

Officers travelling on trains to Glasgow reported to the senior officer at
either Queen Street or Central Station who allocated them different tasks
within the station. The total number of British Transport officers directly
engaged in the operation was as follows

       SUPT       C/INSP   INSP     SGT        CONST   TOTAL

TRAFFIC DEPARTMENT

The operation carried out by the Traffic Department in relation to the
International had two separate strands. Firstly, as part of the arrangements
for policing the M/A74 over the holiday weekend, officers were directed to stop
and check coaches carrying English football supporters to Glasgow on Friday
evening/Saturday morning. Drivers were signalled to stop at thetruck stop on
the M74 at Lesmahagow and issued with a coloured pass and a route map. A total
of 14 vehicles were stopped in this manner and as a result 1 person was charged
with carrying unseated passengers in a van and 4 persons with carrying alcohol
on a coach.

Over the weekend traffic on the M/A74 was fairly heavy, particularly on
Saturday and at around 1300 hours there was a 9 mile tailback on the northbound
carriageway of the M74, extending into Dumfrieshire. A 3 mile tailback also
built up on the same carriageway extending southwards from Hamilton
interchange, due to ongoing roadworks.

The main proportion of the Traffic resources was deployed on the routes leading
to Hampden Park on Saturday and apart from route supervision and points duty,
officers were engaged on anti—violence activity. At the conclusion of the
match 22 traffic pointsmen were uplifted and deployed on foot patrol around
George Square in support of units monitoring a 600 strong contingent of English
supporters who missed scheduled trains. Several arrests were made by Traffic
Officers and Michael Forsyth MP, was provided with a VIP escort to and from the
stadium.

About 1400 hours on Saturday the rear windscreen of a Ford Granada Traffic car,
Regd No B758 YGB, was smashed by a bottle thrown from a crowd of Scottish
supporters while the crew were attending an outbreak of disorder at the
junction of Cathcart Road near to Cumming Drive. No arrests were made.
DAMAGE TO PROPERTY


Although some reports in the press suggest that widespread damage was caused
throughout the city as a result of clashes between rival supporters, there is
no evidence to support this. Enquiries with the divisions concerned revealed
that the only report of damage to property was shortly before kick-off when
4 windows in the Old Vic Public House were smashed by English supporters while
Scottish supporters were inside drinking.

However, 2 police vehicles were damaged viz:

1400 hours    Cathcart Road/Cumming Drive - rear windscreen of Traffic
              Department Ford Granada B758 YGB - no arrests.


1750 hours   Egllnton Court - windscreen of Ford Transit Personnel Carrier,
             E806 XDS - Support Unit - 4 arrests.

Hampden  Park   is  the  home ground of Queen's Park Football
Club which    is Scotland's oldest Association Football Club.
The  ground   is used as Scotland's National Football Stadium
and is also host to many prestige senior football matches.

The   present  Hampden  Park  Stadium was   opened  in  1903
following  a plan   by  Queen's  Park to "create the world's
finest football stadium" of its time.

Located   at   Mount   Florida on the residential south side of
the  city,    Hampden    Park is 3 miles from the city centre of
Glasgow.     King's   Park   and Mount Florida railway stations
nearby   the   stadium provide a direct rail link with Glasgow
Central   Station    and   regular 'bus services are routed from
the city centre through to Mount Florida.

Spectator   accommodation       at Hampden Park includes terracing
on  the west,     north     and   east   sides of the ground and an
all-seated    stand    to   the   south.   At the start of the 1989
season,     following        Lord      Justice    Taylor's   interim
recommendations     after    the Hillsborough Disaster, the crowd
capacity   of    the terracing was        reduced   by 15% leaving a
total   capacity    of    64,061.   The capacity of the all-seated
South Stand remained unchanged at 11,375.

The  terracing    consists of six autonomous fenced blocks and
is  further    divided   into  42 sections separated by aisles.
Permanent     crush barriers    are installed     throughout the
terracing.       The terracing is     separated from the playing
surface    by     a   retaining    wall  and weldmesh    fencing.
Emergency   gates    through  this fence are provided for each
section,   the   opening operation of which is controlled from
the "trackside” .

There    are     114    entrance turnstiles    to   Hampden  Park.
Turnstile    banks   exist   for  each  block   of   terracing    or
section   of   stand   and   once  inside the ground no transfer
between    blocks     is   manageable.        When    appropriate,
segregation     of   rival   supporters  within the   ground   is
im plemented.

A   major     football   match  at   Hampden     Park   involves   a
substantial   inter-agency operation.

Along    with   the  311  ground  stewards,  uniformed  police
officers   supervise   and monitor the turnstiles, patrol the
stadium   and   take  static points around the track.  CCTV is
available   for   police use.  Each area of the ground as well
as the turnstiles can be captured on video recording.
Prior   to     the match   police cordons are positioned outside
the   ground and routes to and from the stadium are monitored
and   patrolled.       To  assist  the  policing  operation  the
specialist      services  of  the  Mounted  and Dog Branches are
fully u t i 1i s e d .

Pre  and post-match         British      Transport  Police marshal and
supervise    football       fans     at   Glasgow  Central  and  Mount
Florida   railway stations between which a shuttle service of
"football    s p e cial” trains         is provided.     There  is no
segregation    of    rival      fans    aboard  these  trains, however
should   an  east     coast       team be involved it is possible to
have   "football     spec i a l s ” arriving directly at King's Park
Station   from     the east coast with Glasgow trains continuing
to use Mount Florida Station.

The  Criminal    Justice    (Scotland) Act 1980, Part V, applies
to Hampden    Park   as   a   "designated” sports ground, hence
alcohol,   controlled    containers,   fireworks  and drunks are
banned   from  the   ground.    The restrictions of the Criminal
Justice   (Scotland)    Act also apply to contract hire coaches
and    "football   special" trains     travelling  to  and  from
matches at Hampden.

A major    football  match at   Hampden  Park creates immense
disruption   in the routine of local residents.  Not least of
these   problems  is   that of traffic congestion and special
traffic   arrangements   are organised  and  executed  by the
Traffic Department.

The   policing   of   a major   football  match at Hampden Park
takes   account   of   public  order,  public  safety,  traffic
congestion   and    disruption of the local community - before,
during and after the playing period.
                       SCENARIO




TWO PROMINENT PREMIER LEAGUE FOOTBALL CLUBS HAVE BEEN
SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING A CUP FINAL, WHICH IS SCHEDULED
TO BE PLAYED AT HAMPDEN PARK ON SATURDAY WIT H A 1500
HOURS KICK-OFF.
                                SERIAL   1



DAY:         WEDNESDAY


Information      has   been   received   from  the  Metropolitan
Police   that    a large group of English football supporters
affiliated    to   one   of   the   Clubs,  intend  to travel to
Glasgow   overnight     on   Friday   to attend the match.  Most
will   be using public transport, mainly British Rail.        It
is understood      that    the majority    of  them do not have
tickets   and    those who do, have them for various areas of
the stadium.

Intelligence   indicates    that members   of this group have
been   responsible   for   major disorder at various football
grounds   throughout   the   UK  during  the  course  of  the
season.

A number    of   forged tickets have been intercepted by the
Police,  having been allegedly sold from a public house in
the  east end of Glasgow.    It is not known how many are in
circulation    and the forged tickets recovered refer to the
west terracing.




QU E S T I O N S :

(a)        What    enquiries can    be progressed to substantiate
            this information?

(b)         What       arrangements would you progress regarding the
            g r o u p ’s travel to Glasgow?

(c)        What     agencies  and   specialists       could   offer
            assistance in this situation?

(d)        How    will  this information     affect   the pre-Match
            policing operation?
                             SERIAL   2



DAY:   THURSDAY


Tickets   for   the match have been in great demand and they
have  all   been   distributed/sold.   Several articles have
appeared   in   the media regarding complaints from fans re
the  non-availability of tickets and the fact that tickets
can  now   only   be  obtained from "touts" at very inflated
prices.

Intelligence   indicates   that  ticket ’t o u t s ’ will have an
abundance   of  tickets   available on the day and this will
obviously   encourage   supporters without tickets to attend
at Hampden.

Protest  calls are being made to the S.F.A.      to take action
to eliminate this practice.




QUESTIONS:


(a)     What   options are available to stop this practice?

(b)     How    will  this    affect   the   pre-Match   planning
         arrangements?

(c)     What   assistance could the media offer?
                             SERIAL    3



DAY:   SATURDAY MORNING


Press  coverage  on   Saturday highlights local r e s i d e n t s ’
complaints  re access, egress on Match Days.  This prompts
local  shopkeepers in Victoria Road to demand extra police
attention that day.

In addition a main water pipe has burst on Aikenhead Road
between  Prospecthill   Road   and   Myrtle   Park.   The Water
Department  have   successfully    switched off the water but
the Roads Department have informed the Police that due to
subsidence   both   carriageways   will   require   to   remain
closed  for  at   least   24  hours.     Pedestrian access is
limited but possible.




QUESTIONS:


(a)      What effect     will this    have   on   your   policing
         arrangements?

(b)      What steps    would you take to alleviate the flow
         of  both normal and football traffic, both pre and
         post Match?

DAY:   SATURDAY 1345 HOURS


The   Duty   Officer,    Force Control, has been informed that
about   1330    hours   today there was a large scale disorder
at Harthill Service Station.       Local officers who attended
have   been   told    that rival football supporters under the
influence    of   alcohol   were the cause of the disturbance.
No   arrests were made but a number of innocent people have
been   injured.       The football supporters left the Service
area in several coaches en route to Glasgow.




QUESTIONS:


(a)    As  Duty Officer, Force Control,    how are you going
        to deal with this incident?

(b)    What  onus,   if any,  has been placed on the ’bus
        operators  regarding  this  type  of incident, and
        what  are  the  wider implications on the policing
        arrangements of the event?

(c)    What    other   problems   could  non-contract   hire
        Public   Transport  Operators   normally  expect   on
        Match days?

DAY:     SATURDAY 1445 HOURS


The   Police    "Controller” watching     the  CCTV monitors is
aware   that    the  ground   is nearing capacity.    There are
thousands    of   fans   still outside the west terracing near
the   ticket    checking   area.    There   are reports of fans
climbing the wall trying to gain entry to the ground.

The   terracing  is near   capacity  and outside the ground
there   appear  to be more supporters than the terracing is
capable of holding.

It would   appear  that  fans  have  grouped together in a
concentrated  effort  to  overcome  the Police.  Resources
are stretched to the limit.




QUESTIONS:

(a)       What courses of action are open to you?

(b)       What  are   the   manpower       implications   of   these
         actions?

(c)       What other assistance   is available to you?

DAY:     SATURDAY,   HALF TIME



CCTV   cameras within the Police Control Room indicate that
a major     disturbance     is occurring in the north terracing
near   the   segregated     area.   A large gap suddenly appears
in   the   crowd   and   traces    of   smoke   can   be  observed.
Officers    at   the   scene   inform you that there appears to
have   been    several   CS   canisters discharged.      The gas is
affecting    the   entire    north    terracing,    and is drifting
into   the   covered west terracing.       Weather conditions are
not assisting in the dispersal of the gas.




QUESTIONS?


(a)     What   are your priorities?

(b)     What   First Aid facilities are available?

(c)     How   are    you   going   to   control   the   evacuated
         crowd?

DAY:   SATURDAY   (POST-MATCH)


Despite  all  the   pre-Match  planning  there were   still
numerous  serious   acts  of  disorder  directly associated
with the Cup Final.

A  total  of  250 persons   have been arrested for various
offences.    A decision   has  been  made   to detain them
pending their appearance at Court on Monday.




QUESTIONS:


a)      Where  are  these  persons to be detained and what
        are the implications of their detention?


(b)     How will   this  affect   the   operation of Glasgow
        Sheriff  Court  on Monday.    What arrangements will
        be implemented?

PS THOMPSON,          the     place was           cleared and          closed.        No    complaints       were

made and neither were                  there any arrests.                  A very large number               of Notts

F o r re s t   fans had been drinking at the                        premises,         but with very          little

trouble.

The    serial      were      d e s i g n a t e d to     proceed to H i l l s b o r o u g h ground just

prior to kick             off,    in order         to en-bus and be back-up for a ny th in g

that might          occurr.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 5 0 p m    (1450)       POL PS T H O M P S O N had rejoined myself and

P OL PC L I G HT ON and           it was         then,       over his    radio,       that we began to hear

of t rouble at the L ep pi ng s Ln end of the stadium.                                      We began to make

our way to H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground,                   messages     (confused),         continuing       to be

h ea rd over        the    radio.          We got a lift           in one of the Police              transits and

e nt er e d the grounds             on the Pen is to ne Rd side,                    where we were       g at hered

together.           At this       time,         I could see down the                entry way onto       the

g ro u nd      itself and        could also            see    civilians      carrying        people,    on what

a p p e a r e d to be a d v e r t i s i n g       hoardings.           After       some minutes,       our    serial,

in company wit h several                    dozen other Officers,                   were    d ir ected to go onto

the    field and once there                     to face       the N o r t / Stand.          It w ould appear at

this     time      that    thoughts         were still          of a / p i t c h    invasion.

We went        o n t o the     pitch a nd while               lining    up facing          the N orth S t a nd I

could see several                hundreds         of s pectators a c t u a l l y on the              pitch and

carrying         people on ho ar di ng s               towar,d/s                   j> FoMj^es^t end of the

pitch.         Once we were          lined up a buse,              shouts      and missiles were             thrown

at us from s pectators                 in the N orth S tand a nd                   pointing    towards       the

L ep p i n g s Ln end of the ground.

M a t t e r s as    far as orders               were    concerned became             very    confused at this

stage.         From a continous                 stream of voices           over      the    radio,   s ud de nl y

t here was         just    silence.             Looking a ro u n d me        I could see that           it was

          conscious       and    I m a n a g e d to find out             f/om him where           he was     hurt.       He

          a p p e a r e d to have head,            back and arry injuries.               He was      placed onto a

          him until       he was     taken a way by the a m b u la nc e                service      (a pp ro xi ma te ly

          half    to three       quarters          of an hour after             coming    into the gymnasium).                     I

          t hen went a cross         to anot he r         casualty,        relieving a nurse holding an                       IV

          drip,     until     he too was           taken by ambulance.

          At this      time a POL PS came               round asking            for   people      to form a detail              to

          go    into the Lep pi ngs Ln stand to                       collect    d ec ea se d    casualties       still

          b el i ev e d to be     in there.            After a wait         of some time,           while       the ground

          was    being    cleared,      we went         out       onto the football             field,    but    it was

          clear    that any       r emaining         bodies        had been      cleared.         We were       then

          d ir e c t e d to wait     in the N or th Stand,                with other Officers a l r e a d y

          there,     until      d i rected to do otherwise.

          At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6pm    (1800)      we were        d ir ec te d to stand down.              I

          t h e r ef o re made my way to C l ay wh ee ls                 to await      transport         back to

              F u rt he r    to my       previous       statement     on page 3 I m e n t i o n a young male who

               I tried to          resuscitate.

              When        I first saw this y ou th he was                on the g/ass        lying as you        look from

               the       pitch,    to the      right    of the     right hapd goal         p o s t , outside     the six

              y ard box but             inside    the    penalty     box. / H i s     head was pointing towards

              the        centre of the         pitch and his         fe^t     towards Leppings Ln.          The

               general       i mpression         I got was      th^t his head w ou ld be          level w it h the

               p enalty spot.

              He was w it h two            civilians ab6ut           the same age as he           was   that being      18-

              20.         I can't       remember w h a y they        looked      like.

               I can recall             that   the   inured      y o ut h was white.        He has m o u s e y    coloured

              hair.         He was       clean s h ^ e n    I got the        impre ss io n he was       quite    tall

                  trousers.            He had a white T shij^Tor              light    top.

                  My e fforts were useless an*Kas                    I said    in my    previous   statement    I left

                  him.      He was        dead.     I jrfoved to an injured man.

                  I left the dead y outh w i t h the two                  civilians      I had the   i mpression that

pyJltPjtf * Uj[hey k new h i m » faut they were in shock,                       they did say the dead      lad

                  had been            like that    for some       time.

                  I never went            back    to that   spot     on the    pitch and      I never saw his    body

                  in the gym.             I was a s s i st in g    in another    part.

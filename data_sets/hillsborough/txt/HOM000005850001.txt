           Dear Mr Addison,

                                             HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

           As you know South Yorkshire are to take legal advice on the issue and on Lord
           Ferrers’ letter of the 27th June a copy of which was sent to our Chairman.

           The Authority’s Finance andManagement Committee considered the matter at its
           meeting on the 10th August and in view of the increasing concern here at the
           continued costs to the West Midlands itis felt appropriate now to render an
           interim account to South Yorkshire as         suggested by Lord Ferrers to be
           considered by them along with their further advice.

           I should nevertheless like it clearly understood by the Home Secretary that the
           rendering of the account to South Yorkshire is without prejudice to our view
           that the Home Office should meet the full costs of the work undertaken by the
           West Midlands Force and to the present and future claims of this Authority
           against the Home Office.

           A copy of this interim account is enclosed and I hope you and South Yorkshire
           may soon agree which of you should reimburse us our full costs.

                                              Yours sincerely,




                                                    Clerk

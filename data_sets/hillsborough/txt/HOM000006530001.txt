COSTS OF ENQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE


You have received a copy of Mr Addison's report of his meeting
with the Clerk and the Financial Officer of the South Yorkshire
Police Authority of 18 May.


2.   We should be looking at all the options for meeting the
costs. I still believe that the best arrangement would be to
channel any additional expenditure through South Yorkshire by way
of additional grant. Nevertheless, we shall be looking at the
implications of the Home Office carrying the costs as Central
Government expenditure from Vote 3. I do not think that at this
stage we are likely to get from the Chief Secretary, in response
to a request for supplementary provision, anything more than a
requirement to find the costs from within our existing programme.
I have asked you, therefore, to establish whether the costs would
count as running costs or non-running costs, and to look at the
effects of meeting them (I understand the current estimate is
Â£4m) from within existing Vote 3 provision. We should also look
at the effect of a subvention from Vote 2 as I suspect that
Treasury would be likely to press us on this.

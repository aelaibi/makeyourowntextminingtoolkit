1 INTROE~3CTION

i.i   Following an incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
      Football Club’s (SWFC) Hillsborc~ Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
      request of Mr M S Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
      Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
      Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the HSE team
      investigating the incident foll~wing correspondence between the Court of
      Inquiry and the Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hanm~r.
1.2 ~ report contains details of examinations performed on site and in the
    laboratory. ~he work was carried out by me and by other staff of HSE
    working on my instructions and under my general supervision.

2 SURVEY OF P~S 3 AND 4

2.1 Using the drawings prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, 1340/02 and 03,
    and comparing with figures stated in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
    1986, the following assessments were made.
2.2   The heights of crush barriers should be 1.02m to 1.12m with a preferred
      height of l.lm. In Pen 3 four out of five barriers do not conform. In
      Pen 4 six out of nine barrie/s do not conform.

2.3   ¯ he alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace should
      form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. Of the four ’paths of
      gaps’ in Pen 3, two do not conform. Of the eleven ’paths of gaps’ in Pen
      4, one does not conform.
2.4 Gaps in the line of crush barriers should be at least l.lm and not more
    than 1.4m in width. In Pen 3, four out of five gaps do not conform. In
    Pen 4, nine out of ten gaps do not conform.
2.5 For a terrace slope of approximately 14° the interpolated maximum
    horizontal distance between barriers is 3.9m. In Ben 3 only one spacing
    does not conform. In Pen 4 only two spacings do not conform.
2.6   Gates or other access points should have a minimum width of l.lm. ~e
      gate to Pen 3 has a clearance width of 0.81 to 0.82m and the gate to Pen 4
      has a clearance width of 0.77 to 0.79m. Both therefore do not conform.

2.7   The aim is for every spectator on the terraces to be within 12m of a
      gangway or exit. If the perimeter gaps are not considered as exits then
      apprcydmately 40% of the spectators in Pens 3 and 4 will not be within
      12 metres of an exit.

3 EXAMINATION OF THE ~ROKEN BARRIER - NO 124A

3.1   Barrier 124A was ~ by HSE staff at Hillsborc~ Football Ground on
      17 April 1989. Various parts of this barrier and 3 core samples of
      concrete were taken to the Sheffield Laboratory on 24 April 1989 for
      detailed ~.
3.2   It was deduced that barrier 124A had consisted of a continuous horizontal
      tube, made from wrought iron, and four vertical supports each made from
      two len~ of steel angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset
                                          1
      plate. Five of the eight support feet were reinforoed by additional angle
      sections which appeared to be let into the concrete terrace steps. Two of
      the rear support legs were braced by further angle sections. A
      rscc~struction is shown in Figure i. ~he barrier had failed apparently by
      partial collapse and fracture of sL~pports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the
      horizontal tube at supports 2, 3 and 4, as shown in Figure 2. ~%e portion
      of the tube which had been located between s~ 2 and 3 had been bent
      uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 133m~ at midspan. ~he
      portion of the tube which had been located between supports 3 and 4 had
      been bent uniformly to give a ~ permanent deflection of 200~m at
      midspan. Barrier 124A was estimated to be approximately 60 years old,
      although it had received a number of modifications during its lifetime.
3.3   ~%e tensile strength of the wrought iron tube material was measured at
      365MPa (23.6 tonf/in~) with an estimated elastic limit of 150MPa
      (9.7 tcnf/in~) . ~%e tensile stre~ of the mild2steel angle used for
      the supports was measured at 360MPa (23.3 tonf/in ) with a yield stress
      of 288MPa (18.6 tonf/in~).
3.4   ¯ he tube fractures had occuzref in areas which had been located under the
      metal straps designed to retain the tube. At these locations the tubes
      had not been painted, and the tube wall thicknesses, IKmninally 4.5~n, had
      been reduced significantly by corrosion. At the fracture surface
      corresponding to support 2 the residual thickness of the tube wall was
      found to vary from 0.4~m to 4.4m~ around the circumference. Similarly at
      the fracture surface corresponding to support 3 the wall thickness was in
      the range 1.6m to 4.5~n. At support 4, however, there was evidence that
      the tube wall had been perforated by co--ion at two locations producing
      holes which wDuld have been approximately 10~u and 20~u in diameter before
      the collapse. Elsewhere, ~ the fracture co~ to support 4,
      the wall thickness was in the range l.Ixmn to 4.5ran.
3.5   In general the appearar~e of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
      iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. Fracture
      of the tube adjaoent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on th~ uphill
      side of the barrier at a position approximately 90° from top dead centre.
      ~he other tube fractures had suffered some post-failure damage and the
      origins were not readily identifiable.
3.6   Tne failed supports had been corroded, particularly at the junction with
      the concrete steps and/or reinforcement angles. In these regions residual
      thicknesses in the range 3.1~ - 5.9n~ were measured ccmpared with a
      ncmdnal thickness of 6.3~n.
3.7   large amounts of metal had been lost by co--ion from supports 3 and 4
      near, what would have been, the original junctions between the support
      feet and the terrace. In one case (rear leg support 4) a ligament of
      metal 8n~ wide was all that remained of the original angle section (50 x
      50n~). On two of the four feet this region had been reinforced by the
      addition of a length of metal angle which had been bolted on top of the
      original angle from which the support had been made. ~he height of the
      concrete terrace had been raised at some stage and this had conoealed the
      previous co--ion damage. ~he appearance of the concrete cores,
      extracted from near the support feet, was consistent with this
      Qbservation.
3.8   Calculations to establish the force required to cause the collapse of
      barrier 124A, and the collapse sequenc~ are currently underway.

4     INVESTIGATION OF %~]RNSTILES AT ~4E LEPPINGS IANE ]~]D

4.1     On 25 April 1989 HSE staff made tests on turnstiles at the Leppings lane
        end of the stadium to investigate how the application of a force to a
        ’gate’ affected the release of a turnstile. On 28 April 1989 tests were
        made to assess the accuracy of the cc~ised system for counting and
        recording the admissions through the turnstiles. Calculations were made
        to oumpare the average admission ~ts of turnstiles serving the
        designated zones of the stadium. Ommts of people passing through the
        turnstiles A to G were made from video recordings.
        ~4E EFFECT OF A HORI~ P~RCE PJSHING ON ~4E ’GATE’ OF A ~ORNSTILE
4.2     Turnstiles C to G appeared to be of the same pattern, whilst turnstiles A
        and B were of a different pattern. In the tests a known force measured by
        a load cell was applied to the ’gate’ of the turnstile. Standard test
        weights were then placed gently on the pedal until the spindle was
        released. ~he tests showed that turnstiles C to G were likely to be more
        difficult to release than turnstiles A and B.
4.3     A turnstile operator having a weight of 750 N (12 stone) or less might
        have difficulty in releasing turnstiles in the group C to G if a force of
        480 N (ii0 ibf) or more was applied to the "gates’. ~he same operator
        might have difficulty in releasing turnstiles A and B if a force of 1340 N
        (300 ibf) or more was applied to the ’gates’.
        THE ACO3RACY OF THE (X]M~JIZ~T~qED SY~ FOR ~ AND REODRDING
        ADMISSIONS
4.4     Turnstiles were d%ecked by rotating the "gate’ a known number of times and
        then recording the count measured in the control roan. Tests of
        turnstiles in the group 9 to 16 indicated that they recorded the correct
        number of admissions.
4.5     Tests indicated that turnstiles A, B, C, D, E and F were likely to record
        the correct number of admissions. In my opinion turnstiles A to F, as a
        group, would indicate the correct number of admissions to within 1%.
4.6     Tests indicated that there could be a persistent error in the recorded
        number of admissions through turnstile G. It is my opinion that this
        turnstile might oontinuously register less than the correct number of
        admissions during a period of operation. It was concluded that the error
        was prcbably attributable to the roller of the roller-plunger micro-switch
        fitted to this turnstile only just making contact with the upper boss of
        each "gate’.
4.7     Additional detectors were installed across each turnstile passageway at
        positions above the gates. Examination of these devices indicated that
        same appeared to be disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been
        cut.
        AVERAGE ~IONS REQUIRED ~ ~E ~NSYILES
4.8 By ref~ to Eastwood & Partners Drawing No 8945/IA dated 16/4/87
    figures were obtained for their estimates of the capacity of the various
                                            3
      zones of the stadium. On 28 April 1989 HSE staff surveyed the outside
      perimeter of the stadium to identify the numbers of turnstiles used by
      eac~ zone. Six groups of turnstiles served the six zones of the st~__dium.
      ~hese are stmmarised in the following Table.

4.9   ~he three groups of turnstiles having the highest average admission
      ~ts were sited at the ieppings Lane end of the stadium, i.e. West
      Terrace Standing, North Stand Seating and West Stand Seating.
4. i0 ~he average admission ~t of the turnstiles serving the West
      Terrace was the highest for any zone of the stadium. It was almost 3.5
      times the lowest average admission requirement whic~ is that for the South
      Stand Uncovered Seating and approximately 2.9 times the average admission
      requirement for Spion Kop.
      COUNTING OF PEOPLE ~ ~ %~qNSI~LES ATO G FRCM VIDEO
      RECORDINGS
4.11 ~he video recordings used for the counting were delivered by West Midlands
      Police and were identified BJH2/E/Part i, PJH2/E/Part 2, PJH2/E/Part 3,
      B3~2/F/Part i, RJH2/F/Part 2, RJH2/F/Part 3. ~hey showed the exits of
      turnstile booths A to G frum approximately 12.55pm until 3.10pm on
      15 April 1989. Tne continuous ref~ timings on the video recordings
      were with respect to the start of eac~ recording, and not to British
      &Amm~_r Time (BST), but the relationship between the recording times and
      BST was determined frum tb~ observation of specific events in conjunction
      with West Midlands Police.
4.12 ~he method of counting used a mi~ and specially developed
      program. A push-button was depressed every time a person was seen to
      emerge frum an identified turnstile booth and the crmputer recorded the
      signal and its time. People emerging from turnstiles A and B were counted
      together because it was not always possible to diff~tiate between
      people emerging frum these individual turnstiles.
4.13 The analysed data provided the relationship between the total number of
      people seen to emerge frum turnstiles A to G and the time that they
      emexged. Figure 3 shows the total number of people that had emerged frum
      turnstiles A to G over the relevant period of time.
                                         4
4.14 I was informed by West Midlands Police that the turnstiles were opened
    before the start of the video recordings. At approximately 2.00pro just
    over 2,000 people had been counted and at 2.52pm this number had risen to
    app~tely 6,000. ~he final total count was 7247 people.
    The HSE count totals are ~ised in the following table and ccmpared
    with the SWFC cumputer print-cut, taken on 15 April 1989, a copy of which
    was provided by West Midlands Police.

    * See paragraph 4.15

    Turnstiles A and B, D and E and F and G had crmmon exits, and hence the
    HSE and SWFC counts of these pairs of turnstiles have been combined.
4.15 Parag~ 4.6 of this report referred to a persistent error in the count
     obtained from turnstile G. ~his could result in no signal being sent to
     the crmputer even though a person had passed thr~ the turnstile and
     could account for the discrepar~y between the HSE count of 2019 for F plus
     G and the SWFC count of 1632.
4.16 Based on the assunl~tion that the SWFC ccmputer printout accurately
    recorded A to E and that the HSE ocunt for F and G was less than the
    number who actually passed through F and G by a similar percentage to that
    obtained from A to E, the estimate for the total number of people that
    entered thr~ turnstiles A to G is 7494. In my opinion the actual
    number is unlikely to have exceeded this value by more than 2%, i.e. 7644.
4.17 ~he rate at which people were cc~nted thr~ all the turnstiles is shown
     in Figure 4. The rate is for a 3 minute time period and shows the number
     of people per hour per turnstile. The rate increases rapidly at about
     1.40pm and remains fairly oonstant between 2.05pro and 2.50pm. The mean
     rate for this period was about 660 people per turnstile per hour. Between
     2.55pa and 3.00pm the rate ~ and reached a maximum of abotrt 1150
     people per turnstile per hour. %%ds increased rate coincides with the
     time Gate C was opened and could therefore be a result of decreased crowd
     pressure allowing a faster flow through the turnstiles.
4.18 If the rate of 660 had been maintained from 2.50pm onwards and no gates
     had been opened I estimate that it would have taken until about 3.40pm to
     bring the total number of people admitted through turnstiles A to G to
     i0, i00. (The quoted capacity of the West Terrace standing area. )

5 ESIUIMATE OF PEOPLE AEMITYED ~ IC41TE C’ TAKE~ FROM VIDEO RECORDINGS
5.1   A video recording labelled R3B2, delivered by West Midlands Police, was
      used for this analysis. It was copied by HSE Dh~ and a timing
      ref~ added. ~ copy was given the identification DFI/B. It showed
      the exits of turnstile booths A to G, Gate C and the general area on the
      West Stand side of these turnstiles. ~e oontinuous reference timings on
      the video recording related to the start of the tape and not to BST.
5.2   I was told by West Midlands Police that, following scrutiny of
      synchronised video recordings, the ’First Opening’ of Gate C had occurred
      at approximately 14.48pm for a duration of ~ 30 seconds. I was also told
      that the ’Second Opening’ of Gate C had started at ~14.52pm and finished
      at ~ 14.58pm, a duration of~ 5% minutes. A ’~lird Opening’ then occurred
      apprcydmately one minute later when the gate was opened for approximately
      8 minutes, sufficient to allow the entry of people in single file.
5.3   The method of assessment for the first two cpeninc3s was to count the
      number of people passing a refe!e/K~ line for a period of 3 seconds and
      then to repeat this process at intervals of no greater than 15 seconds.
      At times when the rate was seen to vary rapidly, and for the whole of the
      ’First Opening’, samples were taken more frequently than at 15 seconds.
      Figure 5 shows a graph of the number of people who entered through Gate C
      during the ’Second Opening’.
5.4   Estimates of accuracy are based on the possibility of missing one in ten
      of the people passing the referenc~ line and the unlikelihood of missing
      more than two in ten.
5.5   ~he estimate of the number of people passing through Gate C during the
      ’Second Opening’ based on the counting was 1800 but this should be
      regarded as a imu. The best estimate would be 10% higher than 1800
      i.e. about 2000, and in my opinion the actual number was unlikely to be
      greater than 2200.
5.6   ~he estimate of the number of people passing through Gate C during the
      ¯ First Opening’ based on the counting was 130 ~ this should again be
      regarded as a minimum. ~he best estimate would be about 150, and in my
      opinion the actual number was unlikely to be greater than 180.
5.7   In the "Third Opening’ entries were much slower and a more accurate count
      was possible. A total of 90 were counted over a period of about 8
      minutes, and in my opinion the actual number is unlikely to be greater
      than i00.
5.8 ~he foll~ng table is a ~ of the estimates of both Gate C and
    turnstile A to G entries.

6 ESTIMATES OF THECAPACITYOFTHEWESTTERRACE

6.1   Drawing 1340/02A by Ralph Brade & Associates gives dimensions of Pens 3
      and 4. Both Pens are shown as being 13. im deep; Pen 3 is shown as being
      14.350m wide and Pen 4 as being 14.645m wide. Based on these dimensions
      the areas are 188.0sq m and 191.8sq m.
6.2 The 1986 "Guide to Safety at Sports ~" states
      "222 The extreme allowances for packingdensityare as follows:
                a.   54 persons per i0 square metreswhentheterraceor
                     viewing slope is in good condition (as set out in
                     ~8); and
               Do    27 persons per i0 square me~ when it materially
                     deviates frGm the ~ed guidlines, so as to
                     oonstitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
                     packed.
      223    It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures whez~
      oonditions fall between the two extremes. When ..."
6.3   If 54 people per i0 sq m is assumed as the allowable packing density
      for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and the
      capacity of Pen 4 is 1036 making a total of 2051 for the camb~
      area.
6.5   The above calculations of capacity m~st therefore be assumed to be
      the maximum allowable capacity for this terrace area. The guide also
      gives examples of how this maximum capacity figure should be reduced
      when certain factors do not conform to the guide. Exaa~01es include
      a)       When the st~ of crush barriers oonform with the
               guidelines but the spacing of such barriers does not ...
      b)       When perimeter wall and crush barriers do not cQmply with
               st~ or spacing ~ ...
      c) When the positioning and width of gangways do not meet with the
         ~tior~ of Chapter 8 ....
6.6   It also states that when crush barriers do not meet the guidelines on
      st~ ..... but are well constructed, oonsideration may be given to
      allowing a lower packing density figure for the purpose of calculation.

7 EST!~ATES OF THE PACKING DENSITIES OF THE WEST TERRACE
7.1   West Midlands Police provided me with several albums of l~phs, taken
      at Hillsborou~ on 15 April 1989, and several of these photographs were
      identified as providing material for the estimation of the numbers in
      Pen 3. Enlargements of photographs PRI/7A and PRI/8A were provided by
      West Midlands Police and these two photographs were analysed in detail.
      The time identification marking on both these I~ was 15.03.
7.2   ~be method of assessment entailed mounting the photographs on an
      electronic digitising table (Digitiser) and then marking the head of each
      person who was discernible. ~be Digitiser was linked to Cumputer Aided
      Drafting software and the act of marking each person on the photograph
      enabled the physical points on the photograph to be placed on an
      electronic grid which could then be displayed, under cc~ oontrol, on
      a VEU screen or printed cut on a ~cs plotter. Actual counting of the
      number of those identified within a specified area was carried cut
      autnm~tically and no allowance was made for people that were hidden from
      view.
7.3   On 22 May 1989 photographs were taken of the empty pens by the same
      photogr-dpher, using the same camera and camera position, enabled the
      boundaries and barrier locations in Pen 3 to be transposed onto the
      computer image of photogr~ taken on 15 April 1989. PRI/7A and PRI/8A
      oovered about 75% of Pen 3 and it was assumed that the density of people
      in the remaining 25% was similar to that in the photographed area of
      Pen3.
7.4   The estimated headoount for the whole of Pen 3 was 1408 people but areas
      at the front of the pen were masked by people outside the pen and heads in
      the area for%ral~ of the first barriers w~re generally less discernible
      than those behind the first barrier; 1408 is therefore a minimum estimate.
7.5   ~be results from a mere detailed analysis, in which Pen 3 was sub-divided
      into four rows, bounded by the perimeter fence and the rows of crush
      barriers, are ~ised in the Table overleaf. Figures 6, 7 and 8
      illustrate the four rc~s and the numbers oounted in rc~s 2, 3 and 4.

8.1   I was asked to make estimates of the number of people which could have
      gathered outside the turnstiles at Leppings Lane but within the outer
      perimeter gates. Tne area between the leppings lane End turnstiles and
      the outer perimeter gates is illustrated in Figure 9. ~ne Figure is based
      on Ral~h Brade & Associates’ Drawing No 1340/04. ~he area has been
      sub-divided into three separate areas (Area i, Area 2 and Area 3) and the
      approximate area of each has been calculated by scaling frcm the Drawing.
8.2 ~he number of people that could stand in the areas has been calculated
    using a packing density of 8 people per square metre and also using i0
    people per square metre; the estimates are tabulated overleaf.

9 SUMMARY

9.1   Various aspects of the crush barriers and perimeter gates in Pens 3 and 4
      did not conform to the ’Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986’.
9.2   Xhe broken barrier, 124A, was made from wrought iron tube and mild steel
      angle section. Both tube and angle sections were heavily corroded in some
      areas. Calculations on the mechanism and force required to cause the
      collapse of the barrier are proceeding.
9.3   ExBmination of turnstiles A-G indicated that there was a fault in the
      counting mechanism of G. From assessment of video recordings, a best
      estimate of people entering through A-G was 7494, with a maximum of 7644.
9.4   If Gate C had not been opened, HSE estimate that it would have taken until
      about 3.40pm to admit i0,i00 people through turnstiles A to G.
9.5   Assessment of the numbers of turnstiles allocated to various zones of the
      stadium revealed that the average admission ~t of the turnstiles
      serving the West Terrace was the highest for any zone of the stadium, and
      was approximately 2.9 times the requirement for Spion Kc~.
9.6   HSE’s best estimate of the total number of people who entered the
      during the three c~enings of Gate C was 2240 with a maximum of 2480.
9.7 HSE’s best estimate of the total number of people who entered the ground
    through gate C (3 openings) and turnstiles A-G was 9734, with a maximum
    value of 10124.
9.8   Even if the strength and spacing of the barriers had complied with the
      ’Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986’, HSE’s calculations showed that
      the capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was 1015 and 1036 respectively.
9.9   Since the barriers did not comply in all respects with the Guide (see 9.1)
      the estimated capacity of Pens 3 and 4 would be less than in 9.7 above.
9. i0 ~be best estimate, based on photographs, of the number of people in Pen 3
      at 15.03 was 1576.
9.11 Xhe number of people who could be a~ted theoretically between the
      perimeter gates and the turnstiles at leppings lane was estimated to be
      3880 and 4850 for crowd packing densities 8.0 and i0.0 per square metre
      respectively.

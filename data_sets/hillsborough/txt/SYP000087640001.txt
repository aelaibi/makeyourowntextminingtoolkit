              p reventing         fans   climbing        over    the front     fence.       I saw also        fans and

               ‘ences and also           up    into the stand above,

       here were more and more                  people getting          on the      pitch.        I realised

      s om ething    had gone badly wrong when                    I saw people         pushing       up and down
y .
      on the     chest     of an old man as he lay on the                        pitch.     They even tu al ly

%     put s omething           over    his face.         I c a n ’t give any        real    de sc ri pt io n of

      this man or any            person       I saw on the        pitch who was           being    treated.

      As   the scene unfolded,                I saw fans and Police               taking a dv er ti si ng        boards

      to   carry bodies          off    the    pitch.

      At one     point     I    remember      some Liverpool          fans       running from the Leppings

      Lrt end towards           the Forrest        fans,      wKwere     all     shouting      for   them to go

      back,    but then whlftk^I thought was a 1 i ne’

      put across        the field a n o N J a e y s t o p p e d .

      We were     not    told what was going               on but     a fart closeby had a             portable

      radio and so we were able                  to listen to         that and      it started        to be

      announced      that       people    had died at          the m a t c n >

      We all     stood watchirtgNy h a t           was   going on,       till a       b     3 . 4 5 pm ( 1545>

                                                       roun       both to        'phone home       if possible

      and to get a drink from a local                      shop.      I w al k e d out      into Leppings,          but

      could not get a            ’phone as so m any other               people      had the same          idea.

      E v e n t u a l l y a lady      in a house      let me ttse her            'phone and       I got    in

      touch wi t h my parents.                 I then     intended      va get      the drinks and go back

      to join my brother,               but    it was    th      that

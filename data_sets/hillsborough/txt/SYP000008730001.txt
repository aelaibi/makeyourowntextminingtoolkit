A   few     minutes             maybe       five          minutes           we     got    a    radio          message          but       we    couldn'

understand                what    it     said,            we     tried       to       confirm        what          was    said       but       couldn*

That      was        before       3    pm       (1500          hrs).




1 stood          at       the    door       and       was       waiting            for    a    patient,                that    what       we

assumed          the       radio       message                was     and    I saw        a    lot       of       Policemen          rushing

the    pitch          and       Police          by    them.            I began           to    make       my       way    along          the      pitch

towards          the       Leppings             Ln    end,           about       to    the     half       way          line,       I then

realised             that       there       were          a    number        of       people        injured             and    decided            to     go

back      to     the       First A i d           room,           where       there        were       patients             beginning               to

The    first          patients           to      arrive              were    not       physically                 injured          but    in      shock

outside          the       First       Aid       room          and     there          were     about          a    dozen       people          on      the

floor,          these       patients             were          being        carried           in    on    stretchers                and       boards.

A   number           of    these       patients                had     pelvic          injuries.

        The     gymnasium               was      being       used    as    a    temporary             mortuary      for    the      dead,     fay

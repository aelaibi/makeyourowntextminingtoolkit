Just    t h en a girl        in a N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t    jumper     came to me and said,                  "I

must     have been w h y she said that she                    couldn't         find her husb a n d and

When     I went     to get the water             for the first           lad I had to go towards the

back a n d t hr o u g h a door.             In there       I saw tables an d there were                     people

sitting       there      counting money.            I was d i s g u s t e d at this.          There were

When     I left there a bit             later     I just went           to    look for m y m ates an d I

f o u n d one on the         pitch.       he said,       "It's alright.            Everybody          is

together       except      for two".         We just       hung a r o u n d     for a few minutes,               met

up w i t h the others and              left the gr o u n d to go back to the van.                           We

f ound one of the two that was miss i n g w a i t i n g                        for us there.          That       left

one     outstanding.          I don't       know what       time      I left the ground.

We hung a r o u n d for ages            by the van but he d i d n ’t turn up.                     We got         in

the     van and tou r e d the hospital                in the a r e a but still we              c o u l d n ’t find

him.

We e v e n t u a l l y   left S h e f f i e l d at about 3 . 0 0 a m          (0300)    and   it wasn't

until a fter        that     day that we found out that the                      last m i s s i n g    lad in

our     van had got a         lift     home wit h someone             else and thaj^ he was                okay.

      I think        that    if the F .A.          had have a l l o c a t e d the ground better all this

      w ay   under the amount              of fans       required them.               I think that      it would

      have    been easy to get the L i verpool                       fans     to the       larger   end.

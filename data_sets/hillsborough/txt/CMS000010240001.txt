FOOTBALL LIAISON GROUP

Thank you for your letter of 9 November.

We had assumed that it would always fall to us to prepare the
notes of the meeting, even if the venue or chairmanship changed.
But even so, we should of course have sent the minutes to you in
draft. This was a lapse on my part for which I apologise.

We are quite content to follow the pattern set out in the last
paragraph of your letter.

                                           Yours sincerely




                                           P E BOLTON

              travelled            through             to S h e f f i e l d        in    convoy,            in ou r    own    personnel               carrier

             We     arrived            at    Hillsborough                at       approximately 9.45am and                         were        briefed

              in the        North           stand          by    our    senior          officers.

             About         11.15am           we       took       up our       position            on       the    roundabout           at    the

             junction             of L e p p i n g s            Lane,    junction             Penistone           Road    and      Herries            Road.

             Our        task      was       to    prevent          opposing             supporters               coming   into         contact         with

             each        other.             Notts.         Forest        supporters               were       not a l l o w e d     to       ent e r

             Penistone             Road          North and             Leppings          Lane.         Liverpool          supporters               were

             not    allowed             to       enter          Penistone         Road        and Herries             Road.        We       carried        out

             this        ta s k    with          no    real       problems,             most      supporters           were       good       humoured.

             However,             I did          notice          that    by a b o u y 2 . 1 5 p m            it a p p e a r e d    that       most      of

             Zpas Notts., F o r e s t                 supporters              were' in the             ground,         there      were         certainly

             very       few       on    the       streets          at    our       location.               I have      w o r k e d at        similar

has     been    played          at       Hillsborough and                       it    has     been          the    case       that       most

supporters           ar&       in    the       ground           by t h i s          time.         Thousands             of    Liverpool

supporters           were       wal^wi^down                     Penistone             Road        North          towards          the    ground

and     hundreds          of    cars          and    even        coachejs^wgjs«-^ust a r r i v i n g .                             I do     not

know     if t h i s       was       caused          by    traffic           hold        ups       or    " s top        offs'       en    route.

together        and       reported             to    Insp.           Millett          who     was       at       the    entrance          to

Leppings        Lane.           At       this       t i m e ^e.^jHrtrfTve"d a                 call          for    assistance             at       the

Leppings        Lane       e                                         .     We       proceeded           to       that    location          with

the     Inspector          and       other          serials.               Outside           the       ground          there       were

approximately              three          hundred           people          ''milling1’ a r o u n d .                   With       the

assistance           of    other          officers              andjiofses              we    formed a             line       outside          the

gates     which       were          open       andri<ept             the    crowd           under       control ,             We    then

started        to    see       injured          persons              and    others           obviously             in a s t a t e         of

shock     1 ea v i ng      t h e g ro u n d .

I believe           a Superintendent                      or     it       could       have        been an          Inspector             waved

us     into    the    ground.                 Although           I had a             radio        I cannot             recall       any

messages        relating             to       what       ha d    happened             or w h a t        was       happening.              We

believed        the       Liverpool             supporters                 had       broken        down          the    gates       to    g ai n

entry.         Although             I had       heard           the      requests            for       the       gates       to    be    opened

because        of    the       crush          and    the        subsequent              order          to    open       them.

I entered           the    stadium             through           the       tunnel           and    went          into    the       Centre

South     Enclosure,                which       was       only        alio lit h a l f        full          at    this       time.        I saw

injured        and    obviously                dead       persons           being           passed          through          the    gate a n d

a whole        in the          fence          onto       the     pitch.              I assisted              the       supporters          and

other     police          officers             with       this^for              a    fe w    minutes.              As    the       terraces

cleared        it w a s        posible          to adrr/inister                     first     aid       on the          terraces.              I

gave     heart       massage             to    two       persons,           whilst           another             officer          whom    I did
                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                             R 3Q1

not, k n o w    gave       mouth         to m o u t h .         They     were      both       males    about       twenty

years     of age,           but     I could          not     d e s c r i£u* t h e m      further.           They       appeared

to    have     been        dead     for       somet imV'and            the      efforts        were    unsuccessful.

They were        eventually               passed        through          t he     gate       and    taken       away    by

supporters            on a d v e r t i« i ng         boards.

There     has    been         talk       of    people        urinating            and       spitting       etc    from       the

stand     above,           but     I. d i d       not/^tness             anything            like    that.

By    t hi s   time        most     of     the       dead    and    casualties               had    been    taken away and

I grouped        my        serial        together           and    stood        in the        centre       of    the    pitch.

On abandonment                of    the       game     we                       way     to    our    original          p o int     to

prevent        outbreaks            of     public       order.           Most      fans       were    very       subdued         and

did    not     witness           any     trouble.

I cannot         recall          seeing        any     stewards,            but    I was       not    really       in a

position         to     notice          them.               /

I would        not      say      there        wa s    any    breakdown            in    r a dio     communication,

although         more       information               caul        have      been       transmitted.

Could      the    situation              t ha t      arose      have     been      averted          with    the    aid       of a n

helicopter            to    monitor           Ihe^Jpbi 1 d up          of    the       crowd?

The     late a r r i v a l         of    the      Liverpool         fans        for w h a t e v e r    r e a s o n wa s

obviously         a major            factor          ir/ the      disaster,            combined with             the    many       who

-did not       have        tickets.            Arcohoi          also     played         a    part    but    this       is

prevalent         at       all     bi g s p o r t i n g      events.

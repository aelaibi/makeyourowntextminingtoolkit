           LETTER FROM




                                      HILLSBOROUGH TRAGEDY



           Dear Mr. Wright,



           On Saturday,     17th April,   1989 between 1458 hrs and 1509 hrs   I was O'C

           of a Fire Appliance attending a "Special Service Call" on Halifax

           Road a distance of approximately one and a half miles from

           Hillsborough.     I wish to state that



           1.   I can verify that Liverpool     fans were still making there

                  way to Hillsborough at 1509 hrs.



           2.   Some fans seemed to be under the influence of alcohol.



           3.   That according to a coach driver from                 South Wales,

                  he had no trouble in getting from L iv erpool-Sheffield in good

                  time.   Name and address of company available.



           All above can be verified with my fire crew.

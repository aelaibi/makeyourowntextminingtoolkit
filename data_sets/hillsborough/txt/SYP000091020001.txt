          c o u l d n ’t breathe.           Pat was         going worse and bluer.                  I tried to scream

          to Joe but          he w a s n ’t looking           our way and he           c o u l d ’t hear.         I c o u l d n ’t

I could see           he was          deara.      T h j f po 1 i cegn^nJpul led me away and onto the

Someone        was taking             pho'yos.         I   told him to fuck off.                The    police       told

him to       leave        u^f a l o n e fend they got Pat and                      carried him over        to the

gymnasium.           Tha^y/put hifrr-tTrT the floor and                           left me with him.         I was

screaming and s h o u t i n g .                Joe was         there trying           to help someone        else and

w hen    he saw Pat was dead he went up the wall                                     too.     They    put them all

in lines.           I just wa nt ed to hold on to Pat                              because there was        nothing           1

could do.           The     police made me                  leave and we were              taken to the     police

station and then sent                     home.



I had to tell              K athy and Mum.                 K a t h y w^f)             go ancKsee Pat        the      next

day.       I was worr ie d because Pat *s face vwfs brtnTsed and                                     lumped and       so      I

went with her.                  We    had to wait           for    three      or four       hours.     Whe n we saw

him,     Pat    h a d n ’t been made              to       look any better and had one eye                  half

opened.         Immediately after                  seeing         him,      the    police    took us    into an

office and a sked me                   to give a statement.                                            K at hy was

sitting        there and             I c o u l d n ’t tell        them.       We    came back home.



Whe n we were             in the       gym,    we a s ke d to use a phone                   to phone    the family

but we were           told w e ’d have             to go outside              to    phone.     If w e ’d gone        out

we    c o u l d n ’t have        got back         in.       A priest made            the    police    give a phone

to Joe and he              phoned.          The    police         told us that,            as Pat had been                /

             The    photographers       just    stood taking         photos and not trying           to help even

             though they          could see    people were      dying.



             Some    of the       police were      unsy.                   young    lad of      19 to 20 whose

             girl fr ie nd had been killed was              there whe n we were        leaving       for   the

             police station.           The    priest a sked why the        police    d i d n ’t use their

             lights     or sirens      to speed through the           traffic.      The    police     said    that

             there was       no    rush now because        it was all     over.     If the      police had been

             more active          in getting    people     out faster,     maybe    sQme/!afj^yierfi w o u l d n ' t

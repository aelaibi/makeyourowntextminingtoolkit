                                decided          to    spend       the       remaining             time      until       kick-off             outside             the    ground

    N At Le p pi n gs              Lane            the         build-up                 of    crowd         increased,             tempers         became

        frayed and                evidence                   of     drunkenness                    became        more       and more             pronounced.

        I remember                at        one        time,               Inspector             Purdy       standing            on    the       barrier          with

        his    back          to    the           t u r n s t i 1e s , while                      in the m a n n e r           of a t i g h t - r o p e

    ! walker,           vainly               trying                to a d d r e s s           the      crowd.           He w a s       beginning             to    look

        frightened                and,           frankly,                   I was          not     surprised.

        A young         boy            of    some             10 or          12 y e a r s          climbed         to      the     top      of    the w a l l

        near    to      gate            ’8'           but      apparently what                         he    saw      on    the       other       side

        deterred             him        from           dropping                     over     and      he     returned         to      the    crowd       on       this

        side.        I was              dismayed                   to       realise           that         in t h i s      swelling          mass       of     p eo p l e
there were            such young           children.                There       were       many       people          standing

about      not a t t e m p t i n g        to    join       the      q u e u e , Cif        it     can      be    described           as

such)     and      I wondered             at    that       t i me     whether          they       ha d a r r a n g e d       to m e e t

friends?         whether           they were          waiting            for    the       r u s h to       die       down    or

whether,          in fact,          they were          opportunists                  without          tickets.              The     gates

marked         ’C * w e r e      opened and           closed          on a n u m b e r          of    occasions             by

stewards         on    the       other     side,       either            to a l l o w      officials             and       police

officers         to    enter        or    l eave      the       ground,         or     to a d m i t        people          who    were     in

distress.             I remember           on at       l e as t       three         occasions             these       gates       were

o p e n e d at     the      request        of    police          officers            outside          to a d m i t         people      with

injuries.             One     of    these       was    a    child who               was    carried             bodily       in a n d w h o

had    been       removed          from    the     c r u s h at          the    turnstiles.

At    s om e    s t a g e , I would            guess       at    about S.40pm,                  I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshall         directing              police     operations                 in t hi s        crush.           He    was    having        to

shout      to m a k e       himself        heard       on       the      radio and             I heard a shouted

request         from     Inspector             Purdy       for      the       gates       to    be    opened          to    relieve

the    pressure          on the          turnstiles.                Even       at    that       stage          I could

understand            the     reason       for     this         request.             I di d       not      see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshall         again.            I was       later       to    learn,         in fact,             that       he    remained

there      continuing              to    direct       operations               in the a r e a             of    the    Leppings

Lane     turnstiles              but     such    was       the      thronging             mass       of    people          that     I di d

not    see      him    even        though       he m u s t       have         been     a matter            of y a r d s      f r o m me.

Not    long      afterwards              I spoke       to       Inspector            Purdy and             said       1 thought           the

gates      should        be      opened.

At    some      stage       it w a s      decided          th a t     some      l a rge        wrought          iron       gates     which

lead     out      into L e p p i n g s         Lane    should            be    closed          in o r d e r      to    prevent         the

now seething             mass       of    people       in L e p p i n g s           Lane       from       continuing             to a p p l y

pressure         to    the       queue     to    the       turnstiles.                 This      was       do n e     successfully

but    it s e e m e d       to     be    only minutes               before          the    gates          were       forced       open

again and          the      pressure           resumed.             At    one       st a ge ,     stil l        pre-occupied

was     standing            only a few yards                       from       the       gate.         I should           s a y at        this

point       that       these       gates           had      never        been        under          severe      pressure            as      the

crowd       had       recognised              that        there         was    no       probability             of      entering

through          that       gate.           The        people        in the          immediate             vicinity           of    the      gate

began       to    go    through             it a n d        it s e e m e d         to     take       the    bulk        of    the      crowd 30

seconds          or    so    to    realise what                    had     occurred.

The     trickle         of    people              going         into     the       ground           through       this        gate

increased and                for       a short            period         there          was      containable             entry         through

the     gate.          It w a s        a    relief         to me         to    see        th e      gate    opened           and,      at    this

point,       I remarked                to PC B o c k i n g              “T h a t     gate        should        h av e    been       opened

ten minutes             ago".

Over      the     n e xt     two       or     three minutes                   the       flow        through this              gate

increased and                it w a s        apparent              to me       that          th e    s i t u a t i o n at       th e

turnstiles             would       soon           be    eas e d .        It w a s         about       th i s    time         that      1 heard

a    roar    from       the       crowd           inside         the     ground and assumed                       that        either         the

players          were       out    or       th a t      the      match        h ad      commenced.              This         s u r p r i s e d me,

having       thought          that          the        game was          going          to     be    delayed.            This       roar

increased             the    urgency              of    the      people        entering              the    ground.             I turned              to

One    half       of    the       gymnasium            had     b e e n set    up        as a d i n i n g          area     and      t h er e

put    tables          to    one      side.        I believe             that      Detective            I n s pe cto r T owe 11

was    in the          g y m n a s i u m at       that       t i me    and    I am       certain         that        I was       the

senior       officer           present.

People       started           arriving           into       the      gymnasium          carrying            victims.            The

first     victim            to a r r i v e       was    a young          man and         I believe            he w a s         carried

in by two           police          officers           and a       civilian.             He wa s        taken        to    the      wall

opposite          the       door      and       laid    down.          Other       people         were       no w    flooding          into

the    gymnasium             carrying            victims.             The    first       man was         apparently              dead

and    I touched             one      of    the    officers,             introduced myself,                       and     explained

to    him that          that        b o d y wa s       his     r e s p o n s i b i l i t y and that            under       no

circumstances                was      he    to    l e av e     t h a t body.            He wa s to       ensure           that        no

one    else       had any           dealings           with     the      property         or      clothing           or

identification                 of     th a t     body.        These         were    instructions                  that     I was       to

repeat       dozens          of     times        on t ha t      afternoon.

Brought          in w i t h       the      dead were          the      injured and             these         were        directed          to

the    far       end    of     the      g y m n a s i u m at       the      other       side      of    the       partition.               The

dead were          arriving             in s u c h      numbers          that      it wa s        impossible              to    try    to

establish whether,                      in fact,         they were            dead,       but      1 have           to    say    that

every     body         that       I saw         bore    what       I recognise            to      be    classic           signs       of

asphyxia and                I am      satisfied          that         every      body     that         I saw and           directed

into     the      area       d e s i g n a t e d as a t e m p o r a r y            m o r t u a r y was,           in fact,          dead.

Although          I s aw m o s t           of    the    bodies         1 have       to    sa y     t h at     1     did    not      see

t h e m all.           Indeed         they were          arriving            in s u c h     numbers           and        with    such

frequency           that       on m a n y        occasions            it w a s     impossible            to       give

instructions                before         the    officers            who    had    brought            the    body        in h a d

departed.
Some     of       the     bodies        were       carried          in by m e m b e r s             of    the    crowd.           Some      of

these        people           were     distressed,             weeping          openly,             screaming,             aggressive

and    I saw several                   fights       and       scuffles          break         out        in the       area       around,

between           and     over       the     bodies       that       were       being          deposited.

Some     drunks          were        assisting           to    bring       the       dead and             injured          persons       into

the    gymnasium               and     it    has    to    be    said       t ha t      they were               not    all    causing

trouble.            Officers            and       civilians          were       attempting                to    resuscitate             some

of    the     victims            and    I s a w at        least          two    such          groups       attempting             to

rev i v e ,       what        were     quite       obviously             to me,        dead         bodies.

Of    th e    people           arriving           in the       gymnasium             many were             standing          around,

remaining           there.             Police       officers             were       going       back       out       to    fetch more

casualties               and     the    scene was             one    of    general             confusion with                bodies

being        put    down         haphazardly.                                  a,       r~- , ■

At    some        stage        I sa w D e t e c t i v e        Inspector             Charles,             apparently             having

come     into        the       gym w ith          a body,       about          to    leave          the    gymnasium.              Mr.

Charles           ha d    attended           the    match       on d u t y          in full          police          uniform.           I

shouted           to Mr.         Charles          and when          he    came       to me          I told       him       that    this

public        order           situation           in the       gymnasium             had       to    be    controlled             and       told

him    to     get        some     men       and    get    on w i t h       it.         He      immediately                started

gathering            police          officers        to       him and          giving          them       instructions             and       1

noted        that        he    gave     priority          to    the       gymnasium             fl o or .        It w a s

impossible               to    count        the    bodies       as       they arrive,                but w h e n          there    were

about        20    I remember               thinking          that       there       could          not    be m a n y m o r e          dead.

As    the     bodies           were     laid       nearer       and       nearer         to     the       gymnasium          door

someone,           I believe            it w a s     Detective             Sergeant             IicSloy, s a i d            to me       "If

we    d o n ’t s t a r t         laying       the    bodies          out       n e a t l y we wi l l            never       get    them

all    in".          I told          him     to    grab       some       men and         get        on w i t h       it.

Two    officers               in u n i f o r m     from       the    Underwater                Search          Unit       came    to me          at

some     time.            They were           carrying          a hand-held                   video       uni t .         They    t o l d me

that     they       had        been     recording             the    scene          in a n d a r o u n d         the       are|    of       the
Leppings       Lane          goalmouth          but       that      they       had     been assaulted                  on       two

occasions          by    football          supporters               and     they       ha d     had    to    retreat             for

their    safety.              I recognised                need      for     evidence            gathering          and          told    them

to    start     filming            the    scene       in the           gym.         1 do      not     remember          seeing          them

again.

I find       it v e r y       difficult          to       re c a l l    the     events          in the       gymnasium.                 My

overall       perception             is one          of    dead        bodies        arriving          and     being            carried

by s h o c k e d and          perspiring             police         officers?            by d i s t r e s s e d        people          w ho

were    obviously             friends          and    relatives            and       by d r u n k e n       p e op l e ,        some    of

whom    were       shouting          and wanting               to      fig h t .       Injured         people          were

arriving       and       being       directed             to   the      far     en d     of     the    hall       and       the       scene

was    one    of    increasing             confusion.

Some    degree          of    regulation             began       to     take        place       as    Inspector             Charles

and    his    team       regulated             the    people           in the        gy m a n d       ejected          the       unruly

ones.        it w o u l d      have       been       folly       to     tr y a n d       separate           the    grieving

relatives          and       friends       from       the      bodies          a n d many,           many    people             were    left

standing       around          in the          gymnasium            helplessly,               in all        stages          of    distress.

On several          occasions             I went          through         to    the     Police         Room       to m a k e          use     of

the    telephone             which       was    in th e r e ,           but         the P o l i c e R o o m w a s           busy, the

telephone          was       in use       and when             1 bullied my way                  to    the     telephone               the

numbers       I tried          to    get        wereengaged               or    unobtainable.

At    some    stage          I recallhaving                seen a         police        officer         sat       on        a    c hair       by

the    telephone             in the       Police          Room.          He h a d      a big         tear    in his

trousers.           He w a s        weeping          openly.             He w a s q u i t e     obviously          shocked.             1

h a d a fe w w o r d s         with       him w h i c h        seemed          to me       to    be    totally          inadequate

and    left     him.

At    a very early             stage           I had d e p u t e d         someone         to a r r a n g e       for the             major

incident        boxes         to    come        from H a m m e r t o n R o a d           and Eccle sf ie ld and                       I asked

Detective          Inspector             Scaife,          at   some       st a g e ,     to     contact        the      Medico

               round      the    various           hospitals           and mortuaries                   in the       district             with a

               view     to    establishing             the a v a i l a b l e           capacities            for     dead       b od i e s .

               1 had also          asked       for     the       Coroner          to    be    informed - which                      s e e m e d at      the

               At    some     stags,         I think after              half       an    hour,          I needed          to m a k e       contact

               with     the     control        box     inside          the    ground          to       inform       them       of    the

               situation         in the        g y m n a s i u m a n d as          I was          unable       to    contact           them      by

               telephone and             I knew        that a n y        radio          message          passed would                be    relayed

               over     every      o f f i c e r ’s r a dio        in the          ground,             I went       on foot.              1 am     now

               informed         by D e t e c t i v e      Inspector           Towell          that       he a c c o m p a n i e d         me,    but       my

               recollection             of    events        is    so    blurred and                distorted             that       1 ca n n o t

               of a s s e s s i n g     the    situation           he    stood          on a       chair,       called          for       order       in

               the    hall,      and     told       police        officers             what       he    intended          to    do.        The

               gymnasium         floor        was    littered with                 rows       of       bodies       and    I remember

               someone        telling         me    when      I asked         how many             "Seventy          od d a n d m o r e          at     the
Northern General” .

Most    of     the    bodies          by     t hi s      time    had     been      draped with what                  appeared           to

be w h i t e    shrouds             and     I remember           wondering          where       on e a r t h       they      had

come    from.          I wa s        later         to    learn    that       t h e y were,        in fact,           the     paper

tablecloths           which          had     been        removed       from       the    wooden        tressle        t a b le s ,

now    piled        up at       the       s id e    of    the    gymnasium.

It w a s a b o u t        this       time      that       I remembered             that       my youngest            son was

somewhere           in the          crowd and almost                  all    of    the    b o d ie s ,    the      fe e t    of

which were           protruding              from        under    these          tablecloths,            seemed       to     h a ve

trainers        on    identical              to     his.        I had       to    resist       the     urge     to    go a n d

look at        each       of    the       b o d i e s.

It w a s     decided           that       I should            return     to H a m m e r t o n R o a d , a s s i s t          in

setting        up a Major             Incident            Room    there          and also       arrange         for     the

friends        and     relatives             to     be    bussed       to H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e        Station.

I arranged           to    be       taken      to H a m m e r t o n     Road       by a m a r k e d       police        car       and

Detective           Inspector             Towell         travelled          in w h a t    I believe            was    the     prison

bus,    with anxious                 relatives            and    friends.

On arrival           at H a m m e r t o n          Road       I found       the    place       under      virtual           siege.

Liverpool           supporters             were         wanting       to m a k e    urgent        enquiries,           many        were

standing        around          not       knowing         what    to     do a n d       someone        had     put    out a        call

for all        off-duty             social         workers       to    report       to H a m m e r t o n R o a d a n d            there

were    many        social          workers.             My    first     r e a c t i o n was      one     of    dismay        at      the

thought        of    so m a n y       social            workers       being       directed        to     this      area      but,       in

a   very     short        time,       it     became           apparent       that       they    were      to    be    invaluable

and    provided a buffer                     between           distressed          relatives           and     fans,        who    had

lost    contact           with       relatives and               friends          in the       crowd,        and     the     police.

I called        together             the     Incident           Room     staff,         who    had a r r i v e d      at     the

Station        to    set       up    the      Incident          room,       and    briefed        t h e m as       to w h a t      ha d

o c c u r r e d at    the       ground and               the    situation          the r e .      I should           say     here

that    I was        aware          that     arrangements              had       been made        for     the C a s u a l t y

                                                                                                                                R6

Bureau       to     be a c t i v a t e d .          I was        shortly        to     be    informed          however        that

all    numbers           to    the     Casualty          Bureau          had a l r e a d y         gone    out     over      the

radio,       jamming           all     of the         lines,           a n d as a         result         there was         to be    no

police       contact           by    telephone           with           the B u r e a u      for     many      hou r s .

Having       t o l d the        Incident            Room     staff        what       had     occurred          they went           about

the    business           of    setting           up the         Incident           R o o m at      H a m m e r t o n Road .

I tried        to m a k e       a telephone              call         to m y    home        but     could      not    get a n

outside        line.           I later          went     to a n a d j a c e n t           building         where      I knew

there       w as    a direct           outside          line.          I telephoned                home    and     established

that    my     s o n wa s       safe.           I think          the    time        was     then about           6 . 3 0 p m but all

I can       say     for       certain          is t h a t    it         w a s s t ill       daylight.

I was       surprised           to     see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         S I e a t h at H a m m e r t o n       Road Police

Station        in       civilian          c l o t h e s a n d he        t o l d me        t ha t    he h a d     responded          to a

call     for all          off-duty             p o 1 i ce o f f i c e r s      to    go     either        to Hi 1 1 sbo r o u g h        or

the    closest           police        station.             Mr.       Sleath        had a s s u m e d      responsibility

for    relatives?              liaison with Social                      Services            and with         the     temporary

D u r 1ng    the        course       of    the      evening           the re w e r e        three        other     events

unconnected              with       this       incident,          which        r e q u i r e d my a t t e n t i o n .         One       was

a    potential           firearms          situation             in    *F 1 * S u b - D i v i s i o n ?     another         was     a

potential           firearms           situation            in    ’F2*      Sub-Di v ision a nd                the    third

involved           the    body       of a n       old    lady w h i c h         had       been      found      in a f i r e at

her    home        under       suspicious             circumstances.                   I asked Detective                   Chief
       (\JU- '6> ( o .
Inspector Addison                    to    go     to E c c l e s f i e l d      Police           Station       and    deal      with

the    body and           deputed Detective                      Inspector           Scaife         to    deal     with      the

firearms           incident          there.

I needed           to    speak       to D e t e c t i v e        Chief      Inspector              Addis     on m a n y

occasions           during          the    evening          but       contact        with        him was       only    possible

by    contacting              people       with       h i m on        channel        25     of     the    police      r a dio      and

then     requesting             hi m      to    return       to       channel        19,     in the        hope      that     our
conversation would                     be m o r e       secure.

At    some       time     during        the       evening,             but    not       long a f t e r       Mr.       Addison          had

left       for    Ecclesfield,               I returned                to    the       gymnasium          for     a     conference

w i t h Mr,       Addis         and    found       t h at        the    Coroner,             Mr.    Potter,           and       the    Home

Office          Pathologist,            Professor                Usher,       were       in a t t e n d a n c e .           Professor

usher       said       t ha t    there       was       little          he    could       do at        the    scene          and agreed

to    go    over       to E c c l e s f i e l d        to    look at          the       scene       and     the       body       there.        I

arranged          transport            for    him.

The    s c e n e at       the     gymnasium             wa s      now much             more     orderly.              The       bodies       had

all    been       certified            dead.           There       were       a number             of d o c t o r s      in

attendance;             there         were    social             workers?             many    grieving          relatives              and

many many           police        officers,             all       of w h o m          looked       shocked,           drawn and             tired.

I be 1 ieve         t h at      it was       at    this          stage       I saw a man              I r e c o g n i s e d as Dr.

Duckworth,             Psychologist,               wh o      lectures             at    police        establishments                   on

trauma          connected with               major          incidents             and,       in p a r t i c u l a r ,       in his

involvement             with      police          officers             following             the B r a d f o r d       fire.

Mr.    Addis        discussed           w i t h me          his    p l a ns       to    photograph,             with        a    polaroid

c a m era,       each     of     the    bodies;             to    display             these     on a w a l l          at a d i f f e r e n t

part       of    the    gymnasium and                  to    have       relatives             brought,          one      lot at a

time,       to    the     gymnasium           to       be    shown          the       photographs           and,       if a

photograph             was      picked       out,       to       have       the       body    relating          to     t ha t

photograph             removed         from       the       hall       into       a    temporary          viewing           room and

identified.

We a l s o       d i s c u s s e d at    that          time       our       priorities             and    decided           that       no

police          enquiry         could     commence               that       night       and     it wa s      imperative                that

all    police          efforts         should          be    directed             towards          the    situation              at    the

gymnasium;              identification                  of       the    bodies          and     providing             what

assistance             was      possible          to    the       relatives.

     returned          to H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e              Station          and     closed          down       the

        The    only      information                 I. can d e f i n i t e l y           set    a time          for       is 9 . 0 0 p m      when       I

        had a      conversation                 by t e l e p h o n e       with          the    Deputy         Chief        Constable,

        Mr.    Hayes,         to     update          him     of     the    operation.

        He    requested            that     a    conference               be     set      up    of all          senior          officers

        involved with                a view          to    being able             to      supply          the C h i e f         Constable         with

        a factual           account         of       events         in o r d e r         that    he       could       be    properly

        prepared         to    meet        the       inevitable            barrage             for       information             from     the     press.

        Mr.    Hayes        asked      me       to a r r a n g e         for     all      senior          officers          concerned           to    be

        at    the C o n f e r e n c e       R o o m at          Headquarters               for       1 1 .0 0 p m .        I remember

        l o o k i n g at      my watch           at       t h at    stage        to a s s e s s          how m u c h       t i me     I had.

        I h a d at       l e ast      two       other        conversations, during                             the    e v e n i n g , w i t h ACC

        Mr.    Jackson         to     update           him,        but    I cannot             remember          the       content        of    the

        conversation.

        I returned            to     the    g y m n a s i u m at H i l l s b o r o u g h ,                spoke       to Mr.          Addis     and

        told     him     of    the     conference.

        I decided           t ha t    X ought             then      to    have       a    look       at    the       stand       and    terraces

        where      the      disaster            had       occurred,            ( ev e n    though           it was         in d a r k n e s s )      in

        order      that       I could           be     properly           informed             for       the    conference             w h i c h was
\
    j to      follow.          Although              the     l i ght      wa s    not      good          it wa s      light         enough      to

        give     me     some       indication              of      the    devastation                which       ha d      occurred.            I was

        accompanied            by D e t e c t i v e          Inspector            Towel^^

        We    went      from       there        through            the    tunnel          and    r o u n d to         the       turnstile         area

        and    on our         way     back        to      the      gymnasium             saw    the C h i e f         Constable           with a

        group      of    people        at       the       scene.

        I informed            the     Chief          Constable            of     the      meeting           being         set    up at
■11.00pm.              I returned             to       the              sium.           I ha d a f u r t h e r          conversation

w i t h Mr.           Addis       and       the    Chie                 table        then         visited       the     gymnasium.                He

was    obviously                 looking          at    the     scene        c a r e f u l l y a n d wa s         speaking             to as

many    officers                 as    he    possibly           could,        offering             words     of    encouragement,

I believe              shortly after                   this     I returned              with Chief           Superintendent

Addis        who       had       not    had       the    opportunity               to       visit     the    area       of    the

disaster              and    together             we w e n t      from       there          into    the     service          r o a d at       the

back    of        the       South       Stand where               we    discussed             the     prospect          of

approaching                 the m a n y       television               crews       now       in a t t e n d a n c e     with a view

to o b t a i n i n g         video          recordings            taken       by     them,          Mr.     Addis       decided

against           it.

After        1    h ad      returned          to       the    gymnasium            I went          to H a m m e r t o n R o a d         Police

Station with Detective                             Inspector            T o w e l 1.         I made       arrangements                 for

video        recordings                to    be a v a i l a b l e       at    the       Conference           R o o m at       Police

Headquarters.                     I travelled                to H e a d q u a r t e r s       with Detective                 Inspector

T o w e 11       only       to    find       t ha t     the     conference              had       been    cancelled           for       that

night        and was             re-arranged             for 9 . 0 0 a m        the         f o 11owing morning.                   I

returned              to H a m m e r t o n R o a d P o l i c e            Station and went                   off      d u t y at        around

2.13am,

On arrival               h o m e at         about       2.30am         I discovered                that     my y o u n ge s t          boy    had

picked           up    two       distressed Liverpool                        fans,          one    of w h o m     had    been          parted

from    his           brother,,         and       these       two y o u n g        men       were     sleeping          at    my       home.

I returned               to w o r k         for    7.30am         the     following               day and       during        the       days

that    followed                 I was       in    charge         of    the     Incident            R o o m at H a m m e r t o n R o a d

E N D OF      REPORT
Graham McKAY

Detective Superintendent

South Yorkshire Police,Ecclesfield      Police Station




In April 1988, as Detective Superintendent at 'F' Division, I attended
a football match being played at the hone ground of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club, Hillsborough.   The game was a Cup Semi-Final and was
played between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC.      There was a
capacity crowd and admission was by ticket only.

My remit on that day was to organise and supervise all elements of
crime prevention and crime detection.

At about 2.40 pm that day I found myself outside the ground in the
Leppings Lane turnstile area.    The crowd using those turnstiles were
mostly good natured but, about 2.50 pm, there was a build up in the
numbers of people using the turnstiles and a sizeable queue developed.
There was increasing evidence of drunkenness amongst the supporters who
were all Liverpool fans.   There was a good deal of pushing and shoving
and police officers on horses were necessary to control the crowd. An
ideal opportunity for pick-pocket activity.   It took this build-up of
supporters several minutes to clear through the turnstiles but without
problem.

On Friday 14 April 1989 I took part in a 'phone in programme with Radio
Merseyside, when I spoke with the presenter of that programme in
relation to the Semi-Final to take place on the following day and
passed on various pieces of advice for fans who were travelling to
Sheffield.  One of the areas which I stressed was that it was an all­
ticket match and that fans who did not have a ticket should not ccme.

At 3.00 pm that same afternoon I gave similar advice, by telephone,
which was recorded by a member of staff at Radio Nottingham.

On Saturday 15 April 1989 I was responsible for all matters in relation
to crime at the Cup Tie Semi-Final between Liverpool PC and Nottingham
Forest FC. As it was a carbon copy of the match which had been played
before it made sense to use what had previously been successful
arrangements as the bulk of the supporters would have attended the
previous match and would be aware of the locations of the various
facilities and the various systems operating at the ground.

On the day my staff were split into two teams. A team of 12 officers,
under the ccmnand of Detective Inspector Towell, who were to operate in
and around the ground.   Eight of those officers were to be engaged on
observations, looking out for pick-pockets.

Outside the ground Detective Inspector Scaife had charge of a team of
14 officers who were to be responsible for the prevention and detection
of street crime.   Two of these officers were in plain clothes on non­
descript motor cycles and it had been envisaged that, whilst the game
                                                                    (2 )


was in progress, these officers would patrol the quiet streets lined
with parked cars in an effort to prevent and detect theft fron cars.

I attended the briefing at Sheffield Wedensday FC at 10.00 am and
following this briefed my own detectives. I was accompanied through
    first         the day by Police Constable 2439 Bocking, who was in
civilian clothes.

At 10.50 am, together with PC Bocking, I went to a mobile police radio
control, who were monitoring all CID transmissions on channel 19. This
caravan was placed on land at the side of Hillfoot bridge and only a
few yards fron the frontage of a public house called ,rIhe Owl'. Even
at that stage supporters were queuing outside, waiting for the Owl to
be opened, and at 11.00 am the bars opened.

I remained in and around that location for sane 40 minutes and during
that period, trade at the public house increased as football fans
gathered there.

The location of this public house would lead me to believe that the
majority, if not all, of these fans were Nottingham Forest supporters.
I had nothing to do with them and cannot say for certain.

I patrolled in my own vehicle with PC Bocking and at about 1.00 pm had
a meeting with Detective Inspector Scaife and sane of his staff in the
parking area for Wadsley Bridge Section Station.    This lasted a few
minutes and after the departure of Detective Inspector Scaife and his
staff I was joined by the two motor cyclists and I gave them further
instructions.

At about 1.30 pm I went to the South Yorkshire Police Sports and Social
Club at Niagara as traffic was building up and it was my intention to
leave my car in the car park there and spend the time between then and
the start of the match, on foot. Whilst at that location I went into
the Club with PC Bocking and sought out the Deputy Head of Merseyside
CID, a Detective Superintendent Baxter - a man who I knew would be
lunching at the Club with same of his family and for whan I had
arranged nearby parking.   I had not met Mr Baxter before and, having
introduced myself as a matter of courtesy, PC Bocking and I left the
Club.

Whilst I was in the Club I noticed that there was a large number of
supporters of both football clubs who, I assumed, were all police
officers.  It was apparent that most were dining or waiting for meals
they had ordered or having a casual drink.

About 1.50 pm PC Bocking and I went to the gymnasium at Sheffield
Wednesday FC where we had a meal and, at about 2.15 pm, we left and I
decided to spend the remaining time until kick-off outside the ground
in the vicinity of the Leppings Lane turnstiles, as I considered this
to be the most likely place for pick-pocket activity.

With PC Bocking I walked out onto the perimeter track surrounding the
ground and walked across the front of the Spion Kop, where the
                                                                      (3 )


 Nottingham Forest supporters ware gathered. There was still plenty of
 roan xn the Spion Kop but, nevertheless, there was a large n mber of
 spectators present and there were very few barren places.

 In contrast, looking over to Leppings Lane end of the ground there
 aP P ^ red to 1x5 verY few spectators in evidence in the terraces or the
 stand at the back of the goal.        Equally, the seating in the North
 btand was sparsely occupied.       I want down the players tunnel and
 through on to the service road and car parking area at the rear of the
 South Stand.     We made our way through a sterile area up to a light
 portable barrier which was near to a pair of metal concertina type
 gates, marked 'C' at the lappings Lane turnstiles area.

This turnstile serves the North Stand and the West Stand and terraced
areas behind the goal.     There are three lots of turnstiles and it
immediately became apparent that the seven turnstiles, serving the
terraced area and between the concertina type gates marked 'B' and the
ones previously referred to marked 'C', were in heavy demand.

A large crowd was backed up right out on to Leppings Lane and there was
angry pushing and shoving taking place.      There were several police
officers in evidence and in particular two mounted officers who I
believe ware fron Merseyside. The officer in charge of a serial of men
was Inspector Purdy, a man I have known for a number of years and
recognised immediately.   Inspector Purdy and his serial were having a
great deal of difficulty in controlling the crowd at this point. The
turnstiles A - G were arranged on the left by the gates marked 'B1 set
into a high wall and on the right by a metal barrier sane 20 yards long
and at chest height, the crowd was contained behind this barrier.

It was apparent that the turnstiles were not coping efficiently with
the crowd, which was swelling by the minute.

Throughout the next 30 minutes or so I remained mostly at that location
but, on two occasions, walked back through the sterile area to where a
serial was employed at another barrier at the Nottingham Forest
turnstiles into the South Stand.    They were having no difficulty with
the people in that area and I spoke to a man I know as Sergeant Bodgett
and told him that I anticipated that, as the crowd increased at the
Leppings Lane turnstiles, more police officers would be required and I
asked him to post an officer fron his serial nearer to the turnstiles
at lappings Lane and in view of the turnstiles in order that he could
respond should the occasion demand.

At lappings Lane the build-up of crowd increased, tempers became frayed
and evidence of drunkenness became more and more pronounced.

I remember at one tune, Inspector Purdy standing on the barrier with
his back to the turnstiles, while in the manner of a tight-rope walker,
vainly trying to address the crowd.         He was beginning to look
frightened and, frankly, I was not surprised.

A young boy of sane 10 or 12 years climbed to the top of the wall near
to gate 'B1 but apparently what he saw on the other side deterred him
                                                                    (4)

fran dropping over and he returned to the crowd on this side.     I was
dismayed to realise that in this swelling mass of people there were
such young children.      There were many people standing about not
attempting to join the queue, (if it can be described as such) and I
wondered at that time whether they had arranged to meet friends;
whether they were waiting for the rush to die down or whether, in fact,
they were opportunists without tickets.     The gates marked 'C' were
opened and closed on a number of occasions by stewards on the other
s^ e ' either to allow officials and police officers to enter or leave
the ground, or to admit people who were in distress. I remember on at
least three occasions these gates were opened at the request of police
officers outside to admit people with injuries.     One of these was a
child who was carried bodily in and who had been removed from the crush
at the turnstiles.

At same stage, I would guess at about 2.40 pm, I saw Superintendent
Marshall directing police operations in this crush.    He was having to
shout to make himself heard on the radio and I heard a shouted request
from inspector Purdy for the gates to be opened to relieve the pressure
on the turnstiles.    Even at that stage I could understand the reason
for this request.   I did not see Superintendent Marshall again. I was
later to learn, in fact, that he remained there continuing to direct
operations in the area of the leppings Lane turnstiles but such was the
thronging mass of people that I did not see him even though he must
have been a matter of yards fran me.

Not long afterwards I spoke to Inspector Purdy and said I thought the
gates should be opened.

At same stage it was decided that sane large wrought iron gates which
lead out into Leppings Lane should be closed in order to prevent the
now seething mass of people in Leppings Lane fran continuing to apply
pressure to the queue to the turnstiles.    This was done successfully
but it seemed to be only minutes before the gates were forced open
again and the pressure resumed. At one stage, still pre-occupied with
the pick-pockets, I moved nearer to these blue gates but immediately
became engulfed in the crow3 and I had to push and struggle to get back
into a relatively clear space near to the light portable barriers.

During these few brief manents I was frightened for my own safety and
it made me realise what conditions must have been like in the more
severely packed area behind the barrier leading to the turnstiles.  I
was getting quite concerned and remember remarking to PC Bocking that
they were going to have to open the gates.

PC Bocking was carrying my radio at this time which was tuned to the
channel designated to CID, number 19.  Uniformed officers were being
directed fran control on channel 25.

Conditions deteriorated, missiles were thrown, a beer can with a drink
spilling fran it striking a police officer on horseback.     There was
another surge fran the crowd which appeared to be a concerted attempt
to unseat this same officer and the horse started dancing about in
fright.   Throughout I could hear demands over a loud speaker system
pleading with the crowd to stop pushing, to be patient.        I could
recognise the speaker as PC 1035 Ryan.
                                                                     (5 )


 As it got nearer to 3 o'clock it became apparent to everyone that it
 WaS wfS°SS^ble for this vast cr€M&' which now stretched out of my sight
 in both directions of leppings Lane, to gain access to the ground
 before kick-off and I heard sane uniformed officer remark that kick-off
 had been delayed for 15 minutes.

 The crowd became more and more unruly and nasty and I could hear
 officers, who were caught in the press, yelling frantically into their
 personal radios.

I began to have grave fears that the situation could only end in
disaster.   The crowd were beginning to swarm over the walls into the
ground. People in the crowd were shouting and screaming for assistance
and yet the thrust fran leppings Lane continued.

At various times during this period the mounted police officers had
been supplemented by a number of others and I would estimate there
being in the region of 8 to 10 mounted officers in that small area.
They were, for the most part, engulfed in the crowd and unable to
contain it.

A few minutes before 3 o'clock, perhaps three or four, I heard the
message given over a uniformed officer's radio "Open the gate" and
almost immediately the concertina doors of gate 'C' were opened. I was
standing only a few yards fran the gate.    I should say at this point
that these gates had never been under severe pressure as the crowd had
recognised that there was no probability of entering through that gate.
The people in the immediate vicinity of the gate began to go through it
and it seemed to take the bulk of the crowd 30 seconds or so to realise
what had occurred.

The trickle of people going into the ground through this gate increased
and for a short pjeriod there was containable entry through the gate.
It was a relief to me to see the gate opened and, at this point, I
remarked to PC Bocking "That gate should have been opened ten minutes
ago".

Over the next two or three minutes the flow through this gate increased
and it was apparent to me that the situation at the turnstiles would
soon be eased.    It was about this time that I heard a roar frcm the
crowd inside the ground and assumed that either the players were out or
that the match had cannenced.   This surprised me, having thought that
the game was going to be delayed.   This roar increased the urgency of
the people entering the ground. I turned to walk back with PC Bocking
down the service road and made my way to the south east corner of the
ground, where I walked onto the perimeter track of the pitch, behind
the Spion Kop goal.

The game was in progress and as I looked up towards the Leppings Lane
end I could see the crowd spilling out fran the terraces onto the
pitch. I could not understand this but, as there were large numbers of
uniformed officers making their way along the perimeter path in front
of the North Stand towards that area, I assumed that the matter would
be contained and I left the pitch at the north east corner.
I walked back to the gymnasium which was being used as a dining roan,
where I spoke to Detective Inspector Towell, and a few minute* later
someone called to me that play had been stopped and that there were
injuries.

Uniformed officers were hurrying out of the gymnasium and I returned to
the north east corner of the pitch to see what was happening.

The scene was one of confusion at the Leppings Lane end with sane
people climbing fran the terraces into the seated stand above and
people continuing to spill out onto the pitch through gates in the
fencing which were now open.     It appeared to be an invasion of the
pitch which should be contained by uniform officers but, after a minute
or so, I decided to walk over.    I had gone only about 40 yards when I
met Detective Sergeant 727 Lindley caning the other way and he called
to me "There's about 20 dead in there boss".

I went imnediately to the Police Roan under the North Stand, fran where
I contacted Detective Chief Superintendent Addis by telephone. I would
estimate the time to be somewhere in the region of 3.15 pm. I informed
Mr Addis that I believed there were deaths and we discussed that we
would need to be thinking in terms of setting up an Incident Roan and
activating a Casualty Bureau.

I have to say that fran that time I have no clear recollection of the
sequence of events or of any time scale.  I returned to the gymnasium
and my return coincided with that of Chief Inspector Beal who shouted
"We are going to set up a temporary nprtuary in here, clear these
tables."

One half of the gymnasium had been set up as a dining area and there
was a temporary partition down the centre of the gymnasium.    It was
this area that was cleared and there was a rush by police officers to
put tables to one side. I believe that Detective Inspector Towell was
in the gymnasium at that time and I am certain that I was the senior
officer present.

People started arriving into the gymnasium carrying victims. The first
victim to arrive was a young man and I believe he was carried in by two
police officers and a civilian. He was taken to the wall opposite the
door and laid down. Other people were now flooding into the gymnasium
carrying victims. The first man was apparently dead and I touched one
of the officers, introduced myself, and explained to him that that body
was his responsibility and that under no circumstances was he to leave
that body. He was to ensure that no one else had any dealings with the
property or clothing or identification of that body.        These were
instructions that I was to repeat dozens of times on that afternoon.

Brought in with the dead were the injured and these were directed to
the far end of the gymnasium at the other side of the partition. The
dead were arriving in such numbers that it was inpossible to try to
establish whether, in fact, they were dead, but I have to say that
every body that I saw bore what I recognise to be classic signs of
asphyxia and I am satisfied that every body that I saw and directed
into the area designated as a temporary mortuary was, in fact, dead.
                                                                    (7)


Although I saw most of the bodies I have to say that I did not see them
all. Indeed they were arriving in such numbers and with such frequency
that on many occasions it was inpossible to give instructions before
the officers who had brought the body in had departed.

Sane of the bodies were carried in by members of the crowd. Some of
these people were distressed, weeping openly, screaming, aggressive
and I saw several fights and scuffles break out in the area around,
between and over the bodies that were being deposited.

Sane drunks were assisting to bring the dead and injuredpersons into
the gymnasium and it has to be said that they were not all causing
trouble. Officers and civilians were attempting to resuscitate sane of
the victims and I saw at least two such groups attempting to revive,
what were quite obviously to me, dead bodies.

Of the people arriving in the gymnasium many were standing around,
remaining there.   Police officers were going back out to fetch more
casualties and the scene was one of general confusion with bodies being
put down haphazardly.

At same stage I saw Detective Inspector Charles, apparently having cane
into the gym with a body, about to leave the gymnasium. Mr Charles had
attended the match on duty in full police uniform.        I shouted to
Mr Charles and when he came to me I told him that this public order
situation in the gymnasium had to be controlled and told him to get
sane men and get on with it.    He immediately started gathering police
officers to him and giving them instructions and I noted that he gave
priority to the gymnasium door. It was inpossible to count the bodies
as they arrived, but when there were about 20 I remember thinking that
there could not be many more dead.

As the bodies were laid nearer and nearer to the gymnasium door
scmecoe, I believe it was Detective Sergeant McSloy, said to me "If we
don't start laying the bodies out neatly we will never get them all
in". I told him to grab sane men and get on with it.

Two officers in uniform fran the Underwater Search Unit came to me at
sane time.   They were carrying a hand-held video unit.   They told me
that they had been recording the scene in and around the area of the
Leppings Lane goalmouth but that they had been assaulted on two
occasions by football supporters and they had had to retreat for their
safety.   i recognised need for evidence gathering and told them to
start filming the scene in the gym.     I do not remember seeing them
again.

I find it very difficult to recall the events in the gymnasium.     My
overall perception is one of dead bodies arriving and being carried by
shocked and perspiring police officers; by distressed people who were
obviously friends and relatives and by drunken people, sane of whan
were shouting and wanting to fight.   Injured people were arriving and
being directed to the far end of the hall and the scene was one of
increasing confusion.

                                                                         (8 )


    Seme degree of regulation began to take place as Inspector Charles and
    his team regulated the people in the gym and ejected the unruly ones.
    It would have been folly to try and separate the grieving relatives and
    friends frcm the bodies and many, many people were left standing around
    in the gymnasium helplessly, in all stages of distress.

    On several occasions I went through to the Police Roan to make use of
    the telephone which was in there, but the Police Roan was busy, the
    telephone was in use and when I bullied my way to the telephone the
    numbers I tried to get were engaged or unobtainable.

    At sane stage I recall having seen a police officer sat on a chair by
    the telephone in the Police Roan.   He had a big tear in his trousers.
    He was weeping openly.   He was quite obviously shocked.   I had a few
    words with him vdiich seemed to me to be totally inadequate and left
    him.

    At a very early stage I had deputed someone to arrange for the major
    incident boxes to come frcm Hairmerton Road and Ecclesfield and I asked
    Detective Inspector Scaife, at sane stage, to contact the Medico Legal
    Centre, assess their available capacity for bodies and to ring round
    the various hospitals and mortuaries in the district with a view to
    establishing the available capacities for dead bodies.

    I had also asked for the Coroner to be informed - which seemed at the
    time to be an absolutely incongruous request.

    At seme stage, I think after half an hour, I needed to make contact
    with the control box inside the ground to inform them of the situation
    in the gymnasium and as I was unable to contact them by telephone and I
    knew that any radio message passed would be relayed over every
    officer's radio in the ground, I went on foot.      I am now informed by
    Detective Inspector Towel 1 that he accompanied me, but my recollection
    of events is so blurred and distorted that I cannot remember him doing
    so, although I have no reason to doubt that he did.

    At the Police Control Box I spoke to Mr Addis and, whilst I cannot
    remember what I said to him, I must have told him the situation in the
    gymnasium.   I do remember speaking to the ACC Operations, Mr Jackson,
    and mentioning that amongst other problems we would have were the
    press, who were present in numbers. Mr Addis asked me to take him back
    to the gymnasium and as we left the area of the Police Box I remember
    hearing the Liverpool Manager, Kenny Dalglish, addressing the crowd and
    a ripple of applause went round the ground. Other than that I have no
    idea of what time it was.

    On my return to the gymnasium with Mr Addis I saw senior ambulance
    officials, in particular Alan Hopkins who I introduced to Mr Addis and
    ws discussed the eventual removal of bodies fran the gymnasium and who
    would be responsible.

    Mr Addis then took charge in the gymnasium and after a few minutes of
    assessing the situation he stood on a chair, called for order in the
    hall, and told police officers what he intended to do. The gymnasium
                                                                        (9 )


floor was littered with rows of bodies and I remember someone telling
me when I asked how many, "Seventy odd and more at the Northern
General".

Most of the bodies by this time had been draped with what appeared to
be white shrouds and I remember wondering where on earth they had corns
fran.    I was later to learn that they were, in fact, the paper
tablecloths which had been removed frcm the wooden tressle tables, now
piled up at the side of the gymnasium.

It was about this tune that I remembered that my youngest son was
somewhere in the crowd and almost all of the bodies, the feet of which
were protruding from under these tablecloths, seemed to have trainers
on identical to his.   I had to resist the urge to go and look at each
of the bodies.

It was decided that I should return to Hairmerton Road, assist in
setting up a Major Incident Room there and also arrange for the friends
and relatives to be bussed to Hairmerton Road Police Station.         I
arranged to be taken to Hammerton Road by a marked police car and
Detective Inspector Tcwell travelled in what I believe was the prison
bus, with anxious relatives and friends.

On arrival at Hammerton Road I found the place under v i r t u a l ^ siege.
Liverpool supporters were wanting to make urgent enquiries, many were
standing around not knowing what to do and someone had put out a call
for all off-duty social workers to report to Hammerton Road and there
were many social workers.   My first reaction was one of dismay at the
thought of so many social workers being directed to this area but, in a
very short time, it became apparent that they were to be invaluable and
provided a buffer between distressed relatives and fans, who had lost
contact with relatives and friends in the crowd, and the police.

I called together the Incident Room staff, who had arrived at the
Station to set up the Incident Room, and briefed them as to what had
occurred at the ground and the situation there. I should say here that
I was aware that arrangements had been made for the Casualty Bureau to
be activated. I was shortly to be informed howsver that all numbers to
the Casualty Bureau had already gone out over the radio, jamming all of
the lines, and as a result there was to be no police contact by
telephone with the Bureau for many hours.

Having told the Incident Room staff what had occurred they went about
the business of setting up the Incident Room at Hammerton Road.

I tried to make a telephone call to my home but could not get an
outside line. I later went to an adjacent building vdiere I knew there
was a direct outside line.   I telephoned home and established that my
son was safe.   I think the time was then about 6.30 pm but all I can
say for certain is that it was still daylight.

I was surprised to see Superintendent Sleath at Hammerton Road Police
Station in civilian clothes and he told me that he had responded to a
call for all off-duty police officers to go either to Hillsborough or
i t




                                                                          (10)


      the closest police station. Mr Sleath had assumed responsibility for
      relatives; liaison with Social Services and with the tencorary
      mortuary.

      During the course of the evening there were three other events
      unconnected with this incident, which required my attention. One was a
      potential firearms situation in 'FI' Sub-Division;       another was a
      potential firearms situation in 'F2' Sub-Division and the third
      involved the body of an old lady which had been found in a fire at her
      hone under suspicious circumstances. I asked Detective Chief Inspector
      Addison to go to Ecclesfield Police Station and deal with the body and
      deputed Detective Inspector Scaife to deal with the firearms incident
      there.

      I needed to speak to Detective Chief Inspector Addis on many occasions
      during the evening but contact with him was only possible by contacting
      people with him on channel 25 of the police radio and then requesting
      him to turn to channel 19, in the hope that our conversation would be
      more secure.

      At seme time during the evening, but not long after Mr Addison had left
      for Ecclesfield, I returned to the gymnasium for a conference with
      Mr Addis and found that the Coroner, Mr Popper, and the Heme Office
      Pathologist, Professor Usher, were in attendance. Professor Usher said
      that there was little he could do at the scene and agreed to go ovrer to
      Ecclesfield to look at the scene and the body there.         I arranged
      transport for him.

      The scene at the gymnasium was now much more orderly. The bodies had
      all been certified dead. There were a number of doctors in attendance;
      there vrere social workers; many grieving relatives and many many police
      officers, all of whem looked shocked, drawn and tired.

      I believe that it was at this stage I saw a man I recognised as
      PjpofossoiDv-, Duckworth, Psychologist, who lectures  at    police
      establishments on trauma connected with major incidents and, in
      particular, in his involvement with police officers following the
      Bradford fire.

      Mr Addis discussed with me his plans to photograph, with a polaroid
      camera, each of the bodies; to display these on a wall at a different
      part of the gymnasium and to have relatives brought, one lot at a time,
      to the gymnasium to be shown the photographs and, if a photograph was
      picked out, to have the body relating to that photograph removed frcm
      the hall into a temporary viewing roan and identified.

      We also discussed at that time our priorities and decided that no
      police enquiry could coimence that night and it was imperative that all
      police efforts should be directed towards the situation at the
      gymnasium; identification of the bodies and providing what assistance
      was possible to the relatives.

      I returned to Hammerton Road Police Station and closed down the
      Incident Roan, which had already ccrrmenced feeding the basic
#
                                                                        (11)


     information into the system.   For example, a copy of the Operational
     Order of the football natch.

     During the evening the relatives had been removed first to Hillsborough
     Boys Club premises across the road fran Harmierton Road Police Station,
     and then to the Church Hall on Forbes Road.

    The only information I can definitely set a time for is at 9.00 pn when
    I hac a conversation by telephone with the Deputy Chief Constable,
    Mr Hays, to update him of the operation.

    JUreq-jested that a conference be set up of all senior officers involved
    with a view to being able to supply the Chief Constable with a factual
    account of events in order that he could be properly prepared to meet
    the inevitable barrage for infomation fran the press.

    Mr Ha/s asked me to arrange for all senior officers concerned to be at
    the Conference Roan at Headquarters for 11.00 pm.     I remember looking
    at my Thatch at that stage to assess how much time I had.

    I had at least two other conversations, during the evening, with ACC
    Mr Jackson to update him, but I cannot remember the content of the
    conversation.

    I returned to the gymnasium at Hillsborough, spoke to Mr Addis and told
    him of the conference.

    I decxded that I ought then to have a look at the stand and terraces
    where the disaster had occurred, (even though it was in darkness) in
    order that I could be properly informed for the conference which was to
    folia*'. Although the light was not good it was light enough to give me
    sane indication of the devastation which had occurred.           I was
    accompanied by Detective Inspector Towel 1.

    We vent fran there through the tunnel and round to the turnstile area
    and or. our way back to the gymnasium saw the Chief Constable with a
    group of people at the scene.

    I informed the Chief Constable of the meeting being set up at 11.00 pn.
    I returned to the gymnasium.       I had a further conversation with
    Mr Addis and the Chief Constable then visited the gymnasium.     He was
    obviously looking at the scene carefully and was speaking to as many
    officers as he possibly could, offering words of encouragement.

    I believe shortly after this I returned with Chief Superintendent Addis
    who had not had the opportunity to visit the area of the disaster and
    together we vent fran there into the service road at the back of the
    South Stand where we discussed the prospect of approaching the many
    television crews now in attendance with a view to obtaining video
    recordings taken by them. Mr Addis decided against it.

    After I had returned to the gymnasium I went to Hammerton Road Police
    Station with Detective Inspector Towel 1. I made arrangements for video
    recordings to be     available at the Conference Room at Police

      Headquarters.    I travelled to Headquarters with Detective Inspector
              °n   t0       that tiie conference had been cancelled for that
      night and was re-arranged for 9.00 am the following morning.         I
      returned to Hammer ton Road Police Station and went off duty at around
      2.15 am.                                                   J


      011 ffTival home at about 2 -30 am I discovered that my youngest boy had
      picked up two distressed Liverpool fans, one of whan had been parted
        ram his brother, and these two young men ware sleeping at my hcxne.

      I returned to work for 7.30 am the following day and during the days
      that follcwsd I was in charge of the Incident Roan at Hamnerton Road
      Police Station.

      At 12.30 pm on Tuesday 18 April 1989, as a result of a conversation I
      had with Inspector Sykes, I returned to Sheffield Wednesday Football
      Club and examined the blue wrought iron perimeter gates which I have
      previously mentioned. These gates had by this time been turned into a
      shrine and flowers were piled up against them and scarves tied to them.
      I saw that one of the bolts, which secured a gate by dropping into a
      hole in the asphalt, was bent and that another such bolt on a different
      gate had gouged out a groove in the asphalt sane 18" to 2' long, and
      that this damage was quite obviously recently caused.     I returned to
      Hammerton Road Police Station and made arrangements for the gates to be
      photographed.

      At 2.30 pm that same day, at a conference between Mr Jones, Assistant
      Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, Chief Superintendent Bevington
      of that Force, Detective Chief Superintendent Addis and myself, Mr
      Jones formally assumed responsibility for the enquiry into the disaster
      and an entry to that effect was made on the H.O.L.M.E.S. Management
      Policy File.

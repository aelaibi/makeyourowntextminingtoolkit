M o u n t e d offic e r s who were               trying       to get        some      order.                      It seemed to me

        an    impossible        task,       the fans were             in no sort           of order,        all    crushing

        towards      the      turnstiles,           fans were         climbing        over      the walls.          Radio

        traffic was h e a v y a n d at times                      I was     unable      to hear due          to the noise

        levels      of tfcre crowd.              As S u p e r i n t e n d e n t   Marshall,       repeated his

        order     for    the    gates       to be opened.

        In view of this              the    gates were            op e n e d and     the    crowd        rushed    in en

        block.       My serial         were       debus s e d and          i n i tially     tried to        prevent any

        non ticket         holders         entering         the    ground.

        Wi t h i n a few m o m e n t s          I heard a radio mess a g e                 that    the     fans were

        invading        the    pitch and           for all        officers        to enter        the     ground.        My

        serial      were      immediately           d i r ected onto          the    pitch at the Leppi n g s Lane

        end of the ground,                 where      I could        see     many fans          on the    pitch and       many

        trying      to get      over       the     barriers.              At this    stage       Ib e l i e v e d that    a

        pitch     invasion wals taking                  place,      with      other     officers          I tried to

        e n courage      fans    to    leave        the     playing area,            but from their            reactions

        a n d the    fact      that    many        seemed      injured        I feared       that        there were

        serious      problems         in the        centre        pen,,

        My s erial/was          moved       back from this a r e a beyond                    the    centre        line    to

        Suprintenderit           Nesbit.
m T~m        ter a few m i n u t e s        I began        to see         people     being      carried awa y on

        stretchers,           fans were          pulling       hoa r d i n g s    from the        perimeter       track        to

        use as      stretchers,            to    carry what         I thought were              injured      fans away.

        I then a s s i s t e d       several        young men who were                having       d i f f i c u l t y standing

        and    breathing        m a n y were        just     c ollapsing          on the     pitch,        I w a s n ’t sure

        what    had happened.               Other      youths       were      shouting       obscenities          at me

 A      calling me a m u r d e r i n g            bastard and             telling     me    it was       the Police's

        fault,      c a m eramen an d           p h o t ographers         from the m edia were              being
                                                                                                                      R486

           threatened with            violence,        one youth         tried to      punch me       but was       stopped

           by his friends            who   said      it w a s n ’t rny f a u l t .     1 saw officers            crying

           and distressed.             Even at this           stage      I did n o t     realise      the scale of

           events.

           I   saw one officer             giving     the kiss      of    life    to a young          boy who       had

           apparently        stopped        breathing,        the   officer       carried on tor             sortie time,      I

           tried     to   comfort      two of his           friends,      and a s c e r t a i n e d   the young        boy s

           name,     I saw him being             taken a w a y      on a stretcher.             I then saw          that

           there were        dozens        of   people      being taken a wa y on the mak e s h i f t

           stretchers,          it was      then that        I thought       that a few         people may have died.

            I remained for           the most        part    in the      cordon of . otf icers across                 the

            pitch until         it was      clear.        I was     then given the order               to    resume my

           Tanqo 3 duties.             On       leaving     the   back    of L e p p i n g s Lane      stand,       I saw

            Inspector      S y k e s and DC Pont,            I went      to them and a s k e d what             had

            happened,      as    I was      speaking        1 saw some dozen Liverpool                  supporters

            behind a barrier            erec t e d     to serene       them from view,            they were all

            dead.      I c o u l d n ’t believe         that m any were          dead,     I was      then    to.Ld that

            there were       almost        eighty dead toodi e s          in the       gymnasium.           I was     stun Tied

END OF RE P O R T
  P.S. 19^8 Derek James Miller        •D' F2   Ecclesfield




At 9*00am on Saturday 15th April 1989 I paraded at Ecclesfield
Police station in respect of the semi final and together with
other members of 'D' group was transported to the ground for a
10.00am briefing in the north stand.
I was aware of my duties for that date, the seriel number and
officers designated to that seriel.
My duties were that of seriel ^8, call sign TANQ0 THHEE, and the
following officers were designated.
1. P.C. 1301 Cherry           Deepcar section
2 . IffVS. 2172     Prince    B group
3. P.C. 3278 Stagg            B group
k, P.C. 893 Hague             B group
5 . P.C. 3 1 ^ Hobinson^Powell   B group (off duty sick)

The duties of this seriel were to patrol Wadsley and Middlewood
areas, paying paticular attention to licenced premises, and to
maintain order.

At 10.00am a briefing was conducted in the North Stand by Chief Supt
Duckenfield, Supt Murray, and Chief Insp Beal. At the conclusion of
this briefing I saw Inspector Walker call sign India 19 who was in
charge of seriels   ,**7»**8 » In respect of my duties, as I had carried
out these duties before and was aware of the likely problems nothing
was raised by Inspector Walker which presented any problem.
I collected my radio checked that it was working, collected keys for
the transit van, and packed meals for the officers on the seriel.
We commenced patrol shortly after 11.00am, As P.C. 3 1 ^ Kobinson-Powell
had not attended the briefing, and not being aware that she had reported
sick, we attended at’Ecclesfield Police Station to collect her, & was at
this stage I was informed that she had reported sick.
The seriel was then directed by me to attend at Deepcar Police station
for meal prior to commencing patrdl at 11 .30 am.

At 11.30am we commenced patrol in the designated aread of Wadsley and : i
Middlewood. Police constable 1301 Cherry was the deputed driver, I was
front seat passenger and the remainder were seated in the rear of the vehicle.

L- was apparent from this early stage that there were considerable numbers
of Liverpool supporters in the area, many walking away from the ground
towards local public houses,
An initial check was made of the local public houses, including the following,
1. The Middlewood Tavern, situate in Middlewood Road, some 1-J miles from
the ground, this was full of liverpool supportes who were in high spirits
 but presenting no problems.
2. The Beehive situate in Dykes Hall Rd, the house was full but doors
were locked preventing overcrowding and congregation of fans outside.
3. The Sportsman, situate in Worral Rd, this again contained a full house
of Liverpool supporters, again in high spirits but presenting no problems.
k. The Horse and Jockey, situate at the junction of Wadsley Lane, Warral Rd,
Dykes Hall Rd, Laird Rd and Collin Ave. This public hous was full to capacity
with fans having spilled over the junction, many were sat and grouped together
on the verges of this junction, in high spirits but no disorder was apparent,
the numbers at this stage outside the public house numbered appro* 100 .


A general patrol was made in the area and no public order situations were
encountered, regular passing checks of the public houses were made.
During this period there were no great problems with Liverpool fans or their
behaviour.
At about 1.30pm a further check was made at the Horse and Jockey and it was
immediately apprent that numbers had swelled to approx 300 drinking outside
the public house, the majority were young single men and noise levels had escalated
there were no signs of disorder but may looked to be drinking very heavily, this
was accompanied by the usual boistrous singing and chanting.
At this stage match control was informed of the numbers and conditions and that
it may be advisable to send another mabile to assist to disperse the group towards
the ground, I was advised no one was available and to moniter the situation on
site.
In view of this the vehicle was parked at the junction to observe the group and to
prevent any likely dissorder. It was necessary to advise a minority group regarding
the chanting of obscenities but they accepted the advice and remained goofl humered.
It was obvious however at this stage that many of the young men were still drinking
heavily and some were obviously drunk.
Other fans were still walking up Wadsley ijane towards the public housees at this
time.
At approximately 2 .10 pm the group outside the Public house and arround the junction
were begging tb get out of hand, many were drunk, glasses and bottles were being
broken, either deliberately of throught sheer drunkeness, they began to urinate in
local residents gardes, the situation seemed to bsasx be getting out of hand, but I
must stress there was no violence or anymosity directed towards the POLICE or any
other members of the publicfcdrin^ seemed to be taking over.
In view of this assistance was again requested from match control, in order that
the public house could be closed and the fans moved away towards the ground.

At 2.15 I was joined by another Tango Mobile, with Police Sergent Johnson in charge.
Together we entered the public house and the landlord was advised to close the bar,
this he agreed to do but from his reactions that was iminent anyway as he had sold
out of beer.
The fans were moved away in groups towards the ground and some were advised that their
drunkeness would deny them access to the ground.
Match control was advised of the action taken and that approx *f00 + fans were being
directed to the ground many under the influence of drink, this was acknowledged.


At approximately 2.^5 I directed our seriel to travell towards the leppings lane area
and to escort the remaining fans to that area.
On arrival in Leppings Lane we were met by the sight of thousands of fans
outside the turnstiles, I could see Supt Marshall stood on the paraphit of
the bridge by the side of the turnstiles, he was requesting that the gates
be opend as there was a large crush outside the turnstiles and that there was
a danger of people being killed in the crush. I could not see any officers
other that two mounted officers who were trying to get some oreder, It seemed
to me an impossible taskt the fams were in no sort of orderrall crsushing
towards the turnstiles, fans wer climbing ober the walls. Badio traffic was
heavy and at times i was unable to hear due to the noise levels of the crowd.
As Supt Marshal repeated his requests for the gates to be opend I heard match
control give the order for the gates to be opend.
In view of this the gates were opend and the crowd rushed in en block. Mj seriel
were debussed and initially tried to prevent any none ticket holders entering the
groung,
 Within a few moments I heard a radio message that the fans were invading the pitch
and for all officers to enter the ground. My seriel were immediately directed
onto the pitch at the leppings lane end of the ground, where I could see many
fans on th pitch and m ^ trying to get over the barriers. At this stage I believed
that a pitch invasion was taking place, with other officers I tried to encourage
fans to leave the playing area, but from their reactions and the fact that many
seemed injured I feared that there were serious problems in the centre pen.
My seriel was moved back from this area beyond the centre line to form a cordon with
numerous other officers, which is the position I believe thef,maitained, this was
on the instructions of Chief Supt Nesbit.
After a few minuites I began to see people being carried away on streatchefcsy
fans were pulling hoardings from the perimiter track to use as stretchers, to
carry what i thought were injured fans away.
I then assisted several young men who were having difficulty standing and breathing
many were just collapsing on the pitch, I wasnt shure what had happend. Other
youths were shouting abscenities at me calling me a murdering bastard, and telling
me it was the polices fault, camera men and photographers from the media were
being threatend with violence, one yout tried to punch me but-was stopped by his
friends who -said it wasny my fault, I saw officers crying and distressed Even
at this stage i did not realise the scale of events.
I saw one officer giving the kiss of life to a young bay who had apparently
stopped breathing, the officer carried on fw> some time, I tried to comfort two
of his friends, and kxMx±kKxfeKyxxK5CX« ascertained the young boys name, I saw
him being taken away on a strefcfcher. I then saw that the were dozens of people being
taken away on the make shift stretchers, I was then that I thought that a few people
 may have died.

I remaind for the most part in the cordon of officers across the pitch untill
it was clear. I was then given the order to reume my Tango 3 duties. On leaving the
back of leppings lane stand, I saw Inspector sykes and D.C. Pont, I went to them and ai
asked what had happend, as i was speaking I saw some dozen liverjjool supporters
behid a barrier errected to serene them from view, they were all dead, I couldnt
believ that many were dead, I was then told that the were almost eighty dead bodys
in the gymnasium, i was stunned and couldnt believ what was said, i have little
recollection of what I did after that because my mind was in turmoil, i can
remember being repeatedly called a murdering bastard by fans as they left.
We remained on patrol untill the crowas had dispersed and at 9»30pm I retired from dutj

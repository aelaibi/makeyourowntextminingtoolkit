a d d i t i o n we were all           carrying          our    personal         issue    first-aid          bags,,

g r o u n d and     thought        how     the Spion Hop and S o u t h S tand were                         full

already        (The    time       now being after 2 . 1 5              pm)      and    the    terracing        below

the West Stand w here                 1 understood             the L i v e r p o o l    fans     to be being

noticeably          empty of         the    normal         number     of fans         you w oula      expect        by

t h a t t im e a n a big game .                     n e s i t u a t i o n was    t n e s a nie in t h e N o r t n

Stand,       I would        even     say at about 2.1 5               pm there         appeared       to be only as

m a n y as 30--40 fans,,

I could        not say       there       was    anything        else     I noticed           until    about       the

time     the    players        came      out.        It was     immediately            prior    to the        players

coming       out    that a p o l i c e m a n         in my     corner      had    told me that             the game

had     been       delayed,,         I remember            in view     of that         I was    s u r p r i s e d at     the

players        com i n g    out.      The      p o l iceman who        told      us was a stout man who                      is

r egu 1a r 1y :i.n t hat          c o r ner.

As    the    players        did    come     out      1 remarked        on how         the terrace          under       the

West    Stand       had filled           up a l t h o u g h    the    sides      of    the    terraces        aid

a ppea r t o s till          have     ro om .

1 knew       that     the    crowd       in the        cent ra 1 sect i ons rnust have                been     tightly
p acked       because            they were            swaying             in a mass.

I think        it was            just a fter           k i c k-off            that      1 noticed           some       fans       being

p ulled        up from t h e             t e r r a c e d are a into the west S t a n d . I also saw

some        fans climbing                over the central perimeter fences of the terraced

a r e a arm w a 1 k i n g          around            the       track       to    climb        into N o r t h Stand.

I did        not know what                 was       going          on b u t     it a p p e a r e d       people were

colla p s i n g          more     than         invading             the    pitch,,           On seeing my              c o lleagues           in

the     vicinity            of     the West S t a n d                b e e a m i ng     involved          in what was              going       on

my     h u s b a n d went         down         triers to            investigate.                  I saw two           fans    climb over

the     fence and a p p a r e n t ! y                 collapse             by the           posts.        At     this       point     I

t hou g h t    our        s t relcner           may    be       neeaed          so together             w ith       all     the    staff       in

our     corner           we went         down        the       track       towards           the w e s t       S tand       end.

As we were               getting         towards           tin e     corner          of S o u t h S t a n d and West S tand a

police        officer             came     over and             placed a young                    lad on our           trolley.           1

ina a not      reacne a the                two       1 nad or i g n a l i y                 seen    collapse           nor    aid     I to

the     best       of my k n o w l e d g e            see       them a g a i n          later.          The y outh who was

placed        on the trol l e y                 was a white y o u t h and 1 think he was                                       wear i n g a

Liverpool            shirt,,            His     face       was        very clue             and    he was not           conscious.

He     was    breathing             although           he       was       clearly           struggling,,              I checked         his

pulse        and     found         he    haa     a f ast            p u lse     so     to    assist       his       breathing         I gave

him     a    couple         of     inflations              fay m e a n s        of m o u t h       to m o u t h .         I checked        his

pulse        again        and      found        it    to       be    strong          and     rapid      but      his      condition           had

clearly        started            to     improve           a    little,,             1 was      about       to      turn     him    into

I turned and           left       the      nurse     with     the     boy,      the    next    thing       I saw was a

p o l i c e w o m a n who    was a s s i s t i n g an e l d e r l y            gentleman,,        He was      lying        on

the    pitch near           the    corner.           He was      in his         early    sixties,          he had grey

hair and was           of slim          build,,        1 think        he wore         a suit with          shirt     and

tie    because        one    of the         first      things        1 did was         to help the          p o l i c ewoman

loosen his           tie.       He was       trying       to sit       up ana was            clearly       very

d i s t r e s s e d and had a grey                complexion which               to myself        indicate a he had

some    sort     of    near t trouble,,              I remember           the    po 1 i c ©woman was asking

him a bo ut      his      heart.           The    Policewoman          got      behind       him and was allow i n g

him to        raise    himself          slightly        by leaning             on her    knees,        For    trie

symptons        he was       exhibiting             she a p p e a r e d       to be aoing       the    correct        task

of    r eassur i ng him and                s to p p 1 ng wit h h i m .          I cine cked hi '5 p u 3.se whi ch

a p p a r e n t l y was     of a safe            level.       I could not             describe       the    policewoman.

1 left        this man then went                  slightly       back along            the side       of the S o u t h

Stand        towards      trie players            tunnel      where       I    could    see    two men who were

giving CPR            to a fan who               I think was         on the      pitch       as oppo s e d to        the

t ra c k „     I w s n t o v a r tow inere           they were         and as k e d           i f t h ey needed        ine 1p „

Tne man        doing      the     bre a t h i n g    told me         that      he was a doctor,              1 rem&mDer

now that        as    he said         this       I thought       the      casualties          head was       not allow i n g

a complete'.! y clear way so                      I immediate ly went                 down,    raised       the

                 I am Police Constable 3077 Weeks                  in the S o u t h Yorkshire Police Force,

                 currently stationed at Doncaster.

                 At 8. 30am S a t u r d a y    15-th April      1989 I was           on duty at Doncaster Police

                 S t at io n for the semi-final           football       m atch between Liverpool             and

                 N ot ti n g h a m Forest,      We then    left for S h e f f i e l d by coach and at 9. 4 5 a m

                 we had a briefing            in the N orth S tand at           t/Ke H i l l s b o r o u g h Ground.     I

                 After     the briefing at         10,15arn we had a packed               lunch   in the N o r t h Stand.

as far as the Old Blue Ball                        public: house            for   public order            reasons and

to prevent          looting       from shops.             At this       time       1 was   in company wit h PC.

290 9 Wild.

Upon    our arrival          we saw small               groups     of both sets of supporters

could see that some                of the supporters were                     carrying        cansydT        beer and
                                               __________
lager which they were                 consuming whilst walking.

As    the a f t ernoon       p rogressed the amount                   of supporters            increased.

About     12 midday a member                 of the       public      informed us that a large                        group

of Liverpool          fans    running         through the Coop store.                      We made          enquiries

at the Coop,          and they        informed us that                the fans had            left without

causing any damage.

Whilst     on patrol         we    found that            the S h a k e s p e a r e    public house

B r ad fi el d Rd was        closed at         the front           but open at the             rear /o         local

c us i.-ome r s ,

F ro m our arrival           until      1,30pm we saw numerous                       football     s upporters             from

both    clubs       buying    beer and         lager from the T h r e s h e d Off Licence                         on

M i d dl e w o o d Rd.

At 3 , 0 5 p m we heard on the                radio of P C . 222 3 Pufrvis that                   there was            some

trouble      inside      the ground.               We then walked yto PS Perry and                          informed
                                                              /
him what we had heard on the                           radio'.

Sgt P erry then           instructed us and the                    rest      of Serial        23 to       return to

L e p pings Lane,         At this           time/half         of the serial            were    tr a n s p o r t e d    to

the    ground by         transit      van,     whilst            myself and PC wild,           PS         P e r r y and

others wal k e d         to the ground.                 On   the way to the ground               I        saw a group

of Liverpool          supporters            w alking awa y from the ground.                       PS P e r r y asked

them where          they were       going and they stated that                         they had no ticKeus

and had not been able                 to buy any at the gates.

On my arrival            at Leppings Lane we                  patrolled           the area outside
                                    _____      _   .                 ....                            __


ground      next to the           corner      shop.          At this time there were                      small numbers

of L i v erpool       fans    filtering            out of the ground                 from the L e p pings Lane
                                                                                                       PAG E          3
                                                                                                       S1915

            end.      I could see 'that nearly everyone               of the fans were      in tears     or      in

            a very distraught           c o nditi on and they were       directing a lot of abuse at

            the    police.      Within 2 min u t e s     of our arrival     2 fire     engines a r r i v e d at

            L e p pings Lane,       and a short       time   later   these were f o l lowed by other

            ambul a n c e s and tire      engines.

            At this        time there were an         increasing amount      of fans    coming   out    of the

            g round making          it difficult      for the e m ergency vehicles       to get /access.

            We then tried to help the e m ergency vehicles                  through the y r owd but           our

            efforts were        hampered    by the Liverpool         fans who were v^ry abusive

            towards        us and    ignoring   our    instructions.

            Some a m b ulance       crews asked for directions           of where    to go and where          to

            get    into the ground.

            We    remained there until          4.43pm when an        Inspector   of Serial 23 told us

            to    resume     to M id dl ew oo d Rd and to      return to the North S t a n d at 3 . 3 0 p m

            f or de-brief.

            At 6. 1 5 p m we a t t e n d e d C l a yfields   Lane where a coach was         provided     for

            our    return to Doncaster.

                                                                                                    SI G N E D

LINKS WITH SHEFFIELD SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENT




1   .   Neil Kay is keen for a meeting later this week to look at ?ol^ ° r a t i o n
        between Sheffield and the seven authorities participating in
        Hillsborough.   I have tentatively suggested to him that we do this on
        Friday.   I would seek agreement from the Group for time to be made avai
        for a joint meeting between this group and the Sheffield group.

        Briefing and visits to Service Centres so that Sheffield staff are aware
        of our action.

        Meeting between Neil Kay and Directors to review the positlon^to-hichl
3.
        hope wi nay also be able to invite David White, Director of Social Services
        Nottinghamshire.

        The Chair of Sheffield Social Services Committee has already met £ ^ a l r
        of Liverpool Social Services Committee and I understand that the Chairs nay
        also be getting together on Friday.

         I offer this as information given the views and attitude of some
         Politicians with whom we are working.

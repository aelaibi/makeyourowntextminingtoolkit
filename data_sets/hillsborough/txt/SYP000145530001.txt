       No not     really.        Apart     from the outer          sliding door which sometimes

       sticks.       It's    the door that has to be opened to allow the                            crowd

       through to that           particular        turnstile.

       Don't ask me which ones,                there are        several,      they seem to rust a

       ade quate    policing at       turnstiles.

       I said that's a laugh?            we've    heard   it all     before.      T hey disappear

       and watch the match.            He told me       it w ould be well        policed.

       There were      no Police      Officers     posted to the        inside    of the Gr o u n d

       At the start          of the season we had verbal             instructions           from the

       Fire Brigade          on how to use fire          extinguishers.         A Police Officer

       gave us a talk' on basic First Aid.

       We were     told      if a message was         put over     the    loudspeakers,

       "Hr.     ME ADOWS     is required at Police Control",                it meant        there was

       an e m ergency and for the stewards to open the gates and we would

       leave the turnstiles and go to our office                         beneath the S Stand.

       When we hear,,         "Mr. MEAD O W S    is no    longer    required at Police

       Control",      that means       everything        is alright.

            I live at the above address              with my    parents                         and also my

            sister                 iged 18 years.      I have      lived   in              for about          13

           years.

           My main        interests    are    playing football       and also     I am a life          long

            s u p porter       of Liverpool Football       Club.     I have been a se a s o n ticket

            holder    for about 6 years.           First    of all    I was     in the stands         and for

            the    last    couple of season       I have been on the Kop.             I travel        to every

We had all appl i e d to A n f i e l d for tickets               for the F.A.         Cup semi     final

at Hillsborough.              As we were season ticket             holders we were a l l o c a t e d a

six    pound standing          ticket     each.     We a c t u a l l y went    to A n f i e l d and got

them the week           before    the game.         My dad had a ticket          for the seating
                                                                                             ^ U~\
stands     but as he was work i n g he gave his up and my                       cousin

have his       ti c k e t .

We had a g r e e d that all         four of us w ould travel            down by coach and my

mum made      the arra n g e m e n t s   for us thro u g h A m b e r l i n e    co a c h e s, W o o d End

Lane,    Speke Liverpool.             We were to meet the           coach at the S h o p p i n g

City    in R u n c o r n at 9.45.        We were all       being    escorted about          going to

the game.

I left my house at about 9 .30 am on S a t u r d a y the                      15th of April.        My

father took me           in the    car and we d i r ected the others              up,   thats

                     and Kevin.       The    coach was     there w h e n we a r r i v e d and      I

think we were the first ones on,                     We then went to Widnes and then

got on to Liverpool.               The    coach was     full   by now.         Everyone     had a seat.

T here was a video on the                coach and we just all watc h e d that.                 There

was    no rowdyism on the           coach.        E v e ryone was good natured and enjoying

themselves.           We tr a v e l l e d down the motorway.           I o nly     recall    a bit o f

t raffic     jam,     I think that was w hen we got              into or near Sheffield.                 We

had all      taken a packed         lunch with us.

We a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at about    1j>m at the big      coach park.         We walked

together      for about 5 m i n u t e s      to the ground.          Whe n we got there we were

all    searched at the turnstiles                 end then a l l o w e d through.         I think the

No at the turnstile was 8.                   I handed my ticket         in,     the   counterfoil        was

ripped off and then it was                  given back to me.                   never    came through

wit h us as he had a seat.

We got through the t u rnstile and wa l k e d thro u g h the tunnel                         to pen 3 .

T here was         hardly anyone      in the ground and we all                sat down and were

reading      programmes.

                                                                                                    SI 601

I remember the        players      coming out onto the           pitch to have a look

around.      We were standing          up then the       pen was filling           up but you         could

still move about          comfortably.

At about     ten to three the          players    came out and by this time the                      pen

was    very packed.        We were standing about             half way up and              in the middle

of the terracing.

K e v i n and Steve were      standing       on my    left.      G r a d u a l l y over the next few

minutes     I was   pushed further and further                down the t e rracing            towards

the front.        1 was    unable     to do a n y thing a bout        it you just          had to move

w ith the    crowd.

I had become s e p e r a t e d from K e v i n and                 and    couldn;t see them.                  As

I .got to the front near             the gate    I could see K e v i n behind me but

c o u l d n ’t get near him.         The   crowd was still        swaying a bit and then all

of a sud d e n there was a real            crush from the back.               I couldn't move.                  I

managed     to get my arms         free that was all.            I could hardly breathe and

it was so hot.         I fainted at this          point.       I blacked out and then                 I

r eckon someone must         have knoc k e d me because            I came     round.        E v e ryone
                                                                                                                        I
was    really panicking and screaming.                 I remember        one of the gates             being

opened and fans trying             to scramble       out.     A P o l i c e m a n was      pushing

people back       in and then he shut           the gate.        E v e n t u a l l y the    crowd

managed     to open the gate and            people spilled out           onto the pitch.I             don't

know how     I did it but       I e v e n t u a l l y m a n a g e d to walk   back down

the tunnel       and got to the back of the stand.

I was d e s p e r a t e l y trying    to find               and Kevin.        I had a good           look

round but     couldn't see them.             I went back       to the      coach but they were

*nt there.        I went    back     to the ground and just waited about.                       I went

back    to the    coach several        times and e v e n t u a l l y found

but we    couldn't     find Kevin.         We stayed on the           coach and there were

still a few people missing.                A Policeman        told us to drive out of

S h e f f i e l d and if they found anyone           else they w ould get them home.                       We

             t r a v e l l e d back   to                    I rang my mu m and dad to let then kno w             I

             was alright and then went                    home.

             It was     the Su n d a y morn i n g         that    I learned that K evin T Y R E L L had died in

             the tragedy.

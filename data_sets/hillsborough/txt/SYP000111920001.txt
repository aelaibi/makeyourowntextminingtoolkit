                On Saturday,            1S April          1989,     I was      on duty from 8 a.m.                 and due        to

                 fi ni sh at a r o u n d 8 p.m.                1   came    on duty at At te rc li ff e Police S t a t io n

                 regarding        the football             match that          day     between Liverpool             and

                 N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

                At    10 a.m.       I   a t t e n d e d at M i d la nd       train station            in S h e f f i e l d   in

                 company w ith Pol ic e C o n s ta bl e                 1790 Craighill.               We were       s up er vising

                 fans a l ighting          from the football                 specials and service                  trains,         T h ey

                were      then being        taken         to H i l l s b o r o u g h   by double de ck ed buses.                   Police

                H i l l s b o r o u g h at, a r o u n d    1.30     p.m.       After      arriving at H i l l s b o r o u g h our

                    erial    lead by P ol i c e S er geant 8 40 Wright,, a ss e m b l e d                       near    to the

                P ol ic e Room,           We were         to be a       reserve        serial     at the      ground.

                At about 2.5 0            p.m.     we were         d ir ected       by Police S er ge an t Wright                 to go

                to the L ep p i n g s Lane           end of the            ground as         there was        some     kind of

                trouble.         We went a long              the    back     of the N orth Stand and                 into     the area

                b ehind the t u rn st il es               at the L ep p i n g s Lane           end,    there       I saw an

                Inspector,         I do not         know who he was.                   He was     looking       thro ug h the

                glass       in the      sliding metal              gates     to the       right     of the     turns ti le s
    vi ew ed from the             back.     He S ee m e d to be         contemplating          opening     the

    gates,      this a p p e a r e d      to be as there was a large                   crowd g at he re d and

    outside         th/f people that were             coming t h r ou gh the t urnstiles Were

    saying t h i n g s       3.1 ke,    " I T ' S '-MURDER- OUT THERE,         S O M E O N E W I L L GET

    KTL^K>»"          I looked         through the glass             in the doors and           X could see

      hat t he re was a large               crowd of people             behind the gates,              someone

    m e n t i on e d that     if the       gates were          opened we would get, t ra mp l ed               in the

    r'rush.     The    Inspector          seemed to have d e c id ed against                  opening t h e      gates

    I then went         to t h e , t ur ns ti le s        at the      left   hand end and above            those

L   t ur ns tiles      I could see          some youths             climbing    over the       railings and

    onto      the    roof of        the turnstiles.            These were          being    helped over by          a

    Po li ce    Inspector           who was also on the              roof.     I helped a few youths

    down from the            roof and then my a t t e n t i o n was                 drawn to a man on the

    ou tside        of one    of the       turnstiles.              He was   bent     over the t urnstiles

    and a sked        for    help.        He was     obv io us ly      being    pressed agai ns t          the

    t u rn stile      by the        crowd outside.             The    t urnstile w ould not            turn because

    of the      pressure on            it and     I kicked the          turnstile          back after      telling

    the man what            I was      going     to do„        The    t urnstile       turned and the man

    fell      towards me.           I a s c e r t a i n e d that      he was        uninjured.    I took         him to

    one side a nd told him to take                        it   st ea dy u n t i l    he got    his w in d back.

    I continued helping                 people thro ug h the turnstiles who were                         having     the

    same      problem and           I could see       that a lot of people were                  simply holding

    their      tickets       in     the air in the         rush they were not having                   their

    t ickets        taken from them.             At this        time    there were, two          or three        other

    P ol ic e C o n s t a b l e s   a ro u n d me,     but who.       I do not know.

    As   the    pressure          from the       crowd eased          and    the     turnstiles began

    oper ating        properly,         I m oved back          from the turnstiles.               I then became

    a ware     that    there were a lo t             of    people      stood    in the are a behind the

    t urnstiles and a r o u n d            the    caravan       type    trailer       from w h i c h    programmes

    were      being    sold.        S o m eo ne m e n t i o n e d    to me   that a gate         to my     left was

now      clear     if I W a n t e d toeject a n y o n e ,                   I think     it was a steward who

 said this         to m e .

 I then became a w ar e of Police S er ge a n t Wright and others                                     ffom my

serial      running       towards        the S outh Stand.                   I was b ec ko ne d to go with

 the m and       I f o l l o w e d as they a p p e a r e d            to be' a t tending       something

•important.          We went a ro u n d the side of the                         stand and onto the

 p erimeter       of the      pitch.        This was          only      possible by going             through a

 locked gate w h i c h we were               stood at           for ar ou nd 45 seconds               to one

minute.          It was    e ve nt u a l l y opened by a steward.                          I went ar ou nd the

 perimeter        track, to face the barriers                         behind the goal m ou th at the

 Le-opings Lane          end.       I could see a small                     gate    in the    barriers?       I think

      was   open at       the      time.     I was        going to go through this gate w hich

 goes     into the       left hand         pen as       vi ew ed from the             pitch.        I Was    unable

 to do this at           first      due to fans           crowding           to see what was          happening

 in the      centre      pen.       Some    of the        crowd were            brought out         onto the       pitch

 and others m o v e d         back       to allow us          in.       Whe n      1 got    in I went       to the

^ d ividing      fence    betw ee n the          left hand            pen and the          centre    pen.     This

 fence was         about    6 feet       high with         spikes on top.                  I saw    at the other

 side     of the     fence people           pressed very close to                   it.I s t r u gg le d to

 help several          people       over    the fence,               some    of these were          injured and

 others a p p e a r e d to         be just       ' w i n d e d 1'.     I can remember          one white       haired

m an who was about              6 0 - 7 0 years       old,      he     looked very bad.              It took       some

 time     to get     him over        the fence an d w hen we had,                      I took       him to one

 side,      loosened his           clothing and sat him down.                         After    taking       some    deep

 breaths      he a p p e a r e d    to    come    round slightly.                   I told him to keep sat

 down for a while             and he said he was                     feeling       better.

S om e    of the     fans were a great help                     but     I can remember             being    spat at

an d being v er ba l l y a bu s e d          several          times.          I can also       remember       being

 either     kicked or t h u m p e d         in the        back        on a couple          of occasions.           After

helping       several      people        over     I W o u l d say about              10 to    15 people,       I

became aware         of a large           pile of          people about            four to five      deep at the

o t h er side of the            fence/         Quite a number              of these were pa ss ed over

the f ence by Police 0 f f i cers and                          ci vi 1 i a n s I     can r.emetriber checking            ;

for the      pulse      on a few of them whilst we were                             carrying    them.       I was

a ware of other P ol i c e O f f i c e r s a ro u n d me doing the same thing                               that     1

was and helping            people        over and          carrying them away.               I tried to

a d m in is te r m o ut h to m o u t h         r e s u s c it at io n onto some of them that we

were 'carryifig away              but    it was a w k w a r d whilst               trying to    carry them as

we 11.                                     .    .

Most      of the    injured and           bodies          that     I helped        carry were      t aken to the

small      gate that       I had come through.                       I can remember a S er ge a n t who

was wearing         a y e l l o w anorak and was                   not   from the S o ut h Yor ks h ir e

Police,      he a p p e a r e d    to he handling a lot                    of the     injured and the

bodies      that we       passed        through the             small     gate.      1 think    he was      taking

them onto         the   pitch somewhere.                   I    think     I helped to       remove a ro u n d      10

or    12 bodies and whe n               it a pp e a r e d       that     they had all       gone     or were

being a t t e n d e d     to,     I came       back       out     of the    pitch.        I cannot describe

very well         any   of the bodies               that       I was     involved with,        but    I think

that almost         all    of them were male.                     .Some, 'of them being very he av il y

built with ages            varying         from a ro u n d         16 to 50; years.

W hen     I had    returned        onto     the      pitch I began to gen er al ly help moving

people and 'trying to assist                        the    doctors and ambulancemen.                   I cannot

remember muc h          of what         happened whe n             I was    back out      on the      pitch.

The      next, .thing. I can        remember          is going w ith the              rest of our       serial

out of the         ground and walking up P e n i s t o n e R oad to                       a spot where         the

buses were         parked to take the fans                       back to the        M i d la nd Station.       Not

many      people    used these           buses and we e ve nt u a l l y went                back     into the

E ND OF REP O R T
’   POLICE CONSTABLE DAVID CARL TRANTER 492.               ATTERCLIFFE SUB DIVISION 'B' GROUP.

    On Satruday 15 April 1989 I was on duty frcm 8 am and due to finish at around

    8pm.      I came on duty at Attercliffe Police Station at                     8am and attended a

    briefing at West Bar Police                Station regarding the football match that day

    between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

    At   10am I attended at Midland Train                 Station in Sheffield in company with

    PoliceConstable 1790 Craighill.              We were supervising fans alighting frcm the

    football       specials    and    service     trains,    they     were     then   being    taken     to

    Hillsborough by double decked buses.                  Police Constable Craighill and myself

    travelled on one          of these buses       to Hillsborough at around 1.30pm.                  After

    arriving       at   Hillsborough     our    serial    lead   by   Police    Sergeant      840    Wright

    assembled near to the police room.                   We were to be a reserve serial at the

    ground.

    At     about   2.50pm we were directed by Police                Sergeant Wright to go to the

    Leppings Lane End of the ground as they was sane kind of trouble.                               We went

    along the back of the North Stand and into the area behind the turnstiles at

    the Leppings Lane End, there I saw an Inspector I do not know who he was.                          He

    was looking through the glass in the sliding metal gates to the right of the

    turnstiles as viewed frcm the back.              He seemed to be contemplating opening the

    gates, this appeared to be as there was a large crowd gathered outside and

    people that were caning through the turnstiles were saying things                          like "Its

    murder out there, someone will get killed."                  I took that to mean that people

    were getting crushed.            I looked through the glass in the doors and I could see

    that there was a large crowd of people behind the gates, someone mentioned that

    if the gates were opened we would get trampled in the rush.                          The Inspector

    seemed to have decided against opening the gates.

    I then went to the turnstiles at the left hand end and above those turnstiles I

    could see sane youths climbing over the railings and onto the roof of the

    turnstiles.         These were being helped over by a             police Inspector who was also

    on the roof.         I helped a few youths down fron the roof and then my attention

    was drawn to a man on the outside of one of the turnstiles.                       He was bent over
the turnstiles and asked for help.        He was obviously being pressed against the

turnstile by the       crowd outside.    The turnstile would not turn because of the

pressure on it and I kicked the turnstile back after telling the man what I was

going to do.     The turnstile turned and the man fell towards me.            I ascertained

that he was uninjured.      I took him to one side and told him to take it steady

until he got his wind back.

I continued helping people through the turnstiles who were having the same

problem and I could see that a lot of people            were     simply holding theirtickets

in the air in the rush they were not having their tickets taken frcm them.                 At

this time there were two or three other PC's around me, but who I do not know

who they were.

As   the   pressure   frcm the   crowd   eased   and the       turnstiles   began   operating

properly I moved back frcm the turnstiles.         I then became aware that there was

a lot of people stood in the area behind the turnstiles and around the caravan

type trailer frcm which programmes were being sold.                Someone mentioned to me

that a gate to my left was now clear if I wanted to eject anyone.                   I think it

was a steward who said this to me.

I then became aware of Police Sergeant Wrightand others frcm my serial                 running
                                                  QC>
towards the South Stand, I was beckoned to*with them and I followed as they

appeared to be attending something important.            We went around the side of the

stand and onto the perimeter of the pitch.              This was only possible by going

through a locked gate which we were stood at for around 45 seconds to one

minute.     It was eventually opened by a steward.             I went around the perimeter

track to face the barriers behind the goal mouth at the Leppings Lane End.                   I

could see a small gate in the barriers, I think it was open at the time.                     I

was going to go through this gate which goes into the left hand pen as viewed

frcm the pitch.       I was unable to do this at first due to fans crowding to see

what was happening in the centre pen.         Seme of the crowd were brought out onto

the pitch and others moved back to allow us in.           When I got in I went to the
                                     -   3   -

dividing fence between the left hand pen         and the centre pen.    This fence was

about 6 feet high with spikes on the top.I saw at the       other     side of the fence

people pressed very close to it.     I struggled to help several people over the

fence seme of these were injured and others appeared to be just 'winded'.             I

can remember one white haired man who was about 60-70 years old he looked very

bad.   It took some time to get him over the fence and when we had I took him to

one side,    loosened his clothing and sat him down.            After taking some deep

breaths he appeared to came round slightly.        I told him to keep sat down for a

while and he said he was feeling better.

Seme of the fans were a great help but I         can remember      beingspat at       and being

verbally abused several times.      I can also      remember       beingeither kicked or

thumped in the back on a couple of occasions.          After helping several people

over I would say about 10 to 15 people I became aware of a large pile of people

about 4 to 5 feet deep at the other side of the fence.          Quite a number of these

were passed over the fence by police officers and civilians.            I can remember

checking for the pulse on a few of them whilst we were carrying them.             I was

aware of other police officers around me doing the same thing that I was and

helping people over and carrying them away.          I tried to administer mouth to

mouth resuscitation onto same of them that we were carrying away but it was

awkward whilst trying to carry them as well.

Most of the injured and bodies that I helped carry were taken to the small gate

that I had came through.     I can remember a Sergeant who was wearing a yellow

anorak and was not frcm the South Yorkshire Police, he appeared to be handling

a lot of the injured and the bodies that we passed through the small gate.            I

think he was taking them onto the pitch somewhere.         I think I helped to remove

around 10 or 12 bodies and when it appeared that they had all gone or were

being attended to I came back out of the pitch.          I cannot describe very well

any of the bodies that I was involved with, but I think that almost all of them

were male.    Seme of them being very heavily built with ages varying frcm around
                                     -   4   -

16 years to around 50 years.

When I had returned onto the pitch I began to generally help moving people and

trying to assist the doctors and ambulance men.   I cannot remember much of what

happened when I was back out on the pitch.

The next thing I can remember is going with the rest of our serial out of the

ground and walking up Penistone Road to a spot where the buses were parked to

take the fans back to the Midland Station. Not many people used these buses and

we eventually went back into the ground and to the North Stand where a de-brief

was due to take place.

When I was in the area behind the turnstiles I was aware of quite a few youths

either entering the ground with cans of alcohol or smelling of drink but due to

the situation these were not ejected frcm the ground.   I was not aware that any

gate or doorway into the ground had been opened until after the incident had

finished.

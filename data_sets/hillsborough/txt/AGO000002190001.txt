DRAFT LETTER FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL


Roy Edey Esq




                                                                                     May 1990




HILLSB OROUGH INQUEST


T hank you fo r y o u r le tte r of 22nd A pril 1990 to th e A ttorney G eneral. I have
been asked to rep ly .

The A ttorney G eneral's jurisdictii
                                            y cern in g in q u ests is limited to th e situation
se t out in section 13 of th e Coro           Act 1988. T his provision enables him to
apply to , o r give his a u th o rity fo r an application to , th e High C ourt fo r an o rd e r
th a t an in q u est o r, a fre s h in q u e st, as th e case may b e , is held into a p erson s
d eath . The jurisdiction to make such an o rd e r is e x p re ssly re se rv e d to th e High
C ourt, and th e A ttorney G eneral’s role is confined to deciding w hether o r not an
application to the High C ourt should be made u n d e r th a t section.


The A ttorney General does not have an y jurisdictio n to control the actions of
c o ro n e rs. T hey are independent judicial officers and a re solely responsible for
th e ir decisions, subject to th e rig h t of th e High C ourt to review th e decisions
which th e y make. It would be an unconstitutional in te rfere n ce in th e coroner^
functions if th e A ttorney General were to p u rp o rt to make th e ty p e of direction
which you re q u e st.

With re g a rd to y o u r points about the powers of coroners to adjourn , th e A ttorney
General wishes me to sta te th a t -thertaw                          w-

I did not a t t e n d            last    y e a r ’s FA     cup semi       final     in a n y capacity.



On S a t u r d a y    15th April,          1989    ("130489)        I was      r eq ue s te d    to   perform duty

all    the S p e c i a l s were          seperately         b ri e fe d   a g a i n by our C o mm a n d a n t in

the gym,        as    to our duties,           we were split up into s e ct io ns w h ic h

■ap p r o x im a t e 1y .



I was     on the Ha li fa x Rd dir ec t in g                 traffic and we were                 there until 2.3 0

pm     (1430 hrs).           The    traffic a p p e a r e d       to be dead,           we e x p e c te d to be

busy,     but there were                no holduos         or gueues,        just a number of             coaches

stopp in g      on side of the             road to unlo ad on the                 left hand si de         of the

road.         At 2. 3 0     pm    (1430 hrs)      we were         told to leave our               post and make

our w ay back          towards          the ground.         One    of our       special         Officers,

C o m m a n d a n t P eter M ar t i n      came and told us to make                     our w ay to the

ground,       becaue    of half      time,     we w o u l d have our meal.



I d i d n ’t have a personal            radio,,     but our S e ct i o n Officer,,                         7

had one.



D u ri n g the b riefing        on the mo rn i ng       it had taken at             least    15 minu te s

for a number        of O f f i ce rs    to ex pl a in what w o u l d h a pp en           in the    case of

e v a c u a t i o n and where    each set        of fans w o u l d go from each stand a nd who

w o ul d be respo ns ib le       for the e v a c u a t i o n of each          part of the ground.

That    is done at every m a tc h on every briefing,                        it was       only a couple of

weeks    before H i l l s b o r o u g h d isa st er     that    they had a practice               evacuation

at Bram ell       Ln during a game,            a code word of         “Mr M ea d ow s       is   requi re d at

Control       room" a bell       sounds a nd all          e m e r g e n c y doors were open,         no fans

were a s ke d to       leave,    then a       code of     "Mr M ea d ow s     is no      longer    required"

is said a nd all         goes    back      to normal.        The same       proc ed ur e     is laid out

for both grounds a nd            is e x p l a i n e d at e very game.



Whilst       on my traffic       post      I no t ic e d L iv e rp o ol    fans,    as    I was on the

route    for L iverpool         fans    gettin g to ground.               I saw fans of all ages

lots of them         carrying       four    packs    of beer a nd b o tt le s of beer and

spirits,        drinking     it on the way a ski ng            us the w ay to         pubs,      they were

ur ni na ti ng anywhere,         they were        jumping      on all      o pp o si t e us a nd

u ri na ti ng    in both d i r ec ti on s      t o ta ll y obvi ou s to       people driving         down

the    road and      into    the grounds        of a    public     house,      we    crossed over and

advised       these fans      to make       their way to the g ro un d and about                   their

behaviour.         W he n we did this          they m o v ed on we did not get a ny back

The fans were          too   busy    looking      for   pubs and      drin ki ng      that going

towards     the ground there were                  loads,     groups w al k in g a w a y from the

g r o u n d asking    us where       pubs were.            These    groups were all              lads a ge d

from t wenty to thirties.



I heard one        lad say       “ I ’ve    lost me ticket'1.             A n ot h e r    lad in his group

said    "Don't w o rr y you'll             get    in w ith us".



We got back       to the ground b etween 2 . 4 5 pm and 2.5 0                            pm (1445 -      1450

hrs),    we got back         ground and           I was w i t h S e c t i o n O ff i ce r

there was a lot of speech on the                        radio,     but    I could not make out what

was being      said?      I e nt er ed the grou nd t h ro u gh the big blue gates from

the P e n i s t o n e Rd leading           to the gym and then a long                    the gravel      path on

to the a r e a s u rr ou nd in g        the      pitch.     I had         lost              at   this    point,

but a P o l i c e m a n   said    "You      come w it h me"        toge th er w it h        a bout ten other

P o l i c e m e n we went    onto the track a r o u n d the               pitch a n d the game was

going    on and as we were wa lk in g a r o u n d the                    pitch     I saw B e a r d s l e y ’s

shot hit the         post.       I was wa lk in g         towards    the L e p p i n g s Ln,       the first

thing    I saw was at         the far         end of the N or th S t a n d           in the      lower a r e a of

the seats was the fans were                      packed    in a nd they were              stan di ng    shouting

a n d g en e r a l l y getting a g g r a v a t e d and        I thou gh t       they were going to

invade     pitch,     this was the            end next      to L e p p i n g s Ln end.



At this     point     I a s s i s t e d a P o l i c e m a n who     had a r r e s t e d a large man

about 30 years of age about 5°                       in height      but     really broad,          w ea ri ng

d enim shirt,        he was      fighting w i th the P o l i c e m a n he was                 drunk and     they

we re really s t r ug gl in g        to     control       him.     I h elp ed get          him   in a head

lock and      then they       carried him a w a y towards                 the    gym.



Then    I saw a few y ouths             began to        climb the fence            out     of the L e pp in gs

L n end and      come out        onto      the    track,    at this       time     I made my way
                                                                                                         PAGE         !


towards        them and s tarted to             push them off          the    pitch because         I thought

it was a pitch           invasion and the game was                  still      going     on,    there was       not

m an y P oli ce Off ic er s about at this                  point a nd this was            prob ab ly that

was becau se most           had d ragged this            drunk man who was             fighting away.



I remember at one            point       but exac tl y when         I d o n ’t know,       I heard someone

say “T he re's a h undred men                  in the    gym    if you want        them",,



As     I was    pushing     fans       back    towar ds t er race a fan said              "Look,        look at

front     of fence       people and getting              squashed",



I made my way towards a nd behind the goal                             net,    I didn't        have a radio

so     I couldn't      tell a ny on e what was happening,                     b e hi n d the net       there was

about     five     or six P o l i c e m e n     i ncluding a bald h e ad ed S e r g e a n t a nd they

were     openin g     the   pitch gate          in pen 3 / 4 ,         but    the gate a p p e a r e d    to be

stuck.         T h e y e v e n t u a l l y got the gate        open then       people     just    f l oo de d out

and several          just   got stuck,          they just       fell    out of the gate.



We we re just         trying      to    pull    people    out,    I tried to         pull a fat man,            who

was stuck at          bottom,      we just       couldn't move          him.



The     only    part of him,           I could get hold of was                his head a nd       I pulled

a nd    I still      couldn't move            him,   he was alive,           but he was        numb a n d I

pulled a n d p ulled a nd then he just give w a y and he was                               dead.       Then     I

just     g ra b be d at the       next    person a nd g r ab b e d the          next     person a nd      pulled

them through.



The     fat man about 35 y ears of age                   black    curly hair,          a slight m ou s ta c he

w ea r in g a y e l l o w   'T*    shirt.        The    bald h ea de d S e r g e a n t    h el pe d me pull

him out.          He was    right at b ott om a nd ever yo ne was                  coming       over    the top.
                                                                                                       PAGE         6




We    carried on        pulling more and more              people     out   then    people      pani ck ed

and      people were       l iterally w a lk in g     over    the top of         people      to get        to the

gate.       T here was      lots of bodies         inside     the gate a nd ever yo ne was                  just

climbing        over    them.



T he n one y ou th who          I now know to be                            of L i ve rp oo l       b eg an to

make     his way a cross         the top of other           people     I c li mbed the        fence        next

to the gate a nd           pulled him over         onto     the    track,           had b ro ke n a rm and

a broken        shoulder?       he had had the bar           smash his a rm and because                    the

crush      the bar had br ui se d his            leg as well.           I took            a lo ng    the    pitch

a nd made my w ay towards             three St J oh n' s A m b u l a n c e men then the game

was stopped?           because    I w a l k e d him a c ro s s     pitch w h il s t       game was     on and

never     realised.



T he n    I went    back    to gate?     then     I reali se d no one          else       could get out

b ec ause      they were all       blocking       gate     the kids at front              couldn't     breath

and the        pushing was getting worse              it was       u n be li ev ab le .



1 took my overcoat, off a n d              put    it on the        spikes on top of the gate a nd

a B obbie       held me     legs and     leant over and s ta r te d to              pull     the kids out

but a lot were a l r e a d y dead?           this     is

                                                                            I was     lite ra ll y just

t hr ow in g    people     over my head.          I d o n ’t know w he re my s tr e ng t h            came

from?      it was      just a rush to       see how m an y         I could get to?           people were

getting        caught    in wire    on top of fence and eve ry th in g.



I then had a kid get stuck                 in wire       to my     left a spike was           stuck        in his

face     his t ro us er s were      caught       up and he        c o u l d n ’t get over?      it was

h o rr ib le    sight?     I pulled him by his             legs    it was     the only thing            I could
                                                                                                       PAGE


grab     it ripped his ear and side of his                     face.       I pul led him over onto

the track,            he was    10 or    11 his     name w a s ________|, I carried on to                pitch

I put him down and                I went    to get St J oh n' s A m b u l a n c e and when we got

back     the young        lad was       dead „ he just said         "I    cannot       breath,      I can not

breath” .



I went         back    to the fence,        by this time       I was      crying and         I began to

pull     people        out again.        I just     c o u l d n ’t believe      that    he had died,

I couldn't            believe what was        happening.        I pulled a young              girl    out,    she

had nothing            on top,     she was    bare    to the waist,          she was        dead.     I c a n ’t

remember what            she    looked     like,    I car ried her all           the way to the gym

and    put her down and             came back out.



I went         back again,        then the few of us that were                  there      began to shake

fence     to     pull    it down,       the fence     came down from top a nd we b ou n ce d on

it to get         it to       come down,     but    it bent w rong w ay          it went      in wards

towards         crowd.        We j umped on it and e v en t u a l l y        it fell       but   it fell on

people         in front.



P eople        were under       the fence     hu nc h ed up,    I think         t he y were a l r e a d y

dead,     but we were           stood on them then           I went      onto    the terrace,         there

was    pressure         but    it had eased a bit           I was m oving        bodies      out of way and

other     bodies were           falling    towards        front on some         of   the    faces    of the

dead     I could see the            implant of the          fence w here        they    had been      crushed

a g ai n s t    it.     T hen we were      t hrowin g      people   t hr o ug h the gap          in the fence

we had made,            we were     throwing       the ones we      thought were alive.                We were

doing      this       for about     15 minutes.



Then     I was s u r r o u n d e d by loads of dead bodies,                  but     I could see       towards

back     by the tunnel            there were       kids    lay floor      injured,         but still alive.
                                                                                                            PAGE     6


I just     picked them up one at a time and                     ran t hr ou gh          tunnel   with

them,    once on the other                 side   there were    loads       of    people     lay on floor

and    I just      left    them w it h a mb u l a n c e and m ed ical            staff a nd went            back

for more.          I m oved about           ten   people   t hr ou gh this way.             I did see what

they    looked      like     or find out who           they were,      there w a s n ’t time to think

of that.



I went back         to the front of the stand and there w er e                           lots of P o l i c e m e n

pulling      people       out    one P o l i c e a n   pulled me out a nd said              "You've done

e n ou g h you     can't     do any m o r e 11.



1 was    just      b ew i l d e r e d at    this stage my m in d was             s w it c h e d off    I was

looking      for    s omething       to do some way of helping,                   but    I was    p h ys ic al ly

k nackered.



I went     onto     pitch a nd        I h elped drag a kid who was                  dead onto         the    pitch

with a Liverpool            fan,     the kid who was helping me                   pull,    his w at ch        came

off,    I put      it    in my    pocket.         I w al k e d onto   the    pitch and



                                                                                                      I was

outside of the ground,                  walking a r o u n d the       perimeter     of the      pitch and

that duty is a regular duty for me at Bramell Ln.                                  I have expe r i e n c e

I did not a t t e n d        last      year's FA cup semi final               in any capacity.



On S a t u r d a y    15th April,        1989    (150489)       I was    requested       to   perform duty

at H i l l s b o r o u g h football       ground for the FA cup semi                final match

betw e e n N o t t i n g h a m Forest an d Liverpool,                the a r r a n g e m e n t was to meet

at H i l l s b o r o u g h at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 9 .30 am     (0930 hrs)     where we were

brie f e d a l t o g e t h e r   in    the N o r t h S t a n d by the O f f i c e r s    in charge, then

all   the S p e c i a l s were         s ep e r a t e l y briefed a g a i n by our C o m m a n d a n t in

the gym,       as to our duties,             we were     split up into sections which

co n t a i n e d four    people        per section.        I was a s s i g n e d to S e c t i o n Officer

                     together wit h S C [                  [   SCj                  and we were      posted

to Hali f a x Rd and su r r o u n d i n g area for traffic                    duties.      We had a meal

and then were           d e s p a t c h e d to our   posts for        11 am    (1100 hrs)

a p p roximately.



I was     on the Hali f a x Rd d i r ecting             traffic and we were there until 2.30

pm (1430 hrs).             The traffic a p p e a r e d to be dead,              we e x p e c t e d to be

busy,     but there were no holdups                  or queues,         just a number         of coaches

stopping       on side of the            road to unload on the              left handside of the

road.      At 2 .30      pm (1430 hrs)          we were        told to    leave our       post and make

our way back towards                  the ground.       One of our special              Officers,

C om m a n d a n t Peter Mar t i n       came and told us to make               our way to the
                                                                                                  PAGE      3


ground,     becaue     of half time,          we w o u l d have our meal.



I d i d n ’t have a personal             radio,    but our S e c t i o n Officer,

had one.



D uring    the briefing         on the morn i n g       it had t aken at          least    15 minutes

for a number        of O f f i c e r s   to expl a i n what w o u l d happen           in the   case of

e v a c u a t i o n and where    each set of fans would go from each stand and who

w ould be     responsible        for the e v a c u a t i o n of each        part of the ground.

That    is done at every m a t c h on every briefing,                      it was      only a couple of

weeks     before H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster       that they had a practice e v a c u a t i o n

at Bramell      Ln during a game,            a code word of        "Mr Meadows            is required at

Control     room" a bell         sounds and all          eme r g e n c y doors were open,         no fans

were a s k e d to    leave,      then a code of "Mr Mead o w s              is no      longer   required"

is said and all          goes back        to normal.        The same       procedure       is laid out

for both grounds and             is e x p l a i n e d at every game.



Whilst     on my traffic         post     I noti c e d Liverpool       fans,      as    I was on the

route     for L i v erpool      fans getting        to ground.        I saw fans of all ages

lots of them        carrying       four    packs of beer and bottles                of beer and

spirits,      drinking      it on the way asking             us the way to          pubs,    they were

urninating anywhere,             they were        jumping    on all    opposite us and

u r inating    in both direc t i o n s        totally obvious         to    people driving        down

the    road and     into the grounds           of a public      house,       we    crossed over and

advised     these fans to make             their way to the ground and about                    their

behaviour.        W h e n we did this they m o v e d on we did not get any back

chat    or abuse.



The fans were too busy               looking      for   pubs and drinking           that going

towards the ground and at 2 . 3 0                 pm (1430 hrs)       w hen we were walk i n g
                                                                                                        PAGE     4


towards the ground there were                  loads,      groups walking awa y from the

gro u n d asking      us where      pubs were.         These       groups were all              lads aged

from twe n t y to thirties.



I heard one        lad say " I ’ve       lost me ticket".                Anot h e r    lad in his group

said     " D o n ’t w orry y o u ’ll get      in w i t h us".



We got back to the ground betw e e n 2 .45                    pm an d 2 .50           pm    <1445 - 1450

hrs),     we got back ground and              I was w ith S e c t i o n Officer

there was a lot of speech on the                    radio,        but    I could not make             out what

was     being   said,    I ente r e d the ground thro u g h the big blue gates                           from

the P e n i s t o n e Rd leading       to the gym and then along                      the gravel       path on

to the are a surrounding             the    pitch.        I had     lost                   Iat this    point,

but a P o l i c e m a n said     "You come w ith me" together w ith about                          ten other

P o l i c e m e n we went    onto the      track a r o u n d the         pitch an d the game was

going     on and as we were walk i n g a r o u n d the                  pitch I saw B e a r d s l e y ’s

shot     hit the     post.     I was walking         towards the L e p p i n g s Ln,              the first

thing     I saw was at the far end of the N o r t h S t a n d                     in the        lower a rea of

the seats was         the fans were         packed     in and they were                standing       shouting

a n d g e n e r a l l y getting a g g r a v a t e d and    I thought         they were going            to

invade     pitch,     this was the end next to L e p p i n g s Ln end.



At this      point    I a s s i s t e d a P o l i c e m a n who    had a r r e s t e d a large man

about 30 years          of age about 5 ’ in height                 but    really broad,           wearing

d enim shirt,        he was    fighting w ith the P o l ic e m a n he was drunk and they

were     really struggling          to control        him.        I helped get him              in a head

lock and then they            carried him a w a y towards                the gym.



The n    I saw a few youths began to                climb the fence out                    of the L e p pings

L n end and come out onto the track,                      at this time          I made my way
                                                                                                      PAGE         5


towards        them and star t e d to          push them off the             pitch because        I thought

it was a pitch invasion an d the game was                         still       going    on,    there was not

man y Police O f f icers about at this                   point and this was              probably that

was because most           had drag g e d this drunk man who was fighting away.



I remember at one           point       but e x a c t l y when I d o n ’t know,           I heard someone

say "There's a hundred men                    in the gym if you want them".



As     I was    pushing fans back towards               terrace a fan said "Look,                   look at

front     of fence     people and getting              squashed".



I made my way towards and behind the goal                             net,    I didn't       have a radio

so I couldn't         tell anyone what was               happening,          behind the net there was

a bout    five or six P o l i c e m e n        including a bald headed S e r g e a n t an d they

were     opening     the   pitch gate          in pen 3 / 4 ,         but the    gate a p p e a r e d to be

stuck.         The y e v e n t u a l l y got the gate open then people just                     floo d e d out

and several        just got stuck,            they just fell           out of the gate.



We were        just trying       to    pull    people out,      I tried to        pull a fat man,            who

was stuck at bottom,              we just       c o u l d n ’t move    him.



The only        part of him,          I could get hold of was his                head an d I pulled

a nd    I still    couldn't move          him,    he was alive,          but    he was numb an d I

pulled a n d      pulled an d then he just give way and he was dead.                                The n I

just grab b e d at the next              person and grabbed the next                   person an d     pulled

them through.



The fat ma n about 35 y ears of age                    black    curly hair,           a slight m o u s t a c h e

wearing a y e l l o w      'T'    shirt.        The bald headed S e r g e a n t          helped me     pull

him out.         He was    right at bottom and everyone was                      coming       over the top.
                                                                                            PAGE      6




We     carried on pulling more an d more            people out then        people    panicked

an d    people were    literally walk i n g       over the top of       people to get to the

gate.      There was    lots of bodies         inside the gate an d everyone was              just

climbing     over them.



The n one y outh who      I now know to be                         pf L i verpool     began to

make    his way across        the top of other        people   I climbed the fence           next

to the gate and        pulled him over onto the track,                     lad broken arm and

a broken shoulder,        he had had the bar smash his arm and because the

crush the bar had bruised his                leg as well.      I took         ilong the       pitch

and made my w a y towards         three St J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e me n then the game

was stopped,        because    I w a l k e d him across    pitch whilst      game was on and

never     realised.



Then     I went    back to gate,      then I realised no one else            could get out

because     they were all       blocking      gate the kids at front         c o u l d n ’t breath

a nd the    pushing was getting worse             it was   unbelievable.



I took my overcoat        off a n d    put    it on the spikes      on top of the gate and

a Bobbie     held me    legs and      leant    over and star t e d to      pull   the kids out

but a lot were a l r e a d y dead,

                                                                   I was    literally just

throwing     people over my head.             I d o n ’t know where my s t r e n g t h   came

from,     it was    just a rush to see         how m any I could get to,          people were

getting     caught    in wire    on top of fence and everything.



I then had a kid get stuck             in wire     to my   left a spike was         stuck    in his

face    his trousers were        caught up and he c o u l d n ’t get over,           it was

horrible     sight,    I pulled him by his          legs   it was the only thing            I could
                                                                                                 PAGE         7


g rab it      ripped his ear and side of his face.                        I pulled him over       onto

the track,          he was    10 or 11 his name was                         I carried on to       pitch

I put him down and              I went    to get St J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e and when we got

back the young          lad was dead,        he just said          "I cannot       breath,    I can not

breath".



I went       back to the fence,           by this time          I was    crying and I began to

pull      people out again.            I just     couldn't      believe     that    he had died,

I couldn't          believe what was        happening.           I pulled a young       girl    out,    she

had nothing          on top,     she was bare to the waist,                she was dead.        I can't

remember what she             looked     like,    I carried her all          the way to the gym

and      put her down and         came back out.



I went back again,              then the few of us that were there began to shake

•Fence to      pull    it down,      the fence      came down from top and we boun c e d on

it to get       it to come down,           but    it bent wrong way          it went    in wards

towards       crowd.        We jumped on it and e v e n t u a l l y        it fell    but    it fell    on

people       in front.



Peo p l e were       under the fence        hunched up,          I think they were a l r e a d y

dead,      but we were        stood on them then           I went       onto the terrace,       there

was      pressure     but    it had eased a bit           I was moving       bodies    out of way and

other bodies were             falling    towards        front   on some of the faces           of the

dead      I could see the         implant of the fence where                they had been crushed

agai n s t    it.     Then we were        throwing       people thro u g h the gap in the fence

we had made,          we were throwing           the ones we thought were alive.                 We were

doing      this for about         15 minutes.



Th e n    I was s u r r o u n d e d by loads      of dead bodies,          but   I could see towards

back by the tunnel              there were       kids    lay floor       injured,    but still alive,
                                                                                                 PAGE         8


I just    picked them up one at a time and                 ran thro u g h tunnel with

them,    once on the other side there were                 loads       of    people    lay on floor

and I just        left them with a m b u l a n c e and medical              staff and went        back

for more.         I m o v e d about   ten   people through this way.                  I did see what

they    looked     like or find out who they were,                there w a s n ’t time to think

of that.



I went    back to the front           of the s tand and there were                 lots of P o l ic e m e n

pulling    people out one P o l i c e a n       pulled me out an d said " Y o u ’ve done

en o u g h you can't do any more".



I was just b e w i l d e r e d at this stage my m ind was s w i t c h e d off                  I was

looking    for something        to do some way of helping,                   but   I was    physically

knacke r e d .



I went    onto     pitch and    I hel p e d drag a kid who was dead onto the                          pitch

wit h a Liverpool        fan,   the kid who was helping me                   pull,    his w a t c h    came

off,    I put     it in my pocket.          I w a l k e d onto   the    pitch and



                                                                                             I was




I handed the w atch         in to Sgt Fidd l e r       incident        room H a m m e r t o n Rd Pstn,

Hi 1 Isborough.



I just think the whole            thing was a tragic a c c i d e n t           but    I think the

Liverpool        fans and   in future any fans sh o u l d be a l l o w e d to walk to the

gr o u n d drinking.

We set off at about                "10.30 am          (1030)     and drove towa rd s Sheffield,

s to pp ing      once at a public              house s o m e w he r e     on t-he P e n n i n e s for one                 pint

of beer.

p arked but          it was only a five m in u te walk from H il l sb o ro u gh .

of the L iverpo ol           fans was good,              a nd a l t h o u g h fans were           d r in ki ng       in

local       pubs    I saw no evi de nc e              of bad behaviour.

I saw quite a number                  of P olice        en route a nd        I saw various              people

a s ki ng      for d i r ec ti on s      to the g r ou nd and the P o li c e were d i re ct in g

them.          I was a ware      of where         to go as        I have     v is i te d H i l l s b o r o u g h

before         including     last years           semi     final    game.

I a r r i v e d at the L e p p in gs Lane End at a bout S . 10 pm                           (1410)        or     perhaps

even s l i g h t l y     later,       w he n   I arrived         the w hole a r e a was a mass of

people w it h o u t any          r esemblan ce          of order.         I saw one P o l i c e m a n on a

horse       near    to the t errace            t u r n st i le   entrance,        he was      i ni ti al ly trying

to or ga ni se        order.       Trying       to slow the fans down,                  telling         them to stop

pushing and get back.                     E v e n t u a l l y out of    pure f r u s t r a t i o n he w ithdrew.

I was by now getting                  nearer      to the tur ns t il e s and the                pressure was

unbelie va bl e.          The    closer        I got towards           the t u rn s t i l e s     the greater the

pressure a p p e a r e d        to be.         I heard       people s ho ut in g        g e n e r a l l y towards

P olicemen,         who were s tanding                on top of the t u r n s t i l e wall,                "Open the

q a t e s ."     This was       said numerous            times.        I saw fans a nd P o l i c e m e n

pulling supp or te rs            out of the       crush over          the wall.          A ft er a bo ut      t we nt y

my ticket a nd           I r etained my         retain       portion.       Once     inside         I saw various

s u pp o r t e r s m il l i n g a r o u n d wa it i ng      for friends      to come t hr ou gh the

t urnstiles.            I p urchased a m a t c h         prog ra mm e and a s k e d the             programme

seller.               "Is that    the way       into the S t a d i u m ? "        P o in t i n g    towards     the

tunnel.          He    replied?     "Yes," and'I            p r oc ee de d a lo ng the       tunnel.         I had a

r e la t i v e l y free       passage a long      the       tunnel.     Although         I had       p re vi o us l y

been to Hi ll sb or ou gh ,            I had never          p r e vi o us l y s tood on the L ep pi ng s

Lane terrace.             At that       time    I b e l i e v e d the tunnel         to be the only

entra nc e       onto    the terrace.           I did not see?          n e it he r was       I a wa re      of a n y

visual         sign of d ir e c t i o n to other            parts of the terrace.

U po n   reaching        the terrace,          I went       to the    left of the C e nt r e of the

goal.          I was    immed ia te ly s ur p r i s e d at the amou nt             of    people on the

terrace.          It was a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 4 5    pm (1445)      by now.           It was      now that

I real is ed          I was    in a very dan ge r ou s          situation.          In all         the y ears       I

s ituation.             The    pressure was       incr ea si ng all         of the time.              Some of the

s u p po r te r s were        panicking and       I could hear          people shou ti ng at the

Police,         "Open the gates."              This    could have       been at a r o u n d 3 pm (1500).

Fans were         now climbing          into the seats above.                The P o li c e at first

appeared         to    ignore the       plight    of the fans          in our       pen.

A couple of m in u t e s          into the m a tc h L iv er po ol           hit    the bar.           At that

stage      I was       involved     in a m a ss i v e       surge forward.           The     pressure for

that surge a p p e a r e d to           come from b eh in d me.             I was       carried w i t h the

surge.          I could see        people      in front of me          in a t er ri bl e state of fear,

people were being               tra mp le d    in the b edlam a nd still                we were       being

f or c ed forward.             I was    very f ri ghtened.            The   pressure was             intense.            So

intense,         I was    unable       to move.        My    right arm was by m y side and my

left arm was on the sho ul de r                  of a m an next to me.                  S o m e h o w t h ro ug h

crowd m o v e me nt       I was    p rojecte d upwa rd s a nd I m a n a g e d         to s cr am bl e     over

the    crowd to my left and out of the m ai n throng.                            I was    pulled by some

other      s u p po rt er s   to a p osition      in front of a crash barrier.                    W h il s t       I

was    still      in P en 4,      I was   now    in a less        p acked area?       although       it was

still      very    packed.

Some P olice and St J o h n A m b u l a n c e        people        had at     least    real is ed the

g r av it y of the s it u a t i o n and were a s s i s ti n g           people over the fence a nd

th r ou gh an escape gate at the front.                        M a n y fans were a s s i s t i n g    in the

rescue a tt em pt and           I saw Police,       fans and St Johns Staff a t t e m p t i n g                    to

r esus ci ta te      fans on the pitch.            I did also w i tn e s s        some supp or te rs

being      injured on the fencing               spikes.        I cannot     now be sure of times

but an A m b u l a n c e a r r i v e d after what felt             like an undue delay.               The

fire b rigade were also               present and had              cut a hole     in the fence.           A

hole had a l r e a d y existed,           that h aving         been     ripped open by fans.

Fans w ere using a d v e r t i s i n g      hoa rd i ng s as m a k e s h i f t    stretchers.           I saw

m an y bodies        on the     pitch near       to the goal.

I remained         in the Pen until         a p p r o x i m a t e l y 4 pm <1600),       I was     in a

total      state of shock at the             carnage      I had wit ne ss ed .         And e v e n t u a l l y         I

left      the g ro un d and met my friends at the                     car a nd we     came home.

D uring     the    incident       1 s us t a i n e d bruising      to my back a n d my knees and

was on

I believe         the P olice      response to the tragic               events was at first             poor

in that they a p p e a r e d slow to             react    to       the s ituation.         But once they

did get       involved a n d       I b elieve that on              the w hole    they did their best.

I saw no e vidence             of d rinking      inside the s t ad i u m or bad behaviour.                         I

b elieve      that    lessons s ho ul d have been              learned f ro m the year           before's

Cup Semi       Final w hile        I u n d e r s t a n d from others were a l mo s t as bad.                   I

also      believe     that     the at te mp ts at    crowd        control    o ut si de the g ro un d was

We all     set out en route to the Football                   Gro un d at about               10.00 am

(1000)     that S a t u r d a y morning,         from Shrewsbury.           We did not stop on the

journe y and         I would describe         the    roads as      containing            nothing unusual

for    normal     Sa tu r da y traffic.

We e v e n t u a l ly    parked near the Ground,            at about    1.30        pm (1330).           We
                                                                                                       PAGE


went to a supermarket,                      I wo ul d say about      half a mile from the Ground,

where about 5 of our                   party,    myself     included,      purchased and drank some

lager and        light       refreshments.           We then made our way on foot towards

the Ground.           There was al re ad y a crowd,                 a l t h ou gh we were able       to

walk with the           crowd,         ushere d along       by Police without any hold-ups and

eve nt u a l l y to the turnstile area.                     At this stage,         it was a matter           of

passing       the tickets          to the attendants,             and having the butt           ends

returned.          There were no hold-ups,                  no organ ise d queues,           people were

gen er al ly milling ar o u n d and                in good spirits.I            e n te re d the Grou nd and

cannot      recall      seeing any direc ti on s as to where suppo rt er s                      should make

their way,         although,           as    I have been to the Gr ou n d          before,     and am aware

of the      layout,       I al r e a d y knew what to do,             where to go and wou ld not

pa rt icularly be looking                   to   rely on other       p e r s o n ’s directions.        Also       I

w ou ld   like to       point out that at the                time    I entere d the Ground,            at

a p p r o x i m a t e l y H.3 0   pm    (1430),     once    inside,    there was not such a large

crowd     inside as          I could walk          freely within the area.

My ticket was for the seating area above                             the W S t a n d area.       People

were moving          that freely             inside at     the time     I entered,      that    I was able

to walk to a vendor                selling        programmes      to the    right as      I entered,         1

was    then able        to walk across             the yard area,        to the      left of the W Stand

and to the steps              leading         up to the seating area.              I ev ent ual ly     reached

my seat at about S . 35                 pm (-1435),       seated next      to                    and

             My seat was           on the first           row,   v i r tu al ly overlooking      the      penned

area below Pen 4.

At about S . 55         pm    (1455),         I decided to go to the toilet,                 thinking       that

I would not have to go during                       the match.        At this time,          I had al re ad y

become aware of a large number                       of    people alread y        in the area Pen 3 to

my right.          Pen 4 below mys el f             did    contain suppo rt er s       but    there were

nowhere       near as many su pporters                in Pen 4 as        in Pen 3, which ap pe ar ed

to be filling           rapidly.

I went     to the toilets       near my seating area.             Whilst    there,      I

heard someone,        I know    it was a Gro un d Steward,          remark that         'they*

we re     o peni ng the g a t e s .    I was able      to   look out of the win do w of the

toilet,     overloo kin g     the yard entrance area            inside the Leppin gs Ln

entrance.         I would say    I was ap pr ox i m a t e l y 50 yards away from the

concertina type gate wh ich was              ev ent ual ly opened and being             sl ightly

above     the    crowd,    I saw a Poli ce Officer and a St ew a r d at            the       gate.     I

cannot     say which       if either   of these      opened     the gate as      X could only

see the upper        parts of their        bodies.      The gates were       opened and

obvi ou sl y a l l ow ed the    persons outside         the Gr o un d to enter and            come

forward as one        large mass.

Due to the        layout    of the Ground,      this    incoming    large    crowd were moving

towards the tunnel           leading   to Pens 3 and 4 w hi ch          I knew were alread y

h ea vi ly filled at the        time    I had   left my seat a few moments                  earlier.

I returned to my seat w hi ch would be at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.00                pm    (1500).

The ma tc h had not yet         start ed but      I became aware,        it was    ob viously

noticeable       that there were        problems downstairs         in Pen 3 to my            right.

The     people    there were    totall y    packed and several          of them were already-

a tte mpt ing     to climb over the fencing            towards    the   pitch.     Others were

trying to attract a t t e n t io n of Police Office rs and Stewards,                         ana

people were        ge nerally becoming       in a d is tre ss ed    state.       All    during       this

time,     there were more and more           people entering and           pushing forward.

The game starte d a l t h o u g h      I paid   little a t t e n t i o n because of the

serious      problems below.          I saw the    crowds      in Pens 3 and 4, more

tightly     packed    in 3,    push forward.         I wo ul d not describe        it as a

surge,     but a push forward wi t h         pure weight and no ba ckward movement.

At this     stage    it became more ap parent           to other suppo rt ers          of the

problem and        people made at te mp ts      to escape       from the    crush by climbing

upwards and some being a ss i s t e d by those                in the seated area,            to my

right an d above          the Pen 3.     In a short         length of time,      more       people,
                                                                                               PAGE


the Police*       and St ewa rd s     became more aware          of the situ at io n and made

attemp ts      to either     pull    the fence down or assist                the supporters       out.

There was       nothing    I could do?       if I had mo ve d over to my              right,   I would

have added to the          confusion and        probably have been             in the way.        I

would    like to say that as soon as everyone                    became aware of the

situation,       ev erybody     concerned?      the supporters,          Stewards,       Police,

S t » Johns A m b ul anc e     e t c , , did all     that they       possibly    could    in my

opinion,       alt ho ug h they were unco-ordinated.

Some time       later   I made my way to the tunnel                  entrance    to Pens 3 and 4

to attem pt      to   locate    the member s        of our   party.      I was unable       to do so

but    later    returned to the        coach and su bs eq u e n t l y e v er yb ody       returned

safely.

I wo ul d    like to add that when           I went to the           tunnel,    I was    not shown as

much    courtesy by Police,           alt h ou gh    I ap pre cia te that they too were

probably suffering a sense               of shock,      which    1    feel   batter     training

should be       called for.         As a member       of the    public,       I expect    the Police

should      be able to     comfort     people       in distress.

            I am a Police           Inspector         in the So ut h Yorkshire Police and am                  currently

            em pl oy ed     in the Police Drivi ng School.



            On Fri da y        14 April      1989     (140489)   as     instructed,       I a tt en de d a pre-match

            briefing at H i l l s bo r o ug h Football             Ground.        The briefing       took     place at

            10.00am       (1000)         and was     co nducted by Chief Sup eri nt en de nt Duck enfield?

            together with other Senior Officers?                        and was     for    Inspectors and above.

            The briefing was ad equate and seemed well                          prepared.



            At 0 9 . 3 0 a m    <0930)      on S a tu r d ay   15 April    1989    (150489)      I commenced duty

            at Hi ll s b o r o u g h Football          Gro u nd for duties        in relation to the Semi

            Final     match which was              to be    played between Li verpool           and N o t ti ng ha m

            Forest.        I was a l l oc at ed Sub Sector              18 with Serial       45.     I was
                                                                                                       PAGE      2


replacing         Inspector Mort on          'E' Division.



My serials         duties were         to be Public Order - Co ach R e c e p ti on at

Ta n k e r s l e y on the A61        on the S h e f f i e l d side of mo to r w a y        ju nction 36.

We were to          check at       random,     coaches and mini          buses       carrying Liverpool

supporters,          these    duties      to be     carried out        in con junction with Road

Traffi c Officers.             During and after              the m at ch we were        to remain       in the

T a n k e r s l e y ar ea as a mobile          patrol.        I at te nd ed    the    pre-match

briefing at          IQ.OOam       <1000)    that    date,       and on checking my s e r i a l , found

that    one of the officers               listed was         in fact on sick          leave,    this

leaving me 9 constables and a Sergeant.                             We were       issued with a Ford

Transit       van as transport,             this    being     registered number



The briefing was given by Chief Su pe ri n te nd en t Du ck e n f i e l d an d aga in

a p pe ar e d adequate.            It follow ed      the general        pattern of other          briefings

for similar matches                I have a t t e n d e d    in the    past.       It ap p e a r e d that

Chief     Inspector Pu rdy was              in command of our sector.                  After    the

briefing,        we were given a small               pre-packed meal,             and drink,     wh ich were

consumed at the ground.                   Myself and the Se rgeant were                 issued with a

personal        radio.



At   11.00am        <1100)    we    picked     up our       vehicle    and went      to Tan ke r s le y

int ersections where we                r en de zv ous ed with several Ro a d Traffic

Officers.          On s p e a k i n g 'with those       officer,       we were       informed that        they

had not been briefed to work wi t h our serial,                             and    in fact     their    order

sp ec i f i c i a l l y   informed them that          because       of traffic        problems    in 1988,

such     checks      for   1989 had been disp en se d with.                   This therefore          left me

with     11 officers         including myself.              At    11.20am     <1120)    I set up my

reception         point     in the     lay by wh ic h        is sit uated on the Sh ef fi el d            side

of the motorway,             on the A61 ap p r o a c h        road.
                                                                                                         PAGE         3




I pre-briefed my serial                 to    randomly       check     coaches and mi ni -b us es as

per the order,           not    to enter          vehicles     unless    there were 4 or 5 of them

together,         in the event of trouble               on any vehicle.             I instructed them

to    check    persons        for drink,          drunken    condition and         the    po ssession of

the    correct       entry ticket,           and any    problems        to be    referred to either

the Ser gea nt        or myself.



It quick ly became app arent                  that the       personal     radios were of no use

whatsoever,          due to our       location and distance               from the ground.               The van

contained a Force              radio,    but our       radio     call    sign as     issued was          India

18 on personal           radio.



At    the outset,        traffic      tr avelling       towards Sh e f f ie ld was only

m od er at el y    light,      with the m a j o r i t y of vehicles             being     private    cars.

Almost all         the   cars were       display ing         colours as s o c i a t in g    them with

Liverpool         Football      Club.        As time went        on,    traffic became        very

heavy,    and there were             periods where           traffic was        in fact at a

standstill         backing up from the traffic                   island at the new Sto cks br id ge

by-pass.          Be twe en    11.20am and 2 . 3 0 p m         (1120 - 1430)        we checked 33

vehicles,         being a mixture            of    coaches and mini        buses.         On the    coaches

checked there were              no drinks          found and only 7 persons were found to

have no tickets.               Due to our          location,     and the fact        that those 7

persons were amongst               o r g ani sed groups,         it seemed       impractical        to

prevent       them    continuing        their       journey,     but    they were        su itably advised.

They all       hoped to purchase              tickets       from touts.         In the mini        buses

checked,       so far as we          could as c e r t a i n     it a p p e a r e d that    persons were          in

posses si on of the            correct a p p r o p r i a t e    tickets.        On some of the mini

buses    cans of drinks were                 located.        These were      few    in number,       and

after    the oc cupants           had been s t r o n g l y advised,          the drinks were
surrendered.           The    contents were            poured away,         and the empty            cans

collected and depo sit ed              in the waste           container at Cl ay w h e e l s Lane

Garage.        None    of the       persons    on the        coaches,       or    in the mini         buses were

under    the    influence       of drink and there were                   no problems whats oe ve r

with their       behaviour.           The occupants were              ob vi ous ly       in high spirits,,

but what       I would       consider normal           for    persons atte nd in g            this    type of

function.        During       the whole       of the time we were                 checking      vehicles we

had no    problems,          and so far as         I     was    concerned all                vehicles       leaving

our    location were          in order.



We    had occasions          to stop several             coaches which were di splaying signs

to the front which showed                 ‘’N o tt i n g h a m F o r e s t ’ ,    but        these     turned out to

be des t i n a ti on sheets          issued by the operator                 to simply         indicate      to

fans where       the    coaches were          going,     as many        coaches         had left the same

area    in Liverpool          to both the ma tc h            in S h e ff ie ld and          the other Semi

Final    betwee n E ve rt o n and Norwich.                   After    being suitab ly ad v i s e d the

signs were       removed       to    prevent wrong           ide nt ifi ca tio n of the visiting

fans when nearer             the ground.         It might also            be     pertinent to note           that

many    of the    coaches       had been sea rch ed by the Police                        in Liverpool        prior

to departure.



At 2.15o m      (1415)       traffic was almost              non existent,            and except       for 2

coaches wh ich a rr iv ed together at about 2. 3 0 p m                           (1430) we      checked no

other    coaches or mini             buses    for quite some            time.         The    reason given by

the drivers       for    these       last 2 coaches for being                    so   late was that         they

had decide d to travel               towards Sh e f f ie ld via the M56                  intending missing

as much traffic as             possible       on the M 6 2 , but          had instead          run into      heavy

traffic at       roadworks          in the Ma nc he st er area of the M56.



After    these    two    coaches       l e f t y we     checked no other              vehicles.
                                                                                                  PAGE        5




During     the    time we were       operating at T an ke rs le y nothing whatso eve r was

received by personal            radio.        On the vans VHF        radio,      it sounde d as

though there was di ff i c ul ty being                exp er ien ce d with    traffic       in the

C it y area.       This fact was        confirmed by visiting Traffic Officers,                         who

felt we had been           lucky    to have     been se le cte d to        cover    the    point we

had,    instead of at the N ot ti n g h a m Forest              side of the ground.



My serial        had been det ailed during Phase 2 to meal                    at Cl ayw hee ls Lane,

then    return to the Ta nk e r s l e y area.            In view of the fact              that    traffic

was    non-existent,        at 2. 5 5 p m    <1455)    I stood my serial           down and we began

to make      our way to C lay wh ee ls Lane.



As we trave ll ed down Halif ax Road for                    the first time,        we heard

mes sag es      on the    personal     radio.       These   tended    to indicate          that    things

aro und    the ground were busy,              but   nothing more.          As we turned          round the

traffic      island at the         bottom of Lepping s Lane?             I was     surprise d      to

still     see    lots of fans making           their way to the ground,              even though it

was now past 3p m          <1500)    the kick off time.



We ar ri ve d at C lay wh eel s Lane at about 3 . 0 5 p m             <1505)       as we turned from

Penistone        Road    towards    the Police        garage    I saw Chief        Inspector Purdy,

I informed him of my in tention to meal,                       and then a t t e n d at the garage

forecourt.         On arival       at C l ay wh ee ls Lane,      my serial       was briefed to

meal    as a group,        ready for future           deployment.     In     the main       I ex pected

this    to be after        the mat ch       had ended.



Whils t at the          police garage,        I used the toilets and then went                    to the

mobile     canteen to       collected my hot meal.               After     being served with the

meal,     I began walkin g         back towrds        the entrance       into C la yw he el s Lane
g a r a g e , and at this        point,       was met by my serial              leaving        the garage.

T hey    indicated to me that we were                   to at t en d at the Le ppings Lane                    end

of the ground as there was                    some kind of         problem.          After     depos iting my

meal     on a table,         I rejoined my serial.                 We a t t e n d ed    near    the Leppings

Lane entrance          to Hillsb or ou gh .           The    time wo ul d now be about 3.15 pm

(1515).



On    initially atte nd in g          this     point,       I saw that officers were               forming a

cordon across          the access ar e a to the ground.                     The only Senior Off icers

in the area a pp e a r e d to be other                 Inspectors.         I a s ke d    them what was

wrong,      none     seemed to know,           but that we were           to    prevent further access

to the ground by supporters.                       1 therefore        left one of my officers with
                                                                                                                    |
our vehicles          to    protect     it,    or move       it as necessary,            and deployed

the     remainder      of my serial,           with    the other       officers a l rea dy forming

the     cordon.       The   traffic      on the       personal      radio was          such that    it was

impossible          to get air     time       to   clarify from gro un d             control     either

what     the     problem was,      or    if they wished my serial                    deploying     elsewhere.



Al t h o u g h   the time was      now past 3 . 15 pm          (1515)      there were still a number

of support ers making             their way to the ground,                  and ob vi ous ly they were

upset at         not being al low ed access             on the      pr oduction of their            tickets.

Eventual ly,         I picked up a messge              that am bul anc es           were at te ndi ng and

realised that someone must                    have been       injured.         On    looking     down the

small      road wh ich       runs a l o ngs ide       the football        ground        I saw that       there

a pp e a r e d to    be something        happening          near   to a large access             gate,    but

from my          position    could not        tell what       it was.       I left my serial             in

position whilst             I made way to that area,                firstly to try to a s c et ai n

what was         happening and sec ond ly             to seek a Senior Officer                  to see    if we

were     required elsewhere.
                                                                                                   PAGE       7


On en tering       the     large access         g a t e , 1 saw a large      number of    injured

persons       lying arou nd       on the       ground    in the triangular area to the                rear

of the Le ppings Lane stand.                   Some were being given mouth to mouth

resuscitation,           others     cardiac      compression.        Others    were   being     treated

for other       problems.         I also       found    close to the gate       the body of a male

who was       obvi ous ly    dead.       X returned to my serial and              in structed them

to go    into the area         previo us ly desc ri bed and give what help they                       could.

I made my way further               into      the area,    still    trying    to assess what          had

occurred.        During      this     time 3 ambulan ces       had ar ri v e d behind me,           near

to the       large gate?      and some         injured    persons were being moved towards

them by either           police     officers      or the    injured    persons friends.



It was       during this      time      that    I met Su pe ri nt en de nt Marshall.          He

in structed me        to fetch the a mb ul an ce s          to the    rear of the stand as             they

were    needed.       On    checking,         I found that    the am bu l a n c e s were too high

to g a i n   access      to the ground a r e a , this         being    due to the       large metal

bars which s t r et ch ed across               the top of the       large access      gate and which

cary th       running gear        for    the sliding       gates.     I considered this to be

a   point which       required furture            c on sid er ati on as   it was      impossible       to

take    the eme rg en cy vehicles              into the    ground area.        I se ar che d out

S u p e r i n t e n d e nt Marshall     and    informed    him of the     problem.       He    then

instructed me to            check     if we     could get the am bu l a n c e s    into any other

gates    in the area,         and     in any     case,    to have    breathing apparatus

brought up to the            rear of the stand.



I then went        to the a mb ula nce          nearest    the gate and       passed on the

message       regarding      the breathing apparatus,               and saw a member          of the

vehicles       crew enter      the ground with such equipment.                    I also saw that

by this       time several        fire     tenders were      in attendance,        and fire

brigade       officers were also              entering    the ground carrying         breat hing
apparatus.            I then    checked the           large gates     in the     immediate area an d

found all           to be too      low to a ll ow acces s         for the same        reason as

initially stated.               I ag ai n     returned to S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall and

passed on this              information.         He then       instructed me      to begin moving

injured       persons        out of the are a towards             the ambulances.         I therefore

went a r ou nd the area and ar r a n g e d for Police Office rs and other

persons who were a d m i n i s te ri ng               first aid,    to begin to move           the    injured

persons       towards        the access       gate.      As    I wal ke d around?      1 saw other dead

persons       lying        in the area?       covered by coats etc.             Even at this          point?

I was     still       not fully aware          of what had occurred?            but   realised the

persons were           suffering       crush injuries.            At one    point?    whilst     near the

acc ess     gate?      I saw that fans were              preventing an am bu lan ce        entering         the

top of the access              road?    an d made my way to the area.                 With others we

ma na g e d to get the am bu la n c e            throu gh the supporters.             Also whilst          in

the area,           both whilst moving a r ou n d a s se ss ing            the situa tio n and whilst

trying      toarrange         casualty evacuaton,              I was a b u s e d on a number of

occasions           by Liverpool       fans.      I was       pulled and    pushed about and on

many occasions              it was    pointed out to me quite              fo rcibly that       I was a

murderer .           The    language     being used was some           of the most foul          I have

heard.        It seemed to me            that    the a b use rs were      suffering shock?           and

were    relieving          their     frust ra tio ns     on me.     I could see       little     point      in

taking      their actions            further and after           trying    to   calm down the various

fans?     left       them to make        their way out of the ground.                 Others     were

simply trying              to obtain     in fo rmation none of which            I was able       to give.

During      this      phase?    the obvious           problems    that oc cu rre d and which has

been hig hl ig ht ed since?             was     the    lack of st retchers       or other means            of

moving      the      injured and dead           persons,      other than by physically               carrying

them from the scene.



E ve nt u a l l y    things ap pe a r ed to be settling             down and most of the              injured
                                                                                                   PAGE        9


persons       had been moved       from the area.            At this time?         I went a long the

tunnel wh ic h       leads from the          rear of the stand,          onto     the standing area

of Lep pin gs Lane          terraces,       at the    centre.        On arr iv in g at the

terracing,         I saw that there were still a number                    of    persons wa ndering

a r o u n d on the ter raced area.             I also       saw that there were           people on the

pitch,    some      still    being given first aid,             and also,        there was a line of

police officers          standing     on the     centre       line across        the w i d t h of the

pitch.        On   looking elsewhere a r ou nd          the ground       I realised that the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest fans were         just standing       pa tiently around,          and    1 was

thankful       that they h a d n ’t decided to              cause other       problems.      On re­

entering       the tunnel,       I was met      by two off duty nurses who were                    seeking

help.     Whilst       speaking with these            nurses,    we were        directed to a yo ut h

sitting       nearby who was       complaining         of    pains    in his     ribs.    The nurses

took    charge      of this    person and began to evacuate                   him to the

ambulances.



I returned to the area near                  the access       gate,    where     I met    Inspector

Sykes,    and a serial         of officers.           They had made an enclosure              out of

portable       fencing and       I saw that there were               several     bodies    covered up

in this enclosure.             On querying       the number,          I was     informed that there

were    ten    persons.       The Liverpool          fans    then began       leaving     the ground

an d   I wo rk e d together with other officers                  in directing         them   from the

g round.



At this       point,    we were    joined by Inspector Webster.                    He state d that        he

was    trying      to a s c e rt a in the    number    of dead       persons at our end of the

ground.        I was under the        impression that           the    10 dead     persons were the

only fatal it ies         to have occurred,           and that the       injured      persons we had

removed were         the bulk     of those      injured.        We were       informed that

there were         over 70 other      persons dead           in the gymn as ium and this was
                                                                                                 PAGE           10


the first time that               I realised the scale of the             incident.



We were then joined by Dr Leigh,                  Police Surgeon.           S u p e ri nt en de nt

Marshall       requested that he attend at               the gymnasium.         As there was              no

one else       in the area who knew the w h e r e ab ou ts            of the gym,        or the

route,     I took him to that            location.       I left    him at the entrance               to the

gym with other officers and began making my way back towards the

Lep pings Lane         end of the ground.          I saw that by this time,               the

ter rac ed area was almost             clear and decided to sue that as the easiest

return     route.       On    crossing      the football    pitch     I saw that       there were

very few       persons,      other than Police Officers,              still    on the     pitch.           On

arriving       back at the Lep pi ng s Lane end of the ground,                    I locat ed my

serial,     still as sisting with ground                clearance     of u n i nj ur ed fans.             I

n o ti ce d that the time was            now 4.4 5p m    (1645).     During     the whole of this

time,    the    radio had been         receiving,,      but there was       no free air time to

pass messages.



By 5pm     (1700)      the mes sag es were talking about traffic                  problems,

obv iously being           caused by the fans          leaving    the ground,      made worse by

returning       em er gen cy vehicles.          At the Lepping s Lane area the fans were

now clear,          and as our original         brief    had been traffic         patrol     in the

Ta n k e r s l e y area,     I decided to resume to my serial               to assist with

traffic,       as    possible.

                                                                           \
I noted     that as we         began to move off         in our vehicle the time was                  in
                                                                         l/ll
fact 5pm       (1700).       We    patrolled as best we          could along the A61            betwee n

H i l l s b o r o u g h and Grenoside,       but saw that    points were         being worked.

One   of the        problems      causing    traffic    hold-ups was the         coaches still

parked along Peni sto ne R o a d / H a l i f a x Road,           and o b vi ou sly waiti ng          to

pick up their          passengers.          These vehicles       caused    problems      throughout.
                                                                                                      PAGE      11




We    co ntinued to patrol             and a t t e n d e d an    incident       reported as Police

Of f i c e r    in trouble       near the super ma rk et s          in Halif ax Road,          but nothing

was    found.         Due to the amount            of traffic       on the      radio    it was still         not

possible         to    pass messag es       to    control.



By 6 . 3 0 pm     (1830)       the A61    towards T a n k e r s l e y was almost          clear.      As we

tr a v e l l e d down towards Hi 1 lsborough,                 I noticed a gap           in air    traffic

and for the first time m an age d                   to    contact    control.        I expl ai ned the

road     conditions and asked for                  instruetons.        We were       in structe d to

continue         patrol    for the time          being.      Due to the fact that we had not

had an yt hi ng         to eat or drink           since     10,30   (1030)      I instructed my driver

to att en d at C la yw he el s Lane Garage with the hope                          of obtaining

ref re shments          for my serial.



Again,         they were       instructed to remain together                 until      instruct ions were

confirmed.            At 7.15 pm       (1915)     I was     instructed to stand down my serial ,

but to         remain a va ila bl e myself          until     instructed otherwise.              At

Cl ay w h e e l s Lane,        I could find no one who a p p e a r e d to be               collecting

debrie fi ng          forms,    radios    or other        paperwork,      but    realised this was            due

to the oper at io n            still    in a c t i o n at   the ground.         At 7. 3 0p m     (1930)   1

was joined by            Inspector Sykes who              informed me that we had now all                 be

stood down.             I went off duty at 7.45 pm               (1945)    that    date.



One of my officers               had been d e le ga ted to go with one of the deceased.

Prior     to     leaving,       I made    certain that          his whe re ab ou ts were         noted,   and

made     provision a rr an g em en t s           for his     transport     back    to    " A ’ Di vi si on on

his    return.

              I am a ma rri ed man and                  I live at the above ad dre ss with my wife and

              four year old son and we have                     done so for          the    past twelve months.             I

             am a Liverpool               football       club supporter and have             been so for the          past

              ei gh te en years.             I am a      s easo n ticket      holder and because of that                  I was

             able       to obtain a ticket               for the semi        final    match played at Sh ef fie ld

             W ed n e s d a y ' s     ground Hi ll s b o r o u g h on Sa tu r d a y    150489 I paid          14.00

              (fourteen          pounds)      for a      seat   ticket      in the North Stand.

              On the day            I was    picked      up from my house         by my mate

             who        lives    in                 but    I c a n ’t remember        the   exact address         but he

              had hired a big Peugeot                    car that had seven seats              for the day and

              before       they       came for me he had picked up five other                      blokes who were

                                                                                                      and a la

              only know as                                                                             area but       1

don't     know the exact address.                   I was    the    last to be picked up and we

left     from my house about               nine    o'clock    (0900)       in the morning.

We didn't            stop an ywh ere      between my house and S h e f fi el d for any                reason

but we d i d n ’t have any hold-ups                  or such       like because we went over                the

dales and moors way not on the motorway.                             We got    into the She ff iel d

area about mid day and up until                     the    time we got to a pub there                I didn't

see a n y b o d y else a c t u a l l y drinking            beer and that.        Any wa y we got           to

this     pub,        whose name    I can't        remember    1 had a pint and something                   to

eat and          1 think the other             lads may have       had two    pints and during             that

time we were sorting the tickets                      out    a n d ____________ |had a six          pound (

6)    ground ticket          but he wa nt e d       to go    in the stands      so not minding

where      I went       in the ground           I swopp ed tickets wi t h him.             After    leaving

the    pub at about          quarter       to one    in the afternoon,          we

drove      for only about          five minutes           before    parking    the    car outside a

small     Police St a t i o n just ar ou n d the             corner from the Le pp ing s Ln end

al t h o u g h    I saw P o l i ce me n    in there we d i d n ’t receive any directions                        or

escort      from the Police,              we    left the    car and wal ke d down Leppin gs Ln

past     the ground and on to a chip shop just                        past the ground to get some

 food and then we sat                on the wall          of a second hand       car       place opposite

the    chip shop to wait             for some       friends from N e wc as tle         upon Tyne who we

a rr an ge d     to meet whilst we were waiting                    there    1 saw a white          bloke

about      fifty       odd a bit of a tramp           really wearin g a couple of L iverpool

scarves who            really    looked drunk walking              up and down the          road    but

al t h o u g h    1 saw other fans             drinking he was      the only drunk          I saw and           I

d o n ’t remember seeing any                   fighting or an y other sort of similar

incident         .
After my mate,            whom    I only know as                   met us he's       the    lad from

New castle we all went back to the                        car and droppe d our jackets               off

beacuse          it was    getting     pretty warm and then wa lk e d back to the                    ground

and    X reckon         I got to the           ground between quarter          to and ten to two
(1345 - 1355)          and al th o u gh      there were a hell                of a lot of people

a ct ua ll y    outside      the ground once             I wal ke d throug h the metal              gates at

the front        I walk ed straight            up to the turnstile and                 I showed my ticket

the bloke took one             part of the ticket and handed me                        the other        part and

I went     into the ground.

Only myself and |             .......... |went throug h these                     turnstiles?     all

the others went           into the stand turnstiles.                        Also a l t h o u g h there were

auite a few P o l i c e m en outside                the ground on foot and on horseback                          1

received no directions about where                           to go and what to do from any of

them but there again             1    d i d n ’t   e x p e c t   them to.         I have been ask ed about

stewards       but    I c a n ’t remember          seeing any at the ground.

Although        I have been to H i l l s b o r o u g h before               I h a v e n ’t been to the

Le ppi ngs Ln end before              but    I d i d n ’t have any di ff i c u l t y finding the

turnstiles        or getting         though them but               I c a n ’t remember wh ic h actual

one    1 went     through,      but    1' do       remember        that    I d i d n ’t see any other

gates    being       opened or a ct u al ly open when                 I was       entering     the ground and

 ag ai n when        I was   going     in I d o n ’t remember               seeing any other          people

getting        into the ground by any other means except                             by through the

turnstiles        themselves.

Once    I had ac t u a l l y got throu gh the turnstiles                          into the ground        I

d i d n ’t see any signs any wh er e               directing me to the               place where        I was

su pp os ed    to stand all          I saw was         the tunnel          opposite me through whi ch                    I

could see the          pitch so I na tu ral ly as sum ed that that was the                            place to

go to get to where             I was going           to stand.            Whe n   X went    to the tunnel            I

c a n ’t be one hundred          per       cent    sure      but    I d o n ’t remember seeing any

P o l i c e m e n or stewards         at    the entrance            to the tunnel          or a ct ua ll y   in

the tunnel.          I just wal ke d down the tunnel                      together with

there were only half a dozen other                           people       in the tunnel at that?             I

d i d n ’t have any       problem walki ng             through the tunnel and getting to the

t e r r a c i n g r I d i d n ’t see any disorder                or an yt hi ng     like that betwen the
                                                                                                  PAGE


time    1 got    into the ground until             the time       I got to the terracing                  or

any drinki ng      for that matter.

When    I got out at           the other end of the tunnel                I went    to my right as               I

was    looking at the          pitch.    I c a n ’t remember a blue          fence      running       from

the tunnel       exit to the fence by the                pitch?    by this       time   it must have

been ar o u n d about         two o ’clock     (1400)     and we were standing             in the

middle    or maybe as we were             looking at       the    pitch just       level with the

right hand goal          post from then on the             part to the terracing              I was

standing       in was    getting gr a d u a l l y more      people       coming    in and      it was

getting       packed and by about          half    past    two    I was    really needing         to go

for a leak       (Urinate)       and    it took me about          ten minutes       to push my way-

through to get to the tunnel                 and by this         time    I was nearly wetting

myself so       I had to go       in the tunnel          which was       quite    empty except            for

other    people    having a leak.            I though      it was       strange at the time

because       there should have          been more       people using       it.

After    I fi ni sh ed my       leak    I went    back    to the terracing and             pushed my

way throu gh      the    crowd and got to a point where                   I could w at ch the mat ch

’PC              of the West mi dlands Police               has shown me a grid map of the

area    of the terracing          on wh ic h     I ma r ke d with the       number      one    (1) where

I stood at this          point wh ic h     I now produce          (Exh No          ) IDN         f 1 but         I

saw that       there was a crash barrier             in front       of me and knowing that                     the

crowd    could surge at football               matches     I pushed my way          round so that

the barrier was          behind m e r this must           have    been about       quarter      to three

(1445)    because       the    players    had just       come out onto       the    pitch so I

started       to watch them and          I saw that               |*>as about     two or three

people away from me to my                right and between me and the fence at the

front    of the terracing          there was       between fifte en to twenty                 lines       of

peo p i e .

Then    that    is when the       crowd behind me          pushed forwar d and           I was    pushed

right    down to the metal             fence at the front          of the terracing and               I

places wh ic h usually happens at match es                            but    it didn't       happen this time

and     I was     getting      pushed more and more onto                     the    fence    itself and      the

right     side of my face was                 pressed up again st             the    fence so I could only

look to the          left and        1 was     having        d if fic ul ty breathing at this time

and     I c o u l d n ’t move any          part of my body then some                  time after      I c a n ’t

h on es t l y    remember      how    long      I saw                         on the gravel        track    on

 the     other side of the fence and he was shouting my name he then

climbed onto            the fence and           leaned over and was                shouting    for me to      lift

my arms         up to grab his hand but                 I can remember             shouting    "I c a n ’t move"

he then shouted that the gate was                            open but       I d i d n ’t at the time       know

where     it was        but   1 then ma nag ed          to get my arms             free and    I lifted them

up and grabb ed the fence and tried to                            pull myself         up but    I c o u l d n ’t

because         of the    crush on my body and my head was                          still   in a   position

that     I could only still                look the          one way and I
                                                                         _____ was shouting that

the gate was            behind m e ? ag ain           I dont know how          long    it was but after

        |had said this a very very                     little amount          of space      became    clear        by

me and         I ma na ge d to spin         round so         1 was    in fact       looking    the opposite

wa y to what         I was     but    I    c o u l d n ’t    see the gate      in the fence because of

the    number      of    people      by    the gate          and climbing      over    the fence.

S om e h o w    I d o n ’t know how,          I ma na ge d to        pull myself along          the fence

using my arms and                         stayed with me telling me how far                     I was away

from the         gate     but at times           the        pressure got that great that              I could

feel myself         going      but    I remember                     nd other       people shouting        keep

your     eyes     open and that helped me to                     carry on witho ut a shadow of a

doubt.          I got to the         gate e v en tu al ly and the             pressure      seemed to      come

off and         I thought      to myself         " I ’ve made        it,    I ’ve made      it" and there was

a lad in front            of me at the gate su dd enl y                    collapsed     in front of me

a nd    I c o u l d n ’t stop myself           falling and           I fell    to the side of him and

Deo    pie behind me fell             on top of me my face was on the gravel                          track and
                                                                                                  PAGE        6


my    chest was       right across         the step of the open gate and because                   of

the    people      on top of me        I c o u l d n ’t breath and      I was suffering         severe

pain    in my chest and             lower abdomen.         I don't     know how long       I was    there

but    I was     in constant         pain all     the time and al t h o u g h my arms were free

I c o u l d n ’t move my body at all              but    I was    ready to go unconscious           but

        and a Po l i ce ma n and a P o li c e w o m a n were with me telling me to hang

on and keep my eyes             open and that           helped me an awful         lot and the

P o l i c e m a n a n d Po li ce w om an   kept   on grabbing my arms and             pulling     but

they    couldn't       get me out because           of the way my legs were en tangled

on the      lads    next to me and          1 remember       people    in the terracing were

stepping       on my head to get out and that                    really was     hurting me.

The P o l i c e w o m a n   stayed with me all           of the time     talking      to me and     I was

pleading       for her to get me out but she said she                        c o u l d n ’t because my

legs were        trapped and         I kept on saying         I was on the bottom          I had been

there the        longest and to get me out.                  then    I heard the Poli ce man

shouting at         the other        people to get        back but     they just      kept on coming.

As    I said the        lad I was trappe d next            to was shouting         like   I was    to get

out of      it but he went quiet and                I looked      round at him and        I could see

that    his face       had gone a sh en and his            lips had gone        blue and being a

qu al ifi ed first aider             1 had a good        idea that     he was     dead.    I would

describe       him as a white man being                 of stocky     build    in his early

twenties       I c o u l d n ’t tell you how tall            he was    but    he had mousey

coloured hair which was shortish?                       I couldn't     tell you      if it was wavy

or straight         or any thing       because      like me he was       covered in sweat          but    I

remember he was wearin g               either a blue/black            strip ed shirt or a blue/

black     check     shirt     but    I ’m certain       it was a shirt.         Whilst we were

still     trappe d a St J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e m a n    came    up to us took the         lads

pulse     on his wrist and then his neck and turned to the Police Of ficers

 and said?         "He's      gone" wh ic h       I took to mean that he was dead?                After

this    I was still          trapped for a long while and               I c a n ’t remember whether
                                                                                                     PAGE            :
 I said or thought              it but        it was    "Why d o n ’t they get me out,            I've       been

here ages" and \                  |
                                  jas shouting          to the Police          to get me out and

 they were          saying    they couldn't.

Then a hell          of a lot of Po l i c e m e n        came up because          I could see their

trousers and          coats and the P o l i c e w o m a n        left me and       I honestly thought

that    they were        going     to leave me and get             the    people     out from above me

so I grabbe d a Policem an s                  trouser    leg and       I held on for ages         just

tugging at          it because       I d i d n ’t have a lot           left    in me for Po li ce me n           I

suppose       because     they had been told he was dead but they grabbed                              his

arms    the    lad next       to me that         is and       pulled very hard and even t ua ll y

they    pulled him out and as soon as they did the P o l i c e m e n that                            had

been with me,          I remember now he was a bald headed Se rgeant                           came with

anothe r P o l i c e m a n and       pulled me out because of the                  space    creacted by

pulling       the    other    lad out.

They dragged me by my arms                     onto    the    pitch and            came to me and            I

think    it was       the P o l i c e m a n    put me    in the    ’recovery       p o s i t i o n ’ which

hurt a lot then the              police        left me anq_______ stayed with me and                 I was

screaming       in pain and a bunch of Liverpool                        lads    came over an d      put me

on a piece of hoarding an d took me to the Forest                                end and            came

with me and they             put me on the grass back                  in the    recovery     position

again.        I was    there     for a while           then    I was    taken b y ______ and anothe r

bunch of Liverpool             supporters         on anoth er      hoarding       to the back of a

stand and took my jumper and shirt                           off and sat me       by a wall made of

tin sheeting which was nice and                        cold and a fireman          came over and

carried me          into the     ’Gym and sat me by a wall a nd                   I saw that      I was

right next          to a line of about            thi rty or forty dead            people just        laid

out and not          covered.




                             I kept on shouting               for some help but        I was     told that
                                                                                              PAGE          8


they were       dealing with the worst            cases first but




bruising       to the arms and      chest and bruising          to the     right side of my

head and       cuts to my ankles.




I also       remember that when      I told you       I was    dragging myself along             the

fence       to get to the gate      I remember a young          lad   aged about       14 - 16

years       that was    crushed up against         the fence and      as   Ia p pr oa ch ed    him he

was    screaming and by the time            I got to him he was quiet              his face was a

deep    purple and his       lips were      blue and he didn't appear              to be

breathing       I though he was      dead but       I didnt    see what      ha ppened about         him

afterwards.        The    lad had blond hair which was straight and                    collar

length he was          clean shaven.       He was    of thin build and         I think he was

weari ng a yel lo w top but         1 can't       remember an ything       else.     I am not

aware       of seeing any barrier         break    in the    part of the      ground    I

was    in I d o n ’t have ray ticket        stub now because my wife            trew it out

when    I

The    one think       I wou ld say was     that    if there were      signs    telling       people

where       to go when    I came   into    the ground       1 wo ul d have    gone    to the     part

of the terracing          behind the goal         I would have      gone   to the sides.

Also    I must    say that    I think      the bald headed Sergeant,            the P o l i c e w o m e n

and es pe c i al ly          have me the will         to go on if it         hadn't    been for

them I really think          I would not have made            it,

           On S a tu rd ay     15 April     1989    I commenced duty at 9am              (0900)    at Hamme r ton

            Road.     I was aware       that my duties        for that day w ou ld          involve

            patrolling        in plain clothes arou nd            the Nee ps en d area of the              city.   This

            was     in connection with          possible    thefts     of and from motor           vehicles

            parked     in that area        by persons atten din g            the FA Cup Semi Final            between

           Liver poo l       and N ot ti ng ha m Fore st at Hi 1lsborough.

            At 10.00am        (1000)    that day     I at t e n d e d a briefing at the H i l l s bo ro ug h

            Football     Ground,       ad d r e s s e d by Chief S u p e r in te nd en t DUCKENFIELD.

            After    that     initial    briefing     I and the other CID officers                  present had

            an additio nal          briefing    from Det.Supt.       McKAY,      de tailing     our    individual

            duties     for that day.

            After     that    I returned       to Hamme rton Road Police              S t at io n together         with

            DC                         who was     to work with me throug ho ut             that tour of duty.
  r

At H a m me r to n Road we            collected DC                       'S own vehicle which we

then drove        to Hoylan d Road at Ne ep s e nd where we                    parked.

As al re a d y m e n ti on ed         our duties     for    the day were to              patrol    the area

with    regard to theft of and from motor                         vehicles.        I    was    dressed that

day    in the following               clothings     blue    leather       jacket,        blue    checked

shirt,    blue      cord trousers and grey shoes.

To get her with DC I                         I patrolled the Ne ep s e nd are a a r ou nd

Ho yl an d Road,       Ne ep s e n d Lane,       Far kw oo d Road,        C l u b m i 11 Road and

P en ist one Road.        On oc casion during              our    patrolling we had to pass the

V ic to ri a Public House              on N e e p s e n d Lane and       the Owl Public House at

Hi 1 Ifoot Bridge.          Guts ide of both these                publi c houses were             large groups

of No tt i n g h a m Forest           su pporters    who were drinking                 heavily.

A pp ro xim ate    numbers       outside        these   premises wo ul d have                 been one hundred

outside    the Owl, and sixty outside                      the Victoria,           the    latter being         the

most    rowdy,     shouting,           singing and giving abuse               to       passing

motorists.        E sp ec i a l l y    receiving abuse were              passing        vehicles    containing

Liveroool        supporters.

A r ou nd 2 pm    (1400)      that af t e r n o o n traffic         had built up in the area,                    the

side    streets      that we were           patrolling       had filled wi t h            parked

vehicle s and along             the main        roads   there was a steady stream of traffic

travelling        towards H i l l s b o r o u g h    football       ground.        This       traffic   soon

became    heavily        congested at the junction of IMeepsend Lane and

Pe nistone Road where a uniform officer was                              on traffic duty.           Sh or tl y

after    this time        he was        joined at this           point    by a Polic e mo to rcy cli st

and a Police Range Rover wh ic h                    contained a further

traffic    officer and Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t NESBIT.                   These       officers

a ss is te d with traffic              control    and att em pt ed to make               two    lanes of

traffic    travelling along Pe ni sto ne Road towards H i l l s b o r o u g h                           in order

to ease    the      congestion.           At aro un d 2=3 Qp m that af t e r n o o n N ot ti ng ha m

public      houses alt ho u gh            not    in such st re ng th as they had been earlier.

There were         still     large        numbers    of supporters making           their way towards

the ground,         a distance            of some one       to one and a half miles.

By 2 . 50p m     (-1450) that a f t e r n o o n most          of the football        supporters     had

left the area and traffic                       congestion had eased       cons id era bl y around

N ee ps en d Lane,        It was aro un d this             time that DC                    and myself

made our way to the Police Co m m u ni ca ti on s Ca rav an wh ich was sit uat ed

outside      the Owl Public House                  on Hil lfoot Bridge,         ar riving a t a r o u n d 2.

5 5pm   (1455).       The    public        house at this       time app ea re d     to be quite empty

but there were           numerous glasses and bottles                   from these      premises

sc at ter ed aroun d on the street                   outside.

At the Co mm u ni c a t i o n C a r a v a n at this           time was Chief        Inspector

location that we ov er hea rd tr an sm i ss io n on Channel                       25 and became aware

that    there were          problems at the ground.

We were      then joined by DS BU XT O N and DC HIRST who were                          both e ngage d on

listened to further tr ans mi ss ion s                     on Channel    25.    It became all      too

obvious      from what we were                  hearing    that a serious       incident    had occ urred

at Lep pi ngs Lane end of the ground and that numerous                               people had been

a rr iv i n g at the P e n ist on e Road end of the ground at about 3. 4 5 p m

(1545).          Togeth er with these           other officers          I went to the gymn as iu m

wi th the equipment and s t a t i o ne ry we had taken wi t h us. On arrival

inside the gym I saw well                    over     fifty bodies         laid out on the -floor,

most     having a unif orm ed Police                  officer standing         by them.

In the      centre        section of the          gym I saw ambu lan ce         crews and medical

teams at t en din g         to numerous         injured       persons.      I also    noticed at      least

two doctors who were                 in the gym and they seemed to be examining                         the

obvious          dead and    pronouncing          life ext inc t. Ma ny of the Police            officers

I saw      inside        the gym at this         time were known to me and some were

personal          friends.       The m a j o r i ty   of these     officers a p pe ar ed to be          in a

severe      state of shock and a small                   number were         reduced to tears.

Tog eth er with D C ____________ |l then began to distribute                            body labels,

string and             rubber gloves to the officers who were                    dealing with the

dece ase d        persons.       Whilst     doing     this    I made   time to speak to officers               I

knew     personally who a p p e a r e d          to be shocked and            in a d a z e .I then

as s i s t e d    in moving the dec eas ed             persons wit hi n the gy mn as ium ,af ter

they had been             placed     into    ’body b a g s ’ and       pronounced dead by the

doctors who were on hand.

I was      then asked together with officers                        from my department,         to arrange

a number          of    chairs    in the     centre secti on of the gym for

relatives and friends to sit on.                        After      I had    put the    last   chair     in

place a short man who                  had been standing           nearby with a vicar su dd en ly

rushed forwards and began kickinbg                           the   chairs around.       He was also

shouting          obscenities and           I took     hold of him         in order   to try and        calm

him and to             prevent    him causing         injuries      to himself or others.          He then

turned his anger             towards me by. swearing and th re atening me,                      this man
                                                                                                        PAGE       5


smelled st ro ng ly of           intoxicants and from his                 demeanor      it was apparent

that    he was        quite drunk.

Anoth er     officer who         I believe was DS H O P E W E L L from D 1 , then                 came over

and    pulled this man away from me,                    speaking to him as             if he a l r e a d y

knew him.        A l t h o u g h this man was        no doubt       emotionally        upset the        fact

that    he was drunk was adding                 to his     problems.

At ar ou n d 5. 4 0 p m    (1740)       that a f t e r n o o n    X became    involved       in speaking

to relatives and friends                 of    persons who were missi ng at the ground.                        I

then a c c o m p a n i e d a number          of these    people      to H a m m e r t o n Ro a d Police

Station,       together with other              officers         travelling     on the Force          coach.

On arrival           at Hamme rton Road the           friends and         relatives went          to the

Hills bo rough Boys Club where Social                      Workers were         present to speak with

them.

I then went           to the CID office w h i c h had been turned                    into a large

interview        room.    He re I spoke         to friends and           relatives who were

reporting        people missing          that     had been with them at Hillsborough.

Aro u n d 7.3 0 p m     (1930)     that evening         together with other officers                    I

a t t e n d e d a briefing at the station,                 by D e t . S u p e r i n t e n de nt M c K A Y .

After     that       briefing    I was stood by in the CID office at Hamme rton Road

pending another matter                 not    connected with the H i l l s b o r o u g h         incident.

On S a t u r d a y    15 April     19S9 I was working              the   football      duty as       a CID

officer,       however,     I have wo r k e d many football                 games at the

H i l l s b o r o u g h Football   Ground       in uniform and           in particular at the

Le pp in gs Lane end.           When    it first      became ap parent          to me what        had

happened that a f t e r n o o n         I found      it hard to believe            that such a thing

could have           ha ppened and on such a large                 scale.

            At 9=00 am        (0900)      on S a tu rd ay        15 April      1989     (150489),      I commenced duty

           at H a m me rt on Rd Police St a t i on together with Police Con st abl e POL

           WALTON.        Tog eth er with other             officers we then made                   our way    in Police

            vehicles      to Sh ef fie ld W e d n e s d a y Football                 Ground,   Hi 1 Isborough,        for the

            event    of the FA Cup Semi-F in al                  betwee n N ot ti ng ha m Forest and

            Liverpool.         On arr ivi ng         at the ground,            we made our way           into the North

            Stand to sp ecified seating areas where                           at      10.00 am      (1000)    Chief

            S u p e ri nt en de nt   POL D U C K E N F I E L D    commenced the briefing               of the event.

           Having      been given our duties                for the day and              collecting a         pre-packed

            snack    bag,     I made my way with Police Cons tab le POL WALTO N                               to the

           N e ep se nd Ln,      collecting          my own motor         vehicle       from H a m m e r t o n Rd,      wh ic h

            I parked      in Ho yl an d Rd,          Neepsend.          Our duties         for the day were

            concerned with foot              patrolling          the Ne ep sen d are a dressed               in casual

            clothing with a view to vehicle se cu rit y and the a p p r e h e n s i o n of
offenders        involved       in theft       of and from motor          vehicles.



T og ether with Police C o n sta ble POL WALTON,                     I patrolled H o yla n d Rd,

N e e p s e n d Ln,    Pa rk wo o d Rd,    C l u b m i 11 Rd,   P e n is to ne Rd areas and    had

oc ca si on     to    pass both the Owl and Vi ct o r i a            public    houses.     Outsi de

both these           pubs were     large groups          of N o tt in gh am Fore st suppor ter s who

were     drinking          heavily.      I w o ul d estimate that there was a p p r o x i m a t e l y

100 supporters             outside the Owl and 60 suporters                 outside   the V ictoria,

the    latter being           the most     rowdy?       shouting,    singing and shouti ng abuse

at    passing motorists,              es pe ci al ly    vehicles    containing Liverpool

supporters.            The at te n d a n c e   of un if orm ed officers        in personnel

carriers,        dog       handlers and Special           C on sta bl es was   required outside

this     location.



Ou ts id e    the Owl        public house was a Police              control    unit and the mere

presence        of this and the few officers                    inside,   de te rre d the supporters

at this       location from becoming               too     rowdy,   but the ar e a was strewn with

cans,     glasses and empty bottles                    of Newc as tl e Brown Ale.        Traffic     in

the area gra dua lly built                up, and side streets were soon full with

parked       cars.     On the main        roads,       N ee ps en d Ln and Pe ni st on e Rd,   there

was a steady stream of traffic                     travelling       towards    the vi cinity of the

football        ground w hic h became           heavily      congested towards S . 00 pm (1400)

and was being              controlled by a un if orm ed officer at              the ju nc ti on of

these     two    roads.       He was    later    joined by a motor          cycle officer and a

Pol ic e Range Rover            containing a further              traffic officer and Chief

Su pe ri n t e n d e n t   POL NE S 8 I T who a s s i s t e d with traffic       control and

attempted        to make two          lanes of traffic           flow towards    the vi ci nit y of

the ground.



They did this by forming a sec on d                      lane of traffic       on Pe nistone Rd
t ra ve ll in g     towards H i l l s b o r o u g h wi th vehicles               turning      right    into that

road from N e e p s e n d Ln=                Tr af f i c alr ea dy    on Pe ni sto ne Rd        city side of

that    ju nc t i o n and tr av e l l i n g          towards H i l l s b o r o u g h formed the         inside

lane.         P r i o r i t y was given to both these                 lanes of traffic and vehicles

t ra ve ll in g     towards        city on P e n i s t o n e Rd were           forced to turn left            into

N e e p s e n d Ln and traffic               t r av el lin g   down Wo od St towards            that ju nc tio n

was forced to turn left a n d also                         travel     towards Hill sbo rou gh.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 .3 0     pm    (1430)     football         su ppo rte rs    could still      be

seen outside          the two          p r ev io us ly me n t i o n e d     pubs and      large numbers were

wal k i n g    towards     the ground,, a dist anc e                 of a p p r o x i m a t e l y a mile to a

mile a n d a half.             By three o' clock               (1500)       the ma jo ri ty    of football

su pp o r t e r s   had left the a re a and traffic                       co nge sti on had eased

considerably.



At 2 . 5 5     pm   )1455)     we a r r i v e d at the Police                control      unit outs ide     the

Owl    pub w h i c h was       by this time empty and saw Chief                           Inspector POL

McROBBIE.           Whilst at the             control      unit    I became awa re          of some     problems

at    the ground by ov e r h e a r i n g             radio tra ns mi ss io ns        on channel 25.         We had

and to gether wi t h them,                   listened to further              t ra ns mi ss io ns   on channel

25.      It became all             too obvious          from those tr an sm is si on s          that an

incident        had oc cu r r e d at the Leppi ngs                 Ln end of the           ground and that

On a r r i v i n g at the gymnasium,             at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3.4 5   pm    (1545)    I saw

              I t r a n s f e r r ed   to    ' F ’ D i v i s i o n on Mo nd ay 3 April        1989    <030489)      as    the

              Chief      Inspector          (Admin).



              The Op e r a ti on al         Order    for the FA        cup semi-final         was    draf ted and I was

              not    included on the order.



              As a new member               of the D i v i s i o n    1 made a request         to the Chief

              Superintendent            to be able        to a t t e n d the event         in order to observe              the

              Po li ce    operation.



              As a pre li mi n a r y to the event                I received an ov er vie w of the                  planning

              and    rationale         from     Inspector Sewell             at 2 .30   pm (1430 hrs)        on W e d n e s d a y

              •12 April       1989     (120489).
                                                                                                         PAGE


I did     not at t e n d the C o m m a n d e r ’s brief       on Fr id ay       14 April,,        19S9

( -140489) .



On S a t u r d a y    15 April       1989    (150489)   I a t t e n d e d S h e f f i e l d We d n e s d a y

football       gr ound at 9.45 am             (0945 hrs)     I was off        duty att en di ng          in my

own time,        in civilian          clothing    in order      to w a t c h , listen and            learn.



I took     up a place at the                rear of the Wor th Stand,             behind CID Off i c e r s ,

but    in front of the Special                 Co nstables.



It a p p e a r e d   to me that a t t e n t i o n to detail          was evident           in the way

aerials were ordered,                Off ic ers wore headgear and               p r of es si on al is m

prevailed.



Chief     Superintendent Duckenfield                imparted a factual               briefing

identi fy in g       the    various S e c t i o n Senior C om ma nd er s          by name and in

person.        He     impressed       that O f f i ce rs must act        in a professional               manner

w hi ch w ou ld       reflect    credit on S Yo rks hir e Police.



This    brief was          clear,,    concise and au dib le at the              rear by use of a

m i c r o p h o n e and amplifier.



This    part was f o l l o w e d by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray.



I was a ga in         im pressed w i t h the stan dar d of briefing,                   aga in a t t e n t i o n

to detail       such as the e v a c u a t i on      procedures and Off ic er s                being aware

of their       individual        requi rement      in the event          of such eventuality.



I p a r t ic ul ar ly      recall     him saying    "We have fully tried the ev ac u a t i o n

procedures           twice this season,          the first time was good,                  the second time
                                                                                           PAGE


was excellence?         if we are     required to         implement   e va cu at io n today,     it

must    be excellent".



This    briefing was fol lo we d       by an up to date          intellig enc e   report       from

De te ct iv e S e r ge an t Cha rl es wo rth .



Finally,     Inspector Sewell         gave general         in for mat ion about   radios,       issue

and mea li ng arrangem en ts .



It was s t r e s s ed that all O f f ic er s must be on their             respective      points

by 11.15 am      (1115 h r s ).



After    the briefing       it was evident         that    little   of value wo ul d be gained

until    later   into   the o p e r a t i o n so   I left the s ta di um to return to my

private     vehicle.     I was a p p r o a c h e d on three    separate    occasions      in

Pe n i s t o n e Rd and a sk ed   if I had any tickets          to sell.



There were a lot of            people a r ou n d first sitting        on walls    in groups.



I went    to my vehicle and drove to Ha m m e r t o n Rd Ps tn where               I carried

out    some o ut st an di ng    clerical   work,



I began to walk back to the stadium,                  leaving my      car at Ha m m e r t o n Rd

Pstn,    when a police         car of fe r e d me a lift to the ground.            This    I

accepted.



I saw P o l i c e w o m a n S m i t h and an ot her Officer      outside Thr es he rs     near

Holme Ln and was         pleased to see Of fi ce rs          doing what was ex pe ct ed of
                                                                                                         page         4


1 'asked to be dro pp ed a little aw a y from the stad ium as                                  I wa nt ed to

observe O f f i c e r s         on their        re spective areas and see how                 they were

performing.            I was      really a n o ny mo us       to them or           ma ny of them as     I    was

new to the D i v i s i o n and not                in uniform.



All Police O f f ic er s were ac t i n g               properly,        but    I    was a little     s u r pr is ed

that at       1.00 pm (1300 h r s ) there were                   so few cars and             pedestr ian s    in

the area.



B y H i l l s b o r o u g h Park     1    saw a group of         people sitting around,                there was
                                                                                                                          !


a white       palstic          carrier bag with them and the outline                         of cans    could be

seen.       The visible           cans were        of H e in e k e n   lager       in the green      can.                 j

                                                                                                                          j
                                                                                                                          !


There were         six men and they were                 joking about          having to drink the            lot

as they wo ul d not              be a l l o w e d to take them          into the ground.



Ap pr ox    1.15 pm (1315 hrs).                                                                                           |



By Leppings          Ln gates were              few supporters,         road       clear,    plenty of Police

Officers        evident.



I went to the            barrier at L e p pi ng s         Ln / Vere Rd where                I spoke to      'A5

Di v i s i o n Officers,          Po li ce C o n s t a b l e s Pa rk i n and Drury.            A few people

passing and we spoke about                       running and       'A 5 Divisional           work.



I then wa l k e d        past L e p p i n g s Ln gates and             came    to barriers and Po li ce

O f f i c e r s - Police S e r g e a n t N o r b u r n an d others             1    do not know.       There

were    no other         people near            this area.       I knew from my             prelimi nar y

d i s c u s s i o n s w it h    Inspector Sewell           the   ne ces sit y to       provide a sterile

area to keep opposing                    fans    separate.
                                                                                          PAGE         5




I cont in ue d along    the   road being       the So ut h St an d    past   the TV unit      vans

where   I was met w it h ano th er     barrier      of metal     ba rr ier s an d Police

Officers.      I produced my war ran t         card,   but    I was   known to one Off ic er

who   I did not know.



I went down and along Pe n i s t o ne        Rd whi ch was      busy.



I w a l k e d towards P a r ks id e Rd and     I was agai nst     the flow of       people,      it

was very busy.



I st op pe d and spoke to Police Co ns ta bl e Vallance               from   'A' D i v i s i o n and

Police Constable]__________ from 'A * D i v i s i o n at separate             points    but   due

to e n qu ir ie s and sheer    numbers    of    persons      it was   prudent to move on,

as they needed all        their a t t e n t i o n to deal with the volume of people.



I returned to rear        of S o u t h Stand.



About   1i.45 am    (1145 hrs),      the Liver poo l      team coach arrived.



There was a m ot or cy cl e    lead and Police         horses    controlling a large

crowd awai ti ng    the trains arrival.



I noticed the horse        near me was       d i spl ayi ng a Me rs e y s i d e Police Badge

on the saddle.



There were no incidents.



S er ge a n t So r s b y of S Yo r k s h i r e Pol ice M o u n t e d said to the other

About    1=35    pm (1355 hrs),          the N o t t i n g h a m Forest   team   coach arrived.

The    procedure was as for Liverpool,                   no   problems?    crowd good humoured.



I left     this a re a and       returned to Pen is to ne Rd as            X intended      to use the

en trance     to the gr ou nd by the Po lice Room.



P e n i s t o n e Rd was quite      busy but        there was    no queuing at the turnst ile s

as    I w o u l d have expected.           At that time about         one hour      to kick    off.



I knew there was a L i v er po ol                train due at W a ds le y Bri dge ar ou nd 2.05

pm    (1405 hrs)      but d e c i d e d to go into the ground.



I went     to the main         sliding     gate and      produced my war ra nt card and          a

special     card     issued to me by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray.         Both were fully

checked and ex am i n e d by the st ewards wh ich                 I thought was excellent.



I was a s s u r e d no u n a u t h o r i s e d    person w oul d gain entry at that gate.



I went     down onto the         perimeter         track and was    im me di ate ly    su rpr ise d by

how full      the S pi on      Hop was.          X turned and saw the No rth St an d was             not

very full.         I made      my way     to the Pol ice Control          box.



Inspector Sewell           had a l e r t e d me to the fact that           inside     there was      only

limited space.           I intended to visit?             see   it op er ate d and     leave   if I

was    in the way.



I wa n t e d to see      the Control         point as     I was at Don ca st er Rovers when

the    camera eq uipment was            first      instal led and op er at ed at the        beginning

of the     present season.            The e n g ine er was always         quoting Sh e f f i e l d
                                                                                                     PAGE         7


We d n e s d a y sy st em as being         exce lle nt and holding               the system as the wa y

all    grounds     should operate.



On en tering       the Po li ce       box there was Ser ge an t Goddard,                Police

Con s t a b l e Ry a n at the front and Pol ice Con st ab le                     B ic ha rd at the    rear

by the     camera op erating            controls.



I was    informed by Police S e r ge ant Go d d a r d that Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu rr a y

had gone      to speak to the             referee so         1 sat on his seat and was           offered

a hot drink.          It d i d n ’t ap p e a r      pa rt ic ula rly busy and quite          clearly

ev er y t h i n g was under       control.



A s s is t a n t Chief Co n s t a b l e    (Operations)           Mr Jac ks on     came to the   control

point,     he was     in civilian          clothing.



I saw th ro u g h the        control       room wi nd o w S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu rr a y and Chief

Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenf ie ld ,     in uniform,         walk ing along      the track.       They

came    through the un c o v e r e d seats             in the So ut h S t a n d and entered the

control     room.



I went     to the far end of the                room and stood by the               camera   control

area.      I was     pr epared to         leave,     but did not appear             to be hindering

•anyone a n d felt        I w o u l d gain onset           benefit        from staying and observing

from this       point.



On    looking    into the gr ou nd the Li verpool                       areas   had a lot of space,         the

Notts Forest         parts     I could see on the So ut h St an d and the Sp ion Kop

were    quite full.



I recall      Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d    commenting about     there    being
                                                                                                     PAGE         Q


no en te r t a i n m e n t       being    prov ide d to encourage         the suppor ter s        to come

early.



I remember when              1    was a child there always            being a band        playing     by the

players tunnel at                 every game at Hill sbo rou gh.



Wh i l s t    I didn't       see    i t , A s s i s t a n t Chief Co ns ta bl e O p er at io ns    commented

that a person just below the Po li ce                      control     had just dro pp ed his

trousers.         When       I looked the         person was     jiggling around.            I remember

thinking        how empty the a r e a a r o u n d this yo ut h was.                  Police Con st ab le

B i c h a r d o p e ra te d the      camera an d      I w a tc he d him to be able         to zoom onto

him w h i c h    I thought was a super fa ci li ty for spotting                        t ro ub le ma ke rs   in

the    crowd.



I was aware            the a re a    in L e p p i n g s Ln behind the goal was filling                up but

this was        to be expected.



I was        then aware          that both teams       came onto      the    pitch for a pre-match

wa r m up.       As there was no thing              special     happening      on the screen or in

the gr ou nd      I looked onto the               playi ng area.



I was aware that Alan H a n s o n of Liverpool                      was     on the    pitch and was

s u r p r i s e d as    I didn't         think   he w o u l d be playing.       The Liver poo l       fans

were shouting            his name and he a c k n o w l e d g e d them by raising his hand.

All was good humoured.



The a r e a behind the goal at L e p p i n g s Ln was getting full                         but     there was

space at the front.                  Pe op le    seemed   reluctant       to move     forward,      probably

all wan ti ng          to m a i n t a i n their    best   view of the        playing area.

App ro x £ .30     pm <1430 h r s ) .



1 looked on the           left mo ni t o r and was aware           there seemed a build up of

supporters.



I remember asking S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu rra y about          this,     he exp la in ed that

due to ne c e s s a r y s e g r e g a t i o n of fans,     access    to the Nor th Stand,           wh ic h

had been a l l o c a t e d to L i ve rp oo l      supporters,       could only be done by

L ep p i n g s Ln entrances,       this meant          that the entrances        on P e n is to ne Rd

to the s ta nd wh ic h wo ul d norma lly be used were unavailable.



This    e x p la in ed at that     time    in my mind the         crowds on the screen.



I recall     a su gg e s t i o n that     the    loud hailer       / tannoy should be used to

request     fans    to move      fo rw a r d to create      room at    the    rear    to prevent

crowding.



Peo ple    began a d v is in g    control       that    radio   recept ion was       poor.



An engineer        came    into the     room to try and           improve    tr an sm i s s i o n and

reception.



I remember       him in blue under          the    control      room bench,      I thought       it was

crowded as Police S e r g e a n t G o d da rd was wal ki ng            round / over          him.



I thought of        leaving but was         unable       to get    past and was better staying

where     I was.



I was aware S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Ma rshall        r e qu est ed the   closure     of Lepp ing s

Ln to traffic.
                                                                                                    PAGE          10




I looked to the sc reen a n d whilst                        there    seemed a    lot of    people   this

was    to be expe ct ed and this had been the sit ua ti on                         for quite a time.

It was       not extraordi na ry .               1 recall     seeing a cream double decker bus

tr av e l l i n g    slowly thr ou gh the              crowd which     indicated the       road was    not

blo ck ed and free move me nt                  was     possible.



The s i t u a t i o n      remained      like t h i s , poor        reception?    the ground slowly

filling       up and everyt hi ng               progres sin g as one w ou ld expect for such                 an

occasion.            The    crowd se emed good hu mo ure d             in the ground.



A pprox 2.4 5         pm (1445 h r s )



The    crowd outside ap pe a r s                denser    on the     camera but    I can see a Police

horse      on the       screen.        Having seen them at             close hand control        the   crj)wd

whe n the          team coaches arrived,                I sensed they were well           in control.



O ff ic er s were          d e p lo ye d to assist?         including a land       rover with PA

e q u ip m e n t    to assist O f f ic er s           outside.



Ar ou n d this time a             radio mes sa ge was            relayed   requesting     the gates    to

be ope ne d as          persons were tr ap ped up aga in st                the   gates.



I remember           thinking,       you       c a n ’t open the gates or you        lose    control     over

who    is admitted,            you are      unable       to search or check        persons a d m i t t e d

for wea po ns and may               create a difficult              public order    sit ua ti on for

Pol ice      inside        the g r o u n d .



The gates were              not a u t h o r i s e d    to be opened by Chief Su pe ri n t e n d e n t

D u c k e n f i e l d at this time.
                                                                                                       PAGE        11




I am a wa re           that the teams are          no longer        on the     pitch so the         start

could not be far off and there was                          still a lot of space on the terrace

under        the Police Control.



It o c c u r r e d      that some Liver po ol            s u ppo rte rs were      leaving    it late but

people often enter after                   the start        of many games.



About        this time         1 can see     people       climbing    over the wall an d            point   this

out to the             controllers.        1 then saw the gates              dis pl ay ed on the       camera

which        1    believe are      the    conce rti na gates on the service                  road to the

rear    of the S ou th S t a n d open and a surge of                       people    rush    into the

ground.            1   said,    "The gates      have      been forced".



It was di fficult              to estimate        how man y entered the             ground but the gates

were    qu ic k l y      closed again.          It seemed         control    was    regained with help

of a m o u n t e d Officer who             put his        horse acr oss      the gap     in the gate.



People           however are still         being able         to climb over the wall            into the

ground.           S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall    again    requests       the gates    to be

opened.           This    is a general         request.



It is getting             close to kick off              time.



I can see by the                players tunnel           a semi    circle    of    pho tog rap her s

awaiting           the arrival       of the     two teams.



It seems the S u p e r i n t e n d e n t will             have to try and          prevent the start          of

the    game as the fans will                 not all       get    in but    I thought       there    is no way

an y o n e       can get to the        referee     or team ma na ger s         to do this at this           late
                                                                                                   PAGE    -12


stage.        As    I was    thinking         this   the    crowd er ru pt ed as a team      ran on.

I've    no    idea wh ic h team as the sound                   inside   the ground tr an sm itt ed

itself       outside a n d from what             I saw on the moni tor          control    was

diff ic ul t       outside     now.



At this       point S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mars ha ll      requested the gates        to be opened

as there was going to be serious                       injury or someone         killed outside       in

the    crush if they were             not opened.



There was          still    room on the         terrace       under   the   control.     The So uth

S t a n d was m uc h fuller         but not full.



Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu rr ay was       stan di ng wi th a personal        radio    in his    hand

as ki ng Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d for a decision.



It was       evident       there e x i s t e d a tre me nd ou s       problem for Offic ers        outside

the L e p p i n g s Ln entrance.



Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d was    deeply   considering      the situation.



I recall       him thinking a l o u d words                to the effect ~ if there's            likely to

be serious          injury or death outside                 I have    no option that to open the

gates ~ He          told S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray,     "Open the Gates".



S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu r r a y gave    the general       in str uct ion over the     radio to

open the gates.



On the mo ni t o r         I saw the      c on ce rti na gates        open an d fans     come flooding

in.
                                                                                                PAGE      13


The    game had sta rt ed when              I looked back onto the         claying area.            The

play was at           the P e n is to ne    Rd end.



X became a wa re of a perimeter                   track gate being ope ned        and      people    being

let onto       the track out of             the   pen behind   the goal an d      ush er ed and

pointed       in the      dire ct io n of the       part where   there was still            plenty of

s pace.



The m o v e m e n t    seemed ord er ly       but the numbers were building             up.



Fans were       going onto        the track st arting        to move    in the d i r ec ti on as

d i r e c t e d but then stopping and standing wat ch in g                 the g a m e .



A P o l i c e w o m a n was    in control     of the gate      into the ar ea where there was

space     but did not open           it.



I thought she           probably d i d n 't have a radio or hadn"t              sensed that she

must open       it to let fans             into the open areas      behind her.



I began to sense yo ut hs w ou ld                 run onto the   piaying area so            ran out of

the    control        point*    thr ou gh the unc ov er ed seats onto the            perimeter

track and got the gate by the P o l i c e w o m a n open and began directing

fans    to the area.           More and more were          coming   onto    the track.         I was

ush ering      them to the open gate and the P o l i c e w o m a n assisted.



I went     behind a d v e r t i s i n g    hoar din gs   to prevent    persons     en cro ach ing

onto    the    playing area.



   could see          people    pushed up a g ai ns t     the fence    but not aware of any

particular        problems or        injuries as there         is a st ea dy stream of          people

onto    the       perimeter      track.



More and more            people on the track and beginning                    to move onto the grass

.by the goal           line.



I see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d on top of the fence,            having     climbed up

and he      is ge sturing             by waving    his arms and asking            for the game to be

s to p p e d .



It seems          by his fr antic waves Control              are not u n d e r st an di ng       his

request.           I run to control          but by the unc ov er ed seats             I meet

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu r r a y with his hat on running           the opposite way.               We

run together            to a linesman to get           his at t e n t i o n to stop the game.



The    linesman         ran straight        past Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray.



I chase          the   linesman shouting          him to get the        r e f e r e e ’s at t e n t i o n to

stop the game.



I then see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d   running    towards       the   referee.



There are          lots of fans          in the Liverpool       g o a lm ou th    in front     of Lappi ngs

Ln Terrace.



I think          it is a public order             situation.



As they are Li verpool                  supporters?    I run onto       the      playing ar ea and

protect Nigel            Cl o u g h    in case any Liver poo l       sup po rt er s try to attack

When    I am s a t is fi ed there            is no danger to            players     I look and see

hun dr ed s       of    people   spilling          onto the     playing area.        There       is quite

clearly       in my mind a major                  public    order s i t ua ti on whi ch will        need a

large       un if o r m presence       to control.



I am    in the          centre of the        playing area,            in plain    clothes.



There       is nothing        I can u s e fu ll y do         in a public order         context      so    1

decide       to    return to the Po l i c e Control               point.



En    route       I am    passed by un i f o r m ed         reinf orc eme nts as      I pass through the

unc o v e r e d seating.



On    re-ent er in g       control      room       I learn that        persons are     su spe cte d of

being       injured.



An a m b u l a n c e     is called for and qu ic kl y arrives                behind the Leppings Ln

goal.



A mes sa ge        is relayed to Police               control     that ma ny      people are       injured.

As they       are       not   local    people,, Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e l d decides

to    call    out C a s u a l t y B u r e a u s t a f f .



I am di re c t e d by As s i s t a n t Chief Constable,                   Mr Jackson,       to    call    for

Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Addis and           request     he    comes to Hil lsborough.



I    make    the       request   by tele ph on e          to Force Op er a t i o n s Room as       instructed.



I've    no    ac cu r a t e a s s e s s m e n t    of time,     but this     call    sho uld be recorded

             I t r a n s f er re d to    'F' D i v i s i o n   on Mon da y 3 April          1989    (030489)     as the

             Chief     Inspector        (Admin).



             The Op er at io na l       Order    for the FA         cup semi-final         was     drafted and       I was

             not, included on the            order.



             As a new member            of the D iv is i o n      I made a request           to the Chief

             S u o e r 1ntendent     to be able        to att en d the event              in order to observe           the

             Pdice      operation.



             As a p re li minary to the event                  I received an o ve rview of the                  planning

             and     rationale      from    Inspector Sewell              at 2 .30   pm    (1430 hrs)     on W e d n e s d a y

I did not a tt en d the C om mande r *s brief                 on Fri da y      14 April,       1969

<140489).



On Saturday         13 April        1989    (150489)    I a tt en de d S he f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

•Football g ro und at 9.4 5 am               (0945 hrs)     1 was off duty a ttending                 in my

own time,       in civilian          clothing     in order to watch,            listen and         learn.



I took up a place at the                   rear of the North Stand,             behind CID Officers,

but    in front of the Soecial               Constables.



It a p pe a r e d to me that a t t e n t i o n       to detail      was evident          in the way

serials were         ordered,        O ff icers wore     headgear and          p r o fe ss io na li sm

prevailed.



C hief S u pe r in t e n d e n t   Duckenfieid        imparted a factual            briefing

ident if yi ng      the various S e c t i o n Senior C o mm an de rs            by name and in

person.        He   impressed        that O ff ic e r s must, act       in a professional             manner

w hi ch w o ul d    reflect        credit    on S Y orkshire Police.



This    brief was         clear,     concise and audible at             the    rear by use of a

m i cr o ph o ne and amplifier.



This    part Was f o ll ow ed by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray.



I was a g ai n      i mpressed with the standard of briefing,                        a gain a t t e n t i o n

to detail       such as      the e va cu a t i o n    procedures and O ff icers             being aware

of their       individual          requiremen t      in the event of such eventuality.



1   p a rt i cu la rl y   recall     him saying       "We have fully tried the evacu at io n
                                                                                              PAGE


procedures       twice   this    season,        the   first time was      good.,, the second time

was    excellence;       if we are       required to         implement   e v ac ua ti on today,     it

must    be excellent".



This    briefing was       f ol lowed by an up to date             intelligence      report       from

D et e ct i ve S er geant Charlesworth.



Finally;,    Inspector Sewell            gave    general      i nformation about     radios?       issue

and me al in g arrangements.



It was    s t res sed that all          O ff ic er s must    be on their     respective      points

by 11.15 am       C1115 h r s ),



After    the briefing       it was       evident      that    little of value w o ul d be gained

until    later    into   the op er at io n so         I left    the s t a di um to return to my

private     vehicle.     I was a p p r o a c h e d on three       separate    occasions      in

P en i st o ne Rd and asked        if    I had any tickets         to sell.



T here were a      lot of    people a ro u n d first sitting             on walls    in groups.



1 went    to my vehicle and             drove    to H am m e r t o n Rd Pstn where    1 carried

out some outsta nd in g         clerical        work.



I began to walk back            to the      stadium,,    leaving my      car at Hammer ton Rd

Pstn,    when a police       car offered me a lift to               the ground.       This    I

accepted.



1   saw P o l i c e w o m a n Smith and anot he r Officer          outside Thr es he rs      near

Holme Ln and was         pleased to see O ff ic er s            doing what was      e xp ec te d of
I a sk ed to be dropped a little away -From the stadium as                              I wanted to

observe O f ficers         on their        respective areas and               see how they            were

performing.         I     was     really a n o n ym ou s   to them or          many ofthem            as    1was

new to the D iv is i o n and           not    in uniform.



All P olice O ff icers were acting                 properly?       but     1 was a little sur pr is ed

that at     1=00    pm    (1300 hrs)         there were so few           cars an d    pedestrians      in

the area.



By H i l l s b o r o u g h Park   I saw a group of          people sitting around,              there was

a white     palstic       carrier      bag w ith them and the              outline of cans       could be

seen.      The    visible     cans     were    of H ei n e k e n   lager    in the green       can.



There were        six men and they were             joking about          having     to drink the      lot

as they w ou ld not         be a l l o w e d to take       them into the ground.



A pprox    1.15    pm <1315 hrs).



By Leppings Ln             gates were few supporters,               road      clear,     plenty of Police

Officers      evident.



I went to the barrier at L ep pi ng s Ln / Vere Rd where                             I spoke    to    'A9

D i v i s i o n Officers,    Police      Cons ta bl es Par ki n and Drury.             A few people

passing and we spoke about                   running and      'A' Divisional         work.



1 then w al k e d       past L ep pings      Ln gates and came to barriers and Police

O ff icers - Police S er geant No rburn and others                         I do not know.        There

were    no other        people near      this area.         I knew from my p reliminary

d i s cu s si o ns with    Inspector Sews 11 the nec es si ty to                provide a sterile
                                                                                          PAGE


a re a to keep opposing       fans   separate.



1' c ontinued along     the   road being       the S outh S tand      past the TV unit vans

where   I was met with another           barrier     of metal     barriers and Police

Officers.     I produced my w a r ra nt        card,   but    I was   known to one Officer

who   I did not know.



I went down and along         P e n i st on e Rd w hich was     busy.



I w al ke d towards Parks ide Rd and           I was agai ns t     the flow of      people,,     it

was very busy.



I st op pe d and spoke    to Police C o n s ta bl e V al la nc e from        'A' D i v i s i o n and

Police Con st ab le               from    ‘A" D i v i s i o n at separate     points but       due

to enquiries and sheer         numbers     of persons        it was   prudent to move        on,

as they needed all       their a t t e n t i o n   to deal with the volume          of people.



I returned to      rear of South S t a n d .



About   11.45 am    (1145 hrs),      the Liverpool       team     coach arrived.



There was a moto rc yc le      lead and Police         horses     controlling a large

crowd a wa iting    the trains a r r i v a l .



1 noticed the horse near me was              displaying       a M e r s e y s i d e Police Badge

on the saddle.



There were no      incidents.

O ff icers - "Exact ly the same            for t-he Notts Forest C o a c h " »



A bout   1.35 pm     (1355 nrs),       the N o t t i n g h a m Forest   team coach arrived.

The    procedure was as        for Liverpool,,        no   problems,,    crowd good humoured.



I left this a rea anti returned to Pe ni st on e Rd as                   I intended    to use      the

entrance     to the ground       by the Police Room.



P e n i s to n e Rd was quite busy       but there was        no queuing at the        turnstiles

as    I w ou ld have   expected.        At that     time about      one hour      to kick off.



I    knew there was a Liverpool            train due at Wads 1ey Bridge ar ou nd 2.05
                                                                                                    1
pm (1405 hrs)       but decided to go          into    the ground.



1 went    to the main sliding           gate and      produced my warrant          card and a

special     card   issued to me by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray.         Both were    fully

checked and        examined by the       stewards w hich       I thought was        excellent.



I was a s s ur ed no u n a ut ho ri se d    person would gain entry at that gate.



I went    down onto the        perimeter      track and was       immediately s u r p ri se d by

how full     the S pion Kop was.           I turned and saw the N orth S t an d was             not

very full.         I made my way to the Police Control                  box.



Inspector Sewell           had a l e rt ed me to the fact        that    inside    there was    only

limited space,         I    intended    to visit,      see   it operated and        leave   if 2

was    in the way.



I wanted     to see    the Control        point as     1 was at Don ca st er Rovers when

the    camera equipment was         first     installed and o pe rated at the beginning

of the      present    season.      The engineer was always              quoting S h e f fi el d

W e d n e s d a y system as being       excellent and holding             the system as the way

all    grounds      should operate.



On entering         the Police     box there was Sergeant Goddard,                  Police

C o ns ta bl e Ryan at the front and Police                C on stable B i c ha rd at      the    rear

by the camera operating             controls.



a   was    informed by Police S er ge an t G o d d a r d that S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M ur r a y

had gone       to speak to the         referee    so    I sat on his          seat and was   offered

a hot drink.          It d i d n 9t appear      p ar ti cularly    busy and quite         clearly

e v er yt hi ng was    under    control.



A s s i s ta n t Chief C on stable      (Operations)       Mr J a c k s o n    came to the   control

point,      he was    in civilian       clothing.



1   saw t hrough the         control    room w i n d o w S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Mu rr ay and Chief

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Duckenfield,   in uniform,      walking along          the track.       They

came      through the     u ncovered seats        in the S outh S tand and entered the

control      room.



X went      to the far end of the           room and stood by the               camera   control

area.       I was    prepared to       leave,    but did not appear            to be hindering

anyone      and felt     1 w ould gain onset           benefit    from staying and observing

from this       point.



On looking        into the gr ou nd the Liverpool             areas     had a lot of space,             the

Notts F orest        parts    I could see on the S outh S t a n d and the S p io n Hop

were quite full.

I recall        Chief Superintendent, D u c k e n f i e l d        commenting about          there being

no e n t er t ai nm en t       being       provided to encourage         the supporters          to come

early.



I remember w hen              I was a child there always             being a band         playing by the

players     tunnel           at every game at Hillsborough.



Whilst    I didn't            see    it,    Ass is ta nt Chief Co ns ta bl e Oper at io ns        commented

that a    person just               below the Police       control   had just dropped his

trousers-            W hen    I looked the        person was    jiggling around.            I remember

t hinking       how empty the are a a r o u n d this y outh was.                   Police C o n s ta bl e

8 ichard o p er at ed the             camera and       I w a tc he d him to be able to 2 0 0 m onto

him w h i c h    I    thought was a super             facility for spotting          troub le ma ke rs      in

the    crowd.



I was aware           the area        in L ep pi ng s Ln behind the goal was              filling up but

this was        to be expected.



I was    then a ware that              both teams       came onto the      pitch for a pre-match

w arm up.        As there was              nothing   special   happening     on the screen or in

the ground           I looked onto the            playing area.



I was a ware          that Alan H an s o n of Liverpool            was    on the    pitch and was

s ur p ri s ed as       I d i d n ’t think he w o ul d be       playing.      The Liverpool          fans

were    shouting         his name and he a c k n o w l e d g e d     them by raising         his hand.

All was good humoured.



The a r e a behind the goal at L ep pings Ln was                      getting      full    but    there was

space at the front.                   People     seemed   reluctant to move         forward,       probably

all wanting           to m ai n t a i n their        best view of the      playing area.

Approx 2 .30         pm   (1430 hrs).



1 looked on the             left m o n it or and was aware            there    seemed a build up of

supporters.



1 remember asking S u p e r i n t e n d e n t         Murray about       this,    he exp la in ed that

aue to n e c e ss ar y s eg r e g a t i o n of fans,          access    to the N or th Stand,         w h i ch

had been a l l o c a t e d to Liverpool              supporters,       could only be done by

L e ppings    Ln entrances,           this meant          that the entrances       on Pen is to ne Rd

to the stand w hich would                  normally be used were unavailable.



This   exp la in ed at that time              in my mind the          crowds   on the screen.



I recall      a s uggestion that             the    loud hailer       / tannoy should be used to

request      fans     to move       forward to       create    room at the       rear to     prevent

c rowdi n g .



Peoole    began advising             control       that    radio   reception was       poor.



An engineer          came    into    the    room to try and          improve   t ra ns m i s s i o n and

reception.


I remember       him      in blue under        the    control      room bench,      I thought      it was

crowded as Police S er ge an t G o d d a r d was walk in g                round / over him.



I thought       of    leaving but was          unable       to get    oast and was      better staying

I was aware S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall            requested the       closure    of Leppi ng s

I looked to           the screen and whilst             there seemed a lot of people               this

was to be expec te d and this                  had been the sit ua ti on for quite a time.

It was       not extraordinary.               I recall     seeing a cream double           decker     bus

t r av el li ng     slowly through the            crowd which       indicated the       road was      not

blo ck ed and         free m ov ement was         possible.



The     s i t u at io n    remained    like    this?    poor    reception,      the ground slo wl y

f illing       up and everything            p rogressing as one w ou ld expect             for such        an

occasion.           The     crowd seemed good humoured              in the ground.



Ap pr ox 2.45         pm    (1443 hrs)



The     crowd outside apDears               denser     on the    camera but      2 can see a Police

horse      an the         screen.     Having    seen them at        close   hand    control     the   crowd

whe n    the    team coaches arrived?              I sensed they were well             in control.



O ff icers were            deployed to assist?          including a land         rover with PA

e qu ip me nt     to assist O ff icers          outside.



Ar ou nd this        time a radio message was               relayed     requesting      the gates     to

be opened as              persons were      trap pe d up against        the gates.



I remember          thinking?        you    can't open the gates         or you     lose   control        over

who     is admitted?             you are unable      to search or       check    persons a dm it te d

for weapons and may                 create a difficult          public order sit ua ti on for

Police       inside        the    ground.



The gates were              n o t ,a u t h o r i s e d to be opened by C hief S up er i n t e n d e n t

D uc k en f ie 1cl at      this time.



I am aware         that     the teams are        no     longer    on the    pitch so the          start

could not be far off and                  there was       still    a lot of space on the terrace

under       the P olice Control,



It occ ur red           that some L iv erpool          supporters ware          leaving    it late but

people       often enter after            the start       of m any games.



About       this   time     I can see       people      climbing    over the wall and             point this

out to the          controllers,           I then saw the gates            d isplayed on the         camera

w h ic h    I believe are the             concertina gates         on the service          road to the

rear of the South S ta nd open and a surge                         of    peopie    rush into the

ground.          I said,     “The    gates    have been forced'1.



It was       difficult       to estimate       how m any entered, the ground but                   the gates

were       q ui ck ly    closed again.        It seemed         control    was    regained wit h help

of a m o u nt ed Offi cer who              put his ho rse across           the    gap   in the g a t e .



P eople      however are          still    being able      to climb over          the wall    into the

ground.         S u pe ri n t e n d e n t Marshall     a gain    requests       the gates    to be

opened.         This      is a general       request.



It is getting             close    to kick off time.



I can see by the             players      tunnel       a semi    circle    of    photographers

a w ai ti ng    the arrival         of the two         teams.



It seems        the S u p e r i n t e n d e n t will    nave to try and          prevent the start          of

the game as             the fans will       not all      get    in but    I thought       there    is no way

a nyone    can get to the            referee         or team managers        to do this at this       late

stage.       As    I was    thinking          this    the    crowd e rr upted as a team ran on.

I've no idea w hich team as the sound                          inside   the ground tr an sm it te d

itself     outside and from what                 I saw on the monitor           control    was

d if fi cu lt     outside     now.



At this      point S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Marshall         requested the gates        to be opened

as there was         going     to be serious            injury or someone        killed outside       in

the   crush       if they were        not opened.



There was still            room on the terrace                under   the   control.     The South

S t a n d was much fuller            but, not        full.



S up e ri n t e n d e n t Mu rr ay was standing with a personal                  radio    in his    hand

a sking Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e I d for a decision.



It was evident           there     existed a tremendous               proolem for Officers         outside

the L e pp i ng s Ln entrance.



Chief S u pe r in t e n d e n t D u c k e n f i e 1d was       deeply   considering      the situation.



I recall        him thinking a lo ud words                  to the effect - if there's           likely to

be serious         injury or death outside                   1 have no option that        to open the

gates - He told S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray,              "Open the Gates".



S u p e r i n t e n d e n t M ur r a y gave    the general       instru ct io n over     the radio    to

open the gates.



O n the m onitor         I saw the        conc er ti na gates         open and fans      come flooding
                                                                                                  PAGE        1




The game had started whe n               I looked back onto the           playing area.           The

play was at        the Pen is to ne      Rd end.



I became aware           of a perimeter         track   gate being opened         and    people    being

let onto the track             out of    the    pen behind        the goal and ushered and

pointed       in the d ir ection of the           part where        there was still        plenty of

s oa c e »



The m o ve ment        seemed orderly but the numbers were                 building       up.



Fans were        going    onto   the track       starting      to move    in the d ir ection as

d i re c te d but then stopping and standing w at ching                    the    game.



A P o l i c e w o m a n was   in control       of the gate        into the area where           there was

space     but    did not open      it.



I thought        she    probably didn't         have a radio or hadn't            sensed that she

must    open     it to let fans         into the open areas           behind her.



1 began to sense youths w o u l d               run onto      the    playing area so       ran out       of

the    control     point,     through     the unc ov er ed seats onto            the    perimeter

track and got           the gate   by the P o l i c e w o m a n     open and began directing

fans    to the area.          More a nd more were            coming    onto the track.           I was

us he ri ng     them to the open gate an d the P o l i c e w o m a n assisted.



I went       b ehind ad ve rt is in g    hoardings      to    prevent    persons       e ncroaching

onto    the     playing area.



I could see         people     pushed up a g a in st     the fence but       not aware          of any
                                                                                                          PAGE      14


particular          problems    or    injuries as there               is a steady        stream of people

onto    the    perimeter       track,



M ore and more         people    on the track and beginning                       to move onto         the grass

by the goal         line.



I -sea S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d on top of the fence,              having       climbed up

and he     is g esturing        by waving        his arms and asking                for the game          to be

stooped.



It seems       by his frantic waves Control                     are   not    understandi ng his

request,        1 run to control           but    by the un co ve re d seats               1 meet

Superintendent          Murray with his           hat      on   running      the    opposite way.             We

run t ogether        to a linesman to get               his a t t e n t i o n to stop the g a m e ,



The    l inesman      ran straight        past S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Murray,



I chase       the   linesman shouting            him to get the             r e f e r e e ’s a t t e n t i o n to

stop the game,



I then see S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d    running towards            the    referee.



There are       lots of fans          in the L iv erpool          go al mo ut h     in front       of L ep pings

Ln Terrace.



I think       it is a public          order   situation.



As they are Liverpool                supporters,        I run onto          the    playing area and

protect Nigel C lo ug h           in case an y Liverpool                supporters         try to attack

him.

                Following          briefing,      I u nderto ok         the    duties        on serial        6 under         the

                task      was    to monitor       p u b lic     houses and            similar     places      regarding groups

                of      su D D orters    who may      be   drunk,       etc.          Our   d e s i g n a t e d meal    tim e      was

  during          this       time.



The only            contact we              had w it h football                 fans was as we were                     parked on a

public          house        car    park        (which was             closed)         on the A61 at G r e n o s i d e .                 In

the main,             these fans were Liv er po o l                          s u p p or t er s who        e nq u ir e d of 3

public          toilet,           and

3.      Where was             the ground.

These       fans were all                   in private            cars a nd        it was           c om m en t ed            upon that

several          of them s me l l e d of drink but                           it is fair         to say they were                     not

drunk a nd g e n er al ly                   they were            good humoured.



we    rema ined on patrol                       in the a re a until a p p r o x i m a t e l y                    14.30 hours,

w hen     because            the    radio         transmissions               from m a t c h        control          centred upon

crowds at L ep pi n g s                     L n , we made             our way      to the       j un c ti o n of the A 6 1 ,

P e n i s t o n e Rd and Foxhill                       Rd.



Just      prior         to    13.00 hours,                  we   heard m a t c h        control a s ki n g             for all

a v a i l ab le       personnel             to make          their w ay to L e p p i n g s Ln - no                      reason,        as

afa^ as           I can recollect was                        given.          We did as         requested.



W i t h i n 2 or 3 minutes,                       we a r r i v e d at L e p p i ng s           Ln.        T here was a large

crowd at the gates all wa it in g                                 to enter the g ro un d via the turnstiles.

  X   saw       o f f i c e r s    from       the      mounted         s e c tio n ,    (w hich      I    b e lie v e     were

I recollect         seeing a y o ut h         crying          because,       as he alleged,             he had been

t ro dd en on by a horse.                The y o ut h was         limping         but did not a ppear

serious     e nough to w arrant m e d ic a ti o n.



We   remained at L eppings               Ln until         we were        inst ru ct ed       to      resume     for meal

£>ut to    remain a va i l a b l e       if required.             I could not            put a figure on how

m an y P ol ic e    officers were           there at           this     time,     but judging           the a mount

of   personnel        carriers         on scene,         there were          s uf ficient.



S h o r t l y after    15.15 hours,           we a r r i v e d at C l a y w h e e 1s Ln for meal.

1 am sure        our vehicle was            one of,           if not      the first        v eh ic le there,          we

I remember being            the    first      in the m obi le            canteen,        a nd w hilst         in the

process     of being        provided w it h a meal,                   S e r g e an t C R E S S E Y    shou te d that

we were     required to           re- at te nd at L e p p i n g s Ln as there was some sort                                of

 crowd trouble.             We    i mm ed i a t e l y went       to L e p p i n g s Ln and            I saw that the

crowd      a p p e a r e d to have       s wo l l e n    in numbers.             1 do    not know         if these

were    late arr iv al s         or fans who            had    left     the g r ou nd a fter           the    incident.

 I do know that most were a g i t a t e d and the                            s i t u a t i o n was     p ot en t ia l ly

volatile.



Our serial,        a fter    the Ser ge an t            c on su lt ed w i t h an        I nspector        on the

gate,     went     straight       to      the gate w here a great                   number of people were

gat he ri ng w h ic h was at              the rear        of the West Stand.



Once    there,     me mb er s     of      the crowd were s h ou ti ng a buse at officers.

Most    of the fans a p p e ar ed           to be in a d i st r e s s e d state.
I    soon    realised that         the     o fficer s who were            there were       stan di ng       over

a p p r o x i m a t e l y six dead bodies.             Their     commander,        Insp ec to r G o rd on

SYKES?       inst ru ct ed us to stand w it h his m en and not to                          let a ny on e       have

a c ce s s   to the bodies-           The     remai ni ng       officers a s s i s t e d      by football

fans were       busy      recovering more            bodies and          injured    people from the West

Stand.       The      death toll at our             location q u ic k l y       rose to       11=



1 recall       telling a photog ra ph e r who                had made       his way a r ou n d the back

of the Police           line     in order      to    p h o t og r ap h the dead      i n s i t u y to move

a wa y for his         own s a f e t y .    It was      clear that his a c ti o n s was                u p se tt in g

the    r elatives a nd friends              of the aead a nd             injured.



Throughout         this time,       a great         number      of injured fans were                r ec o ve r ed

from the West Stand*                All     of these were             sat at the b ot to m of a wail                 at

the    rear of the West Stand-                  T he y a p p e a r e d    to be m a i n l y    rib and chest

injuries.          Most were       in shock.



I knew that a m b u l a n c e s were a r r i v in g             on the     scene,    but      before      they

r eached our          position,     they were         used by other           offi ce rs      furt he r a long

the    line who were           nearer      to L e p p i ng s Ln.         It s eemed that        the numbers

of    injured was         ever    increasing,          but no a m bu l a n c e s    were getting

through.        I saw one         constable         who a p p e a r e d young      in service,          elec ti ng

his driving           services     to one a m b u l a n c e      crew who were         tending         to a y o u th

who a p p e a r e d    on the brink         of death.           The    constable     kept      this     up for a

long     period during           the a fternoon,         a nd    I consider had he not have done,

then we w o ul d have been s t ru gg l in g                to keep the a m b u l a n c e s moving.



By now I had           learned of the m ag n i t u d e           of    the s i t u a t i o n and was a ware

that a l t h o u g h the       injured were          being a t t e n d e d to by off duty Doctors,
                                                                                                          PAGE         5


they were        not being moved.               I made a s u g g e s t i o n to P.olice S e rg ea nt

277 7 JOHNSON,         that we use        the P ol ic e P er s on n el       carriers       outside        the

g ro un d to convey the w alking w o u n d e d                to hospital.         S e r g e an t J O H N S O N

a g r e e d and the vehicles were                b ro ught    into    the a r e a w here     the     injured

were    sat.      These    v ehicles w it h P ol ic e O ff i ce r s         driving,       were     used as

ambulances.



N ow that the         injured were        being m o v ed at a          constant      rate,     the dead

bodies,       w hich still      n u m b er ed    11 were      cove re d w it h t ar pa u li n s     or

s im il ar and barriers were              placed a r o u n d them.          This a l l o w e d several            of

the o f fi ce rs      to a ssist     in a id i ng       the   injured,     and    in general         leaving

the w ay      clear for      other    rescue        vehicles.



After       a short time,       Inspector P eter W E BS TE R a p p r o a c h e d where               I was

s ta nd ing and       r equested me to a t t e n d at           the g ro unds      g y m n a s i u m to

collect a q uantity of adhesive                     labels and s udden d eath forms                  (Gen.

1 8 5s ).     This    I did and once            there    I saw a great        number      of dead bodies

in the       g y m n as iu m w h w i c h was a t e m p o r a r y mortuary.



I c o il ect ea what was a s ke d of me and                   retu rn ed to the       rear of the West

told him that          someone w o ul d no doubt              be in t ou ch w i t h him.



Once    back at the        rear of the West Stand,                   I assisted      c olleagues          in

removing       the dead      into a m b ul an c es       and P o li c e   vans,    to be t r a n s p o r t e d

We   r e mained       in the a r e a of the west S t a nd as there were                         still a great

n umber of          people m illing around.               These    incl ud ed off duty doctor and

nurses who           had    responded to a m e di a         request.



toa were       r eques ted to t ranspo rt an off duty nurse                       to the N o r t h e r n

General       Hospital        to a ssist     o v e r - s t r e t c h e d staff.



A fter      returning        from the hospital,            we were      d i re ct ed    to P en is t on e Rd,

near a local           supermarket,        to a report of a fight                 b e tw ee n    rival

football           fans.     We   r esponde d t o ge th er with other officers.                      There were

no fans and           conseq ue nt ly no fight            tawing    place.



W hi l st    in this a rea we were a p p r o a c h e d            by 2 L iv e rp o ol     s u pp o r t e r s who

had t r a v e l l e d to the m a t c h by coach from N o r t h Wales.                       T hese    two men

they      r eturned to their          coach.       T he y could account               for all     but 2 from

their       party.         They had been to the N o r t h e r n G en eral               Hosp it al    to    locate

them wi th ou t        gain.      The men were a s ki n g          d ir ec t io n s    to the Royal

Ha ll a ms im re Hospital           to see    if t hey      could     locate      the m is si ng men

there.        R ather       than ex pl ai n w here        the hospital        was,      because      from where

we were       it was a c om pl i c a t e d      route,      we t r a n s p o r t e d the men to the

              My duties were            those      of a m obile          patrol     in a personnel           carrier,         in

               company w ith Police S e r g ea nt                 681 HILL?       P olice     C o n s t ab l e 5S3 DAVIES?

              Our a re a of         catrol     was       the Dee p e a r / O u g n t l o r i d g e area,   paying

               publi c order.

              At a p p r o x i m a t e l y   11.00 a.m.         we took        up our    patrol     area.         At   this       time

               I n oticed      that there were               numerous       people w ai t in g      about outside             .

lice ns ed      premises,       many of them w ea ri ng L i ve rp oo l             colours.

T hr o u g h ou t    the day until        just     before 3.00        p.m.    freq ue nt     checks were

made    of licensed           premises.

C he c ks at        public    houses     showed     that some       nad few customers,               w he re as

others      in particular,          the S ilver Fox,           M a nc h e s t e r Road,    Stocksbridge,

a nd the Blue Ball,             Wharncliffe         Side,    were h e av i l y     p a tr on is ed     by

L i ve rpool        supporters.         B ot h these     public    houses       in particular           were

very full           from m id - d a y onwards,       and    it was      obvious     that a lot of

a lc ohol    was      being     consumed.         Most, people's        conduct     t hr ou g ho u t    this

period was           good h u m o u r e d and     there were       no public       order     incidents.

At   1.30     p.m.     1' had o c c a s i o n to speak to and            report one man,             for the

o ff ence     of     carrying alconcl           to a D e s i g n a t e s S p o r t in g Event.         The

vehicle       c ontained 46 empty Lager                cans.

The a r e a where we were               oatrolling was         some 2 0 - 3 0 m in ut es      drive         from

the football           ground under         normal     t ra ffic    conditions.           Under      normal

c on di t io n s     on the day of this game               I w ould     have a l l o w e d m ys el f        up to

an hour       to get to the         v i c i ni ty of the ground.             We a d v i s e d numerous

oeople      of the       time    factor     but    to well     a fter    half    past two there were

still     people       in the     public     houses     and still        quite     h eavy traffic m aking

its w a y towards            the ground.

3y a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2.50    p.m.    we had made our way towards                   the ground.              On

route,      I had heard a b roken m e ss ag e               over the       radio    b e li ev in g     there to

be   crowd      control       problems at the L e p p i ng s Lane             turnstiles.

P o li ce S er g ea nt 681 H ILL a s ke d           if our     ''Tango' m ob il e was         to be

d i r e c t e d to any       particular area,          and we were         told to stay on patrol

around      the ground.

S h o r t l y after 3.00         p.m.    we were      in the P e n i st o ne R o a d M o rt h area.                -A

fu rther      radio m essag e was           heard saying        there was        seri ou s    crowd

problems        inside       the g round at the L ep p in g s Lane end.                   At this       time a

further m e ssa ge was            passed from G r o u n d Cont ro l           i ns tr u ct i ng all

offi ce rs      to go to the          ground.

We went        the re via.       P e n is to ne Roa d N o r t h ana P e n i s t o n e Road.              W it h the

rest of the           o fficers      I e nt er ed the       grou nd via.         the access         b e tw e e n the

N o r t h S ta nd and the S pi on Koo.

I looked towards              the L a p p in gs Lane        end and saw a           large number of

P o li c e O f f i ce rs      standing      on the     playing      field.        The     game     had been

stopped.          In the distance            people were        seen to be          climbing        the fence.

I was     still       not     fully aware       of the      s it ua t io n and b el i ev e d that a pitch

invasion was           taking       place.     We w a l k e d a long       the    front     of the N or th

Stands        e xp ec ti ng    to begin to move            s up po r te r s either        back     into the

L e p p i ng s Lane T errace          or out     of the ground.

M y view of what a c t u a l l y h a p p en e d was             b lo ck ed by other             people    until         I

a r ri v e d at the Lep pi ng s Lane             end behind         the goal and           I then saw that a

large     do   rt i on of the        crowd - those at the front - were                          being    crushed

ag a in s t    the    large steel          fence,     some were      obviously           in great       pain w hi ch

could be seen on their                  faces.        The small       fence gate           was open,       a nd a

number        of officers        were      trying     to   remove     people      t hr o ug h     this gate.            I

went     oo assist.

My first         sight was of a y oung man of about                      15 years lying on the

ground,,       close       to the    gate.      I. could see o f fi ce rs           on     the t er r ac i ng who

were     pulling       people       free    from a large        crush      close along            the steel

•fence area.           There a p p e a r e d    to be      r elentless      pressure        from the       crowd

who were         still      pushing     f or w a r d towards      the    steel      fence.         I could see

people        pushed up ag ai ns t          the steel       fence.       Some were         s creaming and

shouting.            Some     I could now see were             o b v i ou s ly   b eg in n in g    to suffer

oain and         injury.        I could see         people     being     pulled from the g at e wa y but

it was        quite    obvious       it was too small a gate.

W i t h i n m om e n t s    I could see        that    things were w o r s e n i n g all            the time        I

could see         people were         dying.        1 could do n ot hing            to help them as

people were           being     pulled t hr o u g h the gate - some were                    dead?       some we re

Hy oe s t r e c o l l ec ti on of what           I saw was a large              very o v er we ig ht man

about 25 y e a r s        of age.         He was    lying on his side,             I felt       his    pulse but

i t was obvious           he was     dead.       I saw a small           child of a bout         12 y ea rs of

age.       He was     beside      the goal       post area.            He had a f r e c k le d face,         he

was    in dark       clothing a nd         I saw someone             placing a coat over          the top

half of his body.                He was     o bv i o u s l y dead.

AT, no time         did   1 see a nyone w i th visible                 injuries.

Although       people a r o u n d me were           s cr ea m in g and s h o u t in g     I remember

s eeing P ol ic e S e r g ea nt 681 H I LL            running w i t h a person,               holding his arm

w it h a no th er     officer and bri ng in g             him clear       of the     gate w h i ch was

crowded w i t h officers,             in an a t t e m p t      to free      people.

At this a n d mo me nt s          later     I was     stood on the          pitch w it h P S . 681 HILL

when    I t urned a r o u n d and          in the     distance         towards    the    players       entr an ce

I saw B r ia n Clough,           who was stood            looking       over t ow ards        our direction.

I could hear          people m aking         t h r e a t e ni n g    remarks    towa rd s him and        people

m o ving     towards      him.     T ogether       with P S . 681 HILL,          a n d some     others we

pushed our w ay t hrough              the     crowd a nd        pushed the       crowd a w a y from him.

I then s topped           in the     p l a y e r s 5 tunnel         entrance.     W hi ls t    in this

position       1 had numerous             people a sking about             casualties,         and being      very

a bu si ve   towards all          o fficers      present.           A good n umber of these were

o b v i o u s l y s t r o n g l y under    the   i nfluence          of alcohol.        One man       came

towards       us,    a nd P S . 681 H I LL spoke          to him.        He was    very d runk a n d

s t a g g e r e d a few yards a way from me and fell                      flat    on his face.           He was

m o v ed by other supporters.

At 4.30       p.m.    all   mobile        o ffic er s were o r de r e d back         to their         vehicles,

toge ther w ith P S . 681 HILL,              P C . 844 REES,          and P C .2378 WEBSTER,          we made

our way       back    to the      vehicle.

we    resumed       patrol.       P C . 300 H A Y E S was      s e p a r at e d f ro m us.

was very quiet          inside,       there    only being a small             group of Forest              fans

in there as well.           We    left       the    premises at about          14.30 hours and

drove    the    cars down to nearer                the ground       parking    them in one of the

side streets and then walk i n g                   to the actual       stadium.        At that time

there were       very few people about most                   1 a s s u m e d to a l r e a d y b e    in the

that there was          still    numerous          people    outside     the turnstiles.              I

turnstiles.           At this stage          the time was a p p r o x i m a t e l y a couple              of     v         j

minu t e s    before    three    oclock.           The queue m o v e d quite        quickly and &e

were    thro u g h the turnstiles w i t h i n five minutes.                      I entered by^th^'

t u r n s t x les marked A to G.             The man on the          turnstile      quickly had my

ticket       from me saying       come on,          lets    get you all       thro u g h quick.,”              1 did

note    that outside       the ground there                had been a few police            officers            on

foot    checking tickets          before       people       joined the queues and a couple                       of

oolice       on horseback.        I d o n ’t recall          seeing any stewards.              Once        inside

the    ground I d o n ’t recall             seeing a n y police officers              or stewards.

There were       no signs at all             telling       people    of how to get

onto the       terrace?    and t h e refore          everyone       just headed to tunnel.                     The

reason being           that thro u g h the          tunnel    I could see the          pitch and the

players       playing.     I had a free             passage     through the tunnel, it wasn't

packed at all,          and reached the top of                pens three a n d four at about 3

minutes       past     three.         It was    obvious      to me that       the pens were          packed.

                          were    still wit h me at             this    point.       We all then tried

to    push into Pen 4 and             1    made my w a y down about           seven or eight steps

into    the    pen.     I lost sight          of my two mates.            At this time          the garfie wa

still    going      on.     I oegan to realise             that the      pressure    of the     crowd was ’

too muc h and         I was     getting     crushed.        1 realised that         p e o p l e ’were

being    got from the           crowd over        the front      fence and      I t h erefore w a i t e d

thinking      the     pressure w o u l d ease.            The   pressure    didn't ease for some

considerable          time even after          the game had         been s t o p p e d and the      players

had   left the        pitch.       There was       total    confusion wit h all         the    people

a r o u n d me.     Nobody knew what was                going on.      Althought     I could see

people     lying on the          Ditch I d i d n ’t realise            that anyone     had died.         I

was aware         that    people had been          injured,      and    I knew that     some were

serious.          It w a s n ’t until about            1600 hours      that the    pressure     in the

stand finally            returned to what          I w ould     class as normal.          I still

remained      in the stand myself              still      believing      that   the game w ould

continue.          At a p p r o x i m a t e l y half    past four      to twenty to five an

a n n o u n c e m e n t was made over       the    loud speakers         that   the game was

abandoned,         and 1 then       left the terrace via the tunnel.                    Everyone        left

in an orderly f a s h i o n . T h r o u g h o u t       the whole      of the day    I never saw any

b ehaviour        I would     class as d i s o r d e r l y or any drunkeness.

Throughout         the    incident     there was a total            lack of dir e c t i o n being

given an d the           loud speakers,        w h i c h meant    that w ith      people not      really

being aware         of what was        going      on,    nobody could assist a n y w a y either              by

clearing      the     pens from the         rear of from the front.                I was a m a z e d that

no officers          came to rear of          pens 3 and 4 and started              clearing      the    peris

from the b a c k , the         crowd     being     crushed ar o u n d me for some          conside rabl e.

 NO.

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 IT WAS TOTAL CHAOS. FANS ON EITHER SIDE INITIALLY STARTED TO GET FANS G

 3     &   4. OTHERWISE MORE WOULD HAVE DIED.

 BY THE TIME THE GAME STOPPED, THE DAMAGE WAS DONE.

 SUPPORTERS WERE RELYING ON EACH OTHER RATHER THAN POLICE/STEWARDS.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE HAD MORE TICKETS AND HAD SPION KOP END.

 2) BETTER ORGANISATION OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 3) TREATMENT OF FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS BY POLICE IS SAD. HERDED ABOUT TO           A

s oee d for ab out          twenty minu t e s       1 do not know the               reason     for the

delay.      The     coach a r r i v e d     in S h e f f i e l d at about         1 . 4 5 pm (1345).    The

dr ive r   parked       in a line      of other Liverpool              'supporters coaches             in a

side     road about         ten; minu t e s walk from Hi Tlsborough.                   I did not see any

police     of fic ers       in the    road where we         parked but            I saw one or two

po li ce me n on the m a i n         road leading to the ground.                      I saw that       the    pubs

or, our    route to the gr ound were                closed and         I airin't see any s upporters

drinking alcohol.

As we wa l k e d to the ground               1 saw fans singing a n d the a t m o s p h e r e was

exciting      but      I did not see any fighting or drunkeness.

T o g et he r wi t h    j       a nd his son       I a r r i v e d at the L e p pi ng S Ln        end of        the

groun d at about 2pm             (1400).      There were       no actual           queues to the

turnstiles,         it was     crowded w i t h      people m i l l i n g about          in the area.            I

m a n a g e d to walk t h r o u g h betw e e n s u pporters            to the turnstile without

too m uc h trouble.            Wa lk in g    to the ground         I recall         seeing a couple           of

po li ce me n on the street            corner,      but    I cannot        recall      seeing j^ny

pol ic em en or ste wa rds           outside     the L e o p i n g s Ln turnstiles.

1 d i d n ’t have       any d i f f i c u l t y finding      the L e p p i n g s Ln t urnstile s         as     I

knew wh ere       to    go from my        previous visit.             On that occasion,            the 1988

FA Cu p semi-f ina l          be tween L i verpool         and    N o t t i n g h a m Forest.      I arrived

at the gr ou nd be tween             IS,30 - 12.45         an d a l t h o u g h   it was earlier         and

quieter     I was aware of a g reater                police       presence.

I did not have an y tro uble a c t u a l l y               entering        the ground a n d I entere d

I did not see a n y other gates other                      than the t u r n s t i l e s o pert;* I handed

my m a t c h ticket         in at the t u rnstile          and retained the             stub

section.        Inside the gr ou nd            I d i d n ’t look for or notice a n y signs
                                                                                                       PAGE          3


direct ing me where               to go,    and    I just went straight toward®; the central

tunnel         under    the West Stand.

U po n ent er ing        the      central    tunnel     I did not see a n y       pol i c e m e n or

st ew ar ds      in that       particular area.           Inside the tunnel,            it wa s quite              : s:

full wi t h        people but        I was able        to move quite freely.            The tunnel".                •

itself was dark and the only                      light was from the         pitch      end 0 0    .the

tunne 1.                                                                              ..•\ y

Once     inside the ground               I didn't      see any trouble       involving         supporters

and I d i d n ’t see any with alcohol.

1 went         t h r o u g h the tunnel     and onto tne terrace            behind      the goal wit h

               and his son.          Upon emerging        from the    tunnel     we     went     to the

right     of the        central      fence w h i c h     was from the perimeter           fence up        to

the m o u t h of the tunnel               into Fen 3.

We made         our way forward down the terracing,                  and     I   went right to the

perimet er         fence at        the   front of the      pen.     At this time it was             crowded

in that         particular         pen but not      uncomfortable.          At the front,          I found _

there were a l r e a d y alot             of fans a l r e a d y   in position      so     1    m o v e d back           v

dividing         f e n c e , at    the   front I was about         three or four steps from the

perimeter          fence at        the   front of the      pen.      lind his           son were       stood

to my      r i g h t , sep a r a t e d from the dividing           fence by two or three other

supporters.

1 took up this            position at a bout 2 . 10pm,             <1410)    and I was able to move

quite     freely at that             t i m e , it was no more       crowded than at            previous

ma t c h e s    I have attended.

F rom about 2 . 4 0         (1440)       o n w a r d s , I no ticed that more a n d more

supp or te rs were          coming       down the terrace from behind.         Some were

to become           f r i g h t e n e d an d aware    that something was wrong.

It became more and more                    crowded until*        the    crushing     sett l e d for two

three minute s-              When   the     players     come out onto the           pitch there was a

big surge forw a r d from the back.

I didn't a c t u a l l y See the game kick off,                    because at about 2 . 5 5 p m

£•1453)    I       was oeing      crushed and another            supporter       had his arm under my

chin holding my head up I was taking short                              b r e a t h s » I could hardly

breathe and my feet were                    off the terrace.            1 had almost        resigned

mys elf   to the          fact    I was     being     s u f f o c a t e d but the man beside me kept

tellin g me          to breathe          I was   just being held in the             crowd,

just    prior        to the kick off about 2 „ 4 5 - 2 . 5 0 pro (1445)              -(1450)..     I'm not

r eal ly sure,          infact the         team might      not have         been on the     pitch,     f can

remember a poli ceman wa lking along                       the track        on the other side of th«t,:

perimet er         fence.        People were         shouting and swearing at hirt, to

the    perimeter          gate    I recall       he told    people to         push back ans|-; hS

on al ong          the track.       I didn't       see any other        p o l iceman or a n y st ewards

on the track.              As I was        being     crushed    I remember       thinking     ’well,    this'

is it' and           I thought       1   was about      to die.        At    one stage     I could see

the    pe rim ete r gate open and                people were being            pulled out.        I thims

the    game was still             being     played.      The next thing          I can remember        is

being dr ag g e d over            the dividing         fence be tween Pen 3 into the enclosure

Pen 2,     to the         right„         I do not know who drag g e d me over              the

fence.

I sat     on the terrace an d saw other                    people were being          pulled over the

fence.         I still       c o u l d n ’t Dreathe     properly an d         I just wa n t e d to get

to op en space.              I went down a couple              of steps       to an open gate        onto

the track.             I d i d n ’t have     the     strength to get out myself and                I had to

be dr ag g e d out         through the gate.             I had    lost sight        of |         ana his

son but        I   had seen them brie f l y            in the enclosure Pen 2.

this     time the         slayers had left              the    pitch a l t h o u g h      1' w a s n ’t aware of.

properly and             I saw a man sat             crying near            to nse.

After 2-3 minu t e s                     and his        son    came to me and             put a coat a r o u n d my

■shoulders.             Almost    i mmediately          I no ticed a St.              J o h n ’s a m b u l a n c e woman.

She    told me to take deep breaths,                          but      1 was   sobbing and still

c o u l d n ’t.       I seemed to        regain my senses a little and a l t h o u g h                       very

fr i g h t e n e d    I began to       look about me.

I    saw about          six feet away,          a white        lad,      either       in his     late teens or

early twenties with                 collar      length sandy coloured hair.                         He was wearing

training shoes,             blue     denim jeans and a tee-shirt                         possibly white         lying

fiat     on his         back.     I saw one uni f o r m e d man,               I'm not       sure    if it was a

policeman or a St.                J o h n ’s a m b u l a n c e m a n    leaning over         the y outh and

pounding          his    chest.      The youths          tee shirt had been                 pulled up towards

his neck.             The y o u t h ’s face was blue and his eyes were                            closed.       I ’m

not    sure       how long the atte m p t was made                     to    revive him but          I then saw

other supporters.                 So meone      then covered the y o u t h ’s face with a jacket

or    coat,       and he was        then     carried away,              I think on a a d v e r t i s i n g

Hoarding          or stretcher.            I w ould not be able                to     recognise      the youth,

""hereafter           I saw at      least a n o t h e r       four      people      lying on the         pitch wit h

others a t t e m o t ing to          revive them.              It qu ickly became more and more

populated wit h            people      lying      on the       pitch,        some sitting,          some walking

in a daze and others                 running about helping,.                     It seemed to be complete

choas and            it seemed      to go on for ages,                  I c a n ’t put a time on how long

I sat on the             pitch but       I was       led off toaether wit h                         and his     son,

by someone            in un iform off          the    pitch,        th rough     astand and out           of    the

immediate            ground a rea to where ambu l a n c e s were                      parked.       I was given a

hot drink a n d           1 began to calm down a little.

I was      still        faint and      I was e v e n t u a l l y taken           to the       coach w hich

brought me            back to Liverpo ol.

to the ground together.                  >Je had to walk about              half a mile to the

3 0 Dm    (13305.        The ground was       oretty empty when we got                  inside>the

Ian and Phil         inside    the gr o u n d and we sat talking to them.                          By 2.. 00 pm

<1400)      the    pen was    getting more and more                 packed.      By 2 . 3 0 p m    (1430)

the      crowd    in this    pen got unbearable.               1 was sweating and by 2 . 4 3 p m

you      could not move.           There was a      couple of         surges a r o u n d this        time and.

I had my arms            down by my side,          1 managed         to get my arms          out and then

the teams         came out onto the         pitch.      When the teams             came out -there was

a big surge and 1 gr abbed hold of                                  T-shirt and         pulled him

back.       I had a hold of P h i l ’s hand and at about 2 . 5 5 p m                       (1455)    all you

could hear         from the    crowd was         "let us out" and            ’please       let us out,

 dease                   help us*.       About a minute         of the game          starting       there was

one hell         of a big    push from behind.               I was holding Phi 11's hand and

with the         force of the       crowd pushing Phils              hand s l i p p e d f r o m    my graps

and      he fell away.        I did not see Phil after                  that.      W h e n :I lost my grip

of Ph il 's       hand    I was about a one third away                  into the s t a n d and near

to where         the barrier       collapsed.       I did not see the barrier                     coll apsed

but      I he ard the      noise    of   it c o 1 lapsing w hen the barrier                 collapsed

loads      of    people fell       forward.      There was          people on the pitch shouting

to push back.            I pushed back and fell              over    something.         I looked back

and      there was this ma n         lying on the terrace,                 his face was blue,           he

was dead an d        I c o u l d n ’t help h i m . W h e n    I fell       over the body someone

stood on my         chest an d my h a n d s r I don't know                 if I blac k e d out for a

couple of seconds            but the next thing              I remember was          two    lads    picking,

me up and asking me            if I was alright.               I w i p e d my face a n d s t a r t e d to

shout      ’open the g a t e s . 4       I was   shouting with this m a n to open tfie back

gates      leading       into the tunnel.         I d o n ’t know       if they were         closed or not

but      people were       pushing as they came out of the tunnel                          into the pen.

    out    there'1 When        I got out of the stand 1                just   broke down arid cried.

    Eventually        I got myself       pulled together              and I ran back      into the tunnel

    an d   into    the stand to look for                         Ian a n d Phil.        There wa:s so mu ch

    to get back onto the              terr acing       1 could not       see anyone      of m y mates.          I

    st ar te d to help         people   carry the        injured an d dead bodies            out of the

    tunnel an d       put them out of          the way.         The    next   thing was     some    police, - >

    came and did the necessary.                  The     people who       1 helped to carry w &re at

    the back      of the terracing.             About 3 . 2 0 p m      (1520)   after    I had came b^ek

    into the      ter racing      1   saw a young        lad being       pulled onto      the    pit ch.. 7 I

    then saw a police man throwing                     him back       into the terracing.          I then

    went    for a drink and this              bloke was        charging 40 pence         I said to him he

    s ho ul d be giving         it to us free what we had just been through.                            He

    re plied that we were hooligans.                     Two other men h eard what he said and

    t n r e a t e n e d him.   He a p o l o g i s e d and the fans w a l k e d away.            I stood

    drink ing my drink and watch i n g                 the    police    carry bodies      out.      I   saw one

The m a n we were tre at in g was a blu ish colour an d                        I knew he was dead.

The doctor        said,       "We will move onto             the next    o n e ."      Wi t h the help of

the man who was s t a nd in g ne a r b y              I pulled

to continue this statement another day.

The second person who I went to assist was situated on the right side

of the 18 yard area (as per patient two on map)

This person was a white male, aged 23-30 years old and he was placed

in the recovery position.          By his side were two adults who were

comforting him.       I ascertained that the patient was            still breathing

and the two adults were looking after him.

In view of this,      I then went to a white m a l e , aged approx          35 y e a r s . I

cannot give any other description.             He was situated      at a   point next to/

0 r on the penalty spot       (as per patient 3 on m a p ) .     This man was lying

on his b a c k , and a white man      was crouched over him. At this point,           I

saw that the patient was not          breathing and there was no signs of a

p ul se .   I continued to perform heart massage for about three to five

minutes and it was e v i d e nt , the patient did not response to my

actions. I cannot recal1 if it was a nurse or a female d o c t o r , but

whilst I performed heart m a s s a g e , she performed mouth to mouth

resuscitation.       There was no resp on se , and the patient was obviously

dead.On the instructions of the nurse/doctor              I then continued to a

fourth patient who was situated in between patients two anmd t h r e e , in

the 18 yard area (as per map)           close to the edge of the 6 yard area.

1 moved to the 4th p ati en t, who I cannot describe other than it was a

white m a l e .

I saw that the patient was lying on his b a c k , and was surrounded by

two or three p eo pl e.      One of whom I beleive to be a doctor,            bent his

head b a c k , although to clear      the patients ai rways, and he asked me              if

I could obtain an ai rway and         some d r u g s . I gave the    person/doctor an

ai rway from the 'Motivus' resuscitator and he carried on from t h e r e .

At this point, on the request of the doctor,              I tried to seek some

d r u g s , but my finding were n eg a t i v e .   I returned to the doctor and

informed him that I could get no d r u g s .         At the same t i m e , I could see
                                                                                         PAGE      6


         that the patient appeared to be dead.               His face was blue and there

         were no apparent signs of life.

         Although I then went to assist other injured persons,                  I cannot recall

         to my knowledge that I performed mouth to mouth or heart massage on

         any other person.

         I cannot recal1 what time it was but after t h i s , I was instructed by

         an unknown senior fire officer,            to go to the gymnasium and assist with

         the injured persons in t h e r e .        I generally assisted by putting injured

         people onto stretchers,           for conveyance to ho sp i t a l .   I also gave

         oxygen as and when they requi red i t .

         Eventually I collected our equipment that had been used, and at

         approximately 5.15pm I left the ground with the rest of my colleagues

         and returned to                               F i re Station.

         Although I may have been invo1ved in other d u t i e s , I cannot recal1

         precise d e t a i I s .

    Ms Rex


    FOOTBALL .SPECTATORS BILL


    Further to my submission last night, we spoke again this
    morning.     I attach a copy of the further amendment Mr Moynihan
    would be grateful if Mr Lloyd would take, adding a defence of
    lawful authority to Clause 2 (the offence of unlawful entry to
    a ground).


    Provided Mr Lloyd is content, this amendment and those annexed
    to my submission yesterday would go down tomorrow in
    Mr Lloyd's name; others in Mr Moynihan's.

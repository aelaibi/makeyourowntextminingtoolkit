            S po r t Aid w hi c h was       held      in 1988 at H i l l s b o r o u g h Park.                This     event was

            planned with an a t t e n d a n c e           of 5 0 , 0 0 0    people       expected        but only

            a r o u n d 8,000 a t t e n d e d    in the end.             The     point     being       though that          even

            w i t h only 8,000 a t tending ,              the s t e w a r d i n g a r r a n g e m e n t s were

            inadequate.           In respect         of the      stewarding,            1 had    r e cognised         the

            i na d e q u a c y of the    plans       prior    to the event and brought                       this     to the

             a c t i o n was            taken.         The Co uncil         also    refused to use the              e x perience            of

                 the S a f e t y        in Sports        Grou n d s    A d v i s o r y Group,        despite     the experience

             mention            this      is because           it shows       that Counil l o r s ,          generally,           could not

                 be b o t h e r ed to take              the a dvice         of the S a f t e y Officers.               I also          believe

                 that     cost      is a factor           eff e c t i n g    the C o u n c i l ' s    d e c i s i o n not    to

                 use    the S a f e t y Group.                I also made          recommendations            that there should

                 be a m i n i m u m age          for     entry w h i c h was         based on e x perience              from other

                 concerts.              This ad v i c e was also d i s r e garded.                    A copy of my           report         re

                 this     event         should    be on file at              the C i t y Council.

                 Grounds.           The     spacing       of some ofithese barriers is also incorrect.

                 T h ey are        too far apart;              the    gaps    b e t w e e n the two horizontal                runs are

                 too wide          in m any      cases.         The angles          from the         nosings     of the       terrace            to

                 the    corridor          fo r m e d    by the       vnartical      parts    of the        barriers         is also

                 incorrect.              These    two     factors w o b i d a l l o w surges to d e v e l o p more

                 o p i n i o n this       is a s i g n if ic an t       factor       in the       disaster.

                 I also       believe        that       because       the    barriers       are      lower    than they should                   be

                 they are more              r e s ilient       to tests       than     if they were at the                  correct

                 height.           This     is based on simple                physics.

             Another           factor w h i ch           is distu r b i n g        is that     because        there was           no

                    I consider       the overall       p e r f o rmances      of S h e f f i l d Cit y Council   to be

                    less    than a d e q u at e   in relation to the s a f e t y of sports             grounds and       if

                    the    codes    of   practice     had   been f o l l o w e d   I. am   convinced there w ould

                    have    been    less   fatalities.         The    reports      r e f erred to by me are to form

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 8.00 am          (0800)      on the      17th April          (170489),         I came

S H E F F I E L D W E D N E S D A Y -- INITIAL C O N S I D E R A T I O N S

Following          the a c c i d en t at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y     on S a t u r d a y the    13th

April     1989       (150489),          I have    now     i n s pected the West Terr a c e at

S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Footb a l l       C lub and     carried out a d e t ailed

e x a m i n a t i o n of the       crush       barriers,       other      fencing      and terracing        of Pens

3 and 4.           On   reading         the    guide w h i c h gives        i n f o r m a t i o n about   barriers

to be used at football                    grounds        I am forced to the             c o nclusion that,

w h i 1st the b a r riers           at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y were     strong      e n o u g h , the

s pacings were           not      in full       compliance wit h the             guide a nd in particular

the gaps        betw e e n barriers             were     too great and the wj.d th of the                  gates      to

the    perimeter         fence      too       small.

T ests    carried out             on barriers          indicate      that    they y ield w h e n sub j e c t e d

forces       a p p r o x i m a t e l y 257. ,in excess        of    those    required        in the guide and

e xarri i nat i o n of t he        " f a i l e d 11 barriers       indicates      that      they too would

have     c o m plied wit h         the s t r e n g t h    requirements.

Arrangements            have      been made with the R e s e a r c h and D e v e l o p m e n t

Laboratories            of the H ea l t h and Saf e t y E x ecutive,                   to   carry out further

tests     upon these           barriers         but    I feel      that   the    initial      conclusion,           that
                                                                                                                       PAGE    10

              the    barri e r s      t h e m s e lv e s were   strong      enough,    will      be borne out.

               INITIAL. C O N C L U S I O N - had the barrier w h i c h               c o llapsed       remained     in tact

              I feel       that whilst         there w ould         still    have   been    casualties and,            indeed

              quite       probably       fatalities,        the     number and extent w ould                have   been far

              less.        I also      feel    the e v ac u a t i o n of     casul a t i e s w o u l d have been easier.

               IN I T I A L R E C O M M E N D A T I O N -- a full    survey sh o u l d     be    carried out on all

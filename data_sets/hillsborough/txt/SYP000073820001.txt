’F 1 ’ C.I.D,   with the latter officer having a wallet alarm in his back

pocket of his trousers.

Initially,      I was on foot         in plain clothes   in the vicinity of the

turnstiles and driveway leading to the terracing and main car parking

area at the      rear of the South Stand respectively.             At this time the

area was very quiet with a number of supporters gathering about the

outermost entrance         gates and the wall      of the bridge adjacent and

parallel   to the river.          Restricting access to the car park, was a

series of free-standing barriers manned by uniformed Police.

In the locality there was              plenty of uniformed Police presence both at

  e turnstiles and in Leppings Ln itself,                where the reception of

 upporters arriving by coaches and on buses was being supervised by

Inspector Sykes of         *F S ’ «

Even at this early stage,             a number of Liverpool    supporters approached

the ground drinking beer and soft drinks from cans which in the main

were discarded on the floor or as they approached the turnstiles to

gain entry to the ground,              in containers which I noticed had been

positioned by Police Officers directly outside the turnstile area.

Certainly,      anything    containing alcohol was either disposed of,             drunk

or otherwise,      by fans before they entered t^e ground,             no doubt
                                                         /
anticipating that they would be searched. /

Probably around      1.30 p .m . the numbers of /supporters          ir> the Leppings

Lane area had increased significantly.              /Many people were stood about

the footpaths throughout the length of Leppings Lane and a large

number of them were continuing asking              if/they had any     Football

tickets for sale to enable t/hem to see /the match.                Clearl'y,   there

were literally several           hun4reds of peo/ple who had arriyed in

Sheffield without         tickets/ for the game and there was a ready market

for those who I saw selling spare tickets which were quickly snapped
                                                                        PAGE      3

up.    A steady stream of fans were walking towards the ground both from

the Middlewood Road and Wadsley Bridge directions and the area at the

Leppings Lane end was becoming fairly congested.          Looking towards the

turnstiles,     I could only see the top of one Police helmet and the top

of a flat Police cap,     but faces were obscured by the height of the

cr o wd .   On a high wall adjacent to and partitioning various

turnstiles, youths had/climbed to the top ftnd were making their way

perilously towards w^sl 1 above the actual turnstiles where uniformed

Inspector Bennett     */f 1 *, was assisting them and no doubt alleviating a

dangerous situation that they were putting themselves in.          By about Z .

40 p.m. the crowd situation was hectic to say the least.          There were

hundreds,     thousands of supporters walking along Leppings Lane towards

the entrance where there seemed nowhere for them to go/.         Arouncr eight

mounted Police Officers were attempting to fprm a fearrier wi/h their

horses through the solid hords of people cramming toward? the

turnstiles and Police Constable Buxton from Hammer ton/13 oa d , who drove

up outside the Leppings Lane entrances         in a Police/Land Rover, was

appealing through the vehi cle ’s loud hailer system for the crowd to

stop surging forwards as people were being crushed at the turnstiles,

In spite of innumerable requests,     the crowd continued to move

urelentingly in the direction of the entrances.          Such was the volume

of people that any pick-pocket observations were now useless and at

Detective Sergeant S m i t h ’s instruction,   together with Dectective

Constable Lindsay and others engaged on the same duties,         I made my way

to the junction of Vere Road and Leppings lane.          Ue continued to walk

down Vere Road towards Pennistone Road and several         residents were

clearly annoyed and remonstrating with youths who had obviously been

urinating in a passageway.      In fact, without exception,     every

passageway on the ground side of Vere Road had been used a number of

times by unknown persons relieving themselves.

         Staining of urine was all over the walls and floors of the

         passageways.      With Detective Se rgeant Smi th and Detective Lindsay,        I

         continued to the ground a t a time when several dog handlers with dogs

         began to assemble at the top of the access           path to the pitch between

         the Spion Hop and the North S t a n d .    They,    shortly after,   moved towards

         the    pitch.

         About 3.00 p.m.     or thereabouts,    within five minutes of entering the

         gymnasium sited inside the ground,        I was    instructed with other Police

         Officers     present to clear an a r o       make way for the reception of a

         number of fatalities from the L           ngs Lane end.     An area was   cleared

         and almost      immediately bodies started to arrive and throughout that

         evening     into the early hours of Sunday,       16th April,   1989, /with other

         Police Officers,      1 was   engaged in helping to process t \/e    property and

         the victims of the tragedy

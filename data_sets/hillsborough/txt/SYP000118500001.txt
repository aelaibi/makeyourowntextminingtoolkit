              Saturday           1 3th    (130489)      April         1989.




               At    0900     th is      day   i reported          on d u t y at         Hammerton Road Police                       Station,

               from       the re t o g e t h e r    with     the      rest    of    the       serial        I was     transported            to

               Sheffield          Wednesday         football          ground.           On arrival            at    the     ground     I took

               my    seat     in the N o r t h        Stand      ready       for    the       briefing.



              At a p p r o x i m a t e l y     1000    the      briefing        commenced after                    whi ch    I remained

               in the N o r t h S t a n d          unt i 1 we      had    the      meal       whi ch w a s         provided.




               I was        directly       responsible           to    the    Serial          Sgt    who was         PS 57 7 Gardner,

               the       Inspector        in   charge      of    this S e r i a l        was     Insp Darling.                 The    duties

               that       I was    deployed         to w e r e     the    South Stand               or     the     ground      side    of    the

               turnstiles          28A     to 32.



              At     approximately             1100    together          with'my         se/ial          we m a d e a g e n e r a l

               pa t r o l   of    th e   South Stand            s e a t s , the     bar a r e a s         and      checking      the

              emergency           exit     gate®,      to w h i c h w e w e r e          to    be d e p l o y e d     if a n d w h e n

                                                                                                                                     R211

        At a p p r o x i m a t l e y    1 2 0 0 m i d d a y we        took       up    our      positions,           and      I was

        behind       gates      28A     to 3 2       on the S o u t h S t a n d ,            checking          the     supporters

        coming       through         the     turnstiles,             where       I remained             up u n t i l      3.00pm       (1500).




        The    supporter®            coming        through          these     gates        appeared           very     happy and             in

        high     spirits        looking           forward       to    seeing          their       team     play.          There      were

        no    problems         encountered with                 the       fans,       there       was    no    fighting/pushing

        to    get    in.       There        was     infact      a steady          flow       of    people       through          theses

        gate     up u n t il       3.00pm         (1300).



        The    stewards         in t h i s        area    appeared          to    be     their      job,       at    t h is    time      I

        was    aware        during      the       run up       to    the    game       t h at     the re w a s       difficulties

        with     the    r a di o     transmissions.




        At    3.00pm        (1300)      together          w i t h PC       3341       M i t c h e l 1 I went         to    the

        bookmakers            stall     w h c i h w as      in the         bar a r e a       of    the S o u t h S t a n d .           As

        s o o n as     the     game     kicked         off we        escorted          the      bookmaker           with      his




•
        takings        down     to     the    directors             entrance.




        I then       returned          to    th e S o u t h S t a n d       and       on a r r i v a l     there       I could         see

        the    game     had     been        stopped and             the re w e r e       a 1 ready       people        on the        pitch

        and    others         climbing        over       the    fencing          at    the L e p p i n g s      L a n e End.




        At    first     it w a s n ’t        cl ear      what       was    h a p p e n i n g , I saw m a n y           other        p o 1 i ce

        off i ce rs     coming         on    to    the    pitch       from       the     North Stand/Cop                  corner       of

        the    gr o u n d .




        After       a short        while      I saw       t h at     there       were      people        being       brought         out

        onto    the     pitch and were                being         given     heart       massage         and       mouth      to

        mouth.         By     this     time       mo re p o l i c e       were arriving             on t he         pitch      t o g e t h er
                                                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                                                            R211

             with     the       fire    brigade             and ambulance,




             We     were     then      directed             to go       down    to    the     pitch.           On a rrival          there        I

             could        see    bodies       being          carried       over       th e    co p e n d of t h e         ground           on

             advertising             boards.




             There        were     Liverpool            fans       on the       pitch who           were       either     exhausted,                 in

             shock        or w a n t i n g        to    fight       and    several           groups       of    them were           trying           to

             charge        towards          the    cop.




             1 formed           part    of    the       cordon across                the     g r o u n d at     the    halfway         line          and

             remained           there       and    on o c c a s i o n s        getting        the    f ans      back    up     to     the

             Leppings           Lane    end who             had    broke       through        the    cordon and           ran d o w n

             towards         the    cop.          I stayed          on the         p t i c h at     the    halfway        line        up    until

             th e    ground was             emptied.




             At     the    beginning          of       the       incident       it w a s      unclear          exactly what            was

             happening,            t h at    was       partly       due    to      being      so    far    away and          not      having          a

             rad io ,      as    o n l y S g t *s h a v e          r a d i o ’s.      11 a p p e a r e d       on the     pitch        to       be    in

             a    state     of     confusion,               as    there    could       be     no w a y     of    people       being

             organised.             Having         said          that   there        were     many    people          doing     their           best

             and    helping         each      other.              It was     a sickening             sight       to    see a n d       I felt

             very     saddened and angry about                            the      whole      affair.           I feel       t h at    if

             everyone           could       come       to    the m a t c h      in a n       orderly       fashion       nothing            of

             this    nature         would         ever       happen

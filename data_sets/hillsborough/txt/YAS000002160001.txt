Q1RALD LESLIE WILKINSON states :

1   I was born on 8th January 1945.


2   I am employed as the Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer for
     the Hampshire Ambulance Service.


3   I commenced my career in the Ambulance Service as a
    trainee   snibu1anceraau with the    Westmorland    *’ire ana
    Ambulance Service in April 1973.          I took the 6 weeks
    basic ambulance aid training course at West Lea Training
    School run by Lancashire Ambulance Service in September
    1983,   following which I studied for the Institute of
    Certified Ambulance Personnel.



1   In 197? I attended a two week supervisor course at the
    Ambulance Training Centre in Keighley and was promoted to
    Leading Ambulanceman in November 1976.


>   During the time which I spent as a Leading Ambulanceman I
    became involved in the training of personnel, both in the
    service and in outside organisations.        This led to me

    qualifying as a DHSS Ambulance Aid Instructor in 1979,
    After obtaining this qualification I was used regularly
    to   instruct   both   in   service and   at West   Yorkshire
    Ambulance Training School, Keighley.


    In May 1980 I was promoted to Station Officer at Penrith
    Ambulance Station.

                   I took up a position as Assistant Divisional officer (HQ)
                   at South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service on 1st

                  August 1983 and in late 1986 I was promoted to Divisional
                  Officer    (Control and Communications).                       1 took up my
                  present position with the Hampshire Ambulance Service in
                  June 1988,


            8     In     about   early     1986   Mr,      Page    told me           that he was
                  delegating to me the job of preparing incident plans for
                  the 5 Football Grounds within the SYMAS region.                            Those
                  are the grounds of Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United,
                  Rotherham, Doncaster Rovers and Barnsley.                          It was about
                  this time that the Popplewell Report was published and we
                  were    concerned       about   the      safety at       Sports Grounds,
                  particularly in relation to the possibility of fires.


                 I am the officer referred to in Mr. Page’s letter of 16th
                 January 1986, which he sent to the 5 Football Clubs and I
                 saw that letter shortly before it went out.


           10    The Chairman of Sheffield Wednesday replied to the letter
                 of 16th January by letter of 29th January addressed to
                 Mr. Page and Mr.          Page passed that letter to me.                       I
                 telephoned the Football Club to arrange a meeting and
                 spoke     to    Mr.      Chester's        secretary            to    make   the
                 arrangements.             i also wanted the Police to be there
                 and I believe they liaised with the Fire Service.

            11    The meeting at          the ground did not take place until 16th
                   July    1986*           I think         the   delays   were       caused    by
                   difficulties of all parties being available and 1 think,
                   although I am not sure, that the Club preferred to deal
                  with the matter in the closed season.


            12    The meeting of 16th July was attended by myself. Station
                  Officers, Higgins and                          , a Police Inspector and

                  Police Sergeant, and two people from the Fire Brigade*
                  When we arrived, we were introduced to Mr, Chester (the
                  Club Secretary)          who then left us with                            ] (the
                  Groundsman) who showed us round.


            13    It was during the tour of the ground that we discussed
                  with    the   Police      and Fire Service where the casualty
                  clearing post/mortuary would be in the event of a major
                  incident, this was agreed to be the gymnasium.


           14     Following        the     tour       we    were    taken       to    see     the

                  physiotherapist,                    H . in his room.         At that point I
                  believe that the Police and Fire Service representatives
                  left.         Mr* Higgins,      i   ___________     and I spoke to

                          about Ambulance Service cover.                  I told

                  that we could provide Ambulance Service resources for the
                 ground, but that this would involve a charge*                         He told
                 me that the Club would not wish to pay such a charge and
                 that they were happy with their current arrangements with
                 the St.     Johns Ambulance Brigade which attended their
                 matches and which gave first aid training to the Club's

                                              -         sn

                   personnel at the beginning of each season.            He said that
                   whenever the Club had needed the ambulance service they
                   had relied upon making a 999 call.



            15    I told                  that, if we could not actually provide
                  an ambulance at the ground we would like to have two
                  officers       inside the ground in the interest of crowd
                  safety.         I said that if an ambulance was required they
                  would     be   able     to contact Control     to arrange   for an
                  ambulance more quickly than the Club could do so.            I was

                  talking about crowd safety, but                        did mention

                  that if a player was hurt he would certainly like an
                  ambulance to arrive as quickly as possible.


            16    1 suggested that the Club should provide us with two

                  tickets in order that we could put liaison officers in

                  the ground so that they could get resources to the ground
                  as quickly as possible.                      said that if I wrote

                  to the Club then he could arrange for two tickets to be
                  provided.


           17    We discussed where these complimentary seats should be.

                 ---------       offered    us   two seats at      the back of the
                 trainers box at pitch level but, after discussion with
                 Mr. Higgins and                      |# I requested two seats in
                 the Stand.       There were three reasons for this


                 17.1     communication to Control by radio would be better
                          from higher up in the Stand;

                                17.2          there would be a much bettor view of other parts
                                              of the ground from there;



                                17.3         there would be better access to a telephone and to
                                             the physiotherapists room.                  We suggested two seats

                                             io                       which were behind the directors * box
                                             and close to one of the exits that went down into
                                             the Stand.


                       18      I subsequently                     wrote     a letter        in   the   name      of     the
                               Assistant Chief Metropolitan Ambulance Officer, addressed
                               to Mr. Chester at the Club, that letter was dated 6th
                               August 1986.                   I understand that subsequently the season
                               tickets were collected by Mr. Higgins or


                       19      I    had       previously               prepared      a   draft     incident           plan
                              applicable to all five of the Football Grounds in our
                              region.               The station officers assigned to each of the
                              grounds           then completed                  the plans    by filling         in the
                              appropriate blanks.                         in the case of Hillsborough this
                              was done by station officers Higgins and


                   20
                             At the meeting of 16th July we had discussed the question
                             of ambulance access to the ground but not access to the
                             pitch.             when that meeting took place the Spion Kop was
                             in the process of being built.

             21    Prior to the meeting of July 1986 SYMAS had always had
                   two ambulances on stand-by close the ground on the days
                   of major matches, but following that meeting it has been
                   possible to have one ambulance inside the ground for
                   major matches and arrangements for this have always been
                   made with the Police.


            22     Once the incident plans had been prepared for all 5
                   grounds I put copies into the Control Room.             I monitored

                   the arrangements for Football Grounds for a short time,
                   until my promotion to Divisional Officer (Control and
                   Communications).

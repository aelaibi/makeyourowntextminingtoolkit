     1   I am very grateful to you for arranging for me to visit
   the injured in the Northern General and Royal Hallamshire
   hospitals today and for coming personally to accompany me.          I
   know how very busy all the staff in both hospitals have been.
   They have worked with great dedication and professionalismr
   both in the way they have dealt medically with the
   consequences of yesterday's terrible tragedy and also in the
   care and concern which they have so obviously shown to the
   relatives of those who were seriously injured-   You can
   justly be very proud of them.


         I should be grateful if you would pass on ray warm thanks
   to those who were involved with the arrangements for my
   visit.

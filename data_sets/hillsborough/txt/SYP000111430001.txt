                   With      reference         to the above          incident;           I commenced duty at 8 . 1 3 a.m.

                   We were          then given a briefing                by the senior             officers        in charge,         after

                   this we took a meal                  break.       Our    serial        was    briefed by Police Sergeant

stad i u m and general                crowd control.          We    had been i n structed at              the

b r i e f i n g to direct Liverpool                supporters        to the N o r t h S t a n d and

Lepping s Lane.             The N o t t i n g h a m For e s t      fans   to the S outh S t a n d and

S p i o n Kop.       We had also           been informed of the d e s i g n a t e d             parking areas

for both sets            of fans.         I have a t t e n d e d m a t c h e s at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y

prior    to this and at the same m a t c h the year                           before as far as            I can

remember,         the    briefing was very m u c h the                 same.        On this     previous

o c c a s i o n however,        I had been on the detail                   covering      the b a r riers on

Vere Road and other                   junctions a d j a c e n t     to the ground.            We were

informed at          the briefing            that the m a t c h was          'all    ticket'      and that all

tickets had been sold.



From    11.15 a.m.          on taking          up our     positions        there was a steady flow of

fans    coming along P e n i s t o n e Road from the d i r ection of W a d s l e y Bridge

R a i l w a y Station.        Most       of them at       this     time were on the opposite                  side

of the       road from the             bus station and our             position.



At about        1 p.m.      the stream of s u p p o r t e r s          had    increased quite

s u b stan tially,         the m a j o r i t y of them that we spoke                  to on our        side of

the    road were Liv e r p o o l           supporters and           they were d i r e c t e d across            the

road to L e p p i n g s       lane for the N o r t h Stand.                  It Was n o t i c e a b l e at this

time    that m a n y of these fans were                     carrying       tins of beer and man y of

them were a c t u a l l y drink ing as                 they w a l k e d along the          road.       I would

ad d here that           betw e e n this time and about 2.45                     p.m.    a d i s tance     of

betw e e n    100 to       150 y ards away from us a long Pe n i s t o n e Road were

groups       of s u p p o r t e r s    sat on walls at the             side of the         road,     a gain

drinking        cans of beer and              it a p p e a r e d to me they were            not    in any

great    hurry       to get       to the match.



Just after 2 p.m.              a large        contingent         of Liverpool         fans were       escorted

down P e n i s t o n e Roa d by members            of the M o u n t e d B r a n c h an d other

officers.          I presumed these were f r o m the                   train that was          due to

arrive about          this time.           There was       still a vast number              of supporters,

a g a i n the m a j o r i t y    being Liverpool           fans moving along            both sides of

P e n i s t o n e R oad and a g a i n      I w ould add that many of these fans had

o b v i o u s l y been drinking,           some    I w o u l d say from my experience,                   quite

heavily.         There was            the usual    rowdiness and         chanting from these

s upporters at this              time     but nothing          that w a r r a n t e d any Police action.

At about S . 3 0 p.m.            I looked up along Le p p r n g s ^ a n e , it was                   e x t remely

crowded and Police C o n s t a b l e M c F a r l a n e            in fact     remarked to me that

the entire         road     looked just          like    'a sea of      b o b b i n g h e a d s '.    It was

cer t a i n l y u n p a s s a b l e    to vehicular       traffic.      There     did not appear           to be

any u n t o w a r d    incidents at this            time an d e v erything a p p e a r e d            to be

running       smoothly.



At 3.0 5      p.m.     that date we          liaised w i t h Police S e r g e a n t A s h t o n and

other memb e r s        of our serial            outside       the garage     situa t e d a d j a c e n t to

the    roundabout at the j u n c t i o n of L e p p i n g s Lane an d P e n i s t o n e R oad

North.



We then all           c o mmenced along L e p pings Lane a ^ ^ e r i ^ l                   wit h a view to

s tanding       by in C a t c h b a r Lane as           per our     brief.      As we w a l k e d along

L e p p i n g s Lane     I h eard via a radio - p r e s u m a b l y Police S e r g e a n t Ashto n ' s

as he was        the only officer             in my immediate           v i c i n i t y that I knew had             a

radio - a m e s s a g e         to the effect           that    'the    m a t c h had been            stopped',

a n d almost       i m m e d i a t e l y after    that a call went           out for all av a i l a b l e

officers        on stan d b y to a t t e n d at the L e p p i n g s Lane              turnstiles.           We

              turnstiles             on to the        road outside            the entrance.            There was a         large

              number of officers                   present       plus memb e r s        of M o u n t e d B ranch.         At the

              request        of I n s pector           (name not known)               we formed a cordon across                the

              rnouth of the turn s t i l e s                 to stop a n y further              persons gain i n g access.

              Shortly after               this an am b u l a n c e a r r i v e d and went              through the         cordon

              to the       rear of the stand.                    I then saw one or two

              come out of the gr o u n d they were                          red faced an d one, a mi d d l e aged

              man,     was     crying.           I then noticed wha t                 I presumed were          injured      persons

              being      carried to the rear                   of the ambul a n c e .            The middle a ged          chap

              stood      in front of the                cordon,        he was        crying and saying,           "Is     it w orth

              it?      People are            dying      ii          ^e."      At this      stage      I had no       idea of what

              had a c t u a l l y occurred.                  We had been there about                  five minu t e s      by this

              time whe n we were                 reque sted        to a s s i s t i n s i d e    the ground.         We    then

              e n t e r e d the ground and as                   I passed the a m b u l a n c e         I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y

              three      injured          parties at the             rear     of the a m b u l a n c e    being a s s i s t e d by

              Police Constables                  and Amb u l a n c e Service.            One a p p e a r e d dead to me,           he

              was a definite                blue     colour a n d didn't appear                  to be breathing.            At    the

              rear     of the stands               were Police O f f i c e r s w ith other                injured fans,           many
          C
              just     lying         on the      floor a p p a r e n t l y      lifeless.         The grav i t y of the

              si t u a t i o n was        quite      obv i o u s l y dawning          by now and as we          then entered

              the    tunnel          leading       to the      rear of the L e p p i n g s Lane            goal area,         I was
    UP'
&
              du m b f o u n d e d    to see the scene               that was         spread out before           us.      I have

              seen other             " t r a g e d i e s ’ on t e l e v i s i o n    before     this date a n d o b v i o u s l y

              thought        they were           terrible and s a ddening                but     to a c t u a l l y see the

              scene      before your             eyes     is beyond belief.



              T h e r e were         still     a large number              of suppo r t e r s     on the actual           terracing

              both to the             left and        right.        The wire          fencing     s u r r o unding   the    pitch

'                one of the broken hoardings                      carried by Liverpool                  fans.    T hey took him
ot- Q&w
                 a w a y to the o p p o s i t e         corner between the H o p and N o r t h Stand.                       By this

                 time     I had     lost     contact wit h Police C o n s t a b l e McF a r l a n e and other

                 memb e r s    of my serial.                I assisted      fans w i t h a further male y o u t h ~

                 early twenties,             shortish          light    coloured hair.                I believe    he was still

                 conscious — he was                 certainly moving and breathing.                        He too was          put on

                 a hoarding and             taken away.           Again     I tried         to    console one      chap who was

                 just    sat on the floor                staring       into space ~ but a gain what                  could you

                 say to him.           At    this stage          1' just    couldn't           believe    that    this    had

                 happened.          I was at a loss for words myself as to the e n o r m i t y of

                 the disaster.              At    this    stage     I did not witness any h o s t i l i t y from the

                 to do this         but w i t h        little obvious            success.        We were     then a s k e d to

              I w o u l d point out at this             stage that the           length of P e n i s t o n e R oad

              towards      the    railway s t a t i o n was        littered w i t h beer           cans and bottles.



              At ar o u n d 6pm we were           stood down to C l a y w h e e l s Lane            for standby there

              and     I must admit I have never seen so m a n y Po l i c e O f f icers                        so

              dumbstruck         - if that       is the     right word.         You got the feeling of

              inade q u a c y - w h y did        it happen - how did             it happen -■ m a n y officers

              w ere    o b v i o u s l y v i s i b l y upset and shaken,         in a word         it was

              unbelievable.           My only      comment w hen          inside    the ground was that             I

              w o u l d have     thought tha t       the    loudspeaker        sy s t e m    could have been

              u t i l i s e d to a greater        extent     to try and        co-ordinate          the a c t i o n s of

              Po l i c e O f f i c e r s at    the scene.         We were     left v i r t u a l l y to our own

              devices,      a n d o b v i o u s l y no one was       prepared for any              incident    of this

              nature or m agnitude.               In all     honesty       I have     never      in my    life before

              felt so empty and void.                 I know what          it is    like to        lose someone         dear

              to y o u - but this was             like nothing           on this    earth - an d yet these

              people     didn't m e a n a n y t h i n g    to me - but         I was        totally s h a t t e r e d at

              the time and felt               very deeply for all           those who         had been      injured or

              died.

            I am un aware as to what a c t i o n was         taken at the L e p p i n g s Lane

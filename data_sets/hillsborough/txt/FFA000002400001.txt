HILLSBOROUGH INVESTIGATION


The Police require the following details

Names and addresses of people in Directors Box

I can only supply the following information

FA Officials and Council Members and other invited guests, i.e.,
Football League Officials, Howell, Faulkner, etc.

I informed the Police that Liverpool and Nottingham Forest were
allocated 24 seats each for Directors, and a further 6 seats for
guests. Sheffield Wednesday were allocated 12 seats for their
Directors, plus 6 more for their guests. I do not have the

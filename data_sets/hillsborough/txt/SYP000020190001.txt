Dear Graham,
           I travelled to Sheffield for the P.A.
Cup Semi Final with a friend, via the City Centre.
The traffic was fairly heavy and we eventually -parked
on a grass verge about three quarters of a mile
from the ground about 1.15'p.m.
           At that time the density of the crowd
was not too great who moved along in an orderly way
albeit noisily singing, it was noticeable that every
public house en route was packed with many standing
outside but no drunkeness was apparent.     We were
asked several times if we had any tickets, largely
by young teenage bo^s-rwlic did not appear to be
accompanied by adults.
           Entrance to the ground was comparatively
easy and there was no hassle.
           We tookour seats at about 2.40 p.m..
When the trouble beganwe assumed that some spectators
were endeavc&ing to invade the pitch by climbing over
the fence and we saw some policemen trying to
prevent entry cr pushing them back.
             The seriousness of the situation did not
strike us until spectators were being stretchered
off, nor did we realise that there were any deaths
until informed in the private lounge that there were
4 , later 11 and then 50.

    The Public Address system was unsatisfactory as
with the exception of the announcement by Kenny
Dalgleish, when the volume was greatly increased,
it was impossible to hear what was being said.
I am sure      of the crowd were- as unaware as we
were of what was happening.
     I enclose a:- cutting from our locsl paper.
       I an sorry that I cannot give much information
hope this might possibly^a^little.
                Yours sincerely,

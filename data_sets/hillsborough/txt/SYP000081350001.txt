Once    through           the    t u r n s t I saw               quite       a    lot     of    police         on    the      ins i d e

of    the    turnstiles.              X    had       gone     through        the       correct           turnstile           for    the

Police       about X O          of   them were           just       standing           there.            I made      my w a y a l o n g

kicking       off.         My    brother          and    his m a t e       were        already           in t h e r e    but       my

My    seat    was     for G a n g w a y N,            row 6 s e at          163.




I sat       down and        started            to w a t c h    the      match      I had        seen        no-one       drinking

inside       the     ground and            there        was    no d i s o r d e r .          After        a few minutes

while       the m a t c h w a s        s t i ll      going     on      I saw a         lot     of    people         spilling            out

          a n d at       first        I thought          it was        a    pitch         invasion.               T h e n at a b o u t            6

          minutes            past     3 the m a t c h w a s          stopped            a n d m y a t t e n t i o n was             drawn             fully

          I saw a young                    man walking          along        the        front      of       the N o r t h S t a n d              b e ing

          helped         by a St.           Johns      A m bu lan ce ma n and              I could           see       that       his    arm was

          bent      in a f u n n y          position and             I could            see m o r e         and more             people          comi n g

          over      the       fence.         Then      someone         came        running         along          the    f r ont        of       us a g a i n

          <1520)         to    see     if we         could     help.         The        police         had       put a       cordon across

          the      front       of     the N o r t h      stand       before         t his        but    h e ’d m o v e d          it w h e n we               got

          onto      the       p i t c h we     both went            d o w n to      the       front         of    the W e s t       Stand.

          There         were    about        30      people     if     not m o r e         ly ing       on the          pitch a nd                a

          lot      of    other        people         walking        around         in    pair.          I had          seen other                people

          few      of    t h e m w h o were* p u l l i n g           fans      out       of      the    terrace          and       others             were

          trying         to    give m outh            to m o u t h     resuscitation.                       We    started          to    run

          between            this     area and         the     Hop where            the       ambulances               n ow w e r e      bringing

          the      injured          down     to      them     on the        hoardings.                 I brought             4    people          down

          the      pitch       in this         way     one     of    them was            a boy         of a b o u t       10 y e a r s           old and

          think         he    had     fair     hair.          The    other         three         were       young       blokes          one       of      them

we    had. j ust     picked      t h e m all        up off         the    pitch and         taken     them    down      to

the    other       e n d of    the     ground and            put    them     on the        pitch where        there

were    two    ambulances            and     people were            giving        them m outh        to m o u t h

r esus c i tat ion.




After    this       I was      j ust    walking          around       in a daze,           I was     shocked and           I

was    looking       around      for        my m a t e s .      I could        see    people        lying    on the

ground       that    appeared          to    be   dead.         At a b o u t      4.20pm      (1620)       I met     up w i t h

                           again       on the       p i t c h a n d we w e n t        b ack    to    our    seats.         At

4.30pm       (1630)     there        was     an announcement               o ver     the    loudspeaker           and   we

decided       to    leav e    the      ground.           We m a d e      our w a y    back     to    the    car a n d      came

straight       home     only     stopping           to    phone       home.




I was    not       injured      at     all.       I did        not w i t n e s s     anything        that    I consider

to    be a    criminal        offence.




I would       just     like     to     clarify where               I referred         to a b o u t    40    poli c e

officers       standing         j ust       inside       the    turnstiles           they were        to    the     left

standing       by    the      concertina          exit       gate and        they may         have    been    trying           to

stop    it    bursting        open      under       the      pressure        of    the     crowd.     I would       also

like    to a d d     that      I went        to   the     s am e    semi     fjj>a^***Ta~sT~~year a n d           there

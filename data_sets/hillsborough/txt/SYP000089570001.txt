            W it h    regard to the above              incident     I have      to report as follows



             At 8.00 am          <0800)     Saturday      15th April       1989   (150489)      I corns             duty

             under P S 8 4 0 WR IG HJ of A t t e r cl if fe Police Station.                   Our   duties      included

             the t r an s po r t a t i o n of Liverpool           supporters      from t he M i d l a n d

             M i d l a n d S t a ti on at    the   conclusion of the match.



             At 9.00 am          (0900)     that morning         I a tt e n d e d at West Bar g y m n as iu m for a

             briefing about          the mat ch presented by Super i ntendent B A T E S and Chief

             Inspector KING.              We were      then a l l o w e d time    to eat the        packed    lunch
                                                                                                          P AGE         2
                                                                                                          S3383

          provided,      after whi e rf      ]m ade my way down to Midl an d S t a t i o n          in company

          with PC 1668 L E C K Y ^ / n f$>oT.        We a r r i v e d at the station at a p p r o x i m a t e l y

          1000 am     (1000)      that same    date.       Myself and other

          o fficers were         then deplo ye d to form a line from the stat io n entrance

          to w aiting      buses    so that all       supporters       caught the buses       provided.             I

          made    two trips       down to the       ground on the       buses w ith PC LEjSKY.            The

          s upporters      on the     buses a pp e a r e d to be very quiet and ware               not any

          trouble at all.           Several    of the s upporters m e n t i o n e d that          they wi sh ed

          to get to the ground as quickly as                   possible as they did not have any

          tickets.



          On arrival       at the ground there were             hundreds     of s u p p o r t ers stood        in

          the    road at L e p p i n g s Lane.      Some were        drinking,   some were        quite    rowdy

          others     quiet.       I saw tens of fans asking             other fans     if they had any

    f~    spare tickets and several              tickets were         sold near to the turnstiles..-

        ''' The a tm os ph er e was    tense and fans were            chanting   football     songs.           It

'   K     was very noisy at that             time    but no more noisy than you w ou ld expect at

          a major     football      match.     !here       seemed to be no reason for fans

          wa iting    outside      the ground as they were             but they were      not e n co ur ag ed

          to enter the ground.



          PS W RI GH T  i nstructed PC L ECKY and myself                to go to the g y m n as iu m for

          s ta nd by.      This we did until about             half an hour       later   there was a call

          over the       radio    for officers       to a tt e n d at the Leppings Lane            end of the

          ground as fans were           trying      to force    their way      into the ground.            I

          a tt e n d e d in company wit h PC L E C K Y , PS WRIGHT and other               officers at

          gate A in order          to get out       into Leppings Lane         but due to the

          crush of fans at the other                side    of the    gate   it was   c onsidered unsafe

          to open the gate as there might                   be a stampede      of fans.      We    then made

CAT    / our way     to gate C where after                persuading a steward to open the                    gate we

         m a n a g e d to work    our way out of the ground near to the turnstiles.                                     I

         believe     t hat the gates were            closed to after we had got out.



         At this     time there w e r e n ’t many           people       near to the gate.            The m aj ority

         a p pe a r e d to be pushing        towards      the turnstiles.           In my opin io n          peoples

         lives were     in danger         due to the        crush of hundreds           of    people trying             to

         get     into such a small          area.     It was       impossible      to   push    people       back

         away from the turnstiles as they did not wish to miss                                 the match.           I

         did not know at that             time whether        the m a tc h had started or not.                    Gate

       I C was     opened and PS WR IG HT           i nstructed me to start             pulling       people

       / u n d er n ea t h some metal       barriers      near     to the turnstiles           in order       that
         -
         they might     go through the newly opened gate,                      so as to ease           the
/f\K     "pressure    on the      people     near    to the turnstiles.             I did this         but    saw that

         other     people    from the back          of the    crowd were       running forw ar d         in order

         to get t hrough the            gate as well.         There      seemed to be hundreds               of

         people     rushing      through the gate.            Whe n the      pressure        on the    turnstiles

         had eased the gate was              closed and the          crowd were a l lo we d to go through

         the     turnstiles again.           I heard that          the m a tc h had a l re ad y       started and

         the fans outside             the ground were        still       rushing   to get      in through the

         turnstiles.         Tickets were         still    being     sold outside        the ground at this

         time.      During    the      crush,   prior to gate C being              opened fans were

         climbing     over walls         into   the ground         in order    to escape        the    crush

         a s si s t e d by Police       officers w h o y u e r e    on top of the walls           pulling         fans

         over .



         Just as the L ep pings L a n a ' e n d o             he ground       cleared there was a call

            the stand,          On arrival     at           i-irlfch I saw that there were               no    players

            and the game a p p e a r e d to have         been abandoned.                I looked to the

            e nclosure      directly behind the football                  nets.        The    centre    north

            enclosure a pp e a r e d to be full          of people         trying       to escape.       Some were

            being       lifted into      the West S tand above,            some were          climbing    over

 On         d X v i di ng fences     into the N orth and Central                 S outh e nclosures and o t h e r s

            were    climbing out of a small             gate at the front               of the enclosure          in the

            tall    barriers.



            At first       1 did not      realise what was         happening and              I started to ask

            people      to move    back    towards    the enclosure.              I then saw two          injured

            y ouths     being    lifted out of the small              barrier      gate.        O ff icers were

            stood up against          the barrier       trying     to reach over and help fans to

            climb out of the enclosure.                On    realising          that    people were       injured

            behind the       barrier      I climbed thro ug h a small              barrier       gate    in the

            or stand back out of the way.



            I helped to         lift several        injured and unconscious                  over the    barriers and

This went on for a fe«*k minute               until      a man who       identified himself as a

doctor    stated that he was dead.                A friend of the decea se d agreed to

stay with him for          purposes    of    i dent i f i cat ion.       Following      this    1

continued to assist and             comfort    the      injured.



Bodies were      carried out        on wo od en    planks and e ventually an ambulance

a t te n d e d on the    pitch.     I found other members               of my serial       and we all

stood together          in disbelief.       S u d d e n l y there was a charge           of Liverpool

fans towards      the N o t t i n g h a m Forest     end of the ground.               This was

thwarted by the swift action of the Police who made a line across                                      the

w id th of the    pitch.      Tempers       of the Liverpool            fans were      frayed and

man y shouted abuse at us stating                 that we were          'murdering      b a s t a r d s ''and

that    it was ail      our fault.      Others       stated that they should have had

the other end of the          pitch as they had more                 fans.    Things     qui et en ed

down and     I stood wit h other members                of my serial         on the    pitch.        it was

then that we began to a p pr ec ia te             the    true    size    of the disaster.            We

all    felt very emotional         and found       it difficult          to fight      back    the

tears,



We were    finally given          instructions       to escort        the fans    back     to the

train station on the          buses and this we            carried out with abuse               being

thrown at us by man y fans along               the way.          I later a tt e n d e d the debrief

at West Bar      Police Stat ion whe re            I f ound out       that 95 peo pi e had died

as a result      of the tragedy.            I could not         be 1 ieve this.

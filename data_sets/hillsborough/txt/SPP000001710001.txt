 ;   TH E CORONER:  Welcome.   Can I say first of all that
tnis is not a part of the inquests proper, because the
1 9 t h eo f SN o v e Pr r aCe ? Ct Ually r e s u m i n S> as. you know, on the
    th ot November.            ine purp os e of this meeting as I sai d in
my letter to tne legal rep re se nt at iv es , is for me to h a v e an
opport u n i t y to meet mem be rs of the legal pr ofession and
                     ln ° n sr weto can
                                     sort
a        c        i possibl e           runoutthe inquests when we so
     I    ^ e t ,^low" to, tnem, m as sm ooth and as eff i c i e n t a
way as possible m       tne interests of everybody who has an
intere st in the matter, inclu di ng myself.


not - 1 t          t VO i 1 ai?y Possible m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g we will
 ,.     I repeat not - deal witn any questions of e v i dence
tnis afternoon, or q u e stions of fact.        We are de aling w i t h
simple p rocedural matters.        I tried to make that clear in
tne invitation, and I hope that was understood, but I iust
wan   to Lepeat it so there can't be any doubt ab out it at


       Secondly, this meet i n g is - it is diffi cu lt to know
  i t to call it because in Co roner's proc ee di ng s you don't
n orm al ly nave opport u n i t i e s for this sort of gathering, but
Y^ ^ ° U ? tnaybe, by way of analogy, treat it as if it w e r e a
       ° n before the J u d g e m     chambers or an i n t e rlocutory
procedure.      The point about it is that alth ou gh no thing
w e \ ill b f     M     ^       l rkel-
                                      v .to cause a n Y problems bec au se
we will be sticking to procedure, it should be treated as a
jusiriesa meeting, as a priva te g a thering betwe en myself and
tne lawyers.           Pernaps I ought to say that I did mak e it
   ?ar       ^ne letter that I would not raise any ob j e c t i o n to
int er es te d parties coming.          I meant that becau se I did n' t
want anyb od y to feel that I was me eting with lawyers, or
anybody else for that matter, where the people who had a
di rect interest were s p e c ifically excluded.            I r e cognise
      °r   j ° f a c s s > but I don't rec og ni se everybody, mainly
problem.     ^   S° P° ° r 3t   rec o § nition of    faces,   but   that's my


       Would it be best if you just intro du ce d yours el ve s, the
lawyers tnat is, and    the repre se nt at iv es , so I k now who is
h e Le and so  that   the sh orthand wri te r can take a note.      I
t h o n f h ^ f h 3 pr0per note of what is going on because I
       ^           was wlse tnat we knew p r ecisely what was said.
                 i
         i;jR. KING:     Sir, my name is T i m o t h y King of Cou ns el
   am i n structed on beh al f of a numbe r of the de ceased
tnrough their personal repr es en ta ti ve s.          I cannot today
read out a de fi nitive list of every on e whom I represent,
lhat is becau se there was initially a preli mi na ry list of
about forty to forty-two.              At the mome nt it is about twen ty -
six d e f i n i t e sets of instructions.        It is likely... that that
'will be added to and if it is of help, sir, wi thin a w e e k I
am told I can provide you, sir, with a defi ni ti ve list of
tnose who will be re pr esented through myself.               I am
in structed through tlr. Fraser, solicitor, who is one of six
so licitors who form the H i l l s b o r o u g h g roup of so li citors who
were known as the Steer in g Com mi tt ee at the time of the
laylor Inquiry, acting on behalf of the berea ve d and inj ur ed
and they^ m            turn have been instructed by a gro up whi ch h a v e
formed themselves through the families called The
H i l l s b o r o u g h Family Su pport Group.

     However, we don't cla im to repr es en t each and eve ry set
of person al re pr esentatives of each deceased, only those
wnich I have indicated num be r now twen ty -s ix and is likely'
to go up possibly to forty to forty-two.

         TIIL LOROHEk:      ihank you.   Well, when Hr. Fraser or his
i nstructing so licitors are in a posit io n to let me hav e a
de f i n i t i v e list it wo uld be helpful because then I will know
who you aren t representing.            That is what I am really
interested in.           It is the ones who are outside y o u r . ..

         HR. IQUG:      Sir, I ought to say there may well be
indiv id ua ls here today who repr es en t personal
re p r e s e ntatives of, d e c e a s e d who h a v e n ' t given instructions
to our se lv es who would want to be heard today as be ing
representatives.

     THE CORONER:       Indeed.   Perhaps it is only fair to say
this invi ta ti on wa sn't extended to every single
representa ti ve .    It was a limited invi ta ti on to pe o p l e who
I thought had most to gain from the meeting.

          MR. RUSSELL:          Sir, I am next in line.   My name is
Ch r i s t o p h e r Russell and I am a barrister.      I am in st ructed
by Harlow, Lyde and Gilbert, so licitors in London, to who m
y o u ^ e x t e n d e d such an invitation, to re present the int er es ts
of Su p e r i n t e n d e n t Greenwood.

        MR. CATCHPOLE:      My name is Stuart Catchpole.    I am a
b a r rister instr uc te d by Messrs. Davies, Arnold, Cooper,
t^ith me today is M r . Doyle from that firm of soli ci to rs and
we appear on behalf of Sh effield Wed n e s d a y Football Club.

     THE COROWER:   Yes,            I do rem em be r you   from   the int er im
hearings, Mr. Catchpole.

          M R . ilALE:        I am Vin cent Hale.    I repr es en t
S u p e r i n t e n d e n t Roger Marshall.    I am a solicitor.

                                -    2   -
        MR. HANNING:   My name is Richard Manning.              I am a
s o l icitor and I repre se nt Su pe ri ntendent Murray.

     MR. ISAACS:     Paul Isaacs, sir, Counsel.            W i t h me is
Mr. Co pland of my instru c t i n g solicitors, H e p w o r t h and
Chadwick.    We rep r e s e n t Chief Su pe ri ntendent Duckenfield.

      TH E CORONER:      Yes.

       MR. GREGORY:    My name is Gregory of Keeble, Hawson.
I rep resent the insu re rs of Sh effield City Council and the
Cou nc il itself.    Mr.  Hepwo r t h is also a solic it or from tne
City Council.      He is wit h me today.

      THE CORONER:     I un derstand you are a membe r of the
press, is that rignt? Well, with thegreatest of            respect,
I would like you to leave.         This is not part of the
proceedings/     It is not a repor ta bl e occas io n and I w o u l d
be grate fu l if you w o u l d leave bec au se I think that is the
has is upon which I cal le d this m e e t i n g .

       As I ex plained to you, this is not because there is
an y thing being said her e which is so secret that nobod y can
hear it, but I don't wan t - bearing in mind tne m a t t e r is
ooinp to be dealt with before a jury - I think it is only
right that we rem em be r and we just deal w ith the procedure.

           MISS N O R C L I F F E : Sir, I am Belinda Norcliffe. I am a
 solicitor and I repre se nt the Chief Co nstable of the S o u t h
 Y o r k s h i r e Police.

      TH E CORONER:       Yes,   I remember you      too   from the
 previous sessions.

      MR. JACKSON:       Sir, I am Peter Jackson.      I am a
 partner in Hill, Dickenson, Davies, Campbell, and I_
 represent the Football Supporters' As so ciation.         Sir, I ^
 feel I ought to point out at tnis stage that^we are h e r e in
 response to your, invitation, for whi ch my clients thank you.
 It is unlikely, due to the funding of my clients
 organi sa ti on , we will be able to ap pear bef or e you
 throug ho ut the inquiry.

          TH E C O R O N E R : Perha ps I should ex plain that r e m a r k to
 tne rest of the lawyers.              I had been in touch with Hill
 D i c k e n s o n in the past and they very p r o perly poin t e d out to
 me that they were n' t r e p r e senting an ybody in p a r t i c u l a r , ^but
 it oc curred to me when I was thinking about the pr e p a r a t i o n
 for these inquests that su pporters in gene r a l mig ht well
 feature to a great er or lesser extent in the evidence.                     I
 thought it right to d raw that to the at tention of Hill
 D i ckenson in case they wish ed to take a view on it. ^ Tha t
 is why you are here and obvio us ly it is a mat te r e n t irely


                                 -   3   -
for you to de cide what,             if anything,    you do.     I appreciate
your difficulty.

      MR. J A C K S O N : Sir, ray clients do take the vie w that
there would be a void be fore you in r e p r esentation if the
su pporters we ren't here, but we are in di ff ic ulties.      I
will speak to the sol ic it or s for the other parties.       It may
be that if I can obtain under ta ki ng s about the extent an d
scope of cr it icism of Liverpool Football Club suppo rt er s,
that a lot of the need for re presentation before you wil l
go.    That will ob viously depend on what sort of
un dertakings I can obtain.

     THE C O R O N E R : Have I got all the lawyers now?     I did
write to iirs. McBrian - yes, there you are — because I knew
she was not re pr esented spe ci fi ca ll y and I thought it was
rignt that you corne along as well.
                 i
       MRS. M c B R I A N :    I ain Mrs. Joan McB ri an and I. r e p r e s e n t
our   family in this.

     IHii, C O U O N E K :    Yes,       that is all you can represent,      iust
yourself.                                                                   J

      While I am on names, I ap pr eciate that some of you may
not want to be present tnroughout the inquests when we
resume.    Some of you will be here all the time, some of you
may change.    It would be hel pf ul to me if once you k n o w who
is going to be comin g on a more or less r e g u l a r ,b a s i s , if
you could let us know because we are going to be going to
try and m ake name plates for you so that I can r e c o g n i s e you
when we sit in court.      It makes it a lot ea sier for me to
addre ss you corre ct ly by name, so if you would let me kno w
we will get that done.     That is an aid for me.        Of course,
you are free to change, if somebody is new or doesn 't wa nt
to be there, or so me thing like that.

     MR. KING:      Sir, in the case of the deceased, I am h ere
as junior counsel.      At the time of the Inquiry leading
counsel was also instructed.      It is the intention, I know,
of those who instruct me, thart on occ as io n they may wis h to
have leading counsel here, leading myself, and pos si bl y
leading co unsel only on his own.     I assume, sir, you w o u l d
have no obj ec ti on to that course?

       THE CORONER:           No objec ti on at all.

       MR.   KING:       I am obliged.

      THE CORONER:     Pro vi de d somebody has got locus standi,
in the sense that they represent an in te rested party, I am
qu ite prepa re d to be as reasonable and as a c c o m m o d a t i n g as I
can be.    All I am asking you is that you hel p me by ke eping
me informed.

                                     -   4   -
           Can I go through one or two things which I think y o u
    might wan t to know and then I will either pause from tim e to
    time to give you a cha nc e to chip in, or at the end if there
    is any th in g I have not dealt with which you feel I o u g h t to
    be thin ki ng about then I will give you an oppor tu ni ty to
    dr a w it to my attention.

         The venue of the re sumed inquests is going to be. the
    Council Chamber.    For tho se of you who were at Lord J u s t i c e
    Taylor's Inquiry, it is ex actly the same location.   Whether
    we will stay there the whole time will depend upon the
    number s of people who are present.

           Sir?

              HR. HOLROYI):        Good afternoon.     I am Mr. Holroyd
    r e p r e s e n t i n g the Police Federation,   sir.   My ap ol ogies   for
    being late. .                                                   ,

           THL CORONER:        T h a n k you.   Wh ether we tran sl oc at e at
    some point or not I don 't know. , It will depend upon the
    num be r of people who attend.            It is obvious, looking around
    this afternoon, that we would have the dickens of a job
    ge tt in g in nere a s s u m i n g we have this sort of turn-out and
    that was the reason why we chose that venue.

         We are doing our best to m a k e it as conv en ie nt for
    legal represent at iv es and others as possible, but, of
    course, I am limited wit h what is provide d for rne.

f          I have   been asked whe th er     there will be space to store
I papers and we bel ie ve there is   a room.           They call it a
j safe, but it is a c t ually quite a largi sh        room whi ch we would
     be able to make ava i l a b l e for anybody who wanted to put
|   things in.        You would hav-e to be resp on si bl e for you r own
j   security.        I could not possibly take any re s p o n s i b i l i t y for
;   security.       They key to the room is in the custody           of the
!   City Council and we would make          arrangements for it to be
     opened and shut at c o nvenient hours, say, between nine and
     ten and five and six, or something like that in the
s   afternoon,     so that you can have access, (a) to put things in
\   and (b) to get things out.          Wh ether you use it or not is of
     cou r s e a matte r e n t irely for you.

              Ihe times of the sittings:        at the moment I have it in
    mind to sit from 10.00 until about 12.45 or thereabouts.
    O b v i o u s l y the hours h a v e got to be flex ib le beca us e of
    evidence.           Then m aybe from quar te r to two or two o ' c l o c k
    until around four.            You may feel that that is not very long
    and that Lord Just i c e T a y l o r sat for a lot longer.          I know°
    he did, but then lie did not sit wit h a jury.              It is not
    fair, in my view, to expect or dinary people who are not used
    to legal proceedings, even albeit this is just coronal


                                    -   5   -
p r o c e e d i n g s , to expect   them to sit for very muc h lon ge r   than
t iia t .
     If we find         that we      want to ma ke a few ad ju stments to
these times, we         will do      so as we go along.    Ue will p a u s e
probably in the         morning      and af te rnoon for a short b r e a k to
allow pe ople to        stretch      their legs and have a cup of c o f f e e
and so on.

      I have to tell yo u that the present posit io n is that
tne City Council is a no smoking zone.       I am sorry a b o u t
tnat for those of you who are smokers, but apart frotn^ the
fact that tnat is their standard policy, we also thins the
fire servi ce might not be too happy if we allow ed it.
Ther ef or e, for the time being you nav e to as sume it is no
 smoking.
             .   f                                           "
         Is that r e asonably c lear w it h reg ar d to v enue and time?
 O ne final thing.       It may be that y o u m a y have points of     law
 to put to me from time to time.           O b viously it it is
 some th in g that has to be dealt with there and then, then we
 will do so and we will send the jury out.             However,   i f ±t
 is somet hi ng which you feel you want to put, and w h i c h would
 have to be put in the absence of the jury, I would sugg e s t
 we trv and do it around the four o' clock mark so that we use
  the time when the jury have gone home.            That is not an
  in vi tation that you address me on eacn and every day on
  points of law, but it is just a c o nvenient way b e c a u s e on
  princ ip le we should be able to cope wit h just a little
  longer tnan the jury.         However, as I say, if s o m e t n m g
  occurs dur in g t h e d a y that you feel has to be dea lt wi th
  then, then so be it.

       Now the next thing I want to talk about is what I call
  the scope of the    inquelts.           You will reco ll ec t that we h ave
  alread y dealt at con s i d e r a b l e le ngth wit h three quest io ns ,
  who, whe n and where.       In fact we dea lt wit h them rather
  more ex te nsively than     in an average inquest w hich I would
  normal ly deal with.        For various reasons I felt it was
   right.
           What is left of the four things w hich Cor on er s by and
   laroe deal with, is the question of ho w and that is w h a t we
   are goi ng to be c o n c entrating on in t h e s e resum ed inquests.
   For pract ic al pu rposes the "how" will apply to all the
   ni n e t y - f i v e deceased. Technically, as you wil l a p p r e c i a t e ,
   I am not doing one inquest, we are d o i n g ni n e t y - t i v e
   separa te and i n dividual inquests, w h i c h is wny we took
   eviden ce i n d i vidually for n inety-five people in A pril and
   Mav.         However, because it would be a prac ti ca l
   impos sibility to recou nt the ge ne rality of tne ev idence
   ninety - f i v e times over, we will take the e v i dence toge th er
    in resp ec t of all of them.        I, in common wi th m o s t of us,_
   will slip into the fault of calli ng it the inquest.              Whe n

                                       -   6   -
do that you will forgive me and read it as meaning the
inquests.       He will by and large be de aling with all the
evi de nc e for every bo dy today.

      I am, of course, aware that there are some differences..
Just to take a simple example, there were two encl os ur es -
enclosure 3 and e n c losure 4 - but I d o n ' t think that af fects
the valid it y of the princ ip le of how I want to deal w i t h the
evidence.       If evid en ce is s p e c i f i c to en closure 4, then of
course we will take c ognisance of that..               If evide nc e is
speci fi c to something else we will take c o gnisance of that
as well, but we will be de aling with the evid en ce in resp ec t
of ever yb od y together.

     I have to remind you that an inque st is not a public
inquiry.   In another case which I happe ne d to have read
recently, Mr. Jus ti ce Woolf, as he then was, desc ri be d an
inquest as, "An inquiry in public, but not a pub li c
inquiry."    I thought that was a ra ther neat way of p u t t i n g
it.          '

         I do not expect, pa rt icularly as there has already bee n
a public inquiry, to repeat e verything that Lord Ju stice
Ta y l o r had done, but it is, I'm afraid, as I see it,
inevitable that we will be du p l i c a t i n g a ce rtain amoun t of
the wo rk he did.      This is bec au se it falls within, as I
perce iv e it, the purv i e w of my juri s d i c t i o n and also, of
course, because as I am sitting with a jury and as they have
to reach a verdict on the evidence, it is no use re lying
upon what was said fifteen, sixteen, eightee n month s ago
before somebody else.        Regrettably, or may be not, it
depen ds which point of view you take, there will have to be
some repli ca ti on of evid en ce of Lord Ju stice Tayl or 's
investigation.       Indeed, if you look at the Terms of
Reference and com pa re those with what the Coro ne r' s Act
says, you will see there is a quite r emarkable simil a r i t y in
places.                             .                  ■   .

      I have to remind you that in c o n t r a s t to a public
inquiry, witnesses in a Coroner's Cou rt have got certa in
privileges, particularly witne ss es w h o s e con du ct is li able
to be cal le d in question, and in p a r t i c u l a r they hav e the
right not to answer incr im in at in g questions.         I will be
de aling with this again when I open wit h the jury and
explain tnis to them in detail, but I want to take this
opport u n i t y now because it is an im portant po int to
understand and if one doesn't gra sp it then one tends, not
just in the H i l l s borough Inquests but in all inquests, to
walk away disappointed.

      Th e refore two things p r o c e d u r a l l y : witne ss es hav e got
privi le ge s which I will ensure that they are c o g nisant of
and if they wish to exercis e their rights then they are
entitled to do so.      Secondly, a c o r o n a l inquiry has got

                               -   7   -
limited objec ti ve s and again withi n       the best of             1 ity
we will try to stick to those.                                       "
                                                                       \\
         My present inten ti on is, as far as possible, to take\
the ev idence we will hear viva v o c e .     In oth er words, I am
g oing to try and get the witne ss es to come and give
evidence.^ We know alre ad y that that is not going to be
po s s i b l e in some cases.  At least one witne ss whom I h a d
thought about, though not ne ce ssarily deci de d on, has died.
Clearly we ca nnot take his evid en ce viva voce.        T h e r e ma v
be some others who, for medical or other reasons, are so
reluctant to come that X would think it only fair not to
call them.         However, we have a hug e pool, if I can use that
expression, of witn es se s and I think it will be possi b l e to
have the bulk of the evide nc e viva voce.        I think that is
pr eferable though maybe a little bit more time c o n s u m i n g and
certainly mor e expensive, but at least people will have
heard it by word of mouth.

     Shall I pause for a moment here and ask whe t h e r . I ha ve
made my self clear, w h e t h e r you hav e any queries on this
aspect?

      HR. KING:     Sir, I don't know whet h e r this is the time
to raise subm is si on s as to the nat ur e of the evi de nc e you
are going to call or the ambit of the evidence.           If I may
make my self clear, on the nature of the evide nc e I have a
number of su bm issions to make to you as to the use of the
Tay lor Report itself.

          THE CORONER:      ’ I will come to that in a moment.    I
a p p r e c i a t e that you did n' t know that, because I have not
dealt with it.

     MR. KING:    As to the ambit of the evidence, it may be
tnis is not for today at all, that is to say, the s t a rting
point of the events w hich you intend to i nvestigate and, if
I can put it this way, the  cutti ng off point of events.

     THE CORONER:     Yes, I am com in g to that as well.
Perhaps I had bette r car ry on for a little bit longer and
then turn to you becau se it may be that I may cover some of
the points which you have in mind or, indeed, oth er people
have in m i n d .

       In fact you bring me on to what I have called "Groups".
I take the view that, if you like, the c u t - o f f point for the
ev i dence is - I have selected as a ma r k e r the arri valT ^ - f t h e
first ambu la nc e on the pitch.    That does not mean to say^ we
will ne ce ssarily deal with every event up to that point, but"
it is a co nv enient mar ke r beyond w hich w h a t e v e r h a p p e n e d has
either been dealt with in April /M ay time, or is ou tside the
scope of my inquiry.      So if you like that is the end point.
          Now the begi nn in g is a little bit more d i f f i c u l t to
d e t ermine because one has to c o n s i d e r the events of the day
on the one hand, and to a ce rtain extent one also has to
c o n s i d e r possibly the previous oc cu rrences, be cause they may
have a relevance in ev al uating and a s s essing the e v i d e n c e
w hich is put before the jury.                              ---

       However, gener al ly in pr in ciple the way I look at it is
we are going to start, as far as the day is concerned, fro m
the outsi de and work our way inward.            The evidence w i l l
be come more deta il ed or, if you like, I will be ca lling more
witness es as we get closer to the events.              To take an
example, I may just call very briefly somebody's e v i d e n c e as
to traffic conditions, but I c e r tainly wouldn' t go into any
great detail.        It is really, as my co l l e a g u e in east Kent
said when he was d e a l i n g wit h the Z e e brugge inquests, it is
like a theatre.        You have got your staging, you ha ve got
some su bsidiary actors and you hav e got the main plot, but
it is difficult to u n derstand the ma in plot if you h ave not
got the staging, so you need to hav e a ce rtain amount of
i nfo rm at io n which isn't nece ss ar il y vital but w hich m akes
the whole thing mor e readily unde rs ta nd ab le .

     As I say, I intend to move from the outs id e in and as
we get nearer to the groun d we will be going into more
detail.

      I an ticipate call i n g evid en ce from supporters, if I can
use that term.       That will inclu de relatives, but with
regard to relatives I am going to be very - relatives who
qualif y in rny v i e w as witnesses and whom I co nsider to be
a ppropriate to call.      Certa in ly even if I felt a re lativ e
could give useful evidence, if he/she really felt they cou ld
not go through the trauma I would be very sy mp athetic to
that point of view.

     So supporters include relatives, friends.            V7hat I have
just said for relat iv es applies to them as well, a l t h o u g h to
a slightly lesser degree.      Other c o n tacts with the d e c e a s e d
and ’Others" - people who were there who di dn't n e c e s s a r i l y
have something to do w i t h the d e c e a s e d but who can tell us
somethin g about what ha ppened w h i c h I c o n sider to be
relevant to the purpo se of my inquiry.

      That   is the first group.

      The- second group will         be local   residents.

      The third gro up will be people           like shop ke ep er s   and   so
on.                                                  ^

     The fourth group will be what I call "Other
Independents".   I don't meant su pp orters aren't
independent, but I mean people who were either

                             -   9   -
profess io na ll y present or who may not even have been at         the
scene.     I will give you an example, med ia people, for
instance.

     Then we are goi ng to take evid en ce from clu b emp lo ye es .
People who were engaged with the club.      For example,
turnstile operators, stewards and peo pl e of that nature.

      The police, of course.       While I am on the s u b j e c t , o f
the police, there are in the case of a few p o l i c e , o f f i c e r s
and, indeed, at least one other person, statements w hich
were taken under PACE - that is under the Police and
Criminal Ev idence Act. • It is my normal pract ic e. at the
moment if I was dealing, say, with a road traffic incident,
that if there was such a statement from, say, the drive r,
that I would have that ei ther read or pl ayed on the a u d i o
tape.      I have deci d e d that I am go ing to do that in this
case as well, so we will hear wh atever is said in these
statements. ' I intend at the moment to use the audio tape
rather than to have them read beca us e then we hav e it as it
was r e c o r d e d .

      I have de cided that I will not ci rc ulate the list of
witnesses who I intend to call in advance.          The re are
several reasons for this.       The first one - I don't h a v e to
give you all the reaso ns but I will give you a few just so
you know it is not an ent ir el y arbi tr ar y decision.       Th e
first and maybe the mo st important point is this:           this is
an inquiry whi ch I conduct.      It is an in qu is itorial
procedure and not ad ve rsarial.       It is totally di ff erent, in
fact, to every other legal proce ed in g in England anyway.
There is in fact I       think - cer ta in ly the books tend       to
indicate that it is qui te proper not         to discl os e or
cir cul at e names, and I never do.     When I say "never", that's
a big word.     T here may be the odd exce pt io n when I have had
to let somebody see a stat em en t for very special reasons.
However, in principle, I don't and I don't intend to do it
in this case.

     Secondly, we h a v e n ' t got the capacity, even if I wanted
to do it, to deal with the c irculation of statements.        We
have got our work cut out in copin g wit h my needs.        I am
very lucky.   I have got what I suppo se for a Co roner is
quite a good sized     team, but we have to re member that Iam
just a Coroner, an     infe ri or court of record, let me     remind
you, and not an ything else.        The re are limits to what I can
muster, so I cannot do it from a prac ti ca l point of view.

     The third thing is that ci rc ulation of statements, we
did do it wit h the summaries.     As you may rem em be r we did
circulate tne summa ri es because we thought that would be-,,
helpful.     In fact to a cer ta in extent in some cases that,
bounced back on me.      People weren 't entirely happy that jthe
eviden ce w hich was giv en was not word for word what had been

                               10   -
sent o u t in the summary, which, was;:intended r e a l |;y ^                              a

 They may not r e c o l l e c t in detail what they sax<i and                   indeed
  thev may not recollect the events.                       It is likely that we
  will allow them to have a sight of their statement, a l t h o u g h

  would not normally do that.

         Uith regard to Lord Justice T a y lor's Report, if I can
    deal with thlt next.      I do not intend to admit that R e p o r t
    as part of the e v i dence at the inquests.    The only *ay
    could do tnat would be to read it m      toto, and I don t
    that would serve any useful purpose.

         Secondly I perceive It is going to c a u s e more p r o b l e m s
    than it is worth if I did that, so I don t intend to admit
    that.

            Similarly, I do not intend to use t h e _ t r a n s c E J p^
    the evidence at Lord Just i c e Ta y l o r s Inquiry.           Of course,
    I am fully a w a r e that, you will' have access to the
    transcripts as indeed: I have, and I wou ld n o t be at all
    surprised if you looked through them w i t h a view ter seeing
    w h a t oeoille h a v e said..    I would expect you to do that, and.
    I don t mind that p r o v i d e d your q u e s t i o n i n g is       n t to
    the inquests.         What I wo uld not permit is if, f o r instance,
    a u i t l e s s were to e x e rcise his ri ght not to answ er an
     incriminating que stions, I would not p e r m i t you           o p u t t0
     that witness quo tations from the transcripts so that in fact
     he could then e x e r c i s e his rights not. to answer that
     question, but in fact you had put what he had said.                    I am
     going to use commonsense .           I don t wan t to muzzle you.
     don't want to prevent you asking all p ^ o p e tr a n d l ^ xr          ™
     questions in o r d e r that at the end of the day as far as
     possible you will feel you h a v e had a fair chance, so to

 to brea ch w hat I hav e just said t h a t          we will hav
 some- of the t r a n s c r i p t s , but X think    it will be : S r i ? : .

      " D o c u m e n t s 3 y that. I mean bundles of doc um en ts , or
plans o r p no tographs or anyt hi ng of that sort - exhibits, if
you wish..      Bea ri ng in mind ( a ) we are dea li ng with
inquests, (b) with a jury and (c) that we are going, to h ave
our work cut out as it is with the numbe r of witnesses, I
want to res trict as far as I am able to the nu mber of -
documents whi ch are put in as e x h i b i t s ..’ There: is very
little point 'in hav in g hundreds and hun dr ed s of pages of
do cuments if the; jury c a n n o t absorb them.

      I am prepared to li sten to you on this point b e c a u s e            it
is a di fficult one, but what I have in mind, and I will
pause aft er this to enable you to come back on what I ha ve
said, is that if, for instance, we were to intr od uc e the
Green Guide, which is a docum en t which we won't be able to
avoid ref er ri ng to, we can intro du ce it as an exhibit.
However, I would not expect the jury                  to read the wh ole thing
from cov er to cover bec au se a lot of              it we don't need for
the inquests.      If,, you have a p a r t i c u l a r point on it w h i c h
you wi sh to make to a witness, then I wou ld expect you to
either pick that p a r a g r a p h out and read it, or I will read
it, or somebody will read it, or if we have alr ea dy d ealt
with it then we can just refer to it.                    So that at the end
what the jury will have in mind will be, say, ten para g r a p h s
out of the Green Guide.             Al so -with o t h e r documents.    There
may be other do cuments w h i c h we may need to refer to.
Therefore, at the end of the day they will have only to
think ab out those bits of the exhib it s whi ch are relev a n t to
us and not maybe fifty or sixty pages whi ch a r e there bu t
whi ch are totally u n n e c e s s a r y for o u r purposes.

     Is that reas on ab ly c l e a r wha t I am trying to say?         I
think it will be e a s i e r to do than for       m e to exp la in it.
Shall I pause here?        Mr. King,      hav e I dealt w ith some of
the points you had in mind?

   necessary, to hear a small amount of evidence re lating to
   them.                             '                        ^,

        Ob vi ously until you hea r the que st io ns you can no t m a k e
   your mind up, but I would wish to give notice, if I, can put
   it that way, tnat that is what I am instr uc te d to lay be f o r e
   you.                                            ,

         THE CORONER:          Can I tell you my vie w on that?               I was
   aware^ you might well be raising this point.                       I have alre ad y
   mad e it clear that I don't intend to re-op en all the nin et y-
   five cases.           Indeed, I have had c o r r e s p o n d e n c e from the odd
   perso n where they have rais ed matters. . If the matt er s are
   put to me and if wh en I have seen them,, if y our i n s t r u c t i n g
   solic it or s would c o m m u n i c a t e wit h me, if I feel that the
   point which you m a k e is - I will use the word justified,
   that is not intended to be rude at all - ju st ified and
   legitimate, and pr oper to be dealt with, then of co u r s e I
   will c o n s i d e r that sympat he ti ca ll y.      However, there may
   well be matters w h i c h may be ra ised w h i c h L feel have e i t h e r
   been adeq ua te ly dealt with, in w hich cas e I will say so, or
   alt ern a t i v e l y which I feel are outs i d e the scope of. the
   inquiry, in whi ch c ase I will also say so.

        I am not turning you down.        I am j ust rese rv in g              the
   position, de pending up on w h a t you a c t ually say.

        MR. KING:    Indeed.. Really, the purp o s e of my ri sing
   on that ma tter now was to give you for wa rd notice of it and
   to emphasise, becau se I know there are those her e h e a r i n g
   what I am saying, they are matters w h i c h in ev itably are dea r
   to the hearts of many people.

          THE CORONER:         I und er st an d   that.
     M R . KING: • Sir, mig ht I now address you on the c u t - o f f
point, as i t has been called, of the scope.                As I u n d e r s t a n d
Lt      “ ave i n d i c a t e d , sir:, you h a v e in mind the a r r i v a l of
the first ambulance, w hich is prob ab ly going to be s o m e t i m e
- I am g u e ssing now...

      THE CORONER:
.like that-

       MR. KING:    I have a s u b m i s s i o n t o ‘make to you w h i c h is
very neart felt held_ by :tho se I represent,, , a n d I w o u l d say
it is a matter that is very dea r to them, that it s h o u l d be
extended, that timing, to about four o'clock..               ■ I expl a i n
why.     A number of those who I re present are anxious that
there be an _i nquest into the nature of the m e d i c a l att e n t i o n
wni.cn was given to those who had been in the crushing, in
regard to the a l l e g a t i o n w hich c e r tainly they wish to m ake
and wis h to investigate,; that th e a b s e n c e of p r o p e r m e d i c a l
ca re facilities and att e n t i o n and technique, led to those,
cer ta in of them in any event, dyi ng perhaps when they m i g h t
not have die d at all or ce rtainly dying so oner than m i g h t
have been the case, and specifically the di ag nosis of w h e n
some bo dy had act ua ll y died.

          Sir, I know in sele ct in g your cut -o ff point - and I can
unde r s t a n d from hav in g read some c o r r e s p o n d e n c e on the
matter relating to it - that those are ma tters w h i c h yo ur
immediate feeling was you wer en 't goi ng to go into.
Cer t a i n l y rny subm is si on is they are relev an t to the "h ow" in
respect of the d e c eased here bec au se the time of d e a t h is
obviously of importance and how they di ed involves the
c o n s i d e r a t i o n of the at tention paid to them when perhaps
they were still al ive and that is a very relevant matter.

     THE CORONER:    Can I stop you there beca us e I think we
are ge tting into a legal submission.

  .       I have heard what you say.                  I don' t think it w o u l d be
right for tne to giv e a ruling on that be cause I would be
  reaching, if you like, the proce d u r a l as pects of this
meeting, except to say that obv i o u s l y I have, t h o u g h t about
this point quite a bit and at the m o m e n t I am not per s u a d e d
yet that I would want to go down that road.                         I have
reasons for it, but I don t. think I will deal with them.                            I
would not want to e n courage you to think I will ac tually
ac c e d e to that, but if you c o u l d just rem in d me be f o r e we
end that you have mad e this po int b e c a u s e it may be that
what we should do is hav e a n o t h e r m e e t i n g po ssibly be f o r e
the 19th, but a formal meet i n g of the inquest s proper, so to
speak, but withou t the jury, w here leg al po ints can be
d i s c u s s e d in a more c o n v e n t i o n a l way.

       Can we move on to you r next: point?

     wr itten - I think it      mus t be a     m o n t h ago.    I wrote to everv

     miss,,     any I apologise, but I have written to every singlet
     firm of solicitors that I was aware of spec if ic al ly                 I
     reque st in g them to name peo pl e who they wished me to
     c o n sider as witnesses.     I made it clear that the final /
                                                                                     J
     dec ision would be mine, but I did invite them to dra w my
     at te ntion to anybody     they wan te d  me to think about. You
     may be interested to       know that      I        think I have had five
     and       ’nt-hrnrf e ° I - J hem S? id they did not have any names
      nd t n e o t h e r two did put forward a few names.       T here may
     be six, but anyway, a very small number.

          If I can just come bac k to your point.     That
  opportunity has al ready been g i v e n and the mere fact I don't
  cir c u l a t e names does not stop you from telling me the names
  of people wno you want me to consider.

       MR. KING:   Sir, I a p preciate that,, and ever so gentl y

               the. o t h e r ma 11er is r e s e r v e d — but of c e r t a i n 'parag ra ph s
               which can be identified..               They are pa ragraphs w hich go to
               facts, not opinion, and they would curtail a lot of ar gument
               as to certa in events be cause they are there laid out very
               clearly and succinctly.

                       Sir, if I might draw an analogy.             I know this is an
               m q u i sition.   It is not a civil trial, it is not a crimina l
               trial , but in the civil li tigation which is now c o m plete a
               very useful de vise w h i c h e very bo dy agr ee d to was that it was
               agree d that the cote facts , sub ject to anybody's right to
               say, "I dispu te a pa rticul ar fact," wou ld be as set out in
               certa in numbered p a ragraph s w h i c h were giv en and h a n d e d in.
               Every one agreed it at the end of the day t o,approach it in
               tha t way and it pro ve d to be a grea t boon as a. setting, a
               base, upon which e v e r y o n e could oper a t e from, because, of
               cours e, of the d i f f i c u l t y of not wish i n g to be a Pub li c
               Inqui c y ­

                         Sir, I can only urg e again                              that perhaps         some
               c o n s i d e r a t i o n be g iven to that.

                      T H E CORONER:    O n e of the* reaso ns why I am relu ct an t to
               use the Re p o r t is b e c a u s e i t does not n e c e s s a r i l y follo w
               that it is accepted, o r that every p a r a g r a p h is accepted, by

     MR.. KING:;      Sir,:, if I could j u s t clarify the transcript
evidence, you would haver^no objection, as 1 understand: it,
witnin the rules you hav 6. la id down: a s to p r i vilege                 to a -
transcript b e i n g u s e d in c r o s s - e x a m i n a t i o n of a witness as
putting to him, if it be the case, a previous inconsistent
statement;

      THE CORONER:         Yes,    within certain limits.

      MR.   KING:      Yes,   of   course.

    .THE CORONER:   The d i f f i c u l t y is that the Public
Inquiry was done on, if you like, slightly different
premises from my powers, if you like, and also the wav I
intend to run these inquests and my main objective is to trv
and mase sure we do things fairly, w hich I am sure you would
want a l s o .                                         ' v,

w, i [1R*TK iNG:             Of course,, sir*   Sir, you w i l l be pleased
to know I have no o b s e r v a t i o n s on the documents because as -I
understand it we are going to feel our way through it, if I
can put it that way-                I commend that and one can make-
o b s e r v a t i o n s , perhaps, as it arises*

     Sir, m i g h t I just r a i s e one p i e c e of evidence w hich has
not been m e ntioned so far... E u nderstand there is a video
which is m    your possession,., sir,, of the events.          I don't
know to what extent you w e r e intending to use that video to
tne jury.

      THE CORONER:       I am glad you h a v e reminded me about
tnat.    in fact you     have reminded me o f          two things!  It is
my intention - r will g ive everybody else a chance as well.
At tne moment^ it looks as if Mr.. King has got sole rights
here, but I will com e b a c k to everybody, but if I deal with
him it may deal w i t h s o m e o£ the points w h i c h are in your
minds.                                                         3
                 There is w h a t is known as a. c o m p i l a t i o n video, which,
            was used in Lord Jus t T a y lor's Inquiry.            It is about, a. two.
    *     ' hour tape.   It is my present' intention' to use that, to show

.......    show sixty-seven hours, :o r h o w e v e r many hours there are,, but
           there is an awful lot of video footage.            It is of no
           benefit to iny jury o r to my inquiry and I don't intend to do
           it -                     \ .                   I .

                    Secondly, I have no facilities for providing copies of
           this video.       Normally speaking,, of course, if I take         ,
           evide n c e I prepare a trans c r i p t and if you want one you can
           have one, as ^indeed s o m e of you h a v e done.      You may say if
           you show the video that is exactly the same thing.             It is
           an exhibit and therefore I must prod u c e copies.          r have
           none, so I cannot — in fact I will not — produce copies for
           d i s t ribution to people o n request.        If that is not
           acceptable then I would rather not us e the video at all.             I
           think that would be u n f o r t u n a t e because I think it would
           help the jury and it would hel p everybody, indeed, if we saw
           it.       However, I do not have the capacity to set up a video
           duplicating organisation, so this would have to be
           understood by everybody.

                Does that raise                                  terrible problems                                 as far as you are
           concerned?

                 MR. KING:   Sir, from my point of view I am content
           w ith how you have indic a t e d - You will be pleased to know
           for the moment that is all L h a v e to say.

                         THE CORONER:                           Now if I w o r k my way down the line.

                     MR. CATCHPOLL:      Sir, I only rise really to echo Mr.
           King on o n e point: and that is in relation to the T a y l o r
           R e p o r t which c e rtainly from Sheffield Wednes d a y ' s p o i n t of
           view we feel could be beneficial,, both in saving time and
           dealing with some, matters tha t are: n o t d i s p u t e d -   If you
           are intending, sir, to i s s u e a general invitation for the
           parties to attempt to a g r e e certain paragraphs which may in
           the end form a u s e f u l basis to b e p u t to t h e jury, we would
           be very willing to take part in that.

                THE CORONER:             I h a v e go t no obj e c t i o n to that at all...
           I had assumed that that was going to present the parties
           with some c o n s i d e r a b l e d i f f iculties but if in fact I am
           mistaken on that, then of course if w e can save time and if
           we can have something w h i c h is agreed, then I have no
           objection whatsoever.                                              7            -

              MR., RUSSELL:        Sir, you. kindly outlined the c a t e g o r i e s
      of witnesses you w iLl jbe-calling..-^r^lthough; y o u have; s a i d
'   , y ° u w i U not be p r o viding a list of those witnesses, ar e we
      to. as s u m e that you will be calling witnesses from those
      categories in the o rder that y o u h a v e outlined them?             Is
      t h a t y o u r pres e n t intention?
        mmi



                                                             shopkeepers?:

            T H E CORONER:         No, not necessarily.   T h a t was pu r e l y a
     grouping.         What I would intend to do is to work from the
     outside in.             If, for example, I was dealing with the
     s urroundings of Leppings Lane, we w o u l d call some residents,
     w e would c a l L other groups, we w ould c a l l any supporters who
     had something specif ic to s a y on. that- « then we would, m o v e
     o u r way through the events, so to speak.             I do r e c o g n i s e
     t hat in many cases it is n o t actually possible to
     categorise.             You can't say, "¥e will only listen to this
     little bit and not to the rest."              If we call a sup p o r t e r
     he is going to wan t to tell us the story from A to Z, and
     quite rightly, because there is no way we could get him to
     c ome backwards and forwards across the Pennines just to suit
     tne c o n v e n i e n c e of a scheme which I have designed.

          However, there are some witnesses who will only give
     very restr i c t e d evidence beca u s e they don't know anything
     else, but we will try and deal with those as we go.               Th e
     order in wtiic'n I gdve them was not specific.             Itwas just
     the way I happened to w rite it down.          In fact     it is quite
     likely that for logistical reasons we m i g h t well start w i t h
     local people in the m o r n i n g and h ave pe o p l e who are coming
     from a d i s t a n c e later on in the day..    In other words, I
     will be guided not by their category, b u t by the c o n v e n i e n c e
     and timings of w here they live and so on.

              Does   that help you at all?

               MR- RUSSELL:.     T h a n k you for that c l a rification. The
     o t h e r matters are perhaps matters I could raise at any
     s ubsequent meet i n g if there is to be a further lawyers' .
     m e e t i n g at w hich matters of law are, going to be canvassed.
     They deal with two matters my learned friend Mr. King has
     raised.         One of them relating to the matters arising from
     what he has termed the m i n i inquests, a d d i t i o n a l matters
     that lie wishes to have put-             Wha t concerns me, my first
     reaction, is whether and to what e x t e n t those matters are
     going to be c i r c u l a t e d to the o ther legal representatives.
     It seems to me a p p r o p r i a t e if he is going to supply you with
     s pecific questions fo r you to ask the witnesses, which is
     w hat I understand he wishes to do, w h e t h e r those questions
     should be m ade pu b l i c to o t h e r representatives so that; w e

                THE^CORONER:        Can you see any objection to my
      c i r c u l a t i n g a list to all of you of your respective names
      and addresses and references?             I don't suppose any of you
      w ould object to that, so we can do that.

              I hear what you say.      I think the question of the...
      Undertakings, I think, are risky in these inquests.             It is
      not for me to say what undertakings anybody should give,, but
      obv i o u s l y I will conduct the inquests and take w h a tever
      ev i dence I think is appropriate, w h i c h e v e r way it turns out,
      so to speak.         My job is to make an inquiry into the deaths
      of these unfort u n a t e people.

               MR. ISAACS:         Sir, may I ask you to clarify two points?
      The first relates to the Taylor Report, b e c a u s e as I
      un d e r s t o o d what you said at the outset, the T a y l o r Report
      was not to be used at all, save i n s o f a r as my learned
      friends and myself and o t h e r colleagues might actually agree
      cert a i n facts.        T h a t ma y or may n o t prove, something that
      can be done.           Assuming t h a t that c a n n o t b e done, h o w f a r do
      you b e l i e v e you will a l l o w the use o f the T a y l o r Report at
     ■all?                                                      ,Y ....

               As I say, as I u n d e r s t o o d it at the outset, it was not
     going to be used, but then I n o t i c e d when my learned friend
     Mr. King.was a ddressing you briefly, the impre s s i o n I
     c e r t a i n l y got was that you were g o i n g to a l l o w the
     t ranscripts to be used for c r o s s - e x a m i n a t i o n purposes, w h i c h
     was c e r tainly no t s o m e t h i n g I u n d e r s t o o d at the outset and
     w o u l d be something w hich - and I leave this to a n o t h e r time
     - I w ould make submissions against.

           That is the first point, sir.            T h e second is this, and
      it is a relatively m i n o r m a t t e r and relates to the video

                                        - 21 -
         evidence.               Y e s , the v ideo will un d o u b t e d l y b e shown if th e
         c i r c u m s t a n c e s are r i g h t , and that is as I un d e r s t a n d y o u r
      "v" present pos ition.                 W ouId you clarify t h i s : * as I u n d e r s t a n d
          i t you w o u l d not intend ,that the video be shown du r i n g - the



                                                                                                               '0.

* '   ’   ^principle?theiahswer;to., t h a t ,is yes. *_,_.We w o u l d look a t the (                     -
           video and that would be it. ' However, I have to b e a little
           bit c a r e f u l with regard to this response because I can
           c o n c e i v e of a situation w h e r e a p o i n t i s raised and w h e r e it
           w o u l d be infinitely, q u i c k e r and easier to resolve it by
           looking a t t h e video.              I would not give an u n d e r t a k i n g that
           we w o u l d not look at the^ video at other times.                 I w ould
           s e e k to a void it..         T h e purpose of. the video is to giv e the                  j
           jury an overview, if that is the correct word, of w h a t                                   /
           h a p p e n e d ande in o r d e r f o r them to b e able to u n d e r s t a n d ;
           b e t t e r what the w i t nesses are: saying.          It is an aid r a t h e r
           than anything else, but it is not inconceivable that one
           m i g h t want to look at the odd snatch of video.                  Indeed I
           can tell you now, in one or two statements which I h a v e read
           the video is referred to, o r part of the video is r e f e r r e d
           to, and it may well b e nec e s s a r y to look at it b e c a u s e you
           w o u l d not be able to u n d e r s t a n d the statement otherwise.

                  MR.   ISAACS:        We are very grateful for that.

                 THE CORONER:    However, the last thing I want is to
           spend hours and hours r e -running videos and assessing
           ruinutiae on it.   We wan t to h ear the people viva voce as                          is
           c onventional.

                     N o w the other point w h i c h you raised regarding L o r d
           J u s t i c e Taylor's R e p o r t and in p a r t i c u l a r the transcript, I
           m ust confess I do find this quite a difficult problem.                       Wha t
           I was trying to say is this:              it would b e foolish of me to
           a ssume that you don't h a v e the transcripts and that non e of
           you are going to look at them beca u s e I am sure you are all
           g oing to do that, p a r t i c u l a r l y as you no d o u b t ha v e g u e s s e d
           some of the witnesses a r e inevitable.                     We hav e got to call
           them b e c a u s e they are key players, shall we say, in this
           matter.           In that, sense it is unavoidable, as I see it,
           that people will use the transcripts to prepare their c r o s s -
           examination.

                     W ha t I am not very keen on doing is (a) I cer t a i n l y
            will not allow the t ranscript to be used to put things to
            people so that one puts them in the position w h e r e they say
            they will not answer the question.                  If I have put it to
            them that it is an incrim i n a t i n g question and they h a v e           ]
            e xe r c i s e d their p r i v i l e g e not to answer, then I will not     '

   o p p r e s s i v e inaeaa

            THE CORONER:      I take y our point*    I think that, is: a
   very fair point and I agree.            I am not saying that no
   witness will ever be recalled, because if' you r e m e m b e r those
   of you who were here at the interim inquests, we did r e c a l l
   w it n e s s e s even in that instance because things o c c a s i o n a l l y
   c ome up w h i c h we had forgotten or a point is mad e w h i c h on
   refl e c t i o n we ought to h a v e explored.   It may be that I
   will have to recall witnesses from time to time, but I
   accept your point.          I think it is a very valid o n e and in
   pri n c i p l e I agree with you.      I entirely accept that these
   inquests are going to be pretty hard on everybody, not least
   the w i t n e s s e s .

           MR. ISAACS:   The only point that perhaps I ought to
   make, one can under s t a n d why witnesses should be r e c a l l e d         to
   e l u cidate some point that had not been raised at the time
   when he or she g a v e •e v i d e n c e , but that is quite dif f e r e n t
   from asking a witness to stop at some stage and then come
   back.

             THE CORONER:    No, that wasn't my intention.               What I
   was trying to say was that if, for example, we have a local
   resident who can only give evidence as to what h a p p e n e d
   o u t s i d e the ground, di d n ' t go in, then obviously w e will
   stop at that point w i t h him b e c a u s e - t h e r e is noth i n g more he
   can say.         However, if we have a s u p p o r t e r who was there and
   then he went into the gates and so on, w e w i l l listen to all
   of it and ditto w i t h officers as fa r as they are concerned.

              HISS NORCLIFFE:          Sir, just the o n e point.      W e di d
    previ o u s l y send to you. o r dra w to y o u r a t tention a n u m b e r of
    items of d o c u m e n t a t i o n w h i c h the Chief Constable w o u l d like
    to be before the jury and we hav e previously asked for
    p e r m i s s i o n that that, be the case.         That wasn't, done, sir,
    on the basis that the jury would be expected to tak e them
    away and read them from c o v e r to cover, but t h a t they s h o u l d
    be u s e d to dip into as and when required.

         THE CORONER:    Yes,, that is right.            In fact you sent
    me I think volume 3.     I cannot remember your volumes 1 and
    2 at the moment so it is d i f f i c u l t f o r m e to an s w e r this,
  but it s e e m s to me if w e could agree, if you like, a b u n d l e
  ® . papers,; o r three bundles, w h i c h are the ones we are
  likely to want to dip i n , and that is a good w ord b e c a u s e
’ that is w h a t I want.              I d on't w a n t the jury to h a v e -to
  peruse thousands of pages, o r hundreds even, of d o c u m e n t s ,
  b u t :if we have a c o n v e n i e n t way of ha v i n g before us
  documents w h i c h are agreed in the sense they- a r e ’ r e l e v a n t

         MISS NORCLIFFE:       Sir, does t h a t mean that a c t u a l l y at
    this s t a g e we have got p ermission to p u t before the jury...

        TH E CORONER:     No, not quite, b u t you are p u s h i n g me
   towards that.      I want to think about this a l i t t l e bit
   further because my original intention was to go the o t h e r
   way and to m a k e you p r o d u c e e a c h document, or e a c h page, as
   and when you wanted to us e it.             W h a t you are really a s k i n g
   me is to allbw you to produce it in advance a n d then to dip.
   It may b e — ■I am inclined to t hink at the m o m e n t t h a t m i g h t
   be a better way but I want to think about it a little bit
   further.

            Has anybody got any                 thoughts on that?

            MR. ISAACS:      It would be nice to know, sir, what
    doc u m e n t s my friend is referring to and then perhaps...

          T HE CORONER:  I u nderstood we had all had copies
    b ecause that is what you said in your letter.

             MISS NORCLIFFE:         Sir, if I can explain what they were.
   Volumes 1 and 2, and there were three volumes r e f e r r e d to
   you, w ere in fact the South Yor k s h i r e Police Inquiry volumes
   1 and 2, submitted before the P u b l i c Inquiry.           The S o u t h
   Y o r k s h i r e Police submitted something called " B a c k g r o u n d
   m a t e r i a l , and then volumes 1 and 2 w h i c h were just
   documents.           They were. Standing Orders, briefing n otes etc.
   Vo l u m e 3 that^has been referred to by the. C o r o n e r is a mini
   core bundle, if I c a n c a l l it that, documents w h i c h the
   C h i e f Constable considers are r e l e v a n t which a l L p a r t i e s
   have had access to,, either from the P u b l i c Inquiry o r from
   the r e c e n t civil c o n t r i b u t i o n proceedings.

        THE CORONER:     So what you are saying is there is
   nothing n e w in those documents.   The lawyers ought to know
   about them.

             MR. KING:      Sir, what w o u l d be h e l p f u l - we may k n o w
   all about them if we k new w h a t she was talking about.                    Sir
   as a very gentle s uggestion again w h i c h was c e r t a i n l y                ’
   a d o p t e d at the P u b l i c Inquiry, we started o f f w i t h ev e r y b o d y
h a v i n g t heir own s e p a r a t e bundles    and    then h a l f way    through
c ore bundles were produced.

     TH E CORONER:     We d o n ' t want to do that.                   Either we
start w i t h single sheets o r a g r e e d . ..

         MR. KING: ‘ That was my o p e n i n g , -s i r , to c o m e ’ to the
sugg e s t i o n to you that if by the time we m e e t again it may
jtot;|be§agreeable as p e r f e c t , ' b u t - i f a c o r e b u n d l e , ' o n e or.
two bundles perhaps, w e r e b r o u g h t t o g e t h e r w e c o u l d e a c h '
c o m m e n t on it, m a k e r s u g g e s t i o n s a b o u t w h a t might be
intro d u c e d or arguments as to w hat might be taken out, and
we could just have those in core bundles.

       THE CORONER:           Yes,   Miss Norcliffe?

     MISS NORCLIFFE:         If I could just the point that there
has been no attempt at not letting the parties kno w w h a t
these were.   It was d e c i d e d that in the first i n s tance
those documents w ould be put to you for you to look at and
if you thereafter at this, m e e t i n g said no documents
whatsoever, then c i r c u l a t i n g bundles to every o ther party
would not have been a p p r o p r i a t e beforehand.   That was the
reason why this part i c u l a r thing has been done.

          THE CORONER:      Can we leave this question of d o c u m e n t s
for the time being?            I have got to take a d e f i n i t i v e
d e c i s i o n and to a ce rt a i n extent I h a v e d e f e r r e d one or two
of those decisions until after this m e e t i n g beca u s e I wa n t e d
to hear what you thought as well as you to hear what I
thought.

          The only thing I would say wit h regard to d o c u m e n t s is
that we are going to need, o b viously any d o cuments w h i c h are
put, there has to be eno u g h for the main r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s .
T h e r e hav e got to be at least four copies for the jury and I
think it is only fair I should h a v e a copy as well.                Don't
p r o l i f e r a t e documents b e c a u s e I think we worked it out we
will need twenty copies if we wer e going to cover a d e q u a t e l y
the needs of these inquests.

           Y e s , anything else?

           MR. JACKSON:     Just to come bac k on the u n d e r t a k i n g s
 point.           Perhaps my use of the w o r d "un d e r t a k i n g s " was
 unfortunate.           What I had in mind was p r ecisely wha t I hope
 we can do, and agree certain s t a t e m e n t s wi t h i n the T a y l o r
 Report from my clients' point of v i e w insofar as they relate
 to the criticisms of L i v e r p o o l supporters.             We are
 c e r t a i n l y happy to liaise with w h o e v e r on that point.

           My second and      third points come         from the stand p o i n t
 o f ...
        THE CORONER: _ May I just say the d ifficulty about that
is that if I am going to call one h u n d r e d witnesses, it is
very di f f i c u l t for solicitors, indeed anybody, to give
und e r t a k i n g s as to what they will say, and this is a
problem.            I would not be very happy about shutting
w i t nesses up in the mid d l e of a s e n t e n c e if what, they a r e
saying is relevant to my inquiry.                    I think that is a
problem when I was looking at you about giving undertakings.
It is a very major p r o b l e m for you as the solicitors for the
supporters.            It is easier for the o ther parties, but it is
a very m a j o r d i f f i c u l t y w h i c h you hav e got and I am not
quite sure ho w we can reso l v e it at the moment.

     MR. JACKSON:   We will o b v iously have to wait and see
what people are prepared to agree before we make any further
comment.

     Secondly, sir, from the v i ewpoint          of a client who may
be looking at these inquests from afar            and coming in.       Am I
right in thinking there will be a list            available perh a p s
three days in adva n c e of wit n e s s e s who   will be called?

      THE CORONER:      That is what I am hoping for and of
c ourse if I am per s u a d e d by the arguments of your coll e a g u e s
you may get an even fuller list sooner, but certainly I °
would want to try and give a three day p r o v i s i o n a l l y war n e d
list, so to speak, so that you would have some idea of who
was coming.    Not their statements, but their names and, if
you like, category - supporter, friend or whate v e r it m ight
U •

     MR. JACKSON:   My final point is a question:               whether
there will be a daily transcript available.

     THE CORONER:       I am coming    to the transcripts       in a
moment.

    _ Before I move on, we are taking a bit longer than I had
anticipated.    I am sorry a bout that but I think we m i g h t as
well press on and deal with major items today.             Mrs.
McBrian, yes.    You mus t shout b e c a u s e o t herwise I can't
hear y o u .

     MRS. MCBRIAN:   I am c o n c e r n e d very much about the
point, the cut-off point, where you say you are going to
take no evidence after 3.15.        I think the most important
thing that day is...

          TH E CORONER:      No, Mrs. McSrian, I have got to stop
you.          I know it sounds un f a i r because I haven't stop p e d the
others, but you are mo v i n g into what I call the q u e s t i o n of
evidence.             In fact w hat you are saying is you want me to
r e c o n s i d e r the cut-off point?


                             - 27 -
      HRS.   MCBRIAN:     I would        like you   to do   that.

     THE CORONER:    Yes, OK.     Whe n we next meet for legal
submissions then you can a r g ument at that point on the p o i n t
of law.   Forgive me, I realise this is difficult for you,
Mrs. McBrian, because you are not a lawyer.         On the o t h e r
hand, if you represent yourself you have to be treated as if
you were one and so I have to apply exactly the same, if you
like, rules to you, even though it is harder for you.            At
the next meeting when we are arguing points of law, then by
all means if there is a legal point on which one can a r g u e
that I am w rong about the cut-off point, then let it be
argued.   If, having listened to the argument, I am
persuaded, then of course I will hopefully say so.         If I am
not persuaded I will also say  j so
                                 - - and we
                                         .. _ will have to a c c ep rp t
it because that is how it is.       Have I made that clear?

      MRS.   MCBRIAN:     Yes.

      THE CORONER:       Was    there s o mething else,       Mrs.   McBrian?

      MRS.   MCBRIAN:     No.

     THE CORONER:   I am not trying to be unfair to you
because I^know it is very, very dif f i c u l t in the c o n t e x t of
this meeting and anyway legal points, but I have got to try
and be fair to the others as well.

     What I was going to say was are there any other points
on the procedural aspects which you need to raise?    I am
not talking about legal points.    I want to stick to
procedure as far as I am able.   Right, I hope I have
succeeded.

          Transcripts, somebody raised it.             It is my i n t ention
to have next day transcripts, so each day's proceedings
should be a v a ilable first thing next morning.               T here are
two things about it.               I would like to know, and I d on't
need to know this minute, but I would like you to write to
me as soon as you possibly can and let me know whether you
a n t i c i p a t e want i n g transcripts beca u s e we have to plan ho w
we are going to prod u c e them and we need to know in round
terms how many we want.               Secondly, it is going to be a
jolly expensive exer cise for you b e c a u s e transcripts, as you
know, you get a bill from the city, and it is expensive, but
that is ho w it is so you have got to think hard.                   I am not
asking you to waste your money.

          If you know you are going to want a daily transcript
then o b v iously tell me.        If there are some of you who say
you d on't want a daily transcript but there may be the odd
o c c a s i o n w here you may want a day's transcript, then
i n d icate that to me as well and we will do our best to
oblige.           However, what we will not be able to do is to have

                                - 28 -
a sort of industry w here on very short notice we will b e
able to c ough up a transcript.      I want to be as h e l p f u l as
I can on this.    I want you to u n d e r s t a n d that we are
intending to have them available because I want them for a
start.    They will cost you money unfortunately, or
fortunately, it depends w h i c h way you look at it.           Is
that clear?

     MR. MANNING:   Sir, normally if the court is p r o d u c i n g
a transcript there is a cost for the production and then
that is split between the numbers of persons who want an
individual copy.

       THE CORONER:   What we do...             Well,   I will think a bout
it.    We will write to you.

          MR. MANNING:         Sir, if you are going to request the
copy, it may be that all we were involved in would be the
p h o t o c o p y i n g charge which, of course, w ould be much m o r e
palatable.

     THE CORONER:   But even that is expensive, as some of
you know who have had transcripts from the interim
proceedings because it is laid down in the Coroner's C opy of
Documents Regulations 1988, w hich no doubt you will look u d
when you get home.

          S o m ebody asked me in one of the letters how long these
inquests will take.                Well, your guess probably is as g o o d as
mine, but we are planning to start on the 19th November.                        We
intend to rise on about the 18th or 19th of December.                         I do
not think we will have finished by then.                        If it is obvious
we are going to finish with a day or we will carry on for
another day or two, but I think it is unlikely.                       We will
then probably resume on the 7th of J a n u a r y and carry on
until we finish.                  Now there are problems, of course,
beca u s e if we have illness, p a r t i c u l a r l y amongst the jury,
we may have to adjourn.                   It depends on the type of illness
                          c o u r s e > give u n d e r takings that no-one will
fall ill.             Hopefully not, but this is a question w h i c h is
u npredictable.             Secondly, of course, I can't say h o w long
you ladies and gentlemen are going to be w i t h your cross-
e x a m i n a t i o n or, indeed, your legal submissions so I am in
the dar k to a certain extent as far as that is concerned.

          I am going to t r y , as far as I am able, to g roup
w i t n e s s e s so that people who are saying similar things are
c oming at the same time which I think will speed things up a
little bit.                                                    6 F

      I.cannot tell you how many w i t n e s s e s we are g oing to
have either, but I would be s u r prised if it was less than
were c a l l e d at Lord Just Taylor's Inquiry, which was 174, I
think.       It would not surprise me if it isn't more.        That

                                - 29 -
doesn t mean to say they will all be               lengthy,   but   I exp ect
there will be quite a few witnesses.

     Any comments on length?   I don't suppose there is much
one can say, is there?   I am very conscious, of course,
that it is difficult for all the families, but it is also
going to be very hard for the jury, but I don't know w h a t I
can do about^it.   I have thought quite hard about ho w to do
it and I can t see any way round it, other than the way I am
tackling it.

         Perhaps I should just mention another thing about
timing.          On the 28th of November we        cannot      use the Council
Chamber because          there is a Council meet i n g and X have h a d to
agree not to be there.           Similarly, it may be that on the
Gth D e c ember we       will not be able to use the Town Hall and
the 9th of January is another Council day when we will
de f i n i t e l y not be able to use the Council Chamber.        Our
intention is to start on the 7th but obviously as we get
nearer the time we will think about it a bit harder.

          I am considering, although I h ave not take a d e c i s i o n
on this yet, that on the 28th if might be worthwhile,
provided we can arrange it, to take the jury out for anot h e r
site visit for a little bit longer and let them see the
s u r r o undings and e v e r y t h i n g else. Perhaps Mr. Cat c h p o l e
you could check with your clients w h e t h e r they would be
w ill i n g to allow us to come?

         MR. CATCHPOLE:    I a m c e r t a i n t h e y would be w i l l i n g    to
a llow    it at your convenience, sir.

          THE CORONER:        That would mean we weren't totally
w a s t i n g the time and it might be of benefit to the jury to
see the^ground again and to refresh their memory.             I know
things nave changed a bit because some of the barriers have
d i s a p p e a r e d and so on, but that is just how it is.   .

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   C e rtainly my instructions are                 that      the
ground is available at any time you require it.

     TH E CORONER:   Tha t ' s very kind of you.               T h a n k you
very much indeed.  We will let you know about                 that a little
bit nearer the time.

       I have dealt with          the dates w h e n we can't sit.      If we
do the visit, and I am            hoping we will be able to sit on the
6th of December, it is            only really the 9th of J a n u a r y when
we d e f i n i t e l y will not   be able to sit, and, of course, there
will be another day in            February if we go on that long, but I
hope not.

     I Do intend to call a few experts right at the end.                          I
have not yet formalised my thinking on this so I can't
really tell you more than the fact I will be calling a few
experts to deal with special things, but you must r e m e m b e r
that even the experts, their evidence is going to be
r estricted to what is relevant to an inquest.     I am sure
you all appreciate that aspects, say, of civil aspects - I
know the civil matter has been done and in that sense I am
lucky.     Very often what people want from an inquest is the
a m munition for the civil trial, but that does not seem as if
that is going to be necessary.     However, we still h a v e to
take into account that we don't deal with civil aspects as
such.

       Listing.I think I have already dealt with to a c e r t a i n
extent.      It is going to be difficult.      We will do our best
to m i n imise i n c o nvenience and to make things as sensible as
we can, but I am afraid that witnesses are going to h a v e to
be prepared to be shifted around at relatively short n o t i c e
because it is so hard to predict how long any p a r t i c u l a r
person is going to be giving evidence for,but we          will learn
from experience as we go along.

     As I have already said the inquests are public so the
press will be there.      We know that from last time.       T h e y are
not here today because I didn't consider this an a p p r o p r i a t e
meeting for thereto be here at.           They are not, hopefully,
going to report it and you should not discuss it either
because what I am very c o ncerned about is that when the jury
comes together again it is they who reach the verdict.               It
is not I.   It is c e r t a i n l y not you and it is not even you
up there, it is the jury that has to make its mind up on the
facts and I want as far as possible to ensure          that that
happens.

     That is about it, as far as I am concerned.   Shall we
start again with you, Mr. King, and work our way round, just
in case there is something?

     HR. KING:  I have no further comments now, sir.             I am
happy to know we are going to have a further meeting           for the
legal points.

     THE CORONER:    Oh, yes, I had written it down and I had
forgotten it, the order in w hich you gentlemen and ladies
will be asking questions of witnesses.         As you know I start
off in an inquisition and ask whatever I want.         Strictly
speaking, it isn't a perso n ' s witness, but if somebody
represents a particular witness, he asks questions last.
Everybody else asks in w h a tever order I decide, but I would
prefer, I think it was done in Lord Justice Taylor's set-up,
that you agreed amongst yourselves in what order you wanted
to bat.   I am quite h appy to be r e asonable about that.
Not only am I quite h appy to be reaso n a b l e about it, you
will probably have already noticed I tend to go round and
then I start again at the b e g inning because although one has

                             - 31 -
to draw the line somewhere I want everybody to feel that
they haven t been prejudiced beca u s e they have gone first
and something has occurred.   D o n ’t feel that if s o m e t h i n g
occurs to you, within reason I am a m e n a b l e to allow a n y t h i n g
r e asonable to be asked.                                      ”         6

          MR.   KING:    I have nothing else.

          THE CORONER:     Anything else?           No.

      Now if we turn to the point on another meeting, it
sounds to me as if there are going to be various legal
s ubmissions which have to be made.            We could do those on
the 19th, but then we lose a jury day, so to speak.              If it
is ag r e e a b l e to you there is no reason why I should not
decide to commence the inquests - if we met on Friday, the
lbth, and I think we will meet in the Council Chamber,
ihat will be a formal session so if you like the inquests
will c o m m e n c e on the 16th, but with o u t the jury being
present, simply and solely for legal submissions.            We can
deal with those.          I can give you any rulings or I can think
about them over the weekend.          On Monday morning when we
start wit h the jury we can get straight into that.             Is that
convenient?          Mr. Isaacs?

         MR. ISAACS:        I hesitate to say it is inconvenient,
sir, but perhaps I speak on behalf of some of my learned
r n e n d s who, like myself, have c o m m i t m e n t s and whose
co m m i t m e n t s have been arranged so that the inquests will
start on the 19th.            For rny part I would much prefer to be
making such submissions as have to be made and to be
listening tothe submissions that are going to be made,             on
the first morning.             I appreciate what you say, sir, about
the loss of a jury day, but in the context of inquests that
are going to last seven to eight weeks, perhaps one day is
not going to make that much difference.

          THE CORONER:     What does    eve r y b o d y   else think about
tha t ?

          MR. RUSSELL:        I would like to endorse what my learned
friend has just said.             It is very reasonable, e s p e c i a l l y
those of us who have clerks with diar i e s and have sought to
a c c o m m o d a t e the start date on the 19th.

     THE CORONER:   In other words, what you are saying is
that you have booked the 19th, but if we bring it forward it
is going to make it awkward for you.   That is what you are
saying?                                             3


          MR. RUSSELL:    Sir, yes, but subject,           of course,   with
c h e c k i n g with our respective offices.

discover tne evidence is coming out in such a way there is
really no need to hear fifty people.                One of the

1 t^ nk h S Jif say in§ something w h i c h may be of interest so I
would not delete them just for the h e c k of it.       However
neit h e r would I want to waste their time or our time in *
r e peating things.    Hav e you any views on the r e v ision of
any c i rculated list downward?     Of course, I might also add
names upwards.                                        6

            KING: Sir, that would be eminently sensible and
if I may say so one of the advantages of a list is that we
can all apply our minds the whole time it is p r o g r e s s i n g as
“ ' K 00f d ° ™   llst as t 0 >      that group of w i t n e l ses
could in effect become agreed evidence."    That w ould be
entirely sensible.

     THE CORONER:      Does anybody d i s agree with Mr. Ki n g ' s
comment.   No.  Well, that does make it a little bit easier
for me because I was a little bit concerned, maybe from
experience, that a n y t h i n g that is pub l i s h e d becomes law and
I would not want that.

      MR. CATCHPOLE:      Sir, could I just add that one of the
advantages that we cer t a i n l y see of hav i n g a c o m p r e h e n s i v e
list is that there a large number of us who have a c t u a l l y
seen a lot of the wi t n e s s e s that you may wish to call.               We
have had that benefit and it may be that we could say, as a
sugge s t i o n obviously, only to yours e l f that there may be
somebody else you might like to c o n s i d e r calling, or that as
things progress we could prune it down.

   _ THE CORONER:      Tha t is right.           That is one of the
points of Mr. King.        I wanted to tackle it the o ther way.
  wanted you to tell me who you wanted but I can see it does
create a problem because you have got to double-guess me, so
to speak, and I can see that.          It is a valid point and I
will c e r tainly very s e riously c o n s i d e r the point you have
made.                                                        J

     Mrs. McBrian, is it all clear to you?   Well, it may
not all be clear to you but is there anything you wan t to
say on tnese procedural aspects?

     ^1RS* MCBRIAN:  Does it mean that we all wait until the
19th for you to make a decision as to what time the evidence
is to be heard, and the quarter past three?

        T HE CORONER:       No, I can tell you this.   We will
almost certainly start with e v i dence on the 20th.           However
on the 19th we are starting so you should be there b e c a u s e ’
in the morning we will deal with legal submissions.                In the
aft e r n o o n I will deal with anything I want to say to the
jury and anything that is agreed w h i c h we can put to the
]u r y ^ j     the" we wil1 Probably start with real e v i d e n c e on
       2Uth*      That m a y be videos, you see.   We may use the


                               - 34 -
afternoon for the videos but I have got to look at that                      and
do some sums and decide h o w best to use the time.

        MRS. MCBRIAN:   So it will be the 19th that you d e c i d e
when    the evidence will be heard?

        THE CORONER:             D e finitely   the 19th,   exactly as yo u hav e
been    told.

     MR. KING:   Sir, I think you have perhaps m i s u n d e r s t o o d
the question.   I think the lady is asking:   is it the case
that it would only be on the 19th that a decision will be
made as to the ambit of the cut-off time?   In other w o r d s ,
that that is when the decisions will be made?

          THE CORONER:             Yes, Ibeg your pardon,      I did
m i s u n d e r s t a n d you.      T h a n k you, Mr. King.

        That is correct.    O b v i o u s l y I have h eard what you have
said and so I will probably be thinking about the m a t t e r
b etw e e n now and then but I will want to listen to legal
submissions o n _that^point on the 19th.             I will then, in the
light of what is said,      and also any further thinking w h i c h I
have done, take a view      onit.             I think we will leave it
like that, so the answer is there is no decision on that
today.

     MRS. MCBRIAN:                So we would not be able to p r e p a r e   any
witnesses about this              until the h e a r i n g begins?

     THE CORONER:    That is true, but then we are talking
about inquests w hich will last at least five weeks and
probably eight, and maybe even longer so there is g oing to
be quite a bit of time to do a d d i t i o n a l work.

     If I were to change my mind on this, on the cut- o f f
point, if I were to     decide I wanted to alter it before that
date, then I would let you and e v e rybody else know, but I
don't want to e n courage you to think I will do that.      There
are strong reasons for     saying that.     It is not just
obstinacy.

     OK, ladies and gentlemen, I think that is it.          I am
most grateful to all of you being here.         I hope it has been
of use and that we have made a bit of progress.          It is
going to be a very dif f i c u l t inquest, I'm afraid.   We will
just have to do the best we can.

        MR.    KING:        T h a n k you,   sir.

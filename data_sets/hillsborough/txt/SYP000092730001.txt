               being     partially       blocked          by bodies          laying across               it,    this    proved       very

               difficult.            Other     officers         climbed through the gate and over                            the

               bodies     to t ry to ease the                 p r o b 1ems     from the b a c k .

               I continued at that                 location t ra nsferring                  bodies and           people     through

               the g a t e and onto            tms^ pit c h , try i n g to            r e vi ve     a    n umbe r of     people,

               until     I became aware             tha^the          perimeter          fence       had been        cut and      pulled

               away,     gaining access             to the V r n a c e .            1 then entered the stand and

               a s s is t ed   in passing         b o dies      from the terrace                to officers            on the

               Pe rimeter       track.

               Whe n all       the    bodies      had h e e K r e m o v e d       from the          ground.         1 resumed         to

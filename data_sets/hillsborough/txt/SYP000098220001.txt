Mr Woodward

I realise that your address will be already prepared and I appreciate, too,
that seme of these points are minor, but Chief Superintendent Wain would
never forgive me if I failed to keep the paper flawing in his absence*.

Thoughts arising frcm reading the submissions :

1.   SYMAS                 Already forwarded.

2.   TREASURY COUNSEL      i) p.3 para 1 and p.32 para 7 criticiseslack of
                            leadership at restate - Superintendent Greenwood
                           gave quite forceful evidence of early organisation
                            (Transcript day 12 p40 - 42)
                            (ii) p.12 para 2 - futile for the Police to
                            suggest the club had a responsibility for the
                            safety of the fans on the terrace -
                            It may be arguable (given the evidence) but surely
                           not futile. Our arguments are well known.
                            (iii) p.16 para 3 - Many died elsewhere than by
                            the failed barrier -
                           We have not heard this evidence. We contend that
                            the vast majority died as a result of the barrier
                            failing, otherwise, how does one account for
                           discrepancy.
                            iv) P.21 para 1 - "We suspect that...an
                            indication by a Police Officer to a ticketless
                            fan to go away would suffice" -
                            Our experience would suggest otherwise.
                            v) p.34 para 11 (apropos SYMAS submission),
                            "...we doubt that any delays in seeking medical
                            aid and a sufficiency of ambulances made any real
                            difference (to the deaths which occurred)"

3.   FOOTBALL SUPPORTERS   i) p.13 - it is alleged that the South Yorkshire
     ASSOCIATION           Police had a statement frcm ex-Sergeant Higgins
                           'before the Inquiry started' which described the
                           blocking of the tunnel in 1988.

                           This is untrue. Stat. obtained 2.6.89 during the
                           third week of the Inquiry. It was retained to
                           clear up an ambiguity. An additional statement
                           was obtained on 8th July 1989 (Higgins had been
                           working away in Newcastle) and the 2 statements
                           handed over to West Midlands.
               ii) p.14 - It is said to be 'unfortunate1 that
               PC Smith, a perimeter track officer, was absent at
               lunch until 2.50pm.
               Mr Jackson is ignoring the well established
               evidence that Smith was replaced by PC Helliwell
               during his refreshment break.
EASTWOOD       i) para 32 - "raison d'etre for radial fences was
               controlled filling of pens" -
               The objective was segregation. This is important
               because Eastwood's submission goes on to allege
               that the cause of the tragedy was a failure to
               comply with that policy.

F.A.           i) para 10 - Confuses the issue of pen filling.
               Confusion arises out of misinterpretation of a
               league match operational order which states a
               requirement to "ensure pens are filled in
               accordance with direction frcm control* - This
               relates to filling of pens in terms of segregation
               not in terms of capacity.

BEREAVED       No points.

CITY COUNCIL   i) Counsel appear to have reached the unilateral
               decision that Barrier 124A failed because of
               "gross overloading" (eg p31 para 1) -
               The question of how, why and, indeed, when the
               barrier failed has still to be determined.

FIRE SERVICE   i) p.l para 6 - It is suggested that Chief
               Superintendent Duckenfield was aware of the need
               for Fire Brigade by 1504 (they were actually
               called at 1513) Such a suggestion relies upon a
               particular interpretation of Mr Duckenfield's
               evidence to the Inquiry. He did say that it was
               apparent that people were having difficulty
               getting out of the pens at 1504 but it does not
               automatically follow that he appreciated the need
               for specialist equipment at that time.

                 HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER INQUIRY

Lord Justice Taylor, who will conduct the Inquiry into the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster, will be assisted by two
assessors - Professor Leonard Maunder OBE BSc PhD ScD FEng
FIMechE, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University
of Newscastle-Upon-Tyne, and Mr Brian Johnson QPM, Chief
Constable of Lancashire. Counsel to the Inquiry will be Mr
Andrew Collins QC and Mr Alan Goldsack.

On 28 April, Lord Justice Taylor will hold a preliminary hearing
at Sheffield Town Hall at 11.00 am. The purpose of this will be
to hear applications on behalf of those who wish to be
represented at the oral hearings and to give directions as to
the procedure to be followed. He also hopes to announce the
date on which the oral hearings at Sheffield Town Hall will
commence.  Those intending to apply on 28 April to be
represented at the oral hearings are invited, if possible, to
notify the Secretary to the Inquiry in advance:

The evidence to be considered for presentation by Counsel to the
Inquiry is being gathered and collated by the West Midlands
Constabulary, under the direction of its Chief Constable,
Mr Geoffrey Dear QPM. Mr Dear is responsible direct to Lord
Justice Taylor for the conduct of the police inquiry.

Anyone who has information bearing on the events on 15 April is
invited to contact West Midlands Police. A Freephone number for
this purpose will be announced shortly.  Alternatively,  they
may contact the Secretary of the Inquiry at the above address.

Apart from oral evidence, Lord Justice Taylor will consider any
written submissions bearing on his Inquiry. These should be
sent to the Secretary to the Inquiry.

    ADVERTISING FOR ORAL EVIDENCE

    Please see suggested copy below. If it is intended to take
    evidence from anyone who has any relevant information        (eg
    contractors or manufacturers of crush barriers) this advertising
    should be carried in the national dailies.

    Arguments against using the nationals are that are cost (COI are
    pulling out the figures for me) and quantity of replies in the
    short period allowed.

    Local press (Liverpool, Nottingham, Sheffield, London) has the
    disadvantage that it may suggest to people we are not interested
*   in evidence arising from outside those areas.  There is also the
    problem that people affected lived in several parts of the
    country, and we would not reach them all. On the other hand,
    those papers could be reached for under £9000.

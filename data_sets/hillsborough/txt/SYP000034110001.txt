Hr K Dalglish’s loudspeaker announcement


Commences
15.56.04      "Hello hello, excuse me, this is Kenny Dalglish."

15.56.09      Pause - speech unable to define.

15.56.18      "Really appreciate it if you can co-operate with the Police.
              ............... Co-operate with the control people."

15.56.21               Unable to define due to crowd noise.

15.56.31      "Thank you for your co-operation."




This schedule should only be treated as a guide to what Mr Dalglish actually
said.  It will require further detailed scientific examination of the tape in
an attempt to recall in full what was actually said.

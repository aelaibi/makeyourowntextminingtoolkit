            After       the    initial         brief i n g at Woodall            Police Post             I took / u p a static

            The    flow of traffic, from                  the N o t t i n g h a m fans went              quite w,e 1 1 and     our

            l o c ation was subject                to very few problems,                 and my          colleague     and   I were

I saw that a large                 number         of fans    had been drinking and were                        very

hostile       towards myself and PC S T E V E N S a n d H o                      the Police           in general.

Wh i l s t at     this     location        both PC WHEAT,             PC S T E V E N S and myself              were

by these        supporters.            Most       of the    physical       abuse           c o nsisted of

one   of the most             inti m i d a t i n g    situations        during my Police                service.

At 5prn ( 1700)          PC S T E V E N S and myself             resumed       patrol         and at 5 . 1 0 p m

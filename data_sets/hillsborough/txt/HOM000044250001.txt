               STATEMENT O N H ILLSBO RO U G H SCRUTINY


I am writing to let you know that I am making an oral statement to the House at
3.30pm on the Hillsborough stadium disaster.

Last year, on the 30 June, I announced that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith would be
conducting an independent scrutiny on this matter. My statement will formally
publish his report and I agree with its conclusions. I will put this on the board in
the normal way.

In advance of that I am enclosing a copy of the judge’s report which I am
publishing this afternoon.

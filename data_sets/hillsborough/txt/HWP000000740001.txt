        Dear Councillor Spriggs,
        R«?J Working Party Meeting -.Friday 16 June 1995
       I regret to advise that due to short notice and other
       commitments, myself or Phil Hammond are unable to attend the
       Working Party meeting scheduled for Friday the 16th.
       we are aware of some of the strains and difficulties that
       currently exist regarding item 7 on the agenda - "No Last
       Rights", as part of the Hillsborough project.
       You are already aware, but for the avoidance doubt, we would
       like to stress that the HFSG represent the interests of the
       majority of the families bereaved in the disaster.
       As in all democratic organisations, individual families are
       free to take what action they wish, in their own name or as a
       group of say five families (as those who sought a judicial
       review). Our purpose in writing to you is to place on record
       the position held by the HFSG/its membership.




 CHAIRMAN                                      SECRETARY                            TREASURER

    I would like to make the following points:
    1.    The   report was commissioned from Edgehill College Centre
          for   Studies in Crime and Social Justice by the City of
          Liverpool.
    2.    Clearly, therefore, copyright/intellectual property
          rights are in the ownership of the City of Liverpool.
    3.    Professor Phil Scratton was appointed the Project
          Director and he enjoys the full confidence of the HFSG.
          Indeed, his work is well respected and he has spent many
          hours not only researching the report but assisting
          families in many other ways.
    4.    We have had the opportunity of seeing the latest draft of
          the   report and in principle are in full agreement with
          it.    Any minor errors or omissions would be dealt within
          the   normal way by us reverting back to Professor
          Scratton.
    5.    We are aware of the current difficulties, and your
          attempts to resolve them, but we are very concerned that
          the publication of the report may become "bogged down".
    We have noted your intention to hold smother meeting in July
    to consider any matters arising from the 16 June meeting and
    also to discuss correspondence received byyour goodself from
    family members. Naturally, we will attend that meeting if
    possible, but wish to table our views "in absentia".
    We trust that the meeting will allow the report to move
    forward and that the recent problems can be overcome. We
    reserve the right to appeal to Full Council should the Working
    Pairty be unable to resolve any more difficulties.
    Yours sincerely.



    Trevor Hicks

    Dear Sir,

    Hi31sborough

    Wq are acting on behalf of the chief constable of South Yorkshire
    in civil proceedings which have been brought by the families of
    persons who died in the Hillsborough stadium disaster on
    15th April, 1989.

    At present, there are two lead actions which are intended to
    provide a basis for dealing with the liability issues in most of
    the claims and, on Thursday, 26th October at Manchester High Court,
    there is to bo a pro-trial review before Mr* Justice Rose,

    Wo a.re given to understand, that you have instructed the West
    Midlands Police to conduct an inquiry into the overall circumstances
    of the. Hillsborough disaster, with a view ultimately to considering
    whether criminal charges should be brought against any person,

    As we understand it, at this stago, no individual has been either
    charged or interviewed under caution, nor has the inquiry been
    announced to bo in rospect of any particular person*

    So f a r as the civil proceedings are concerned, a public undertaking
    has boen given on behalf of th<a Defendants that they will co-operatc
    .in bringing the civil actions on for trial as soon as possible.
    That undertaking was given prior to the publication of the interim
    report of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry and prior also to the
    announcement from your office of. the institution of a criminal
    inqu.t ry.



•                                                                     *                                                /.., contd,

Whilst we have no instructions in connection with any possible
criminal charges, nor indeed any instructions on behalf of specific
individual Police Officers, it occurs to us that in the light of
tho case of DPR Futures Limited ((1989) 1WLR 778] that some
prejudice may be caused to any individual - Police Officer or
otherwise - subsequently charged with a criminal offenco if either
a civil trial takes place before cmy criminal trial is concluded,
or indeed if civil interlocutory proceedings take place in open
court, as wc believe may be the intention, on 26th October,

Wo write to bring this matter to your attention so that you have the
opportunity of responding to the issues raised if you consider this
appropriate.

        forward to hearing from you and, as we have also written
today to the Assistant Chief Constable of the West Midlands in
connection with another matter arising out of the civil proccodings,
       ,t lC: liberty of enclosing a copy o£ that letter, in case this
should bo referred to you for advice.


Yours faithfully,

D®ar Sir,

Hillsborough

Further to previous correspondence, we have been given to understand
by the Health & Safety Executive, who presently have custody of the
broken barrier 124A, that no access to the barrier and, in
particular, no taking of samples is to be permitted and that any
enquiries in this connection are to be referred to yourself.

as you know, we are acting for the Chief Constable of South
Yorkshire in the civil proceedings and one of the issues in tha
case is whether the barrier failed whilst under a load leas than
the load which it oufjht to have safely carried,

whilst our Engineer can make some estimates about this on the basis
of a physical inspection of the barrier, which he has carried out,
no final report can be prepared for use in the civil proceedings
without some samples being taken and metallurgically tested.

As you may be aware, there is a pre-trial review in the civil
actions at Manchester High Court on Thursday, 26th October before
Mr. Justicc Rose. At that stage, we may be called upon to indicate
when we anticipate having expert evidence available and, indeed,
when we are able to consider a number of other points which depend
upon the availability of. that evidence.




                                                                                                                   /... contd

     We wonder if you arc in any position to indicate at this stag*,
     that is to say before 26th October, if possible?


           1.    Whether those with a legitimate interest in the
                 civil proceedings may now take appropriate samples
                 from barrier 124A?

            2,   If not, can any prospective date be given when
                 such samples might be available?

     as we are today writing to the Director of Public prosecutions on a
     separate matter, we are taking the liberty of copying this letter to
     the DPP.

      Dear Sirs
      HILLSBOROUGH
      Your faxed letter dated 20 October 1989 addressed to the
      Director of Public Prosecutions has been passed to me for
      reply.
      With regard to the question of possible prejudice and the
      D.P.R. Futures case, it is our view that, on balance, no
      application to stay civil proceedings needs to be made.
      However, the Director would be grateful to receive an
      undertaking that the Judge dealing with interlocutory matters,
      at any stage,be referred to the DPR case so that he may be
      alerted to the problem,if necessary making orders restricting
      publication of sensitive or potentially prejudicial matters.
      The same would apply if the civil trial itself were to precede
      the Director's final decision.
       With regard to the request made to the West Midlands Police
       for samples to be taken from barrier 124A for metallurgical
       testing. There is no objection to such samples being taken
       providing the following undertakings are first given in
       writing by each party
       1.       When samples are taken and when tests are carried out
                wherever they occur a representative nominated by the
                Crown Prosecution Service is to be present.
       2.        Photographs are to be taken whenever samples are obtained
                 and copies provided to the C.P.S.
        3.       All reports and data are to be provided promptly to the
                 C.P.S.




                                                         Telex 945310 CPS HQ                                    Brltdoc DX2328 Victoria

    Please would you be good enough to liaise on the above points
    with either myself or Mr Michael Kennedy in this office.

    Yours faithfully

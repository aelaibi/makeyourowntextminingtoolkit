                                                           MR. FLETCHER

             Q. And quite clearly there were other rescue operations going
                on?   A.  Probably so, yes, sir.

             Q. And what was lacking was any form of co-ordination between
                the various services that had arrived there to help?
                A.  That's correct, sir.

             Q. It was also apparent, was it not, Mr. Fletcher, that there
                were two areas where injured persons were being treated -
                one at the back of the Leppings Lane Terraces and the other
                in the gymnasium area itself?   A.  I never saw the back
                of the Leppings Lane Terraces.

             Q. You did not?   A. No.  I only dealt with what I saw on
                the pitch and then I went into the gymnasium to the
                casualty holding area there as well, and then liaised
                with the ambulance at that stage.

             Q. The Ambulance Service had set up their area in the
                gymnasium area earlier, and that is where they were
                treating the injured and the dead as well? A.   Yes.
                I saw two particular ambulancemen - well, paramedics -
                who came in, and there were various doctors in that area,
                but all we did really was comfort them and give them
                immediate first-aid and then try and get a priority as
                to who needed to go first, from the doctors there.

                    . Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you, Mr. Fletcher.

                            Cross-examined by Mr. WOODWARD:

             Q. Mr. Fletcher, did you know that there was a semi-final
                on that afternoon?   A.  Yes, sir.

             Q. Was that beause of your general awareness of things
                happening in Sheffield or some specific note that was
                on a Fire Service memo?   A. Well, you follow football,
                don't you?  I follow the results.

             Q. Is there a practice of the Fire Service being acquainted
                with major events that may be happening on a particular
                day?   Can you help us?   A. Certain ones, certain ones;
                not specifically a football match or a semi-final.

             Q   Not a semi-final?   A. Well, yes and no.  We would be
                 told for the simple reason of traffic problems, if
                 nothing else, but not because of the specific risk of
                 semi-finals;  because of the traffic problems passing
                 the ground.

             Q. It may be relevant for a number of reasons, one because
                of the effect that it would have on your efficiency of
                movement in and around the area? A. That's correct.

             Q. And also because it might, of itself, be a focus of
                potential difficulty or attention?   A. Well, it never
                has been.  It's never been a particular risk that we have

                                                     MR. FLETCHER

             considered to be worth any special treatment.

        Q. When there is an event that merits some special treatment
           or special consideration by you, what is the procedure?
           Do you have a liaison officer at the event, or what?
           A. What would probably happen is that our Division would
           deal with that.  The supervisory officers on Division
           would probably meet with the Police and probably the
           Ambulance - I'm not sure, because i t ' s n o t something I
           have done - and they would certainly discuss it with the
           Police and take appropriate steps there;       have an action
           plan, probably.

        Q. Have an action plan?   A. Yes, if the Police thought it
           was necessary from the risk.

        Q. Or if the Fire Service thought it was necessary?   A. Well,
   #       it isn't our jurisdiction really, is it?   We are there
           for fires; we are not there for such as a civil accident,
           if you like.

        Q. The endeavour is to try and be constructive - do you follow?
           In relation to an event like this, it would seem that
           there were problems of communication, people not knowing
           where things were happening?    A.  Yes.

        Q. And once actually on the ground, you were having to explore
           around and find where the focus of attention was? A. Yes.

        Q. If there is a large event taking place in which you have
           an interest, does the Fire Service sometimes have a liaison
           officer on site during the event?    A. There was only one
           particular time that I've known it, and that was the Bruce
           Springsteen Concert at Bramall Lane.

        Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: The what at Bramall Lane?
             A.   The Bruce Springsteen Concert at Bramall Lane, sir.

        Q.          Mr. WOODWARD: And what was the reason for that?_
             A.     I think it was because they built structures within
             the ground.     I am not 100 per cent sure,bee ause I didn t
             deal with it, but I think they built structures within
             the ground.      They were going to have a lot of people
             and they probably thought it would be worthy of some
             attention.     I think it was the first one at Bramall Lane
             as well.     I stand corrected, but I think it was the first
             o n e , so they probably thought they would want to be there
             to see how it ran.

        Q. May I ask you about one other matter? Your means of
           contact, communication, was radio with other officers?
           A.  That's correct.  We had a hand-set as well as the
           radios in the appliance.

        Q. Did you have any problems of communication? _ A. For a
           very short time, which I put down to Mr. Swain going to

                                                            MR.FLETCHER

               make pumps up and to our drivers getting changed, but
               that is correct, yes,that is the only difficulty I had.

          Q. The difficulty was because of loading, was it?    A. No.
             I think Mr. Swain had had a lot of information given to
             him when he arrived and he had gone back      to   thepumps
             and the policeman   came out and said that    he   had gota
             major incident outside and he wanted resuscitators.    So
             I think he wasn't listening to his personal radio because
             he had gone to do a specific task; and our two drivers,
             who would be the other people on the radio with me, would
             be getting changed at that stage.   So that is why I didn't
             get through.

          Q. Your problem of getting through was that there was nobody
             to hear you?   A.  That's correct.

                    Mr.WOODWARD:   Thank you.

                           Cross-examined by M r . MULL E R:

          Q. Would you just have a look at this document?   (Handed to
             the witness). Is     that the kind of document, as it
             comes to you from the computer, indicating where to go?
             A.  That's it exactly.

          Q.   That is indeed exactly the one that    went     out, I do not
               know whether from your station ---      A.      That's correct.

          Q. But that is the one that goes to every station?          A. That's
             correct, y e s .

          Q.   And that gives information - just refer       to it, if you
               would - that you have to go to Penistone      Road - is that
               right?   A. Yes, that!s correct.

          Q.   And that is where you go?     A. That's correct.

          Q.   Unless you are told something to thecontrary on        the way
               to the fire?   A.  That's correct.

          Q.   Or to whatever the incident may be?     A.      That's correct.

          Q. When you actually got there, this is an event taking
             place, of course, during the course of the day? A. Yes.

          Q. Did you know, when you were going to a football ground,
             that there would be police officers there generally in
             control of the situation?   A. Yes.

          Q. In those circumstances, did you or did you not expect that
             there would be a police officer there to receive you at
             Penistone Road?   A. Yes, I would.

          Q. And when you got there, all those of whom you enquired
             knew nothing about it?   A.  That's correct.
                                65



                                                  MR. FLETCHER

Q.    Then, just taking it a bit further, when you met with
     no success in asking the officers, as far    as the
     ambulances were concerned, did anybody seem to be
     organising that?   A. Yes, there was.     I saw later,
     in actual fact â

Q. No, I am talking about that time, because you have told
   us that you took some part in creating a casualty clearing
   area?   A. Y e s .

Q.   What I am asking you is why you did that? A.Because
     there was no-one else to do it.

Q. So at that time did it appear to you that the ambulances
   were not going to the right place, or what?    A. Well,
   I didn't know the situation as regards the ambulances.
   I presumed that they would be in attendance but I didn't
   know where they were.   In actual fact, they told me
   afterwards that there were six parked just round the
   corner from where we ---

Q. That is afterwards.   I am not worried about that.   At the
   time ----    A. I didn't know the whereabouts of any
   ambulances, no.

Q. I am just trying to get it clear what it was that motivated
   you to set up a casualty clearing area in the area which
   you have indicated.  What was it?    A. Because there was
   nothing happening on the pitch.   Well, as far as I could
   see when I walked round there, there was no concerted
   effort - there were no stretchers moving at that time,
   I'm pretty sure ---

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    There was no what?   A. I'm
     sorry,there were no stretchers moving at that time.

Q.       Mr. MULLER:   That is why you set up the casualty
     clearing area?   A. As we walked down, it didn't seem
     as though there was a concerted effort to move the injured
     and dead, and that's what I tried to do.

          Mr. MULLER:   Thank    you very much.

                    By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Q. Can you just help about this? You say that when you got
   there, there was no need for cutting equipment by that
   time?   A. That's correct, sir.

Q. Because presumably the people had been got out of the Pens?
   A.  Yes.

Q. If you or somebody    had been able to get cutting equipment
   there, how quickly    could you have cut through the kind of
   wire mesh that you    saw there?    A.   About a minute per
   panel or something    like that.
                                  66




                                                         MR. FLETCHER

    Q.   Pardon?   A. Probably a minute for     a panel     or something
         of that nature.

    Q.    And how     would     you have done that - with wire cutters or
         what?      A. Looking at it with hindsight ----

    Q.   You saw     the wiring, did you?      A.   Yes.    I would probably
         have used bolt cutters.

    Q. Bolt cutters?   A. Bolt cutters.  If we had used any of
       the other equipment that we had got, the Hurst power
       equipment, and cut through the stanchions, you are in
       danger of the whole lot coming on top of the operators.
       I have gone through a lot of things that I might have
       done. I may well have put ropes round the top and cut
       the top and pulled it down.   I don't really know, but
       I would probably have had more than one effort going on
       at the time.  I would probably have used the bolt cutters
       and ropes as well.

    Q. At any rate, a panel could have been got out in about a
       minute, you say?   A.  I would have thought so, yes, sir -
       something like that.

    Q. Presumably bolt cutters do not require very skilled
       operation?   A. No.

    Q. They operate in the obvious way?        A. That's correct.

    Q.   So that if bolt cutters were available at the ground,
         it ought to be possible to get them to the  scene and
         at any rate clear a gap in the fencing within a couple
         of minutes?    A.  That's correct.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, thank you.

              Mr. GOLDSACK:   Mr. Hornsby, please.  Sir, whilst
         Mr. Hornsby is taking his place, can I indicate that
         after the next two witnesses, we propose to take the two
         Mr. Lloyds, as they have come from Liverpool.  We are
         anxious to get them away, sir.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, very well.

                           A. D. HORNSBY, Called
                           Examined by Mr.GOLDSACK:

    Q. Mr. Hornsby, I think you got to know about this incident
       at about halfâ past-three?  A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Were you in fact on duty at all?        A. No, as a matter of
       fact, sir, I was off duty.

    Q. You got a call at home, did you?        A.   Yes,.sir.

                                                 A. D. HORNSBY

Q.   Did you make yourway tothe ground immediately?         A. Yes.

Q.   To which end did you   go?     A. Penistone Road.

Q.   Did you expect to be the senior officer there on     your
     arrival?    A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And you would have known,  would you, by that that some
     of your colleagues would  have been there for ten or 15
     minutes before you?   A. That's correct.

Q.    So what did you see your  role as at the time you arrived?
     A.   I saw my role as ensuring that all rescues had been
     carried out and to establish a liaison between the Police
     and Ambulance.

Q. Now, you went at a fairly early stage, I think, to the
   gymnasium?   A. Yes, sir.

Q. Was there any particular reason for going there? A. When
   I arrived at the incident, I was informed that the
   officer in charge from the Fire Service point of view,
   Lockwood, was at the gymnasium, so I went over there to
   get briefed from him and to see the situation myself.

Q. Was there any other reason for going to the gymnasium at
   that stage?   A. No, sir.

Q. Had you become aware of a South Yorkshire Ambulance Service
   document that in the event of an incident such as this,
   the gymnasium would be used for casualties?    A. No, I
   hadn't, sir.

Q. You established contact with M r . Lockwood? A. No,not at
   that time.  When I arrived at the gymnasium, Mr. Lockwood
   was not there; Mr. Robjohns was there.

Q.   All right.   So you established contact    with one ofyour
     officers?    A. Yes.

Q. Did you also shortly thereafter speak to the senior
   ambulance officer  that you could.find?   A. Yes, Mr.
   Hopkins.

Q. Was that a general enquiry of him as to what, if anything,
   he wanted the Fire Service to do by way of assistance?
   A. Yes, it was, sir.

Q.   And at that stage did theAmbulance Service require your
     specific assistance?  A. Nothing specific was said;
     just to carry on as we were.

Q. I think you then made contact with the Police?        A. Yes,
   si r .

Q. Whereabouts did you first make contact?   A.  I went to
   the Police control box and there was a Superintendent there.
                           68




                                            A. D. HORNSBY

Q. That is the control box where the usher is indicating,
   is it?   A. Yes, sir, above the ground.

Q. Did you know where that was before you got to the ground
   that afternoon?   A. Yes, I did.

Q. Do you know who it was you saw th e r e ? A.  It was a
   Superintendent.   I think it was probably Mr. Murray,
   but I don't know.

Q. Can you help as to the time that we have now reached when
   you came to the control box?    A. I would think it would
   be round about quarter-past-four.

Q. And at that stage was your main purpose a general enquiry
   as to what, if any, further assistance was required from
   your Service?   A.  That's correct.

Q. Had you by then been given any explanation from anyone
   as to what actually had happened?    A. Yes.  When I
   arrived at the gymnasium and tried to ascertain from
   Mr. Robjohns what had happened, he was a little bit unsure,
   so at that point I was told that there was a local Police
   Station actually on the ground, so I went there to ascertain
   from them what had happened.

Q. The one under the North Stand?   A. That's correct.  I
   also used the telephone and passed a message to our
   Control to inform the Chief Fire Officer of the situation
   at that time.




                                /Q.   Just tell us briefly

                                       A. HORNSBY


Q. Just tell us briefly, what were you told by the Police?
   - A. At that time they were a little bit unsure.  They
   said that three barriers had collapsed, that was all they
   knew.

Q. And that information from someone in the Police loom under
   the North Stand at about what time? - A. That would be,
   I think, shortly after 4 o'clock, about 5-past-4.

Q. You were given someindication, were you, of the anticipated
   number of casualties? - A. I could see that for myself,
   sir. Most of the casualties had already been taken to
   the gymnasium.

Q. Well now, Mr. Hornsby, you have helpfully attached to your
   statement the various lists of equipment which the various
   tenders that were despatched by the Fire Service carried
   as standard equipment? - A. Yes.

Q. I don't propose to go through those.  They are there for
   people to see. Can I just ask you about one matter that
   you referred to "Special resuscitators suitable for
   dealing with crushings"? - A. Yes.

Q. I think at the time of your statement you were making
   further enquiries into those? - A. That is correct.

Q. Have you received any further information about those
   since? - A. No, we have not, sir.

Q. You carry of course resuscitators as part of your normal
   equipment? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it your belief that there might be some specialist
   equipment specifically for this type of injury? - A. Yes.

Q.    But you have not so far come across   such equipment being
     on the market? - A. No, I haven't.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What you had was oxygen, was
     it? - A. It was sir, yes.

Q. With a mask? - A. Yes, but slightly different from what
   the St. John's Ambulance described.   Ours will force
   air into the lungs until it meets resistance and then
   it allows the air to come out naturally.

Q.   So yours does help, if not entirely    take over breathing?
     - A. Yes, it does.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

Q. Just on that last point please, Officer, in fact the mask
   which accompanies this type of resuscitator forms a seal
                                70


                                        A. HORNSBY


     over the nostrils and the mouth? - A. Yes, it does.

Q. It has to be an airtight seal? - A. Yes it does.

Q. And thus it has to be operated by people who know what they
   are doing? - A. Yes.

Q. As you have described, it forces oxygen directly into the
   lungs from the patient until such time as the lungs start
   operating for themselves? - A. Correct.

Q. I think you have a Motivus and a Maxaman which is similar
   to the Miniman that the Ambulance Service carry? - A. Yes.

Q. You said you were unaware of the SYMAS Operational Plan
   for Hillsborough.  Were you aware please, Officer, that
   Assistant Divisional Officer Rowlands of your Service
   attended a meeting on the 9th August 1988 together with
   the Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Mr. Hopkins and the
   Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer Mr. Jones and also
   Superintendent Marshall, Superintendent Murray, Chief
   Inspector Beal and Inspector Sewell? - A. I was not aware
   of that at the time of the incident but I have been informed
   of that since.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I have got Hopkins, Jones,
     Marshall and Murray and Sewell, but who was it from the
     Fire Service?

           MR. KALLIPETIS:  It was Assistant Divisional Officer
     Rowlands, my Lord.  This is all to be found in the Police
     Bundle, Tab 15.

Q. At that meeting, Officer, it was decided, confirmed rather,
   that the gymnasium would be the rendezvous point for the
   Ambulance Service and the gymnasium would be the treatment
   room for the casualties and also temporary mortuary if
   such were required? - A. I understand that to be the case
   sir.

Q.    As one other Officer has already pointed out, in situations
     like this the Service with the overall organisation of
     course is the Police? - A. That is correct.

Q.    In   that connection at the bottom of your statement, page 1,
     you    refer to a visit that you made to the Police Control.
     Was    that the Control Box up between the South Stand and
     the   West Terraces? - A. That is correct.

Q. And you spoke, I believe, to an Inspector there.  Is that
   right? - A. No, that is not correct.  He was a Superintendent,
   sir.

Q. Do you know who it was? - A. As I said, I think it was
   Mr. Murray.
                                  A. HORNSBY


Did you also tell us who he told you was the Officer in
charge of the operation? - A. Yes, he did.

Mr. Jackson? - A. That is correct.

Not Mr. Duckenfield? - A. No, he said A.C.C. Jackson and
he was in the middle of the field.

      MR. KALLIPETIS:   Thank you very much, Mr. Hornsby.


             Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Hornsby, you are aware that the Ambulance Service had
a Liaison Officer at the match, are you? - A. Yes.

In relation to large gatherings of people at a big event
in such a large stadium as this, has it ever occurred
to the Fire Service that it may be helpful to have a
Liaison Officer there as well? - A. The only thing I
can say, sir, is what Mr. Fletcher said, that we have had
them at the pop concert but it has never really been
considered other than that.

The reason for the pop concert we understand from the
last witness was because there may have been some temporary
stands which had a particularly flammable quality? - A.
That is correct.

So is this the situation, that the Fire Service's attention
is really concentrated upon fire rather than anything else?
- A. Fire and means of escape sir, yes.

Well if means of escape is important and you have so many
thousands of people present, would it be a drain on resources
and of no value, first of all would it be of no value to
have a Liaison Officer present at such an event? - A. Yes,
I think it would be of value.

Can you explain why in your view it would be? - A. I think
from this point of view:  I think if we had have had a
Fire Service Liaison Officer in the Control Box, I think
he would have insisted on the Fire Service being called
immediately they thought that people were trapped and
he could have given the detail of the equipment and probably
exactly where he wanted the Fire Service to respond to.

What you are saying is that the perception of a Fire Sirvice
Liaison Officer at the event would be tuned in to Fire
Service capacity, facilities and ability to respond and
he would be able immediately without having really to think
about it, by second nature to say specifically to the
Fire Service how they could help and at what specific point
and in what manner with what appliances? - A. Yes.

It would avoid difficulties of communication through computers,
wanting to have specific passwords or formulae followed? -
A. I think you have asked two questions these.

Yes, I have, more than that. - A. The point about the computer,
I would like to come back to that later on if I may, yes it
would avoid that.

All the intermediate thinking and the expectation of people
who are not tuned into the Fire Service would be cut out
by having that there? - A. Yes.

That would enable a quicker response; a more accurate response
without the frustration of people who are not Fire Service
people being involved? - A. Yes sir.

You wanted to say something about the computer? - A. Well
I just wanted to make a comment about it. The inference is
that the system we have got is something a little bit too
exacting from the point of view of mobilising but the system
we have actually got is almost an identical system to what
most other Fire Brigades have got in the country, so that
almost all Fire Brigades would ask for the same information
that we asked for.

      A point was made when our Control Operator was questioned
this morning by I think it was Mr. Hytner about the fact he
hoped that it would not happen in Manchester City.

      At lunchtime I took the point to ring Manchester up
and they would mobilise exactly the same as us and ask for
exactly the same detail.

      MR. WOODWARD:    Thank you.

      MR. HYTNER:  To set Mr. Hornsby's mind at rest, I was
merely observing if the same system were observed in
Manchester, the Manchester City Ground would be on the
computer since the road is the name of the ground but Old
Trafford would not be.

      May I take the opportunity of saying this to Mr. Hornsby
since he is here and he felt there was some criticism, that
in the very many statements we have got there are not only
no criticisms but many spectators volunteered the view that
the Fire Brigade were magnificent.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes, Mr. Muller.

      MR. MULLER:     Sir, I think it would help if you would
look at Tab 15.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes.

                                      A. HORNSBY


Q. I will read it to you, Mr. Hornsby.       What it says on the
   second page it says:

          "Following discussions with the Fire Service
          Officer it was agreed that the fire service
          would attend by the quickest possible routes
          direct to the immediate scene of any fire and
          as such no rendezvous points or pre-arranged
          routes could be determined.

          The main points raised, in relation to the
          fire service, were that it was imperative that
          the Police Control give the exact location of
          any fire or incident and as much detail as
          possible given.  No senior fire officer is on
          duty at the match."

     Do you agree with all that? - Ai Yes.

Q. Just one other matter I would be grateful if you could help
   us about. I think you are in fact control generally of
   equipment.  Is that your particular role in the Fire Service?
   - A. It is one of my roles.  I am responsible for training,
   equipment and also control as well.

Q. I think you have in fact applied your mind,,of course with
   hindsight and in retrospect, to what if anything could
   have been done if the Fire Service had been there at an
   earlier stage? - A. Yes.

Q. Now could you help Lord Justice Taylor about that matter
   please? - A. As regards that sir, the sooner that we
   receive any call to an incident obviously the better.
   We can't do any good in the Fire Station, we need to get
   there as soon as possible.

           As regards the equipment we have got on every machine
     we could have quickly removed that fence, as Mr. Fletcher
     said, probably within a minute or two.

           We carry the same equipment on every appliance, so
     because we had two or three appliances responding at the
     same time, we could have removed the whole of the front
     fencing very quickly.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I suppose without troubling
     the Fire Service, bolt cutters at the ground could have
     been operated by anybody, couldn't they? - A. If I may
     make a comment sir?

Q. Please? - A. I think if it was felt that bolt cutters might
   have been needed, would it have been better off not to
   put the fence there to start off with?  I certainly would
   not have gone along with something whereby we expected that
   we would need bolt cutters there because of problems of
   crushing personally.
                                 A. HORNSBY


      MR. MULLER:  Can I just ask you about that.  I think
it has been suggested by the previous Fire Officer who gave
evidence that he would have considered at the time a number
of different things, he would not have just done one thing,
he would have done several things in order to get the people
out of the pen. Would you agree with that? - A. I think
that is correct, yes, there is several things we could have
done.

The obvious thing is to go through the perimeter fence which
would have been done with wire cutters? - A. Yes, bolt
cutters.

Have you considered the possibility as it were of going in
through the side pen, to get access from people from the side?
- A. Yes, I have.

As far as that is concerned you have seen the structure of
that radial fence? - A. Yes.

How would that have been removed? - A. We have got equipment
on the machines that would remove it slowly but we had in
attendance an emergency tender which carries heavy rescue
equipment and depending on the circumstances we could have
either used the Hurst cutting equipment to cut through it,
you have got an engine that drives a hydraulic force with
big jaws that actually through it, cuts through metal.
It is rather large. We have also got thermal cutting equipment.

As far as the Hurst ones, can I just deal with that for a
moment.  The Hurst cutting equipment, is that entirely
portable? - A. Yes.

As far as that is concerned it just works like a pair of
scissors but under hydraulic force? - A. Correct.

And having looked at those radial fences would it have been
possible to have removed those radial fences by cutting
in four places, the bar at the top and the bar at the
bottom in two places? - A. I don't think that the Hurst
cutting equipment would have cut the bars at the top and
the bars at the bottom.

So this is a bar about a quarter-of-an-inch thick? - A. No
it is not, it is almost three-quarters-of-an-inch thick and
it is three inches wide.

I think we are perhaps talking about something different,
Officer? - A. If you are talking about the horizontal
bars which the uprights go through?

I am talking about the radial fence? - A. Yes.

If you look at Photograph 28 it probably shows it.   It is
in West Midlands 2, otherwise known as âB ' . I think you
can see the radial fence, it is the best photograph we
                            75


                                    A. HORNSBY


   have got, you can see it going down the slope? - A. Yes.

Q. What I am asking you about is you see the bar that runs
   along the top? - A. Yes.

Q. There is one that runs along the bottom through which the
   vertical bars appear to go.  Do you follow me? - A. Yes.

Q. You see the thick vertical stanchion? - A. That is right.

Q. If you cut just to the right of that and just to the left
   of the one further down, you would release the top bar,
   wouldn't you? - A. Yes.

Q. What I am asking you is whether the cutting equipment is
   capable of cutting through that horizontal bar? - A. Yes,
   I believe it is.




                      /Q. In fact this Hurst

                                                       A. HORNSBY

Q. In fact this Hurst cutting equipment is the stuff they
   use onmotor-cars very often? -A. That is correct.

Q.   For cutting motor-cars at the members which support the
     roof? - A. That is correct, for removing the roof.

Q. And that Hurst cutting equipment, does that work quickly
   or what? - A. Well, we need to transport it there.

Q; Once it is there. - A. Once it is there you have got an
   engine that you start up, you have got ten metres of
   supply cable and then, yes, it is there.

Q.   Does it cut it straightoff? - A. It does cut it     straight
     off, yes.

Q.   Andc    if you had used that method it would      have enabledyou,
     for example, to come into the side? - A. Yes.

          MR. MULLER:     Thank you very much.

                        By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Q. You talked about some other, the thermal .... - A. Thermal
   cutting equipment, thermal arc, sir, yes.

Q.    Thermal arc? - A. Yes.  It works - the nearest I can
     describe it, it is like  oxyacetylene but it is a lot
     hotter. It will cut through solid RSJ in a matter of
     about 20 seconds. But the risk from that is because
     the people were trapped the other side. We would have
     had to put a leather blanket there and then get water
     on to them. This will cut under water.

          LORD JUSTICE TMEOB:         Thank you.

          MR. GOLDSACK:     Thank you.. That is all.

          MR.   PHILLIPS:    Sir, I do not know whether you are
     aware of   the document that was put in to Station Officer
     Fletcher   by my learned friend Mr. Muller. There was a
     document   shown to him but I do not think it was then
     produced   to the rest of us.

          MR. MULLER:   I assumed it had gone in that direction
     because it seemed to disappear.

          MR.   PHILLIPS:Yes. It seemed a    rather private
     affair.    May I just hand in a copy of that document, sir?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes.

          MR. PHILLIPS:      It is a very brief Teiex type
     message.
                                                  D. HOUSLEY


     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Oh, yes, he handed up, that is
right.

     MR. PHILLIPS:   Sir, I do not know if it has been
distributed. Perhaps I should just read it briefly.
"Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground, Penistone Road,
Bradfield Road, Owlerton, Sheffield. Major incident.
Cutting gear required." Then a grid reference and house
numbers& Leading Fireman Housley.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The original of that is where
now?

       MR. PHILLIPS:   It was put into the box.

(Produced)

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      It had better be exhibited,
I think. Thank you.

              LEADING FIREMAN HOUSLEY Called

                 Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:

Now, you are Leading Fireman Housley, is that right? - A.
That is correct, sir.

And you are attached to the Central Fire Station in
Sheffield? - A. Yes, that is right.

And you responded also to the     call at the same time as
Station Officer Fletcher?- A.     That is correct.

You, I think, were driving the emergency tender? - A. No,
I was Officer in charge of the emergency tender ---

I am sorry, yes. You were in charge of the amergency
tender. That is a different vehicle from the tenders
that were being sent out under the other two Officers.
Is that right? - A. Yes. It is a specialist appliance
with rescue equipment on it.

Is it a larger vehicle than a m ordinary fire engine? - A.
It is a larger vehicle, yes.

We have heard something of the equipment from Mr. Hornsby.
Do you confirm that that sort of equipment was carried by
your tender?- A. That is correct. I have a list of the
equipment here if it is necessary.

Can you recall what time you arrived at the ground itself?
â A. I arrived at the same time as Central 1 and Central 2
which I understand now is 22 minutes past.

You arrived exactly at the same time and at the same place

                                                         D. HOUSLEY

         - A. That is correct.

      Q. Penistone Road entrance. And did you go into the road
         behind the Spion Kop? - A. Yes, the Riverside.

      Q. Yes. And what happenedswhen you were going down there?
         - A. I dismounted from my appliance with Station Officer
         Fletcher getting off his appliance and Sub-Officer Hunter.
         1 then made my way and I spoke to a Police Officer, a
         Police Constable.  I asked him the type of incident and
         all he could tell me was it is crowd trouble at the
         Leppings Lane end of the crowd. So at this time I was
         under the impression there had been a collapse of stand
         due to the message I received and there was crowd
         trouble.

      Q. Yes. What did you do with your emergency tender? - A.
         Station Officer Fletcher sort of ascertained from
         stewards and the Police on the entrance - my impression
         was that they were sort of amazed to see us, were not
         expecting us and it was sort of us saying, Can we go
         down there?" and they were saying well, if you want to.
         It was that sort of attitude.

      Q. Go down there, you mean flown .... - A. Down by the
         Riverside, down by the side of the river.

      Q. Towards Leppings Lane?- A. Yes.  I do not think they
         were expecting us.  I followed Central 1 and Central
         2 along the Riverside. One-third of the way down that
         stand there is a protrusion. The two appliances were
         able to go under the stand. Due to the height of the
         emergency tender against the height of the stand I
         was not able to proceed.

      Q. You could not get through? - A. No.   Impossible.

      Q. Now, is that the part on the South Side there where the road
         is effectively roofed over to form the entrance to the clubÂ­
         house itself?- A. That is correct, yes.

      Q. Had you previously been given any idea that there would be
         difficulties in your emergency tender getting through along
         that road? - A. No, I had no knowledge of that.

      Q.So in fact what did you do? - A. I radioed to Station Officer
         Fletcher, my Officer in charge, informing him of the fact I
         was unable to proceed along that avenue.    I was under the
         impression that the incident was at the Leppings Lane end
         of the stand, far end of the ground.    ^Because I was
         carrying emergency rescue equipment, heavy equipment,
         it was necessary, in my view, to get as close to the
         incident as possible.    I therefore got the assistance
         of a Police Officer and guided my driver back on to
         Penistone Road.a iAt vthe junction of Riverside and
                              79


                                                   D. HOUSLEY

     Penistone Road I spoke with another Police Officer? trying
     to get some indication of the incident again, and it was
     still crowd trouble.  I indicated to the Police Officer
     would he want to go in the back of the emergency tender.
     The thinking behind that was if there was crowd trouble,
     if there is trouble with access, a Police Officer on the
     vehicle would be of assistance. The reply from him was
     he did not really want to know or he was not - he had not
     got the permission to leave that area.

Q. Was that a Constable? - A. It was a Constable, yes.

Q. Well, did you leave the ground 'ait thfl entrance through
   which you had originally come? - A. That is correct,yes.
   I then proceeded along Penistone Road to the Leppings Lane
   roundabout.

Q. Yes. Did you have an uninterrupted journey? - A. No.
   Proceeding along there I was deliberately looking to
   the left at various access points into thecoground. The
   first one, there was a similar problem, unable to - which
   is the one on the bottom end of the ground.

Q.    It would be p^haps   the top left-hand corner of that?
     - A. Yes. This area.   The one on the bottom left. That
     open entrance there. There is a structure over the top
     of the gate so from my position I did not think the
     emergency tender would have been able to go through
     there. It is off the plan. As you go further through
     there is also an access to the gymnasium.   I looked m
     there. Again, at that point I was - well, there was
     something over the entrance and I thought I would have
     been unable to get in therei At that point I was
     approached by I believe a Police Inspector.

Q.    Did he have a radio? - A. He had a radio. He sort of
     waved to me to flag down the appliance and I approached
     him and said what do you want, sort of thing.

Q. Yes. What did he say? - A. Prior to this I had received
   a message over my fireground radio that resuscitation
   equipment was required at the far end of the ground, so
   I was beginning to get a picture of the type of incident.
   The Police Officer said to me wait and he was trying to
   get a radio, either receiving or transmitting, a radio
   message over his radio. After what seemed a good deal
   of time or short while of time I proceeded.  I informed
   my driver we would go to the incident and I left him.
   I did not get any information from that Police Officer.

Q. So you did not wait for the Inspector tÂ© give you any
   further instructions? - A. I waited for a fair while.
   At that time I knew that resuscitation equipment was

                                                                  D, HOUSLEY

               required at the far end of the ground.      I decided to go
               on my fireground message.

          Q.   Did you eventually get then to Leppings Lane? - A. Yes.
               Proceeded down to the roundabout.  The entrance to the
               three side streets on the left-hand side were blocked.
               I made the decision, told the driver we would go down
               to the roundabout and proceed along Leppings Lane.

          Q.   Yes. And did you get to the entrance to the ground at
               that point there? - A. Yes.  I arrived at approximately
               the same time as ADO Robjohns and&naefgency tender was
               parked up to the rear of Mr. RobJohns' car directly
               outside the gates.

          Q. And then having parked outside the gates did you take
             your resuscitation equipment off the tender? - A. Yes.
             The normal procedure is that the driver would don his
             fire kit. Because I realised the resuscitation equipment
             was required I informed him do not put on your fire kit.
             We went for the Motivus resuscitator, a spare oxygen
             cylinder and a first aid kit. We then proceeded into
             the ground.   I was not aware of any Fire Officer or
             firemen in that area.   I did not see any firemen or
             any Policemen.

          Q. Did you not see Station Officer Swain? - A. Not at that
             time, no.

          Q.    Did you see his fire engine? - A. I cannot remember seeing
               his fire engine but I know it to be there.

          Q.   How    did you get    on to the pitch from where    you were? - A.
               From where I was parked at what seemed to be the nearest
               entrance into the ground which took me to the left and
               to the North Stand.

          Q.    Yes, I see. And you went through on  to the pitch with
               your equipment at that time?- A. Yes. Went into the North
               Stand and then went down through the crowd who were all
               standing up from their seats and I was sort of indicating
               mind your backs, move out of the way, and the crowd sort
               of parted and I made my way on to the pitch ....

          Q. I am sorry.  Can you give us any idea what time it was
             when you finally got on to the pitch with your resuscitation
             equipment?- A. I understand that ADO RobJohns arrived at
             Leppings Lane at approximately 2.30 so I would indicate
             we were on the pitch just after 2.30.

          Q. Just after 2.30? - A. Yes.

          Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        3.30? - A. 3.30.   Sorry.

                       was something over eight minutes before you actually got
                       on to the pitch? - A. Yes, bearing in mind we had to
                       reverse along Riverside.

                  Q. Yes, yes. Well, we understand the reason for that in your
                     evidence but that is in fact what happened. Yes. - A.
                     Roughly, yes.

                     with your "equipment on the pitch, did you not, and then
                     later you went over to the gymnasium where you gave further

                  Q. Has it been your practice to go on most away matches?
                     - A. Years ago we always did. Lately, money being short,
                     we ....

Q. Did you come to the semi-final at Hillsborough in 1988?
   - A. I was there as a fan.

Q.   Did you do any stewarding at that match? - A. Not in 1988.

Q.    Were youaware of there being Liverpool stewards acting in
     that capacity in 1988? - A. Since Bradford and Ipyefel
     Liverpool Football Club have always had six regular
     stewards at away football matches on a rota basis.

                                             G. LLOYD

And again for the future, however official or unofficial
it may be, is it your experience and would it be your
advice to us that it is a good thing for stewards to travel
with their own teams to help control some of the more
irresponsible people who inevitably travel to away games?
A.  I certainly would.

Can I bring you back to this particular occasion in 1989,
Mr. Lloyd?    I think when you arrived, the first occasion
of the meeting with Mr. Thorpe was just you and your
brother?   A.   That's right.

And you met him somewhere near the stairs to the Stand
in which you later worked - do you remember that?
A.   Yes, that's right.

And you were talking to him in a perfectly amiable way
about the match that was to come?   A. We didn't.  Well,
I didn't.

You did not.  Mr. Lloyd, I am not suggesting to you that
 anything very dramatic was said, but can I again ask
you whether you can recall whether anything was said
about a larger number of people who might be coming,
for whatever reason?   A.  I cannot recall anything of
that nature.

You cannot recall anything?    A.   I wouldn't know.

All right, Mr. Lloyd.  We will s e e whether your brother
can help.  Do you remember that while you were talking
to Mr. Thorpe, a number of other Liverpool stewards
turned up and physically joined you?     A. As soon as I
met Mr. Thorpe, he took us upstairs by the Restaurant
Bar upstairs.

He explained to you, I think, that he wanted you and your
brother eventually to help in the Stand?   A.  That's all.
He said, "Will you assist my steward?"

Not to help him, but to help one of his Stand stewards?
A.  Th at 's right.

Again I would like to have it from you if I can.  Can
you remember what the particular problem was that he
wanted you to help with?    A. Just organisation of the
Liverpool crowd, to get them into their seats as soon
as possible, as quick as possible.

Could I help you with a specific problem then? Had there
been a difficulty in the past with people pushing their
way into the Stands and sometimes throwing tickets over
to people in the Terraces, which Mr. Thorpe thought your presence
and the fact that you were known as a well-known Liverpool
steward might help to prevent?    A. Yes.
                                                G. LLOYD

Do you remember him saying that?        A.     I've got that now,
yes.

Thank you.  And he explained to you that it was really your
presence, your voice and your accent, and the fact that
you were well-known, that would help to keep the
situation generally under control in the Stand? A. Yes.

And that is what you attempted to do?          A.   Yes.

Could I again refresh your memory? Maybe you did not know
his name, but I think you had met Mr. Thorpe before?
Are you saying that you have no recollection of him?
A.  No recollection atall.

You   had been to the ground on many occasions, I think?
A.    I had.

I think seven or eight times?      A.   Yes.

And you were well familiar with the general lay-out?         A. Yes

Again I am not challenging your honesty at all, Mr. Lloyd,
but I have to tell you that Mr. Thorpe recalls that you
had helped in an official or unofficial stewarding
capacity on one previous game?   A. Never.

Are you saying that with certainty or are you saying you
have no recollection?   A.  Certainty.

All right.  Do you remember that there was a time when
some other Liverpool stewards joined you and wanted to
help in your area in the Stand?   A. No.   The only two
stewards I saw before 2 o'clock was the two I designated
to go to the other part of the Stand to help down there.

I am just wondering, again without any serious criticism,
whether your recollection is correct about that.  Was it
your job to designate where stewards should go at this
ground, however helpful you were trying to be? A. There
was three or four stewards came by the tea bar when we
was there.

And who is "we"?  Is this just you?   A. Me and the pay
steward, I think it was, at that time of day.

Mr. Thorpe?   A. No, I think he had taken Raymond elsewhere
to designate somewhere he wanted him to work, you know.

So now we have got three or four more Liverpool stewards
turned up?   A.  Two of them were taken away to the
Terraces.

Now let's be very careful about this, if we can, Mr.
Lloyd.  I am not being critical, but I think this is the
first we have heard, despite a number of questions of you,
                                                 G. LLOYD

that you do now remember that at least some Liverpool
stewards were helped simply with their presence on the
Terraces?   A.  These four stewards that I met then, I
assumed that they were the part of the official party
as eight stewards, as I knew in my frame of mind.

Mr. Lloyd, please when answering my questions do not be
worried about whether peole are official or unofficial.
You have nothing to fear from my questions, I assure you.
I am not trying to trap you in any way.   All that I want
the Inquiry to know is whether you know, from whatever
source, that a number of your colleagues very helpfully
went on to the Terraces to assist in the way that you
were assisting in the Stand?   A.  The only two Liverpool
stewards that I saw on that pitch was Raymond and I.

The only ones you saw on the pitch?        A.     That's what you
said.

No, if I did, I apologise.  I meant the Terraces, if I
did not say "the Terraces".  Did you not see some stewards
from Liverpool on the Terraces as well?   A.  No.  I
assumed the two stewards I designated to go to the other
Stand went on to the Terraces.

I see.  It was just a matter of assumption?            A. Yes. I
didn't follow them.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry, you designated two
stewards to go to the other Stand, did you say? A. The
other part of the Stand.

The other part of the same Stand?     A.        The same Stand.

What made you think that they were going to have anything
to do with the Terraces, then?   A. I didn't say that.

     Mr. GLASGOW:  I think, to be fair to him, sir, his
recollection was  that there were four stewards, two
of whom he thought he designated to the Stand and the
other two he assumed had gone to the Terraces.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Is that right?        A.    Yes.

     Mr. GLASGOW:   Have I got it right?         A.    Yes.

And the only difference between us, Mr. Lloyd, is that I
am suggesting to you that there were rather more,
something just over half a dozen, and that apart from
you and your brother, the other stewards from Liverpool
went on to the Terraces?    A. I only saw them four.

You only saw the four?   A.  I give two a jacket each,
because Raymond, who was in charge of me - he was my
chief steward - he wasn't there at the time.

     Mr. GLASGOW:   Mr, Lloyd, I will not press it.            Despite

     your memory, we are grateful to you for what you did.

                 Cross-examined by Mr. WOODWARD:

Q. Mr. Lloyd, how long have you been a steward at Anfield?
   A.  Ten years, about ten years.  I don't know whether
   it's nine or eleven.

Q. And would it be right that as a steward at Anfield, and
   in accordance with the Anfield Certificate, one of the
   tasks that you had was directing, assisting and controlling
   the people entering within and leaving the Stadium?  That
   would be a fair description of the job of a steward,
   would it, such as you were?   A.  One of them.

Q. Yes.  That-is not simply getting them through the entrances?
   You shake your head;  that will not go on the note.  It
   involves more than that, does it not?   A. Yes.   My job
   is to direct them to their seats as soon and as quickly
   as possible, but my job at Anfield is that I look after
   the disabled, because there is a section of the Stand for
   the disabled and I'm designated there to look after them.

Q. But the crowd steward's task at Anfield is assisting and
   controlling the people to ensure that they are comfortably
   accommodated and in the right place?   A.  That's right,
   sir.

Q. And to ensure that there is no crushing or pressing and
   no dangerous situation develops?   A. As soon as there
   is a little commotion arises, we go to the source and
   try and fix it, alleviate it anyway.

Q. You agree with what I am putting to you, that if there are
   too many people getting too pressed up in a particular
   place, that is something that a steward would have his
   eye upon?   A.  That's right, sir.

Q. And deal with?     A.   Yes.

Q. And when you came to Hillsborough in 1989, that is one
   of the jobs which you expected to be doing amongst the
   Liverpool supporters, is it?   A.  That's right.

Q.    The same sort of thing?          A.   Yes.

Q. And is it right that those other stewards who were coming
   along with you would have the same sort of task? A. Yes,
   I should imagine so.

Q. No doubt about it, is there?             A. That's right.

Q. Another purpose of having stewards who come from the
   same place as the fans is that those stewards have the
   benefit of the intelligence, the information - is that
   right?   A. Right, sir.
                               95


                                                    G. LLOYD

Q. So that if a rumour or a whisper is going round that
   something might happen, the stewards are expected,
   because of their familiarity with the fans to be able
   to pick that up?   A.  That's right.

Q. And when they travel with the fans, if there are troubleÂ­
   makers or problems on the horizon, that would be something
   that the visiting steward would communicate to the
   stewards at the host ground?   A. I should imagine so.

Q. That is one of the most important features of your
   coming with your own supporters, the passing on of
   information?   A.  That's right, sir.

Q. The arrival of you and your brother was in advance of
   therest of  the Liverpool stewards?  A.  That's right.

Q.    You had not travelled together?  A.        No, I didn't know
     how they were getting to the match.

Q.   You had   got the tabards, had you?    A.     Yes.

Q.   And had you got enough tabards for all the Liverpool
     stewards?    A. Yes, eight tabards.

Q. Eight.  And was it expected that your stewards would
   wear those tabards?   A.  That's right.

Q. There is really not much point in having a steward who
   cannot easily be seen?   A. Yes.

Q. You were asked about stewards going into the Terraces.
   That is not a surprising thing, is it?   A. No, no,
   but I wasn't.

Q. You were not asked to go, but the fact that someone should
   suggest to you that there might be stewards on the Terrace
   is not remarkable and not surprising in the least, is it?
   A.  No, no.

Q. It does not cause you to raise any eyebrows or wonder
   about the sense of it? It is a very sensible thing to
   do, is it not?   A. It is, yes.

Q. And really it is a very necessary thing to do if you are
   going to be able to control, help, assist and direct the
   crowd?   A.  That's right.

Q. You cannot really do it without stewards on the Terraces,
   can you?   A. No.

Q. That is your experience? When you shake your head or
   A.  I'm agreeing with you, sorry.

Q. I understand the message, but it does not go on the
   shorthand note, do you follow?   A.  Sorry.
                              96



                                                 G. LLOYD

Q. When you arrived at Hillsborough in 1989, you did have
   a chat with Mr. Thorpe, did you not? You had a talk
   about the journey?   A.  I don't think so. We made
   ourselves known to him.

Q. You made yourselves known to him.  According to a statement
   that Mr. Thorpe has made, he has a recollection of you
   being there in 1988. May you have met him in 1988?
   A.  No.  I went there as a fan and I was in that opposite
   corner, as a fan, on the Terraces.

Q. Which opposite corner?   A.   On the steps, on this side.
   I never met any steward then.

Q. Why would being there prevent you from having met Mr.
   Thorpe? What is the connection?     A. Well, I'm just
   telling you where I was at that time. I thought you might
   have forgotten.

Q. If you had got any intelligence, any information, the
   time to pass it on would be on your arrival, would it
   not?    A. Which I would do, yes.

Q. And you would do that, as a conscientious steward.  Mr.
   Thorpe has made two statements about this, and no doubt
   we will hear his recollection.  He appears to have the
   firm recollection of talking with you and your brother.
   That did happen, did it not?   A. Yes.   All I can
   recollect is where I was designated to work.

Q. Yes.   His recollection, or the gist of his recollection
   is that you gave him information to the effect that
   "some idiots might be coming this year"?    A.   I never
   said anything like that.   All I can remember is when I
   got the job off him and I went to that position.

Q.    And made a reference to some horse race?   A. I'wouldn't
     know what happened 12 months before.    I wouldn't know
     anything about racing.

Q.   But if he says there was such a conversation, do you say
     that that is completely wrong, or may it have taken
     place?     A. I am an out-and-out football fan.  If that
     had happened, if I had been talking to him, it would have
     been about football.   I can't recollect the conversation
     between that chap and myself.

Q. It is not a conversation about a horse race, it is a
   conversation about football fans - do you follow?
   A.  I do.

Q. And the information that Mr. Thorpe appears to have
   received from you is that there were going to be a lot
   of fans coming from Liverpool without tickets?  A. I
   never said that, honestly.

Q. It was a matter of concern at Liverpool that there were
   not enough tickets for their supporters, was it not?
   A.  That s right.
                                  97


                                                   G. LLOYD

Q.    And it would follow from that that those who wanted to
     see the game that had not got tickets might come
     A. Which is understandable.    I've done it myself years
     ago.

Q.    And if they turned up     in any great numbers, that would
     cause trouble, would       it not?   A.  I should imagine so,
     yes.

Q. You see, Mr. Thorpe's recollection is that the ini~rmation
   he got from you or your brother - it is not entirely
   clear who it was, but in the conversation - was that a
   lot of fans were coming without tickets and you, the
   Lloyd brothers, thought there was going to be a lot of
   trouble?    A.  Can I say once again I hardly spake to
   the man.   I got a job off him and I done it. After
   receiving that job off Mr. Thorpe, the next time I spoke
   to him was at the end of the game when we shook hands.

Q.    Did it surprise you that apparently an awful lot of
     people had turned up expecting to get into the^ground?
     A.   I had no knowledge of Leppings Lane at 2 o clock
     when I was in the Stand.

Q. You must have read the papers, you must have been aware
   of the situation that had occurred?   A. Everybody can
   assume these things beforehand.

Q. But when you heard about it, did you say "Good heavens,
   what a surprise!"?    A.  Thousands and thousands of
   Liverpool fans love their football team and they go all
   over the country following them, with .tickets or without
   tickets, but I don't know how many persons arrived on
   that day with or without tickets.

Q. You see, asking you about the conversation a little
   earlier on this afternoon, you seemed to be saying that
   if you did have such a conversation, you really had not
   got any recollection of it.   A.  I will say once again
   I have no recollection of talking generally about what
   would happen or what wouldn't happen on the day with Mr.
   Thorpe.

Q. Do you remember in the conversation with Mr. Thorpe
   discussing stewards going on to the Terraces?  A.   To
   work?

Q. Yes.      A.   Not me, no.    I didnât speak to him at that
   time.

Q. Which time was that? A. When he took us upstairs for
   the pay station, I don't know whether it was him who
   took the other two stewards down on to the Terraces
   when I designated the two stewards that was with us
   to do the part of the Stand.  That's the only recollection
   I know of any stewards going on the Terraces.

                                             G. LLOYD

Q. Is this the position:  There was a time when you, your
   brother, Mr. Thorpe and other stewards were together?
   A. Yes.




                                 /Q.   And those other stewards.
                                       G. LLOYD


Q. And those other Stewards, like you, were at that time being
   given your jobs for the Sfternoon? - A. That is right.

Q. And was there a discussion that Liverpool Stewards were
   going to be needed to go on to the terraces? - A. Yes.
   Mr. Thorpe said:  "The Stewards that come after you will
   be put on to the terraces" not in the capacity of Stewards,
   they would not be there with their jackets.

Q.   Why not? - A. I don't know.   That is up to him.

Q.   Did that surprise you? - A. No.

Q. If these people were to be acting as Stewards to be without
   their jackets would seem to somewhat defeat their purpose
   and value? - A. Mr. Thorpe said we only needed four Stewards
   in the upper Stand.

Q. It is the terrace I am asking you about, Mr. Lloyd? - A.
   I don't know nothing about the terraces.

Q. What was the discussion about there being Stewards on the
   terrace without jackets? ~ A. The two Stewards that went
   down on to the terraces I imagine they weren't in the
   capacity of Stewards, they were just there to watch the
   game.

Q. What was the discussion about it? - A. You will have to
   ask Mr. Thorpe that later on.

Q. You don't recall it? - A. No.

Q. But you recall some observation about them going there as
   Stewards but without jackets? - A. There was eight of us.
   There was four, Raymond, myself and these other two Stewards.
   He said:  "We only need four". The other four Stewards they
   came along and they would be taken to the terraces.

Q. The name Phil or Ray has been mentioned.  Do the names Phil
   or Ray mean anything to you? - A. No, all the Stewards at
   Anfield we only see each other for an hour and they are
   designated all round the ground. We know faces but we don't
   know names.

Q. Did you learn after this event at Hillsborough in 1989 that
   there had been Liverpool Stewards on the terraces? -
   A. Liverpool Stewards go to every away match.

Q. Are you saying that you did learn ...      A. They go as fans.

Q. I am sorry? - A. The extra Stewards I have seen at other
   football matches have been there in the capacity of fans.

Q. May I ask you the question again please.  Did you learn
   after this event in 1989 that there had been Liverpool

        Stewards, not simply Liverpool fans, Liverpool Stewards on
        the terraces?

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   As Stewards?

q   .         MR. WOODWARD: As Stewards, stewarding? - A. No,
        because we still had the other four jackets that were not
        needed.  We still had the four jackets for them Stewards
        if they were needed.

Q. You heard nothing to that effect? - A. No.

Q. Are you sure about that? - A. I am.

Q. I am not sure how that quite accords with what you said
   in answer to Mr. Goldsack but we can look at the record.
   - A. Yes.

              MR. WOODWARD:   Thank you.


                       Re-Examined by MR. GOLDSACK:

Q. One matter Mr. Lloyd please.   You have spoken of the
   practice of a rota for Liverpool Stewards to go to away
   matches.   By whom are they paid? â A. Â®hey don't receive
   pay.  I think they are usually those people who have got
   plenty of time on their hands and they can assist.    We
   need them.   We need them as Stewards.  They go free and
   they look after them on the official Liverpool coaches,
   I think.

Q. What about their own travelling expenses.   Dp they have to
   pay them or does someone else pay?   - A. They are sent on
   Liverpool official coaches, supporters' coaches. They
   look after ___   If there is three   they send six; if there
   is four coaches they send eight.

Q. So they get free travel, do they, but no actual payment for
   their stewarding? - A. That is what I understand.

    Q. So does it follow that you did not pay for your trouble
       this year? - A. Which I did.

    Q. Did you pay or not? - A. Ours was an organised coach. We
       paid.
    Q. If you believed yourself to be coming as one of the official
       Stewards, why did you have to pay for your travel this
       year? - A. Well my son was on there on this coach ana that
       is how we travelled. We have been to Hillsborough three
       or four times on this same organised party, coach party.

    Q. Was that not an official supporters' coach? - A. No, it
       was organised by one of the head Stewards and a friend of
       his.

                     MR. GOLDSACK:    Right, thank you.


                                 By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

          Q. If you were going as a Steward why weren't you able to go
             free? - A. I cannot answer that, my Lord.  I don't know
             how many coaches there were from Liverpool Supporters' Club.
             I don't know what they were doing.

          Q.    I am not understanding this.  If you go away from Liverpool
                as a Steward, as I understood it you get free travel.  Is
                that right? - A. I know that is a fact.

          Q. And you also get into the match without having to pay for
             a ticket? - A. They are doing crowd control, yes.

          Q.    Well the answer is yes, you don't have to pay for          a ticket.
                Is that right? - A. That is right sir, yes.

          Q. Who says who goes as a Steward, the Club? - A. At the start
             of the season those people who want to go as an away Steward
             they put their names down on a form.

          Q. And who selects them for any particular match? - A. A Steward
             is designated.

          f
          fii   The head Steward? - A. I don't know his name.        I don't know
                who it is.

          Q. If you are allowed to go as a Steward you would not get a
             ticket as well, would you? - A. No.

          Q. But you did get a ticket and you did pay for your travel?
             - A. I got an Â£18 Stand ticket and when I knew I was going
             as an Official Steward I give that to my son.

                      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Very well.   Thank you.

                      MR. JACKSON:  Sir, there is one matter which may be
                of assistance to your Lordship, the question of the different
                people who send people away.  There could well be confusion,
                according to my instructions, in the last witness's obserÂ­
                vations about certain trips with the Liverpool Supporters'
                Club providing the Stewards for the coaches.  That may be
                a quite separate matter from Liverpool Football Club
                sending Stewards away and I have no instructions to challenge
                the evidence that may be a Steward will go with the Supporters
                Club to look after the people on that coach.

                      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Thank you.

                                     R. LLOYD


Q. You   are    Raymond Lloyd, are you? - A. Yes sir.

Q. You   are    also a Steward at Liverpool? - A. Yes.

Q. And   the    brother of the last witness? - A. Yes.

Q. You went in 1989, did you, to the game at Hillsborough? -
   A. Yes.

Q. Had   you    been the previous year? - A. Yes, twice.

Q. Had   you    been to the previous semi-final in 1988?-      A.Yes.

Q. Had you     been as a Steward or as a paying member of      the
   public? - A. As a paying member of the public.

Q. On what basis did you go this year? - A. Two chaps came to
   Anfield to see the Sheffield Wednesday game. They came
   for the Sheffield Wednesday league match.  I met one of
   them outside the ground and he wanted to see the Chief
   Steward Phil.

Q.    Is that Phil O'Brien? - A. Yes. The chap spoke to me and
     he said: "We are head Stewards from Sheffield"   soI said:
     "If you would like to see Phil come with me" and I took the
     two of them in to see Phil O'Brien.   From what I can make
     out they invited so many Stewards from Anfield for the cup
     match.

Q. Can you tell us the names of these two chaps from Sheffield?
   - A. There is one sitting there over the back but I don t
   know his name, Ken I think his first name is.  I have a
   piece of paper with the chap's name on.

Q.   You have got a piece of paper there with his name on,   you
     say? - A. Yes.

Q. Is it Kenneth Castley? - A. Sorry, I have lost it now.      I
   can't remember the fella's name.

Q. Is Kenneth Castley in the room? - A. That's him yes, came
   with another chap who I don't know. I can remember that chap.

Q. Had you previously travelled as a Steward with Liverpool
   to away matches? â A. Only one to Manchester City.

Q. When had that been? - A. That was a Cup match a few years
     ago, about three or four seasons.

 Q
     For how long have you been a Steward at Liverpool? - A. Eight
     to ten years, I am not sure.

 Q. Were yoisurprised when the request came for Stewards to go
    from Liverpool to Sheffield Wednesday? - A. Not really because
    me personally I think it is advisable that stewards do go.

            They know their own supporters and they get on well with
            them, well I think they do.

    Q. Your brother speaks of it happening at away league games
       too.  Is that your experience? - A. Yes, it does happen
       at away games but as has just been pointed out, if six
       coaches go there is usually six away Stewards go on those
       coaches.  They are organised by the Travel Club of Liverpool
       Football Club as was our trip to Manchester City for the
       quarter final, or whatever it was.

    Q. Is that the Supporters' Travel Club? - A. It could be the
       Anfield Travel Club.

    Q. How did it come about that you went on this particular
       occasion on the 15th of April, you rather than any of the
       other Stewards? - A. Off hand I could not tell you but
       after the Sheffield Wednesday game our boss come up to
       Phil O'Brien and he said:  "Would you like to go down as
       a guest of the Stewards and work down there for the game?"
       so we said "Yes".

    Q. Had you by then already been allocated your ticket for the
       match? - A. Not at that time.

    Q. But you were subsequently allocated a ticket? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you expect you would have to use that? - A. Oh aye, yes.
       We were going whether we went as pre-arranged or whether we
       were going in our capacity as a Steward.

    Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Did I hear you say that Phil
            O'Brien asked if you would like to go as guest of the
            Stewards? - A. You know as a Steward.  Sorry, my fault.
            As a Steward to help out as an away Steward; on the day of
            the game.

    q   .         MR. PHILLIPS:  When you work as a Steward at
            Liverpool do you get paid for it? - A. Yes.

    Q. By whom? - A. Liverpool Football Club.

    Q. What were you going to get for doing this job? - A. I don't
       know.

    Q. Did you receive any indication from Mr. O'Brien that you
       would be paid? - A. No.

    Q.       Did he tell you that you would not be paid? - A.No.

    Q.       Did you ask whether you would be paid? - A. No.

    Q.      Did you care whether you were going to be paid?    - A. No,
            we just went to do a job and to enjoy the game,    I suppose
                                      R. LLOYD


Q. What about your travelling expenses? - A. Paid for them
   ourselves.

Q. You paid them yourselves? - A. Well we had already paid to
   go a fortnight previous.

Q. If you had not done that could you have gone for nothing?
   - A. No, I don't think so, no.

Q. You don't think so? - A. No,I would have had to have paid
   to have gone to Sheffield with the other, as my brother
   keeps pointing out, he said eight but there was ten.

Q. Ten what? - A. There was ten Stewards asked for or ten
   Stewards went there.

Q. Did you go in the coach with the other Stewards? - A. No,
   my brother was misled there.  There were some Stewards
   on the coach but they weren't, it was nothing to do with
   stewarding, it was only our kid and I were on that coach
   and we were the only ones to leave that coach acting as
   Stewards.

Q. So whatever other Stewards went must have gone by some
   other means? - A. Yes.

Q. And you don't know what their arrangements were? - A.
   Cars and whatever.

Q. But there is no arrangement that they would get free
   transport? - A. Not as I know of.

Q. Your coach stopped I think some distance away from the
   ground, didn't it on the day? - A. Before dinner.  The
   Travellers Inn in Ecclesfield or something like that.

Q. Then you went by taxi? - A. Yes.

Q. Why didn't you carry on by coach? - A. They stayed in a
   pub the people there.  They know the bloke in there.  There
   is a lot of people on the coach who are friends of the boss.
   He does a meal for us and we have a sandwich, and what have
   you, a pint and then go down to the ground.

Q. Leaving the other people to continue drinking or whatever?
   - A. Yes, whatever they do.

 Q. So what time did you get to the ground? - A. 10-past, quarter-
     past-1.
 Q. Getting there deliberately early so that you could get
    this Steward business sorted out? - A. Of course yes.

 Q. You   did report together with your brother. Were there
    any   other people there from the Liverpool Steward Section
    who   were there to do any stewarding? - A. At the time we
    got   there, no.

    Q. You were the first two to arrive? - A. I don't know, but we
       were the first to talk to a Mr.Thorpe.

    Q. Now did you in fact agree to act as the Chief Steward? - A.
       Well our kid said to me:  "You are a Chief Steward at
       Anfield" you know.

    Q. Are you a Chief Steward at Anfield? - A. Yes.

    Q. But there are Stewards nevertheless with authority over you
       such as Mr. O'Brien, are there not? - A. Yes, and Ian Nelson.

    Q. So you were going to act as Chief Steward of you and your
       brother? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Of course you are older than he is, are you? - A. No.

    Q.   What about the other Stewards, when did they come? - A. They
         came in dribs and drabs.

    Q. I mean the Liverpool Stewards? - A. From quarter-past-1 till
       25-to-2 say.

    Q.   How many turned up? - A . I would say the eight that were
         supposed to come, well not with us but to see us there,
         they all came at that time.

    Q.    So is that eight plus you two or including you two?   - A.
         Yes, including us.

    Q. And your brother had got eight tabards with him? - A. No,
       I had them. When he says that we do everything "we".

    Q.   Yes, all right.   The tabards are orange, aren't they? - A.
         Yes.

    Q. And the ones for Sheffield Wednesday are yellow? - A. Yes.

    Q. A different colour? - A. Yes.

    Q. So you get yourself kitted out with a tabard? - A. Mr. Thorpe
       was upstairs.  He came down and he said:   "Your brother will
       be at the top of the stairs on the right in the Stands".
       I said:  "Well what would you like me to do?" He said:
       "Would you just hang around here till all the other Stewards
       come" because I had all the jackets and I said "Yes, certainly".
       When they turned up I said you know:   "They have turned up,
       what's the problem now?" He said:    "You only need four to
       work and there is six.  The others can watch the game from
       the side".

    Q. Did you give them tabards? - A. No.

    Q. They just went in as ordinary members of the public then?
       - A. They stayed by the staircase.

                                         R. LLOYD


Q. How many Stewards were being paid that afternoon? - A. As
   far as I know there was two.

Q.   Were you expecting that? -A. No.

Q.   Nice surprise for you then when     the offer was made to   pay
     two Stewards? - A. Not really.

Q. As Chief Steward were you responsible for deploying any
   of the Liverpool Stewards? - A. I was responsible for
   nothing at all apart from taking the jackets.  Mr. Thorpe
   was in charge of us and he gave us our jobs.

Q.   So you did not in fact send any Stewards down to theterrace?
     - A.,No.

Q. Were you aware of any Stewards being sent to the terrace?
   - A. No, only to the right of the terrace which would be
   in the top up there. That is right up there. He said
   they could watch the game from up there.

Q. Those were the two who were surplus to requirements, were
   they? - A. There was six surplus.

Q. Six surplus to requirements without the tabards? - A. Yes.

Q. So you were posted, were you not, to Gate-C? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you stand by Gate C with some Sheffield Stewards? - A.
   Y e s , three Stewards.

Q. Do you know the names now to be Mr. Bain, Mr. Beardsley
   and Mr. Marsh? - A. I could not put a name to them but
   they are sitting over there.

Q. At all events what were you supposed to be doing there?
   - A. Assisting the Sheffield lads.

Q. Well the Sheffield lads were standing behind the gate,
   weren't they? - A. No, the gate was open.

Q. What time are we    talking      about? - A. Half-past-1 onwards.

Q. Why  was the gate open at that time? - A. Because they
   usually leave it open for Police, catering staff and whoÂ­
   ever to come in and out of that one.

Q. Did     in fact that happen?     - A. Oh yes, yes.

Q. Did   there come a time when the gate was closed? ** A. Well
   around 2 o'clock ish it was getting a bit packed outside
   and the odd fella without his ticket trying to bribe the
   lads but in the end two went inside and two stayed outside
   and they closed the gate. Anybody that came in or out
   knocked on the gate.     We knocked on the gate and then
   they opened it.

Q. Were you outside or inside? - A .   I was outside.

Q. So you and another Steward were outside the blue gate? - A.
   Yes sir.

Q. Where the Policemen were? - A. There was a Police cordon just
   on the left of me.

Q. You saw them, did you? - A. Yes.

Q. What exactly were you supposed to do? - A. To help the lad.

Q. Help him   do what? - A. Whatever he wanted usto do.

Q. What did   he want you to do? - A. If anybody came up with
   official   things they knew them and they went in.

Q. He would have to just knock on the gate .... A. And the
   two lads inside would open it and they entered.

Q.    How long did you stay out there? - A. I stayed there till
     about 25-past-2.

Q. During that time were people going through or apparently
   going through the turnstiles? - A. Turnstiles, yes.

Q. During that time was the gate opened from time to time for
   people to be taken out? - A. Taken out?

Q.   Yes. - A. I never saw anybody taken out.

Q.   You did not see anybody thrown out or taken out?   - A.   No,
     not at that time.

                                                R.   LLOYD

For people to go in?- A. Some, yes.

What sort of people? - A. Catering lad, he had been in
quite a few times, in and out. Well, that was it ....

Now, at 25-past-2 what did you do? - A. I said to the
young fellow that was with me, I said, "It is getting
a bit hectic out here now.  I think we should go inside."
So he said O.K. then, so knocks on the door and ....

Was it getting hectic out there?- A. Oh, yes.   Yes.

At 25-past-2? - A. Between 2 o'clock and half-past-two,
yes. When I went inside one of tfssslads says what have
you come in for? This gate should be closed . It should
not be open. So we had a few words. He said something
and I said well, if that is the way you feel - he told me
I was trying to do his job and I said, "Well, I am not
here to do that.   I am here just to help you. But if
that is the way you feel I will move away," so I went
upstairs, see ....

Is that on the West Stand?- A. Yes.

To where your brother was? - A. Not far from him.  I was
not with my brother.  I was where'we.put our jackets
earlier on, the ones that were not being used by the
stewards, and there was a window overlooking the gate
and the turnstiles where Mr. Thocpe was standing.

I was curious about that. Could you look at the bundle
of photographs, West Midland 2, which is the thicker of
the two bundles with*West Midland Photographic Department
written onthe front? Photograph 17. Can you identify
the window from photograph 17 out of which you say you
could look and see the gates and the Leppings Lane end?
- A. I actually think it was ....

Do you see the back of the West Stand withfeSheffield
Wednesday written on it?- A. Yes, I have got it.

Turn it round, please, so we can see it. - A. I think
it was the second.

The second from the letters .... - A. Wait a minute.

.... gangways Y, Z? - A. Yes. It could be the first one,
the one that was right by the actual door, nearest to
the door, going into that area.

No doubt that can be loÂ®ked into in due course but you
say that is the window through which you could see what
was going on? - A. Either that one or the next one to it.

Yes,   And you were able to see what was going on there.

     Did    you stay there for some time? - A. Yes.

Q. And you saw people coming in through the gate? - A.
   Turnstiles, yes.

Q. You  saw people climbing over the top of the turnstile
   wall? - A . On to the topj yes. Then     Mr. Thorpe,hehad
   his walkie-talkie with him and he went down, I think, to
   do something about it.

Q. And you see the blue gates open once or twice? - A. The
   blue gates opened about 20-to-3 and then.....

Q. Then later? Did you see these people getting in quite
   obviously not by going through the turnstiles and showing
   a ticket? - A. No, they got through the gate.

Q. So people were coming through the gate and people were
   going over the top as well, were they not? - A. At the
   time, the second time the gate opened^ well, before, there
   was a Policeman was on the top. There was a Police
   Officer there and he was - before the Policeman got
   up there the fans were actually showing tickets to
   Policemen and stewards down below and they were allowing
   them to ....

Q. Did you think you could have done any good by going down
   to the forecourt where you had been originally posted?
   - A. I do not think so. There was a few Police and
   stewards.

Q. There were Police and stewards there, were there? - A. Yes,
   inside the gates, and they were searching people and what
   have you.

Q. And later when the blue gates were opened!...^ -TA& Theaac
   second time, this?

Q.   Yes.   - A. They   opened about 20â to~3 where so manygot in.

Q.   Yes.   - A. Tien about 3 o'clock.

Q. From where you were could you see forward in front of the
   West Stand on toi the terrace? - A. No.

Q.    You could not.  And you stayed there for how long? - A.
     Till just after 3 o'clock when all this happened.   I ran
     out towards the Staircase.   There is a few supporters
     there running up the stairs who had already got in and
     they were all making their way towards where my brother
     was and other entrances and exits and I went up to see
     if I could do anything about it. I got on to the stairÂ­
     case but there was only the odd couple there and they
     had tickets, so I looked down on to the pitch and I seen

     supporters climbing on to the railings and when ....

Q.-Again,'I do not want   to .... - A. They were climbing on to
   the railings. Then a Police Officer ran on to thepitch
   and he went straight to the referee and then we came
   downstairs.

Q. Yes, I know, and I know also, Mr. Lloyd you did a great
   deal to help to rescue the people who had been caught
   in the pens - that is right, is not it - and helped to
   take them out on to the pitch.  I do not want to dwell on
   that but, again, I do not want you to think that we are
   passing over it lightly. Thank you very much for what
   you did then. Thank you.

          MR. HYTNER:    I   have no questions.

                  Cross-examined by    MR. JACKSON:'

Q. Mr. Lloyd, may I ask you about the observation you made
   to My Lord about being a guest of the Sheffield Wednesday
   stewards? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. It was rather an odd phrase to use, was not it, in relation
   to being asked and steward at a semi-final? - A. Well,
   whether it is a guest or whether they want you there, you
   know, to me they were asking youitog go, you know, so if I
   ask you to come to my house I do not want you to pay, you
   come as a guest, and this is ....

Q. I wonder if you feel yourself a guest at the shipyard
   where you work? - A. Yes, they pay me.

Q.    Yes, exactly.  I have no reason tosuggest your evidence
     about being asked by Sheffield people to go is untrue
     but it was quite an unofficial arrangement, was not it?
     - A. I do not know. That is between their chief steward
     and the fellow that told me.

Q.    May Ivfust ask you one matter about it? At half-past-2
     you were at the concertina gate? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. What would you have done if you had been told your duties
   were to stay there until the final whistle?- A. Me persÂ­
   onally, I would have stayed there.

Q. You were not interested in; ithet*match? - A. I have done it
   before, sir.

Q.   I am asking .... - A. No.   I   am interested in the game, yes,
     very interested in the game.

Q.    You see, I wonder if .... 0-  A. Now, if the crowd had have
     gone in orderly and gone in the way they should have done
     we would nave been able to see some of the game, not all

                                                              R. LLOYD

          of it, but some of it and then we would have helped out in
          any duty that we were there ....

     Q. Mr. Lloyd, I am not asking about Anfield because I expect
        that certain stewards have to miss the match every week,
        some some weeks.  I am wondering about you and your trip
        to Sheffield. You paid your own way there?- A. That is it.

     Q.   You were not being paid or reduced rates for the day and
          you missed the game completely? - A. I think I would have
          done if the chap had asked me to.

     Q.   In fact you went at half-past-2 to 3 o'clock of your
          own accord and stood somewhere else? - A. Yes, to stop
          an argument between me and one of their stewards.

     Q. And what were you doing at 3 o'clock? -A. I was standing
        in the area above the stands.

     Q. Just to get a glimpse of the game? - A. No, I was not
        watching the game.  I was watching the actual gate at
        half-past-2.

     Q. Mr. Lloyd, can you assist a little bit further? On the
        coach trip when the Liverpool supporters arrange for a
        steward from Liverpool to go, he is not acting as a
        steward of Liverpool Football Club, is he? - A. I do
        not think so. I think he is acting on behalf of the
        travel club of Liverpool Football Club which is run
        away from ....

     Q. What they do, is it not, is to find responsible people,
        and stewards invariably are, and ask them if for away
        matches they would help the supporters club to make sure
        the coaches are run properly? - A. Yes, I expect so.

     Q. That is a quite different function than travelling to an
        away ground and assisting the home stewards to steward
        the ground itself? - A. Yes, sir.

              MR. JACKSON:     Thank you.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Mr. Robertson, do you ---

              MR. ROBERTSON:     No questions.

                      Cross-examined by        MR. MAXWELL:

     Q. Mr. Lloyd, it may assist in establishing whether you
        were officially present or not if youjloÂ»k at the club's
        bundle at page 151.  It is the black folder. Do you see
        there a page with photocopies of what I take it are pay
        packets and I am referring you, please, to the bottom one
        on the page.  Is that your signature? - A. No, sir.

Q. Would you pass it to me for a moment? Would you have a
   look again, please, at page 151? I will invite you to
   look at p a g e 154 in a moment. - A. No, sir.

Q. Now, would you look at page 15....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         151?

          MR. MAXWELL:   I am sorry?

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Did you say 151?

          MR. MAXWELL:   151, My Lord, is the first one with
     R. Something Lloyd:

Q. Is it R.F. Lloyd? - A. R&J. Lloyd.

Q. R.J. Lloyd. - A. The way that one is,          yes.

Q. Is that your signature? -A. No.

Q. That is not your signature. Would you go to page 154?
   Is there another Lloyd signature on page 154?- A. Yes,
   my brother's.

Q. That is ysir brother's? - A. Yes.          That is his writing
   as well.

Q. That is his writing. - A. Yes.

Q. But the R.F. Lloyd .... -A. R.J.

Q. R.J. Lloyd is not your writing? -A. No.

Q. But somebody has evidently received, apparently received a
   payment and signed .... - A. No-one was given anything. He
   might have signed it on the expectation at the end of the
   game that he would get paid out that way and it might save
   problems but there was nothing, none at all. That is not
   my signature.

Q. That is not your signature.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: You are saying in view of what
     happened there was not any payment out. Is that right?
     - A. Yes, sir.

Q. That is what you are saying? - A. No payment whatsoever.

Q.Is this your brother signing for both of youtor what? - A.
   Yes, sir, by the looks ....

Q. Yes, well, not the first time that has happeaed, I should
   think? - A. As I say, we are brothers and we stick together,
   like.

                                                           R, LLOYD

    Q.        HR. MAXWELL: Mr. Lloyd, I am not making any
         criticism. There are there, I think, some 12 temporary
         stewards signatures. Do you recognise any other Liverpool
         stewards amongst them?-A. Sir, I do not know nine out of
         ten last names of stewards at Anfield.  I only know bosses
         and some of the people in the immediate vininity that
         work with me in a ....

    Q. Is the position at Anfield this, as I think your brother
       told Mr. Woodward earlier, that the stewards are quite
       confident enough to go on to the terraces to carry out
       their stewarding? - A. I think they are quite confident
       any way, sir. You know, they do a great job which I
       suppose you know some of them did on that day,.pointed
       out before by somebody asking was there any of our
       stewards on the pitch. Yes, there were stewards on
       the pitch who had gone down to see the game and then
       helped. They did not have to go on fcfeatppitch but
       they did.

    Q. Is the position this, that if the Liverpool stewards
       had been asked to go on to the West End Terraces,
       Leppings Lane Terraces, that would not have created
       any problem? - A. I do not think so.

             MR. MAXWELL:      Thank you.

                    Cross-examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

    Q. Mr. Lloyd, during your eight to ten years as a steward,
       did you receive any first aid training? - A. No, sir.

    Q. Did you receive any training or instruction from the
       fire service or the Police? - A. We have not but we
       have two meetings a year with fire, Police, Safety
       Officer of I think it is Liverpool City Council.

    Q. You attend those, do you? - A. Yes, twice a year.

             MR. KALLIPETIS:      Thank you.

                     Cross~examined by      MR. GLASGOW:

    Q. Mr. Lloyd,whatever the books may show I think the true
       position is that when you were offered payment you and
       your brother both said that any payment that you would
       have been entitled to you wanted to go into the Disaster
       Fund? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Yes. And you would not accept anything out of this game?
       - A. No, sir.

    Q. Because you wanted the money to gÂ© there? - A. Yes.

                                               B. SALES

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you, that is all.

     Mr. GOLDSACK:   Mr. Sales, please.       Sir, this is
the first of the turnstile operators.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Yes.

     Mr. GLASGOW:    Sir, before you start on these
witnesses, I wonder whether it would be helpful for
you and the Assessors simply to have a rather crude
diagram that we have drawn of the Leppings Lane end of
the ground identifying where everybody was, simply
for ease of reference, if it would be convenient for
you to have one.    Everybody else has got them and I
apologise that I did not have them distributed at the
right moment.     (Handed).

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.

                 BRIAN SALES, Called
               Examined by Mr. GOLDSACK:

Are you Brian Sales?    A.   Yes, sir.

Mr. Sales, on Saturdays do    you often act as aturnstile
operator?   A.  Yes, sir.

Both at Sheffield United and Sheffield Wednesday grounds?
A.  Yes, sir.

For how many years have you been doing Sheffield Wednesday
A. Approximately five years at Sheffield Wednesday.

How many semi-finals have you been present at in the
capacity of turnstile attendant?    A. I must have done
about seven, roughly seven    or eight, sir.

Was this ye a r 's different to the others?    A. Yes, sir.

What was the main difference?   A. Well, on a normal
semi-final which we have usually done, say about half-
past-two all the crowds have been in and it's just been
a steady flow up to the kick-off time, but the latest
one was just Bedlam.  We had never done at all.  People
just were coming and coming, and there was no stop to
them.

We will go through this year's in a little more detail
in a moment.  When you arrived at the ground this year,
did you receive any form of briefing?   A. We just get
a slight briefing.  Normally they give you instructions
as regards forged tickets but there wasn't any issued
this year at all.

Who was the briefing from?     A.   The head steward usually
gives them.
                              122



                                                      B. SALES

Q. Is that Mr. Thorpe?   A.  No, he's a chap called --- Well,
   the head steward is Mr. Basil...

Q.   Jones? Is it Basil Jones?   A. He wasn't the one       in
     question.  The one who usually gives the speech is     Mr.
     Roger Childs.

Q.   Did you receive any briefing from a policeman?    A.   No.

Q.   You say that nothing in particular was said this year
     about forged tickets?    A. No.

Q. Did you know what colour ticket you had to look out for?
   A.  No, they didn't, actually.  They usually have them
   when you go into the Stile Room on the dockets, they
   usually give you the colour of the tickets which you are
   taking, but there was none at all, no.

Q. Whereabouts is the Stile Room?      A.   You go through the
   players' entrance to it.

Q. Now, this year you were sent, I think, to Turnstile D?
   A.  Yes, sir.

Q. Which is the middle of the batch of seven, is it not?
   A.   Yes, sir.

Q. And the people coming through your turnstile should have
   had tickets for the standing area at Leppings Lane?
   A.  Yes, sir.

Q. Did you, up until about half-past-two, have any Liverpool
    supporters coming to your turnstile with tickets for
   the Nottingham end of the game?   A.  Yes, sir.

Q. Had you been given any instruction by anyone as to what
   you should do in those circumstances?   A. Yes, we was
   told to take the tickets, the Rop tickets that the
   Liverpool supporters had got, we was told to take them
   by the police officer.  He was a ranking officer..

Q. That is to say, you were to let Liverpool supporters in
   even if their ticket was for the Kop end?   A. Forest
   tickets, yes.

Q. Can you describe the police officer at all?   A. Yes,
   he does the Leppings Lane end regularly.  He's an
   Inspector and he has a bushy beard.

Q. Now, what time were you told by him to let those
   Liverpool supporters in?  A. Oh, up to about 2 o'clock.

Q. Was that something that he said to you individually or
   to a group of turnstile operators?   A. Well, he said it
   to the turnstile where I was and to the chap next to him,
   and to the Police Constable who was outside.
                              123



                                               B. SALES

Q. Now, did that instruction ever change?   A.   Yes, after
   a while he said "Don't let no more Liverpool fans in
   with Forest tickets.  We've got too many in."

Q. Can you help as to the time at which he told you that?
   A.  I'm sorry, no, I'm a big vague on the times because
   everything was happening, you know, and it wasn't a case
   of looking at my watch, you see.

Q. I appreciate that, Mr. Sales.  Can you help perhaps in this
   way?   Had you been letting people in for the wrong end
   for quarter of an hour, half an hour, an hour, or what?
   A.    About quarter to half an hour.

Q. Can you help at all as to the number of people who went
   through your own turnstile with the wrong ticket during
   that period?   A. I didn't have that many.  I should
   imagine there must have been about 30.

Q. 30 people who appeared to be Liverpool supporters ---
   A. With Kop tickets, yes.

Q.    Now, up until about half-past-two or so, did you have any
     people coming to your turnstile with no ticket at all?
     A.  Yes.

Q. How were they trying to get in?   A. Well, they were
   shoving a fiver on the counter and, you know, saying
   "Come on, let me in".

Q. And in the early stages, how did you deal with those?
   A. Well, there was a small police constable between my
   gate and the next one and when it happened, I just used
   to give him a shout.  At first, he started shoving them
   back out, you know, because we wasn't that busy at the
   time, and then when it was busy he used to let them
   through and I think he was turfing them out then.

Q. So that is when it has begun to build up?     A.   Yes.

Q. They are allowed in and identified but ejected - is that
   right?   A.  Yes.

Q. We know from many other witnesses already, Mr. Sales,
   that a time came when there was an enormous crush outside
   those turnstiles?   A. Yes.

Q. Can I deal with how you coped as those people went through
   your turnstile?   Did they all go through with tickets?
   A.  Not really, no.  The majority of them had tickets,
   but there was people pushing through and the turnstile was
   that jammed, they was just easing their way through, you
   know, through the crush, and they was jumping over the
   tops;  any way they could, they was getting in.
                                              B. SALES

Let me take those one by one.   When you say they were
jumping over the top, what do you mean exactly? A. Well,
they just cocked their leg over and they are over.    I
mean the turnstiles are not very high.    They just cocked
their leg over and they was in.   There was no way we
could do anything about it.

Can you help at all as to the number who went through
your turnstile that way?   A.  I couldn't give you the
number but it was quite a few.

Are we just talking about one or two?       A. Oh, no, more
than one or tw o .

Are you aware that in your turnstile area there is a form
of sensor device on the wall?   A. Yes.

Do you know whether that was operating properly in your
turnstile that day?   A. No, because I think it goes
into the Control Room somewhere.

You have n o      A. We have no way of finding      out
whether that's working or not.

Those people who jumped over your turnstile, would they
have been high enough to have been picked up in that
sensor? A.     I should imagine so, yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     That is what it is for,
presumably.

       Mr. GOLDSACK:   I beg your pardon?

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Presumably that is what it is
for.

     The WITNESS:  It just depends how far you want to
jump over.  I think it s about head high.

      Mr. GOLDSACK:  I ask for this reason, Mr. Sales:
We have got some figures printed by the computer which
show only one person going through your turnstile in that
way.   Now, in your view, is it possible that people jumped
over but at a height where they are below the sensor?
A.   Oh, yes, yes.  If they are just lifting their legs
over, anybody can just work their way over in the crush.

So that is people jumping ---

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   And it would not be picked
up by the sensor?   A. Yes, sir, yes.

You have to be an Olympic jumper to get on that, have you,
or what?    A. Not really.   I think one match that we
were working on down there was Tottenham Hotspur
supporters and they was bringing the flags over, you
know, and of course the Police stopped them. Well, they
(HSlV                                       125


                                                                     B. SALES

             stopped them but they was passing them over into our stile;
             they was passing the canes over into our stile which they
             had the flags on, and even that was going on the sensor,
             because they came down and they wanted to know what the
             problem was.

        Q.         Mr.   GOLDSACK:   So t h a t w a s   certainly   effective?
             A.   Yes.

        Q. Did everyone who went through your turnstiles at ground
           level go through one at a time?   A. At the beginning
           of the match they was quite orderly.

        Q. But when the crowd built up, were they all going through
           one at a time?   A.  Yes.

        Q. Right up until 3 o'clock? A. Oh, no, before that they
           were going in any way, any way they could.

        Q. You see, what I would like your help with is the number
           that went through without tickets.  Can you help us?
           A.  There was a few that went through without tickets
           but I couldn't give you any numbers because everything
           was just chaos.

        Q. To the best of your recollection, by what time was it
           chaotic at your particular turnstile? A.   I think, as
           near as I can remember - I haven't any official time -
           what we are talking about was about quarter-past-two
           when they started building up.

        Q. But at that stage were you still able to check individual
           tickets as people went through?   A. Yes, up to then,
           yes.

        Q. At what time were you no longer in control of the
           situation?   A. About half-past-twoish.   It might have
           been just a bit before.

        Q. You have mentioned that earlier there had been a policeman
           near to your turnstile?   A. Yes.

        Q. Did that person remain there?   A. No.  The Constable
           who was outside, who was quite a big fellow actually,
           was searching and checking tickets for the right and
           wrong ones, but when everything built up, I literally
           saw them just lifting him up outside the stile and he
           just disappeared.

        Q. After that, did you see another policeman or not?                    A. No,
           not outside, no.

        Q. I appreciate it is difficult, but can you help us as to
           the time that the policeman disappeared?   A.  No, I
           can't, I'm sorry, no.

                                                B . SALES


Q. But some time after half-past-two?   A. That's right.
   When the crowd was at its worst, I think he must have
   gone inside for his own safety then.

Q. After the policeman had gone, what did you do with those
   people who did not have tickets?   A. Well, there was
   still the one on the inside, the Sergeant on the inside,
   and he was just pulling them through.

Q. Were you still able to identify all those people without
   tickets?   A. Yes.




                         /Q.    Were they all still being
                                 B. SALES


Were they all still being thrown back out? - A. Yes, well
he was taking them on the inside.  There was no way they
could get out on the outside of the perimeter, they were
taking them on the inside way.

Were you able right up until 3 o'clock to point out to
the Police everyone who went through without a ticket?
- a . No the Police disappeared, well they went from the
inside.   I think it must have been when the gate was open
I don't really know this, but I think the Police went to
rush over to the gate to find out what was happening.

What was the first you knew of the gate opening? - A. Well
I had got a restricted view through one of the stiles
and I saw the gate open and it was just a mad rush, it was
a free-for-all Hiore or less.

After that gate had opened did any more people come through
your turnstile? - A. Yes, the turnstile crush eased off.
They were still coming through because they were saying
to one another:  "They have opened the gates" and they
were still coming in the stile but it had eased off.   I
don't know how long the gate was left open or when it was
shut and we had the turnstile crush again then.

Well now, Mr. Sales, can you help us at all as to the number
of people who you think went through your turnstile without
any ticket at all? - A. No, I could not give you any number,
no.

You can't relate it to anything else? - A. Without tickets?

Yes? - A. No, everything was chaos.   There was no way we
could have counted them.

By a few minutes before the gate opened were you still
checking tickets at all? - A. No, no, we were just taking
the full tickets off them and just checking the full length
ticket and just putting it on the side. They could not
get in fast enough and they weren't bothered about a stub#
they just wanted to get in and it was just a matter of
taking the ticket.

If you were still taking tickets can you give us some idea
of the proportion who did not have tickets? - A. No.
There was some but they were all pushing in together.

From your own position in the turnstile, what was your own
assessment of the behaviour of the crowd in that last half-
hour? - A. Well it was not very good at all. They were
diabolical.  I have never ....  I have worked some football
matches and I have never been in a situation like that.
It was terrifying.

                          Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON;

    Q. Mr. Sales, you were last year on the Spion Kop, were you
       not? - A. Yes.

    Q. When you go to work at the turnstiles are you given any
       instructions as to whether or not you can expect to be busy
       or quiet or very busy or very quiet or what? - A. Not really.
       On a normal league match the Police on duty outside might
       say there is a couple of thousand coming, you know, but not
       on a semi-final, no.

    Q. I suppose you would use your commonsense if Wednesday were
       at home to Manchester United, a big crowd? - A. Yes.

    Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     When you say 2,000 you mean ....
            Visiting supporters.

    Q. In all? - A. Not on a ticket game.          The gentleman said
       "a normal league game".

    Q. But you mean the total number of supporters might be 2,000,
       not those standing outside at one time? - A. No, the visiting
       supporters, yes.

    q   .         MR. JACKSON:  I want to ask you about the difference
            between 1988 and 1989. Were you ever told that you could
            anticipate through your turnstiles about three times as
            many people in 1989 as in 1988? - A. No sir, no.

    Q. If I told you after you had finished work in 1988:  "Have
       you had a busy day?" Notts. Forest and Liverpool again,
       you on the Kop end, what would you have said? - A. Well ---

    Q. Remember last year, capacity crowd, Spion Kop end, Notts.
       Forest and Liverpool? - A. On semi-final days they are an
       easy match to handle because everyone is in by half-past-2,
       no money to handle, just tear the ticket off.  They are
       really what you call a cushy job.

    Q. Because you expect all the crowd to have tickets and be
       a capacity crowd,  you can anticipate an easier day? - A.
       In my own opinion yes, I think so.

    Q. Would you be a bit surprised to know that you were expected
       in 1989, on average, to take three times as many people
       through your turnstiles as your had done in 1988? â A. No.

    Q. That would put a bit of a strain on any system, would it
       not? - A. Yes.

                  MR. JACKSON:   Thank you, Mr. Sales.


                          Cross-Examined by MR. GLASGOW:

    Q. May I ask you very briefly, Mr. Sales, I think at the
o?>
                                     129


                                            B. SALES


           beginning of every season you have a training session one
           evening? - A. Yes.

      Q. Can I put it to you very briefly, I am only concerned with
         your turnstile operators' training evening? - A. Yes.

      Q. I think you get a lecture from the Police on that evening?
         - A. Yes.

      Q.    Is it always the same Police Officer or does it change? -
           A. More or less, I think it is usually the same Police
           Officer, the one in charge.

      Q. You get a lecture from one of the Club Officials and I think
         that changes but always Mr. Lock? - A. Mr. Lock, yes.

      Q. And somebody else as well? - A. Well there is the Police,
         the Fire Brigade, the St. J o h n âs Ambulance.

      Q. The Fire Brigade come and tell you about their functions
         and usually an Ambulanceman as well? - A. Yes.

      Q.   You have those meetings at the beginning of every season?
           - A. Yes.

      Q. And before every game I think there is a brief, much shorter
         meeting at which you are addressed either by a Police Officer
         or a Club Official? - A. Every game?

      Q. Before, when you turn up? - A. Not before every game, no.

                 MR. GLASGOW:  I don't think there is anything else.
           Perhaps I can put the other matters to the other turnstile
           operators sir, thank you.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Thank you very much, Mr. Sales.
           I think we will break off now.


                        (The Inquiry was adjourned until
                         10 a.m. the following morning)

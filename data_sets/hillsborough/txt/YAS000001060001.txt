I received a call from                         wife at 1540 asking me if I
had been called in to a major incident, as I hadn't I phoned          the
phone was answered by my niece who said she had gone into HQ

On putting the phone down it rang it was             requesting me to
proceed to HQ due to a major incident.

Nurses, a nurse who said she couldn't get through to the Royal Hallamshire

and advised her to go in.

Several Doctors phoned in offering their services,

General Hospital.

I received a call from police (time?) saying they didn't require any
further ambulances, I informed             and then            in the
incident room Mr Page asked where the information came from.

I received a call from WYMAS asking us to contact their ambulances to stand

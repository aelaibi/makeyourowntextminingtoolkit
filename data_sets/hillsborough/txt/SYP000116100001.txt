I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently stationed at
Attercliffe C.I.D.

On Sunday 16 th April 1989 I was on duty at The Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street,
Sheffield.    My duties on that day were to identify bodies froa the Hillsborough
Incident*
The bodies that had not been identified were each given a number*       This number
coincided with a polaroid photograph that had been taken to the body*
                                                                    G
The photographs were displayed in a room within the Medico Legal        entre and
realtives of the deceased were asked to view the photographs*

If   m identification was made, then the body would be brought froa the mortuary
and placed into a viewing room.

The relative would then be asked to formally identify the body in my presence.
An identification statement and a form Gen 18 would then be completed in respect
of the body*

At 0920 hrs on that date I had body number 16 identified to me as that of Paul
MURRAY.     I eannot recall who identified the body to me,   T M original notes are
with The investigation team (West Midlands Police)

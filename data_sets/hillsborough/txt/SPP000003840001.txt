1 Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;          3 I need thy presence every passing hour;
  The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!         W hat but thy grace can foil the tempter’s power?    1 The Lord’s my Shepherd, I’ll not want;         3 Yea, though I walk through death’s dark vale,
  When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,        Who like thyself my guide and stay can be?                he makes me down to lie                         yet will I fear none ill;
  Help of the helpless, O abide with me.             Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me.           In pastures green; he leadeth me                 For thou art with me, and thy rod
                                                                                                               the quiet waters by.                            and staff me comfort still.
2 Swift to its close ebbs out life’s little day;   4 I fear no foe with thee at hand to bless;
                                                                                                          2 My soul he doth restore again,                  4 My table thou hast furnished
  E arth’s joys grow dim, its glories pass away;     Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
  Change and decay in all around I see;              Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy victory?      and me to walk doth make                          in presence of my foes;
  O thou who changest not, abide with me.            I triumph still, if thou abide with me.                Within the paths of righteousness,                My head thou dost with oil anoint,
                                                                                                             e’en for his own name’s sake.                     and my cup overflows.

                     5 Hold thou they Cross before my closing eyes;                                                                     5 Goodness and mercy all my life
                       Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies:                                                                 shall surely follow me;
                       Heaven’s morning breaks, and earth’s vain shadows flee;                                                            And in G od’s house for everymore
                       In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me!                                                                           my dwelling-place shall be.

             I am A d r i a n Crawley,        31 yrs     of age d.o.b,                            P olice C o ns t a b l e

             2761      in the S ou t h Y o rk sh ir e Police.

             At S am on S a t u r d a y       15th April      1989    I c o mmenced duty at A t t e r c l i f f e

             Po l i c e Station,       S h e f f i e l d having   been s el ec te d     for duties         in relation

             to the F .A . Cup Semi           Final    tie?, to be         played at H i l l s b o r o u g h F oo tball

             Stadium,      Sheffi eld      that    day between Liv er po ol           F C and N o t t i n g h a m Forest

             FC.

             At 9am      I a t t e n d e d at the force       driving       school, j ^ i g h t s i d e Lane,

             S h e f f i e l d for a briefing wit h         regards        to jrr^ides i g na t e d duties,        traffic

             control.        Initially        I was   in a reserve          unit,    on s t an db y at B r i gh t si d e

             Lane.

             A bout     12 noon that       day    I went    to F i t z a l l a n Square,      Sheffield         to assist

             w ith traffic        control.        About jl.30 pm that           day I was         conveyed back        to
B ri g h t s i d e Lane        for a meal.

About 3 pm that                day the meal was             i nt er ru pt ed and        I was       i nstructed

along with other                 officers         to get    into our       transit       vans.        We were          then

co n veyed at           speed to H i l l s b o r o u g h Stadium.

About 3 . 1 Q pm that day we a r r i v e d at H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m.                           We drove

to the       rear       of the N o r th S tand where we debussed.                            I made my way onto

the     pitch.          At this         time    I could see a large                 number   of Liverpool

S u p p o r t e r s mill in g        on the       pitch at the L ep pi ng s Lane               end of the ground.

At    this     point         I was      instr uc te d by an        Inspector          (details       not known)             to

s ta n d at the Hop End of the g r o u n d , facing                            the N o t t i n g h a m For est         fans.

At this        stage         I did not         know what     the   sit ua ti on was at              the    opposite

end of the ground.                      Eventually       I saw Police O ff ic er s and mernebers of

the    public          carrying         bodies     from the opposite               end of the        ground,         on

a dv e r t i s i n g    boardings.             The N o t t i n g h a m fans were        taunting          the

Liverpool           fans,      w it h    chants a nd s ho uting           obscenties.           The a t m os p he r e

was    highly          charged a n d       I feared that a serious                    public    order          s i tu at io n

w o ul d arise at an y time.                     I was     still   unaware          of the nature              of the

incident at             the o pp osite          end of the       ground        .    Several     of the L iv erpool

fans     broke a wa y from               carrying      the m a k e s h if t     stret ch er s and          ran at         the

Nottingham             fans,    m an y    of w hom     rushed at         the       perimeter    fencing           in an

atte mp t      to      reach the L iv erpool             fans.     At     one      point a gang           of

Nottingham             fans a t t e m p t e d to open a gate              in the       perimeter          fe ncing        to

gain entry onto                the      pitch.      T og et he r w it h other          officers       1 step pe d

forwards         to the        gate,      intending        to stop these             fans.     I co mm en ce d         to

draw my staff                from my trousers.             H o we ve r    the N o t t i n g h a m    fans       s t ep pe d

back     from the g a t e .              I st opped      back    several        yards    onto the          pitch,         as

missiles,           coins and the              like were     being       t hr o wn at us.

Eventually             our    1 ine was        relieved by other           officers and             their       dogs.

T here     had been several                lo udspeaker a n n o u n c e m e n t s       r equesting            calm,      and

the    tension at             the    'k o p ' end seemed         to eased.
                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                    S2934

I then made my wa y together with several                         other      officers,    along     the

front      of the S ou th S ta nd to the L ep pi ng s Lane                  end of the ground.

1 of     course       realised at this          time that a serious            s ituation exis te d at

this     stand,       I did not know the             cause.

There were          still a      large     number    of people     on the      pitch,    a l t h o u g h by

this     time      people      had star te d to leave         the ground.

I saw that          bodies were        still    being    placed onto         stetchers    and m a ke sh if t

stretchers,           1 helped      place    sej^ral     of these      onto them.

I was     then      i nstructed by             officer    (details      unknown)      to go to the

S o u t h Stand,         the   players     entrance.      By this      time most      of the      persons

on the      pitch were          leaving.

I went      to the        players    tunnel     in the S o u t h S t a nd where a crowd of

Liv e r p o o l    s u pporters     had gathered.         T hey were        shouting abuse at

persons       in the S o u th Stand.            I am of the o p in io n that many of these

were    drunk.

One youth tried to kick me after                       I had a sk ed    him to leave        the    pitch.

I took hold of him to ar re st                  him,    however an      Inspector       told me     to      let

him go.           This    I did,    an d   e v en ut al ly this   crowd      left the    pitch.

I was     then      i nstructed      to    return to my van at          the    rear   of the S o u t h

Stand,      my unit was          there     i nstructed to make         our way to the         c^ity centre

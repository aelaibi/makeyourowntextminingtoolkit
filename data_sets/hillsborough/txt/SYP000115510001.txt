 At       2 . 5 0 pm    (1450)          I received             a    radio       message          from       the        match          control            to

 and        12 M o u n t e d          officers       from Merseyside.

 The       Leppings              Lane    entrance             was     being       used      for       the L i v e r p o o l

 Upon        our       arrival          at    Leppings             Lane     1 saw a         large          crowd           of    between

 through           the       turnstiles.                 The       turnstiles           were      divided              into          two

the        people           appeared          to    be    under          control.           The       smaller              of    the       two

them     from'behind.                  I could          see       that      the     people        at    the     front         were

under       extreme          and      unbearable             pressure           against         the w a l l s       and

turnstiles?               in the       crush       I saw several                  young      children,,            some       of w h o m

were     pulled           from      the     crowd       by M o u n t e d        officers          and    carried             to    safety.

M a n y of       the      large       g ro u p who       had        caused        the      crush       had    only       arrived           in

the    previous            "15 m i n u t e s ,     they were              badly      affected           by    drink          and     in a

•ffffinco-opera'tive                      and     foul       temper.

Along       with        other       Mounted        officers            at    the     scene        I began          to    use       my

horse       to     force       an     entry       between           the     element, a t          the    b ack      and       the

innocent           people        at    the       front?       during         t his      operation            I was       genuinely

and    gravely            concerned          for       the    people         at     the    front,        I was          sure       that       if

the    situation             was      not    resolved             then      som e    people        would        be at         the       very-

least       badly         injured.

Whilst        myself         and      the    other       officers            were       attempting            to m o v e          the

unruly        element          from       the     back       of    the      people        being        crushed          PC    Kerry

went     to      the      gates       between          the    turnstiles             and     Leppings          L a ne,        he     u sed

his    horse        to     drive       b ack      the    youths           who     were     charging           up    behind           the

people        at    the      turnstile            and    then        closed         the    gates,.           This       had       very-

little        effect        -as m a n y      of    them       climbed           over      the     fencing          at    the       s i des

of    the     gate       and     into       the    turnstile              area-.,

the    ground without                 a ticket.               The     walls         were     about       IS*       high       but       this

did    not     deter        these       youths          from       climbing          o ver      and     into       the       ground,

the       scenario           to     one       of    a m e d ieval            battle.

Many        of    those        at    the       back       seemed           to     think          it    was        amusing           to    push        the

people           at    the     front          and       I would           describe            their          attitude           as       being        one

of     having          great        fun at          taking           part i n -such a                   canfrontation.

At     one       p o int     I had        put       my    horse           into       the c r o w d      to     split           it,        I then

 had      been        sav e d .      At       the       time        I thought            t his        was      an      excellent              decision

 as    it    had       undoubtedly                 saved        the       lives        of     some         people.

 During          the     whole       of       the       "time that           I was          at       this      incident             I saw about

 EDO      people         standing             watching              the    crush,           it w a s         obvious          t hat       these

 people          did     not      have        a    tic k e t ,       periodically                    s ome     of      them wou ld             seise

 similarly             when       the     gate          wa s    opened          all      of      them        ran        forward           and

 through          the      gate.

 After       the       2-300Q        crowd          had        cleared          at     Leppings. L a n e                 I along          with        the

 other       Mounted           officers             at     the       scene        were        directed              to    Gae        ’O ’ on

                At S.00am (0800)      on Saturday 15th April          1989 <150489),       officers from

             and lager at th                                      Southey Green Rd

             At 2.50pm <1450)      the^J^ist of the supporters were leaving the public

             house and were n^rfTing their way to Hillsborough,           some seemed worried

             that they might miss the kick-off and so began to run down Halifax Rd

             to Hillsborough.

             At 3.00pm <1500), as few supporters remained on Halifax Rd, Serial 42

             made its way towards Claywheels Ln for a meal/fireak.               As we reached
ot/oLioe
             the junction of Halifax Rd and ClaywheeLrlLn we met other serials

             rushing to the ground at Hi 1 lsborooffi, saying all officers were

             needed.     At this time the Serial was unaware of exactly what was

             happening, we knew only ojP^a pitch invasion.          On a rriving at the

             Leppings Ln entrance>£o the ground,        the turnstiles were closed and

             we were i n s t r u c t s to prevent supporters from entering the ground.

             Fire and Ambulance services began to arrive, most entering the ground.

               I did however, witness      injured people b e / t r e a t e d    outside the
                                         Cat
             ground.     Once it was announced over                   address system that the

             football match had been cancelled.             for supporters to evacuate the

             terraces,    people began to 1eaye in numbers.        We remained outside the

             ground throughout, maintaii£ing order on Leppings Ln until the crowds

             had dispersed.

             At 5 . 3 0 pro <1730)r Serial 42 was positioned at the junction of Leppings

             Ln and Penistone Rd in order to control traffic f}ows and prevent

             unnecessary congestion.                    _           i.s _ _     _ ^

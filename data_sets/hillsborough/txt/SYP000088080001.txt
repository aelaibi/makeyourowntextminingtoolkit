actually         on the A57,                 a n d we        used       the        toilets.              We    eventually              got     to

Sheffield             at    about        2.15       pm    (1415)         and        it    took        10-15 minutes                   to    find

somewhere             to    park.           We    eventually                   parked           on a m a i n          road, o n l y a b o u t £

anybody        doing         a    lot       of    drinking.                 I just        saw      the        odd     person with a

either        outside            or    in si d e       the     g ro un d .
          Because        of     the      c haos        outside              thjsr' g r o u n d        it     took    us at       le ast         10 to          15

          minutes        to     get      through            the        turnstiles                 and      eventually           we    got       to    our

          Dositions           on the/ t e r r a c e s / ^ i a                the         tunnel         at    about       E.45       pm    (1445),

          having        h a n d e d myV t i eke J/ to                  the       collector              in the       *B*    entrance

          turnstile.               At    no     time        di d       I    see        any    g at e       open     other       than a turnstile

          nor     did    I see          anybody            getting            into         the     ground         except        through a

          t u r n s tile.



          Because        I ’ve      been        to     the       ground               before       I Knew where              I was         going        to a n d

          through        the       tu n n e l     with        lots          of        other       people       towards          the       terrace          but

Things       are     very       vague      but        eventually                   I ended        up    on    the    grass          m        the

with    and went           to     look     for        them       but        two      Policemen           took       me    back          to    the

grass       and     laid me        down.




I can       remember           when      I wa s       on    to p       of     theXence             looking          b ac k     down          on    thf

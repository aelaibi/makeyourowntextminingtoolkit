                                                                                     /

                I am a Police Constable          in the S Yorkshire Police,       at present

                stationed at Rawmarsh.



                At 8.00am        (0800)   on Saturday 9th April     1988,    I commenced duty at

                Rawmarsh Pol S t n .



                At 9 . 45am (0945),        the same day,    I paraded for duty     in company with

                other Officers at Hillsborough Football Ground for                 the FA Cup semi­

                final between Nottingham Forrest v Liverpool.



                At about       10.15am (1015),    the same day,     1 commenced    foot patrol duty on

                Penistone Rd, Hillsborough,          approximately one mile        from the ground.      I

                continued this duty until about 6.00pm              <1800),    the same day, when we
                                                                          PAGE   2
                                                                          S3211B

         were called to return to the ground for de-briefing.



         I did not see any crowd trouble during the day in relation to the

         ground, as I took no part   in the policing of the ground.

The    time we a r r i v e d at              the       coach         park was     1245 hrs.

Once we got               off the        coach we w a l k e d to the ground,                        1 did not                              see

anyone         consuming alcohol                    or any drun k e n e s s whilst              I was walking.

We did not              receive any direc t i o n s                   or escort         from the Police                                   but. on

route      there were              numerous          o f f icers about watching                 the                crowd.

I a rr i v e d at          the L e p p i ng s Ln e n t rance                to the ground at about                                         1200

hrs    (1300).            My ticket was              for       the    terraces and           I had to use entrance                                        8

at    that      time       there were            no queues at              the turnstiles,

I did not enter                   the    ground strai g h t away as we had a r r a n g e d                                                to meet a
friend at          the entrance.            His      name                                    » I think               he    lives at

                                                                               We waited for

the     road,      we were          sitting     on the      bridge wall.

After a bout            13 minutes- -a P o l i c e m a n         came up to us to. move                         off the

wall.        We   then w a l k e d over a n d s tood              near       to the t u r n s t i l e s . We had

only     been s t a nding            there when a m o u n t e d officer told us to get                                       in the

ground        if we had a ticket                or clear         off,      if we h a d n ’t he was                        quite

rude     to us.

1 w ould          like to say at this time                  the Police were                      telling         everyone          to

stay on the             ground       side of the        road.       They didr." t tell- people                             to queue

but     just stay           on that side of the             road,           I did           see a      lot of             people

disobey these               i n s t r uctio ns an d     cross     back ever                 the road to stand                     by

tickets           cut   I   didn't       see any at         the entrance.

I did not sea               an y stewards at          the    turnstiles.               Once        i   had ent& ea                ti'.a

by the entrance                to the tunnel           under      the West Stand.

I had had no d i f fi cu lt y                in finding my entry                     point or getting                      into    the

ground and e n t ering                 via a turnstile,

I   did see a gate                 op e n e d just    to the      right of the turnstiles,                                 but that

was m a n ne d by a stew a r d a nd he was                       only allowing police                           Officers          in

and then shutting                   it behind them.          I did not see anyone                              gaining

Whe n    I    entered         I handed my ticket             in and          I have          lost the stub.

Once     inside         the    ground      I did not see any signs or any                                  people giving

until    a bout    -14*15 hrs       (1415)               did not show up,             so we 'walked, along

the    tunnel,     there were           no o bs t r u c t i o n s    in the tunnel        a l t hough       it was

crowded.       I ex i t e d from        the tunnel          and turned to the            right       into Pen 3.

T here were       no Police         or Stewards          evident at this              point.        As -soon as           I

e n te r e d the terracing,             I observed          it was already full,               so    I tried       to

turn ar o u n d and         return back down the                tunnel.       This was     impossible             owing

to the volume          of    people       still     pouring         onto the terrace from                 it.

1 was    just     pushed until            I ended up near             the front        of the       right-hand

side    of pen 3.           At this       time    it was      reasonably empty and all 3 of us

found space        in order         to view the          game,       it became more and more-

crowded,       until      by about        -1445 i I was       pacKSG +uJ.i, ai thougn net

d a n g er o u sl y so,      i    was    not subject         to any      crowd crush at             tnat    time.         ,l

was    still    standing wit h my brother and friend.                             I did not witness any

The    girl    d i r ectly       in front of me          passed out ana a man was                    trying       to

hold her up.         I couldn't           see    their      faces     but the girl        slipped          right

down and w ou ld have fallen onto                      the    floor      if the man h a d n ’t held her

up.

I was    unable      to move my           left arm       it was       trapped down by my side.                    The

same man       that was          holding       the girl      up told me to lean on him but                        1

d i d n ’t because        ha was alre a d y s tr u g g l i n g         to keep the girl              up. All          I

can say about          him was          that    he was white,          stocky build 5*8,              mousey

b ro w n short     hair.         I cannot       remember what          he was wearing.

                                                                                                        S3 3 9

At    this stags         I could see my brother                 had been pushed down a few steps

in front me and                           «s     a few behind me.                        a p pe ar ed to be

alright       but    I could hear _________ screaming.

After    that       it got worsa. 'and 'worse for                several         minutes.      1 did not see

any barrier          break.        I did see that             some    people near         the front and to

my    left    had m an a g e d to get a gate               open onto        the pitch,        but a Police

officer       kept      closing     it and w o u l d n ’t let          them onto the pitch until

a b o u t 5 m in u t e s    later when he must                have    realised what was           happening.

S o o n after       this    the     m a t c h was stop p e d and           the    crush became less

intense.         I looked over            to my left       a n d about 5 metres awa y I saw                   some

bodies       of m e n    lying      on top of each other.

As the       crush became           easier 1 m ov e d      to the          fence    separating Pen 3          with

Pe n H and       I was      helped over          into    that.       We tnan went        to go onto     the

pitch but        it was      vary busy           w i th the      dead and        injured being taken onto

the    pitch ‘through         it,

I than went          onto    the    pitch and         sat down,            I was    in a severe       state of

shock and        I just      star t e d    crying.         A few      people       came over ana hsloed m

over    towards         the S o u th Stand where              the Nott i ngharn supporters            were,

Some    of them then gave                us some      drinks.

I h a v e n ’t seen the           girl    that    past out       sines and          I don't    know    if she

is dead or alive.             However,           we     did get an ad v e r t i s i n g board and use            th

as a s t retcher           to assist.

I left       the ground at about               16255 hrs       <1625).           I left of my own accord.

After     the    game      had been stopped             the    police acted q u i c k l y        in assisting

the    crowd.

I think       the    cause was          that   there were        just      too man y      people allowed

through the          tunnel       and    if the side          fences were          not   there we would

have    been able          to spread cut.

1 did not witn e s s any                criminal      offences        or    person stealing         property

from the        dead and      injured.

              After     leaving          the    ground we went         to the      coach and then returned home,.

              During         the    crush      1 received severe           bruising to my    ribs and on

                     The provision of both mounted and dogs to the fixture on the above
                     date has been discussed with F Division. The requirerrent is for
                     36 horses and 40 dogs.

                     Barnsley also play this date against Birmingham City in the league
                     and request a reduced number of 4 horses and 4 dogs.

                     I am informed that South Yorkshire will supply 2 horses and 4 dogs
                     to Barnsley and 16 horses and 20 dogs to Hillsborough. We therefore
                     require to import 22 horses and 20 dogs for the fixture and these
                     have been provisionally arranged as follows:-

                     Humberside Police                      2    horses          Barnsley fixture
                     Merseyside Police                     12    horses          Semi-Final
                     Nottinghamshire Constabulary           8    horses          Semi-Final
                                                            8    dogs            Semi-Final
                     West Yorkshire Police                 12    dogs            Semi-Final

                     I therefore request approval for this mutual aid. The necessary
                     confirmatory correspondence will then be prepared.

  1.   NOTTINGHAM FOREST

 Five special trains carrying Nottingham Forest supporters will arrive at Midland
 Station; the tineswill not be available untilthe week of theserri-final and
 therefore will be given at briefing.

 Each train has a capacity of 550.

 The fare for these        special trains is inclusiveof the busfareto theground.

 SYT will run buses     frcm the Station to the ground using aroute a Ion:Penistone Road
 and unloading in Merries Road South; these buses will be under motor cycle escort.

  After the match a similar operation will take place to return Nottin3-jam Forest
^supporters to the railway station , loading in Penistone Road North opposite the

 There is the facility to delay the trains in the event of extra tire being played.




 2.    LIVERPOOL

  3   special trains carrying Liverpool supporters will arrive at Wa±=ley Bridge

 Each train has a capacity of 55D.

 Departure times will also be given at the briefing.

 Affiiin there is a facility to delay the trains in the event of extra time being
 W>yed.

 As the support for Liverpool is widespread, it is anticipated that supporters will
 travel by service train from all parts of the country to Midland Railway Station.
 Arrangements have therefore been rrede for those arriving at Midland Station to be
 transported by SYT buses to the ground by a route separate from that used by Nottingham
 Forest supporters, travelling along Langsett Road, Middlewood Road end arriving at
 Leppings Lane wt^ere they will unload.

 At the end of the game, SYT buses will be available to return any person arriving in

                                    COACHES


LIVERPOOL


    1       A2J. Liverpool coaches should leave the Ml Motorway at E>c: 36
             'Tankers ley) and travel via the A61 to designated parkinr areas.

   2        The geographical location of Liverpool, coupled with the countrywide
             support enjoyed by the Club, suggests that coaches coulc well approach
             trie stadium by other routes, particularly the A616. If ttis is the
             case, then they must be brought to the designated coach perking area.

   3        The serials engaged on duty at Tankersley and CXigfitibridoE will
             operate selective stop and search procedures to ensure (= passengers
             herve tickets, (b) they are not in possession of alcohol =sd (c)
             z n e y are not drunk. When this has been done, each coach will have
             s r. adhesive sticker placed on the nearside of the windscreen and it

fOEE:     Item 8 above outlines the contractual agreement between the
focrball supporter and the Club. It does not create a power to search
and any search must be with the consent of the individual supporter.
Ref-jsal is merely a bar to entering the ground and not a criminal offence.
Wjere a search is conducted with consent, it is a search within the
meaning of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. Section 3(i) of the
Act requires an officerto rrake a record of the search in writing unless
it is not practicable to do so and large scale searches such as those at
focrball matches fall within this section. There is not therefore a
requirement to ccrrplete a Form PACE/ 1.

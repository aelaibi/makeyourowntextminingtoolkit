 IN THE DEATHS, OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 TO MATCHES BEFORE WHERE THERE’S BEEN A CRUSH AND PEOPLE HAVE JUST CLIMBED

 ONTO THE PITCH.

 AFTER THE LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT BY DALGLESH.

 Oijj^lY O W N ACCORD.

 NO.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS       ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED, AFTER THE MATCH       WAS STOPPED?

 I THINK EVERYTHING WAS HANDLED AS BEST AS IT COULD. THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS

 T^jT FENCE.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 •1. I D O N ’T THINK THE FOOTBALL GROUNDS   SHOULD HAVE PERIMETER FENCING.

 2. A GREATER TICKET ALLOCATION SHOULD       GO TO THE TEAM WHO HAS   GREATER NUMBER

 OF SUPPORTERS.

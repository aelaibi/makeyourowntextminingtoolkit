       Dear Sir

       I refer to previous correspondence, and in particular my letter to you of 24* July (copy
       enclosed) which detailed the statements and parts of statements which we have still not
       received.

       Despite reminders and a telephone conversation there is a substantial amount of material
       outstanding, and this causes great concern. I have, therefore, requested Maria Eagle MP to
       help us expedite matters and I know that she has been in touch with you.

       I trust that this matter can be resolved quickly and I look forward to an early reply.

       Yours faithfully

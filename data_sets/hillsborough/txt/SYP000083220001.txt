         f ive    or    six      bus e s        had        passed       our      position,             and      the       passengers             ha d

         alighted           I began         to       notice          they were             being       approached              by    other

         From     this       I assumed               they were             enquiring             about        spare        tickets,,             As     more

         hundred.           At     this         point          I began advising                     the      bus     passengers             to    keep

         their     tickets            in    their           pockets          until         they       reached           the    ground        so as           no'

         to    t ake    the      risk       of       loosing          them       or    having          them        stolen.




         The     buses       contained               a wide          range       of    supporters               of      both     sexes       and        all

         ages,,        They      were       generally                well       behaved          and       many were           singing           as     the;

         walked        past      us.        A       few were          carrying             cans       of     beer/lager             but     when

         spoken        to   they        returned               these       cans       to    their          b us e s .      The      majority            had

         been     drinking            but       1    did       not    see       a n y at        this       stage        who    were       drunk.

         Many     of    the      supporters                 were      in a t a l k a t i v e           mood        and     intimated             they

across          the        open       ground         towards          the       tunnel        which      lea ds       under       the m i d d l

of    the       W Stand            large        numbers          of L i v e r p o o l         Supporters           were       hurling

abuse          at     us.        These         fans     were       the m o s t          violent        and abusive             I h av e         eve

seen.           They        were       kicking,            punching             and     spitting        at      us.      We    were

hopelessly                 outnumbered.                  I s till          did    not      have       any    idea w h a t         was

Liverpool              supporters               were       not     as      gr e a t .      Up    unt i l     t hi s     point       I ha d

assumed             that        the    assistance               required          was      due    to     fighting           inside           the

ground          but        at    t hi s     p oi n t    I saw         other       O f f i c e r s,     and      supporters           carryin

what       appeared              to    be      unconscious              fans      through         the       tunnel       we    were

walking             down.         As      we    neared          the     e nd     of     the     tunnel       and      the     terraces             I

could          see     f a ns     who       were       involved            in m i n o r       scuffles          among       themselves

still          remember           the       taunts         of,     “Y O U ’R E T O O F U C K I N G           LATE       NOW

any      i de a w h a t          had      happened,             but     I cannot           recall       ever       having         seen a

more       violent              crowd and            I was       stil l         very      frightened.




As    we       came        out    onto         the     terraces,            and       paused      in an >Tttempt               to

             from       the     others         and    I could          not     see       them.         I again attempted                     to      form       a

             I spoke          to    the       ambulance          m a n wh o        was    sitting           in the      front        and     he       told

             was      blue      and was         not       breathing          but     he    pointed           to      the     rear     of     the

had    happened             inside         the     ground.             I did     not/have              a    r a dio        but     Sergeant

LINDOP       informed             us    what       was      being       passed        by     now.           There          were        no

fans    booed          and       jeered.




The    Serial          by    now       was    almost          back      as     a Unit        although                I noticed              PC    GOSS

was    missing.



We    made        our       way back           to C l a y w h e e l s LN,      along        Penistone                 R D N.             Some

Once    at    the       junction             of C l a y w h e e l s      LN     and       N i a g a r a we           stopped           and       stood

beside       a wall.              As    the      Liverpool             fans     passed           by    us       they       were        shouting

abuse       and    s ome         were      restrained            by     their        fellow           supporters.                  All

attempts          to    be       civil       towards         them were           met       with        abuse.              When        an

emergency          number          was       announced           myself         a n d PC         3234 COBB                visited           every

coach       parked          on    the      Claywheels            LN a nd        informed              the       drivers           of    the

coaches       of       this       number.           We      s t i ll   were      constantly                 being          threatened              and

abuse       was    being          shouted          in our        direction.                Once        all       of       the     Coach

drivers       had       been       informed            of    the       number        we    began           to    t al k     with        what       few

Liverpool          supporters                would       spe ak.         This        number           grew       and       eventually              the

majority          calmed          down.          Some       were       even     taken        to       the       traffic           garage          to

use    the    telephone/toilet.                          Gradually             the    buses           began          to    disperse

except       for       those       who       had    passengers               missing.             Many          of    the       Liverpool

supporters             stated          that      the     Liverpool             Chairman           had a n n o u n c e d            on       the

They       strongly          denied       t hi s      stating          t ha t       the    g ate      had    been       opened.          Ma

were       fearful       of w h a t       they        described               as    a    ’ cover      up'.




As    a    result      of w h a t        these        supporters               had       said,     a n d as       a    result      of m y

own       feelings       1    returned           to       the    traffic            garage       where       1    completed         a fu

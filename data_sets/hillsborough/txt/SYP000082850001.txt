at    how many        people were            trying       to    rush      in.



Everything           seemed        to become        ex t r e m e l y    confused at           this    time.



S e r geant    B O O T H joined me              outside        the P o r t a c a b i n and we went            to    the

enclosure.           Fans         came    to the gate           requesting            entry    into    the W Stand,,

Conversely           fans were           approaching           from behind wit h N S t a n d              tickets

fans    were        entering           thro u g h Gate A they star t e d                to    run and were          pushint

each other           in the        back.        About     this     time     I heard a cheer             go up from

t h e f a n s a 1 r e a d y in t h e S t a n d s .             It really         s u r p r is e d m e a n d 1 t h o u g h t

the teams must               be    comi ng out       onto       the     pi t c h „ and       that ther'e

were    still       a lot of            people     trying       to get      into       the Football         Ground.         As

soon as       the fans            heard the        cheer       they star t e d to            run faster       and    push

ea c h other more.



At    this    time        the S t e w a r d s     on the       small     gate where           I was    standing

seemed to be getting                     very a g i t a t e d and        flustered.            Sergeant       B O O T H was

vetting       tickets            for    them and     I was       helping         to    let    fans    thro u g h    the

           him not        to be so stupid and to go round to                                 the    gate where           1 would           let

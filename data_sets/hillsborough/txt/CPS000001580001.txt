     Dear Sirs

     RE: ADLINGTON V. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

     Attached is a copy of our latest letter to the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

     The Crown Prosecution Service is now ready to give you voluntary disclosure of the
     documents in our possession on the same basis as for the other parties to this private
     prosecution. It is a matter for you whether you wish to accept this offer or not.

     In order to assist you I have enclosed a copy of the Schedules of the material in our
     possession at this office.

     Please contact me to arrange a date and time for any required inspection of these
     documents.

     Yours faithfully



     George R Croston
     Prosecution Team Leader

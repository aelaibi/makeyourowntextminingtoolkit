   Dear Ctoj

   thank you for your letter o f the 12th acknowledging receipt of my submission

   I would advise that the 28* December date of my submission letter was not intentional ( to
   infer earlier submission than “actual” etc.) - 1 had simply forgotten to change the date on the
   word processor!

   I would confirm that the submission was sent “special delivery” for safe keeping and was
   despatched on the 7&January 1998, the day before you received it

   Regards,       a




   Trevor Hicks

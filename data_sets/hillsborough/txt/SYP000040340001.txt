   Dear Sir

   Further to my letter and our telephone conversation of 25 Septembmer 1989, I
   enclose the copy of a questionnaire taken from                     (22 yrs) in
   connection with the Hillsborough disaster. You will see from the questionnaire
   that         irrived at the ground at about 2.15 pm on 15 April 1989. and alleges
   he saw a Police Officer at what he describes as the
              accepting money from supporters to enable them to gain access into
    :ne ground via that gate - Questions 24 and 52 refer.

   While I appreciate this is at a later time and different location to the
   incident you are currently investigating on behalf of South Yorkshire Police,
   Gates A and B are, as you know, only a short distance apart and tha two
   incidents may therefore be related.

   Dealing with Questions 7, it will be saen that                   rent to the game with the
   following peoples-

   1.                               Same Address.
   2   .                                             Liverpool
   3.                                                 Liverpool
   4.                                                   Liverpool

   None of these, with the exception of            has been interviewed in
   connection with the disaster. A copy of the questionnaire relating to|
         Ls included for your information, but appears to take the matter no
   further.


                                                                             Continued...




   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT              NECHELLS GREEN POLICE STATION
                                       2.


For your information the questionnaire came to notice during a manual analysis
of some 7,500 lower priority questionnaires which commenced shortly after the
West Midlands Police were invited by South Yorkshire Police to conduct the
joint Criminal/Discipline aspects of the investigation and concluded just prior
to your request to me for a copy of the composite video and a statement.

If as a result of your enquiries you are satisfied the two incidents were
unconnected, the papers should be returned immediately with any supporting
documentation to the Incident Room, Nechells Green, where we will complete the
investigation.

Please note that a copy of this letter with copies of the questionnaires by
      and his mother have also been forwarded to Deputy Chief Constable South
Yorkshire Police for his information and a copy of our letter to him is
included for your file.

Yours faithfully




R Taylor
Detective Superintendent

I was      stood             in f r o n t         of    the       barrier           towards          the      bottom          I d i d n ’t feel

that      I was          in a n y        immediate                danger.            I w a s n ’t        crushed,             no m o r e       t h a n -a

normal         big       match,          neither             were        the       people       around         me.           I heard          someone

say move          back         people             are       dyi n g ,        but    no'one          n e ar    to    me       believed          that

that      was     what         was       happening.                     Whe/s' I got           to    the      top       of    the       pen    I was

helping          people            to    climb          up       in^"6 the          stand.           I helped            up a b o u t         6 or 7

people         and       then       I was          giv&f* a             leg    up a n d        I climbed            into        the      sta n d .

moved      back          a    bit       once       ¥ got into the s t a n d b e c a u s e                           people          were       s t ill

                                                            on the           pitch and          I waved            to    them.           I had       been

up      there     a b aiyy€^ 110 m i n u t e s                before          I n o t i c e d them.            I first             saw        them       on

the      te r race           and    the n t h e y             climbed          onto       the pitch.               I         remember seeing

at      least     one         ambulance                on     the       pitch,       and       it     seemed           a long      time       before

it a r r i v e d .            There          were       a     lot       of    people       on the        pitch,              walking about

and      quite       a       lot    of       police          in the           terrace          where         I had       climbed           up from.

I made         my way          down          from       the       stand        to    the       place         where       you       come       in a n d

when      we     got         back       to    the       car we           were       invited          into      a    nearby          house          for

some      tea and             t h a t ’s the            first           time       that    I became            aware          of    h ow      bad    the

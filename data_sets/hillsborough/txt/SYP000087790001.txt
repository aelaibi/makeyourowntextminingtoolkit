walked           around        for         a while.




At     s o me     stage        I assisted                 in t e a r i n g       down an a d v e r t i s i n g                hoarding             board

going         to a s s i s t          an     injured          person who must                     have       d i e d as       we     were

tearing           the       hoarding             down.          I do      not        know    where           the       injured          person may

As     I was          still      walking             around         the     pitch          I heard                           snouting          to

                 crush        barrier          was     towards            trie f r o n t   of    the    pen a n d         to    the    isft     ot     the

                location            of     this       crush        barrier        t ha t   collapsed          and     the      barrier        t h at    i

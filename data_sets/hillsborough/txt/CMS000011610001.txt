HILLSBOROUGH

It goes without saying that my colleagues at BRE would wish to put their
expertise and facilities at the disposal of the Enquiry into the Hillsborough
tragedy, and into the formulation of any design recommendations that stem from
it. As you know, FRS played the leading technical role in the investigation
of the Bradford FC disaster and have substantial knowledge of crowd behaviour
in emergency situations, as well as detailed knowledge of the safety
parameters for football stadia.     Our loading expertise in the Structural
Divisions at Garston may also be relevant.

No doubt, if our services are called upon, some part of the CID programme
could be employed to resource what is required.

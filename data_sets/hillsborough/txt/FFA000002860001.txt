Dear Mr.   Whaileyr                           £        ^      '

    Thank you for your letter of 23rd May,    X confirm that The'
Football Association wishes jointly with The Football League to
submit written material in connection' with the second stage of Lord
Justice Taylor's Inquiry,                         .     -

       We note the suggested timetable.          May we enquire whether Lord
Justice Taylor intends to make any recommendation.s in' a report to be
issued after the conclusion, of the first stags, and if so whether he
will % a k e -into account written material submitted fQr the second
stage.      If Lord Justice Taylor intends to issue'a report after th.e
 firsH: ‘s tage which contains no recommendations, then we would prefer
to have more time for our written submissions, say; ^untii the end of
June,       I f: on the other hand, tLord-Justlce i*aylor intends that his
report on' t.he first stage should contain some recommendations, then
we would respectfully ask him to take account of the written
submissions.        For example, we are preparing submissions on issues
such as perimeter fencing, pre-match entertainment, increased
seating, ticket touts as well we membership schemes and ID cards.
If Lord Justice Taylor is willing to take account of our written
submissions in his first stage report, then we shall do our utmost
.to nvget the proposed'timetable," although we think that we may be a
 few 'clays lat.e.    1 You..will appreciate that until recently, we have
had, to concentrate on.dealing with the statements" required for the
first stage, but we are now well into preparations for the second

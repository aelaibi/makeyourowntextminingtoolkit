Police Constable                1639

Ecclesfield Police Station




9.00am - On duty at Ecclesfield Police Station, High Street,                                                    Ecclesfield.

               Transported down to Hillsborough Football Ground for semi final dutie




Once    at        the     ground       I        attended       the   briefing          given    by    Chief           Superintendent

Duckenfield,             after which              I commenced        patrol      in a transit              of the Stocksbridge

area.        My     Sergeant          on    that       transit was PS 13^7 Hunt                and our sector commander

was    Inspector          Walker           who    accompanied        us     throughout         that    patrol.              Our    patrol

was mainly          confined          to        the Stocksbridge          area which was             our allotted duty but

as    our    sector        commander             was    with    us we     occasionally          visited          the       Deepcar       and

Oughtibridge             areas.        There were            only a small number of local public houses in

these       three areas that were                      serving drinks to Liverpool                    fans      and although due

to the       fact I was          the driver of the transit I did not check any of the public

houses,       as     did    my         supervisors, the              fans       did    not     appear to             be    causing       any

problems.

At    2.45     p.m.       that        date        we    were parked       stationary           in    the    Oughtibirdge                area

monitoring          the    flow of              traffic      to Sheffield.        At     this time         I noted that             there

were    still       a number of vehicles                      containing Liverpool              fans       travelling             towards

Sheffield.           With reference to any radio traffic from ground control, whilst in

the     Deepcar            and         Stocksbridge areas                 we     were          unable           to        receive        any

transmissions,             but    in        the    Oughtibridge           area we       were    able       to    receive          but    not

transmit.

It    was    about       this     time          that    we   heard over         the    radio    numerous             requests       for a

gate    to     be       opened.            As     we    were going      to      take    a meal        at    3pm       our       Inspector

instructed          us     to    go    into       the     ground.         The    radio       traffic       seemed          to    indicate

some    sort       of problem              at    the Leppings        Lane end of the ground.                     We went          to that

end    to see if we were needed to assist or whether we were to take our meal as

instructed.

The    journey           to    the       ground     from       Oughtibridge          must        have      taken       about     ten    to

fifteen          minutes.          On    arrival     there         were     a number       of police            officers and          fans

outside the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end, and I could see Supt Marshall

standing          on    the        bridge    at    that       location.        He        was    stood      on   the wall         of    the

bridge       and seemed             to be     trying to get               a view of        the       exterior      of the       ground.

Upon    arrival          our       Inspector       alighted          from    the    vehicle          to   ascertain whether we

would       be    needed       and seconds           later came            back and        instructed us            to get       out    of

the    vans       and    gather          outside    the exterior pen.                As        the driver of the vehicle I

was    the       last    to leave         the vehicle having to lock the doors, and just as I got

out    I heard          over Channel           2 XS,          the Operation Support call                   for the ground.               I

immediately             reported          this     to    my     sergeant           and    Inspectors.              A     couple       more

minutes          passed       during       which     a Liverpool            football           fan   with a ticket             demanded

access       to    the       ground but was             turned away by a mounted officer. At this point

there were a number of fans milling about near the ground.                                                  Seconds after this

we    were       directed          by Supt     Marshall         to go       into     the       ground.      Although I did not

have    a    radio       I was          stood with PS Hunt             all    the time and did                  not hear any          call

over    the       radio       stating        what       had    occurred       in     the       ground.          Due to    this        both

myself       and       the    members        of my      serial        thought       that       there      was   a serious        public

order problem in the ground.                         As we approached the exit gate from the Leppings

Lane    end,       I    saw    an       ambulance.            Laid    at    the side           of this     ambulance       were        two

bodies,       who were being attended                         to by police officers and ambulance officers.

We    then       entered       through        the       gate.        We     then    approached            the    entrance        to    the

tunnel       leading          to    the     terrace.          At     this    entrance          there were        numerous        bodies
DUNCAN CHARLES McINTOSH




laid       on      the     floor,       a     number    of     police       officers         were       there       and       numerous

Liverpool           fans,        most    of     whom    were       stood    quietly,         but    a    small       number          were

hurling           abuse    at    the police        and some were stating a wish to go back onto the

terraces           but were       being prevented             from doing so by police officers.                                At    this

point        we     were    still        not    aware of       what    had      happened       and      we    went        down       the

tunnel.             I went to the left of the dividing railings and met a colleague from

F2,    I     told     him       there    were     bodies      outside       the      tunnel    to    which he        said       there

were       bodies        down    on     the    terrace.        Upon hearing           this    I went         down     the      terrace

and mananged              to get onto the perimeter track.                           At this point I realised there

had been some sort of disaster but I thought                                      itmust have been over.                      However,

I looked to my right to where an ambulance was parked                                         and saw officers pulling

bodies out of the terrace through the gate.                                     Upon seeing this I went to assist

and with           other officers             pulled    out    3 to 4 bodies.                I checked         the bodies             for

signs      of      life    but    it was obvious             they were dead.            Sometime          later I turned to

look onto the pitch in front of the goal and saw body after body laid out near

to    and          around       thetouchline.           Officers          and    fans   then started                carrying          the

bodies       off     the pitch.          A sergeant whom I do                   not know      and two fans assisted me

to carry           a body off the pitch and round to                            thegym.The         fans were         trying to

run.         I don't       think        they realised         that the person we were                    carrying was               dead.

At the            entrance to the gym it was chaos. Fans were trying to get into the gym,

most were hysterical.                       Officers    assisted in getting the body through the door

to     the         gym     and    I then       returned       to    the     terrace.          I managed          to       locate       my

sergeant.            It was       still        chaos.     Fans were jeering at us,                      blaming us            for what

had happened.

There        were     no    directions           over the radio            so   we   stood     there.         Then        a    senior

officer,          I     do     not    know       what     rank,      ordered     myself      and     a    number       of   other

officials          to    enter        the    terrace         and make    sure    that    clothing         which was strewn

about      was     not       moved.         At   this we were then abused more                  by the fans.            Then an

Inspector came to us seconds later and ordered us out of the terrace.                                                   I don't

know       how    long we        stood       there      on    that pitch but eventually                  the    fans   left    the

ground and we then resumed our transit patrol,                                   attempting to attend reports of

fights, but due to the heavy traffic we always arrived after the event.

The only incident of note was when we had to arrest a Notts Forest fan who was

walking          down    the     central         reservation         of Penistone        Road      near    Bradfield        Road,

jeering at Liverpool                   fans in their cars.                He was arrested largely for his own

pr o t e c t i o n .

We retired from duty at 8.30pm that date.

A number of the football fans in the ground and on the pitch had been drinking

but    I    couldn't           tell    whether          they   were     drunk,    they      just    seemed       in    a lot   of

cases       to    be    displaying           hatred      of    the   police.      One     fan   came       up to me on the

pitch       and        asked    me     if    I   was     alright.        He     was   the    only        calm    and   sensible

Liverpool         fan I met all day.

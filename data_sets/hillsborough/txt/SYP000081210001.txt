              I reside at the above address w ith my wij*#

              I arn the Brunner P r o f es so r          of Econojyfx Scie nc e at           the U n i v e r s i t y o f

                                   a position      I have he^Jra for 8 years,             my qual if i cations        being

              B A an d PHD.

              On S a t u r d a y    15 April      19ff^ 150489 I went         to w a t c h Liverpool        play

              N o t t i n g h a m Forest a'WT-ii 1 lsborough,       Sheffield.            I was    in the      company of
                                                                                   n          rJ-r
              my wife and two Ji^ri ends                                and                          We    t ra ve ll ed to

              the gamer by p ^ v a t e         motor    vehicle.

              We      parkeVmir         vehi cle at about 2 . 2 0 p m     1420 on a school           car    park

              si tu at ed behind a public house              called the White House.                  I cannot        be

              more      specific w ith regards           to the    location.

              We the      proceeded to walk along a dual                  carria ge wa y heading           towards      the

              L ep pi ng s    Ln,    en route      I heard a huge       roar      to my    left.     I thought        that
                                                                                                           PAGE        2
                                                                                                           82547

        was where       the ground was          so    I a s k e d / a bystander who d ir ected us           in the

        opposite       direction.           I assumed Jmen        that this was a large            contingent

        of supporters          coming      up behind us        probably off a train.

        As we wa lk ed to the groundr I noted a large Police                            presence    in the

        area,       however,    on arrival       at the entrance           to the ground the Police

        were    not    contributing/ to any form of                crowd    co n t r o l .

        We then entered thnough some metal                      gates     into an enclosure         type area

        in front       of the turnstile

        It was about 2. 4 5 p m            1445 and the       crowd was about         two thirds     deep at

        the turnstiles          but   not     in any forty of queue.            We joined the        rear of

        this    crowd and wi th in 30 seconds were aware                     that we would         not move      out

    ^   of    it.     The   build up of the           ci(jwd behind us had occurred fairly

        d r a m a t i c a l l y , almost    to a person the        people d ir ectly a ro u n d me were

        pleading       for everyone          to stay       calm and not     push.       We found ourselves

        pushed towards          the wall       housing       the turnstiles,         at this stage       the

        b odily      pressure was          intense.        My wife was     unable     to breathe and became

        m i l d l y hy6sterical,           she was somehow        lifted by two         individuals      for

        about a minute.            This was      done of these          individuals          own accord,      they

        were    lifting my wife above                thr    crowd because      she    is so small,       in order

        to enable       her to breath          prope/rly.
                                                    I
        At the height of this                crush/I was wit hi n five           persons       of the wall,      at

        that stage we heard that a y^ate was                      going    to be opened.          I saw a

        conce rt in a gate        to my      left/open m o m e n t a r i l y and then partially shut                 by

A       two    policemen.         At this      tjfme the      crowd   pressure was           reduced and      people

        b egan to form into quas i/ad queues.                     I was ext reine lyre 1 i eved and

        s u r p ri se d at the speed aT w hich the                crowd    pressure had been eased as

        the gate       to my     left was      opened for an e x t r em el y brief             period,   in

        retrospect          I became aware       that       the gate w h ic h was g e n e ra ll y held         to be

        open was       in fact another          one w hich was        not wi th in my angle         of sight.

        Whilst       in the general melee             outside     the turnstile         I saw individual
                                                                                                 PAGE           3
                                                                                                 S2547

supporters         being hauled over a wall            to the side of the turnstiles                   by

Po li ce Officers.

I am totally            convinced that      the sit ua ti on outside         the entrance        to the

turnstiles was so serious                 that    theere w ould have        been severe       injuries,

if not fatalities,              had the    circumstances       prevailed for a further                five

minutes at the most.                My own breathing was         sever el y     curtailed and          I

was    being      pushed towards        the brick wall        housing      the turnstile.         In the

circumstances and having                found themselves wit h a totally u n c on tr ol le d

surge      I remain totally convinced that               those    in a u t h o r i t y   in that area

had no a l t e r na ti ve       to make    the type of decision that they did,                   ie

opening      the gates.          I am also equa ll y      convinced that had there               been as

m u t c h as a semblance          of orde rl y queues        once we entered L ep pings Ln

that      the situation des cr ib ed earlier w ould              not/nave arisen.

We then entered through the turnstiles                       handing    out" tickets       in,   once on

the other side we had e ve ry access                  to our seating         position,       in fact        I

did see a sign directing me to my final                       viewing      position.       The

t urnstile we entered through had a./letter A above                          it.

I took up my seating              position       in/the N o rt h S tand gangway D at about

3 . 0 4 pm 1 5 0 4 .     The   game was    in progress at       this    time.      Even as    I took up

my seat      I was aware         that   something     unusual    was    occurring        in the West

S ta nd    pen three and four.             I was    seate^'for    barely half a mi nu t e when

the    crowd a ro un d me began standi ng j/p to view the                    problem.        I saw

individuals atte mp ti ng            to scramble      over    the fencing and            policemen

init ia ll y pushing           them back, ^Jfhose that were about             to come over        the
                                         J''
fence.       One       individual /fcaiiur over and     im me di at el y    col lapsed on the

ground      in front       of the goalposts.          At about    this      time    I obser ve d a

p ol ic ew om an       physically    push aside      two of her     colleagues who were

facing      the    crowd in order         to try an d help the         people      inside the     pens

get out.

At this      stage       the   individuals who had got over were                being m oved by

                                                                                                          S2547

         Police Officers           onto the side of the            pitch.       I saw four or five

          s upporters attem pt in g         to    puli   the fencing a w a y from the         pitch side and

          the Police       near them just          stood facing Jfe'he crowd.          At this stage         I got

          the    i mpression that the Police              thought a pitch         invasion was       taking

          place,    however,       there    came a poijnt when        it was     obvious     that    this was

          not the    case yet the major ity^jf Police                 still      just stood about         doing
f   i   \3
          noghi n g , irt fact at one            poimt   I o bs erved about 60 Police O ff icers

         m a r c h onto    the    pitch a n e ^ j u s t stand there dp'fng nothing up until                 a

          point    in time when tirsy we re directed jWo                from a line across          the    pitch

          between    the two f ac ti onsfof          supporters.        I w o ul d   like to say that           in

         some     part this act io n d i <L hindaf           the a tt em pt s   to move the dead and

          injured from the ground \n^*fakeshift stretchers.

          It was obvious          to me that       the m a j o r i t y of the Police     did not da

         a nything,       this    contr as te d with the       police O ff icers who were helping

         quite     considerably.           I feel    that    the   reason for this       i nactivity on the

          part    of the Police was          because      they were o b v i o u s l y sent onto the          pitch

         to perform a specific              f un ct io n and did not,       therefore,       stray from

          their    orders.        This ama ze d me       because of     the mag ni tu de of the

         s i tuat ion unf o 1 di ng in ? rcyrfl of t h e m .

         The distinct        lack of S/ltsX aid facility an d               back up was       evident,

          initially only tw oy st re tc he rs were ava il ab le and these were a n g m e n t e d

          by a further       tVo    which    I believe       belonged to the         club.    Throu gh ou t

         this episode        the    public address          system   contri bu te d towards         the   d is ­

         o r g a n is ed state     of O ff icers     by repeatedly asking            individual      supporters

         to move     off    the    pitch.        At no stage was      there any       request   for medical

          help from members          of the       public and I believe          that the     initial      tense

          inter a ct i o n between the N ot ti n g h a m supporters              at the S pion Hop end

         was e n co ur ag ed by these announcements.

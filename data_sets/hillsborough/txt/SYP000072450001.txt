the time we had                reached        the    iron gates           it was       packed.         It was

this      stage.

D u r i ng    the whole a f t e r n o o n           1 did not           see an y stewards.

When      I was about           IS yards         from the             turnstiles,       one second           I was

              My      friend                 was    just     in    front     of    me,     when    about        half   way      down    the

      I       I was               still    cruised an d unable               to move       or assist him.

              On the                edge of this barrier about                    two    people      to my       right        towards    the

              he       looked dead to me.                    I w ou l d      describe       him as a white m a l e ,he was

              It was                like a w hi rl p o o l        and      I was being      pushed around              uncontrolably.

              It was                very hard to breathe out because                       of the        intensity of the               crowd.

              I did               not see    the    barrier        break     in the        pen    I was      in,    but       1 must    have

              Eventually                  I was    pushed over           to the fence            segreg a t i n g      pens     three and

              gate            int\    pen two w hi ch was               sparsely        populated.           This was

                The   crush was          due    to the          sheer    volume      of    people       in too small          an area.

                T here   was    no fights            or     dist u r b a n c e s   that    I saw.

                The   factors        I consider             cont r i b u t i n g   to the      deaths and           injuries      over

                the   tunnel        should have             been blocked off and                 people       d i r e c t e d to the

                sides.      I should           not     have      been a l l o w e d down the            tunnel      as w h e n    I

                reached     the      end    it was          obvious      there were          too many         people     in the

                section,       but there was                no way to get           out.

                Another     factor         is the         side fencing.             If they had not                been there         the

                crowd w ou ld have             sp r e a d    out and       I think        there was          room to a c c o m m o d a t e

                                                                                                                                        >o p 1 e

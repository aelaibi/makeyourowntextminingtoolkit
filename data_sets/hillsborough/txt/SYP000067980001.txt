The    lad next             to me and myself               then tried to duck under              the bar.           I

m an a ge d      to get under             the bar.         The     lad next     to me didn't make             it.        His

face was          crushed against                the bar.          I can remember      that he screamed.

All    I can remember about                      him was         that he might     have    been        in

his e a r 1y twenties and that he was                              sma 11er than m e „          I am

I didn't          see him again.                    I d o n ’t know what h ap pened        to    him.

By this          time       I was     only        about 3 yards from the           front    fence,,         I think

         had to       let go of the m a n 's hand and                      let him go back                into the        c rowd,

         He fell       back       into        the    crowd and the          crowd just trampled him.                       There       is

         no doubt        in my min d that                he was     killed.         I think           he was    probably

         dead when we tried to                       pull    him out,

         I w ou ld describe                  this man as being            between 3 0-35 yrs.                  I d i d n ’t see

         his    face     but he was wearing a navy blue                           jacket and trousers,                   it could

         have    been .       f U . i. U u    He had on a white              shirt.             ne

         ■nan he was         lying           in the gutter at the front                    of    pexjSA           ieopie were

          tanging        on him         in an effort           to get out         of the         per

         When    1 saw tnis             1 jumped off           the fence.                  t

     I   I really d o n ’t know what                     I did next,         1 was       shocked and stunned.

         The    next     thing       I remember             is that     1 was     in the 6 yard box                near the

         goal    when     I tripped over a foot.

         I looked        down and             I saw a young         lad    lying         on his       back with his          right

         knee    in the air and his hand was                          in the air as well.

         I grabbed his hand and                        I knelt     down beside            him.        I to o k h i s n and a n o.

         a s k e d him    if he was alright.                     i lifted his             head up,           I think he was

         still       alive    then but              he d i d n ’t say anything.

         His    face was white and sort                       of p o c k m a r k e d .     His       lips were     purple.

         The    pock marking was where                       individual        pores       had gone          purple     1 ike small

               I have today,              Saturday     15 Jul y     1989      (150789)     been shown by WPC

              and P C |               |a p hotograph          reference        number P R 5 / A / 3 P .     I have

               i d entified myself             on this    photo,       I am     carrying a hoarding across                   the

              pitch with other fans,                   I am    closest        to the     camera behind a youth               in a

               red top.             (Ref No PR5/A/30)           (                     ) I do not know w h i c h body           I

              am     carrying at this             time.        I do remember            carrying a lad on a hoarding

              who had fair            hair and green eyes,               I cannot        say whether       this      lad    is the

              one        in the photo.            I have also been shown p h otograph                     reference         number

              NGN1/94.              This    shows a lad on a hoarding,                   on the    pitch,    at the Notts

              Forr e s t      end being given m outh to mouth by a policeman,                              I am kneeling

               down to the           left    (as you      look at the          photo)     of this     policeman
                                                                                                         PAGE   2
                                                                                                         SI224A

             (Ref No N G N 1/94)<                          ) I am giving       heart m a s s a ge to the

             youth.         I cannot     say whether     this youth      is the one on the hoarding                  in

             the    previous     photo    or not,       I can say that        this    is the same youth

             that    I found     in the goal       mouth at   the L e p pings Ln end.           I did not

             carry him to the S p i o n Kop          I can only a s s u m e    that    I must   have    come


             across     him a g a i n   later on.



             I have also       been shown        photo N G N 1/108,    I can identify myself a g a i n as

             the    person giving h e a r t massage         to a y o u t h on a hoarding        on the     pitch

             at the S p i o n Kop end        (Ref N G N 1/108)(                  ) again     it is the       same

             y o u t h as   I found earlier at Leppings Ln goal.



             I have m a r k e d on a sketch         plan of the       pitch the area       I found the y o u t h

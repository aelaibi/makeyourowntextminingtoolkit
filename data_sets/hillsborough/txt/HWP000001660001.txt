The Working Party considered:-

 (a) the continuation of the secondment period of the
     Solicitor to the Working Party to assist the Family
     Support Group in their submissions to the judicial
     investigation being made into the Disaster by Lord
     Justice Stewart-Smith; and

     other local Councils agreeing in principle to the
     request made for financial assistance with the funding
     of a post of solicitor to enable the above secondment
     to continue.

Resolved that a recommendation be made to the Delegated
Powers Committees of the Personnel and Policy and Resources
Committees that:-

 (a) the secondment period of the Solicitor to the Working
     Party be extended until January 1998 and be reviewed
     again at that time;

     funding of the secondment period, which has so far been
     received from other Councils on Merseyside and in the
     wider region, be noted; and

 (c) the detailed nature of the financial assistance which
     is to be requested of other Councils be determined,
     following consultation with the Merseyside Co­
     ordinating Committee, as soon as the total sum involved
     and the full length of the secondment period are
     established.

           I live at the above address with my mother and father I am an Engineer

           and am presently unemployed.                                    /

           On Saturday 15th April             1989,   I attended the/FA Cup Semi Final being
                                                                       /
           played at I^i 11 sborough Football Club, Sheffi^ield, between Liverpool and

           Nottingham Forest.  I am a keen Liver[moy sup po rt er .
                                                     /
           I travelled up to Sheffield with e i g h ^ other lads in private vehicles.

             I d o n ’t know all the people who I/travelled with they are all friends

           of my g i r 1 f r ie n d .    I know that sjh< of the lads had tickets for the

           seats    in the stand, and that yfiree of us had tickets for the standing

           area in Leppings Lane.              All/tickets had been purchased from Liverpool

           Football Club by one of t^ne other              lads.

           At approximately 1g.45>nours w e arrived in Sheffield but parked a

           couple of miles from the ground where we went for a drink in one of

                                                                                                 923-16

             the local       public houses.     I can ’t remember the name of the pub, but it

             was very quiet       inside,    there only being a small group of Forest fans

             in there as well.        We left the premises at about         14.30 hours and

             drove the cars down to nearer the ground parking them in one of the

             side streets and then walking to the actual stadium.                   At that time

             there were very few people about most              I assumed to already be in the

             ground.I    d i d n ’t see any sign of drunkeness or disorderly behaviour at

             all.   As we got to the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane End I noted

             that there was still        numerous      people outside the tu rnstiles.       I

             remember    thinking that       it was going to take ages to get into the
        Vi   ground.    Myself and the two lads with standing tickets who I only know
                  M i n g o    N i i m
             as          land I      Ia l 1 joined the end of one of the queues at these

             turnstiles.        At this stage the time was approximately a couple of

             minutes before three oclock.              The queue moved quite quickly and we

             were through the turnstiles within five minutes.                 I entered by the

             turnstiles marked A to G.           The man on the turnstile quickly had my

             ticket from me saying          come on,    lets get you all through qu i c k . ’      I did

             note that outside the ground there had been a few police officers on

             foot   checking tickets before         peopl^ joined the queues and a couple of

             police on horseback.           I d o n ’t i^cal1 seeing any stewards.        Once    inside

             the ground I d o n ’t recall       seeing any police officers or s t ew ar ds ,

             There were no signs at all/telling             people of how to get

             onto the terrace,       and therefore everyone just headed to tunnel.                 The

             reason being       that through the tunnel        I could see the pitch      and the

             players    playing.     I had a free passage through the          tunnel, it wasn't

             packed at all, and reached the top o 4 pens three and four at about 3

             minutes    past    three.      It was obviousr to me that thepens were packed.

                       and          were still with ine at this point.             We all then tried
K   *
             to push into Pen 4 and I made m/ way down about seven or eight steps

             into the pen.        I lost sight of/ my two mates.         At this time the game wa
                                                                        PAGE     3
                                                                        82316

still going on.     I began to realise that the pressure of the crowd was

too much and I was getting     crushed.     I realised that people were

being got from the crowd over the front fence and I therefore waited

thinking the pressure would ease.         The pressure didn't ease for some

considerable time even after the game had been shopped a nd the players

had left the pitch.     There was total     confusion with all the people

around me.    Nobody knew what was going on.       Althought   I could see

people    lying on the pitch I didn't realise that anyone had died.          I

was aware that people had been injured, and I knew that some were

serious.     It wasn't until about    1600 hours that the pressure    in the

stand finally returned to what I wouljef class as normal.         I still
                                     '/
remained    in the stand myself still/believing that the game would

continue.    At appr o k imately half* past four to twenty to five an

announcement was made over           loud speakers that the game was

abandoned, and I then left/the      terrace via the tunnel.
                               --------------------------------- Everyone left
                             /
in an orderly fas hi o n .Throughout the whole of the day I never saw any

behaviour    I would clasjf as disorderly or any drun ke nes s.

Throughout the incident there was a total        lack of direction being

given and the loud /speakers, which meant that with people not really

being aware of wh/t was going on,       nobody could assist anyway either by

clearing the per/s from the rear of from the front.        I was amazed that

no officers ca/te to rear of pens 3 and 4 and started clearing the pens

from the back!    the crowd being crushed around me for some considerable

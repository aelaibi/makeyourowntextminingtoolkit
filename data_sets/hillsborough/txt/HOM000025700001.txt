   THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT 1989 - DESIGNATION

   As you will already know from Frank Smith my Secretary of State is content
   with the designation structure specified in the Football Spectators
   (Designation of Football Matches in England and Wales) order 1990*

   We mentioned during our recent meeting that the proposed designations in
   respect of Part 2 of the Act and ground licensing go further than the scope
   of the Football Membership Scheme in Wales. The Secretary of State decided
   that the FMS would only apply to matches played in Wales between Football
   League teams (regardless of the competition).  In view of this the
   designations will need to be reconsidered in respect of Wales, if, at some
   future date proposals for a membership scheme are resurrected.

                                                                      Yours

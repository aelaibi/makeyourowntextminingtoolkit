               AND

 G42

 DID YOU WITNESS ANY FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCE OR UNUSUAL INCIDENT AT THE TIME OF

 TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 ON TAKING MATCH VIEWING POSITION LIVERPOOL HAD JUST WON A CORNER,        WE WATCHED

 IT TAKEN BUT BECAME AWARE OF SOMETHING GOING ON AT THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE.

 WE LOOKED AT IT AND SAW SUPPORTERS ON THE PITCH, CLIMBING THE FENCE AND BEING

 PULLED UP TO THE WEST STAND.     MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS WERE THAT THIS WAS

 DjjjppRDER.   BUT WITHIN A MINUTE OR SO WE REALISED THAT IT WAS MORE SERIOUS.

 THE PERSONS CLIMBING OVER AND ROUND ABOUT THE GOAL AREA WERE OBVIOUSLY NOT

 BEHAVING AGGRESSIVELY AND WE INTERPRETED THIS AS SOMETHING HAVING GONE WRONG.

 D # YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 <353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 WHEN THE MATCH WAS STOPPED NOTTS FOREST SUPPORTERS WERE CALLING FOR THE GAME

 TO BE RESTARTED.    <THEY OBVIOUSLY WERE NOT AWARE OF THE SITUATION AT LEPPINGS

 LANE).    SOME SECTIONS OF THE NORTH STAND WHO WERE MORE AWARE RETALIATED BY

 SHOUTING BACK AND A POSSIBLE CONFRONTATION SITUATION AROSE.     THE POLICE THEN

 PUT A CORDON IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND AND WE FELT THAT THIS WAS KEPT ON
                                                                              PAGE     9

 FOR FAR TOO LONG, 8 - 10 MINUTES LONGER THAN IT NEEDED TO BE.        THE OFFICERS

 COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER DEPLOYED ASSISTING AT THE OTHER END.        THEIR PRESENCE

 WAS ANGERING SOME LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS WHO WERE SHOUTING FOR THEM TO GET DOWN}

 AND H E L P .

 QS4

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY.

 PRE MATCH PLANNING BY FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES WAS INADEQUATE AND THE USE OF THE>K

 OP END WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE APPROPRIATE FOR LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS BY ANALYSING

 OF THE RESPECTIVE CROWD FIGURES.

 SLOW BUT STEADY OVER A PERIOD OF TWENTY MINUTES OR SO.

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 fl^THE TWO CENTRE PENS.         I FEEL THAT THERE IS LITTLE OR NO POINT IN

 COMPARTMENTALISATION OF THAT TERRACING.         I CAN SAY THAT I EVEN SAW FANS BEING

 HELPED OVER THE SIDE FENCING        INTO THE FLANKS TO GET OUT' OF THE CRUSH. THIS

 WAS HAPPENING FROM THE TIME THAT I GOT INTO THE GROUND.

 IF THE DIVIDING FENCES ON THE TERRACES HADN'T HAVE BEEN THERE, THE CROWDS

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OWN ACCORD


Q18

 G52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDE^/tO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 I SAW A POLICEMAN GET HIS HELMET KNOCKED />FF & ALSO I SAW SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS

 GETTING VERBAL ABUSE FROM THE FANS.

 G53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 a4        ^R   THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 WHEN I GOT ONTO THE PITCH,             THERE WAS A POLICE CORDON ACROSS THE 1/2 tyftY LINE

 WHICH WAS 2 MEN THICK.             THE POLICE JUST STOOD THERE DOING NOTHING FIR MORE

 THAN 30 MINUTES.                0/\T      A   t   D   £   L

 INITIALLY,          I CAN UNDERSTAND THE POLICE THINKING THAT THERE MIGHT BE A PUBLIC

 ORDER          INCIDENT,   BUT AS THE MINUTES PASSED IT BECAME OBVIOUS THAT THE POLICE

 CORDON WASN'T NEEDED ACROSS THE PITCH & THEY COULD HAVE BEEN REDIRECTED TO

 ASSIST THE INJURED PEOPLE.              THE FANS APPEARED TO BE DOING THE MOST TO ASSIST

 THE INJURED FANS BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE POLICE OFFICERS WERE INVOLVED IN

 T ^ CORDON ACROSS THE PITCH.              THE REMAINING POLICE WHO WERE     AT THE PERIMETER

 FENCE HELPING THE FANS APPEARED TO ME TO BE VERY DISTRESSED                 &   UPSET.

 MORE USE COULD HAVE BEEN MADE OF THE GROUNDS P.A. SYSTEM TO DIRECT THE RESCUE

 OPERATION & ALSO TO KEEP PEOPLE INFORMED AS TO WHAT WAS GOING ON.

 WHEN I MANAGED TO GET ON THE PITCH,               I SAW POLICE REGULATING   THE FLOW OF

 PEOPLE OUT OF THE EXIT GATE WHICH EMERGES FROM PEN 3 OUT ONTO THE PITCH.                     IT

 WAS BEING OPEN & CLOSED AT INTERVALS INSTEAD OF BEING LEFT OPEN.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I THINK GROUND LAYOUT PLANS ON THE TERRACES SHOULD BE REVISED SO THAT FANS AT

 ALL GROUNDS CAN MOVE FREELY ON THE TERRACES & NOT BE HEMMED IN BY FENCES.

 BRIEFLY DESCRIBE.

 YES,   I DID FANS CLIMB FENCING OR A WALL TO MY RIGHT SOMEWHERE NEAR TO

 THE TERRACE TURNSTILES.      THEY WERE ONLY YOUNG, ASSISTED BY A WOMAN OFF ICER,

 I BELIEVE IT WAS TO AVOID ANY CRUSH AS OPPOSED TO UNAUTHORISED ENTRY,

 I.E.   (NO TICKET).

 WHAT TIME DID YOU TAKE UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POSITION?

 WE NEVER SAT DOWN.    ONCE WE FOUND OUR SEAT A CORNER KICK WAS TAKEN,

 EVERYONE WAS ON THEIR FEET, SOME WATCHING THE GAME, SOME LOOKING DOWN

 TO PENS 3 AND 4, OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING WRONG.    THIS WOULD BE ABOUT

 3.04 (1504) TO 3.05PM (1505).

 TIME OF TAKING UP YOUR MATCH VIEWING POINT?

 NO FIGHTS OR DISTURBANCE, BUT I COULD SEE VERY CLEARLY THAT A CRUSH

 d^-iUGE PROPORTIONS WAS TAKING PLACE DIRECTLY BELOW US IN PENS 3 AND 4

 I COULD SEE THIS CONSTANT CRUSH FORWARDS, PRESSURE AND NO GIVE

 BACKWARDS, NO SWAYING, FANS ONE SOLID MASS.

 AS G42.

 NO, JUST A CONTINUOUS PRESSURE TOWARDS PERIMETER FENCE.

 NO.


G18

 G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR        IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

        FROM MY VIEW OF WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE,      IT WAS CLEAR THAT AMASSIVE

 CRUSH WAS TAKING PLACE.       THE FACT THAT A PERIMETER FENCE EXISTED

 D I D N ’T MATTER,   IT WAS THE SIDE FENCES BETWEEN 3 TO 2 AND 4 TO 5 AND 6,

 PREVENTING EXPANSION TO THE SIDES,       PENS 2 AND 6 BEING EMPTY.

 OBVIOUSLY THE PERIMETER FENCE CAUSED MANY DEATHS AND INJURIES BECAUSE

 THERE WAS NO WHERE TO GO.

 Q50

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 I *M NOT QUITE SURE, WHEN I REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING,       I THEN WENT ONTO

 T^PITCH      TO FIND THE THREE GIRLS AND SEARCHED EVERYWHERE FOR THEM AND GAVE

 DETAILS TO POLICE OF THEM.       AT ABOUT 4.15PM - 4.20PM   (1615-1620),   HAVING

 SEARCHED EVERYWHERE POSSIBLE,       I THEN LEFT THE GROUND AND MADE MY WAY TO THE

 CAR.    I DID LEAVE OF MY OWN ACCORD BUT I WAS     AWARE OF THE PUBLIC

 ANNOUNCEMENT ASKING FANS TO LEAVE THE GROUND       IN A SLOW AND ORDERLY    MANNER.

 HANDLED,   AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?                                     /

 1)    OFFICERS CLOSE TO PERIMETER FENCE IN FRONT OF PENS 3 ANj0r4 ON

 REALISING WHAT WAS TAKING PLACE, ACTED ALMOST           IMMEDIATELXY/HELPING FANS

 OVER THE FENCE,     ABOUT   10 TO 15 OF THEM, BUT THERE WERE, H O W E V E R , M A i y

       WERE PRESENT BUT INACTIVE TO THAT S I T U A T I O N .   OFFICERS HAD L i p

 THE PITCH IN FRONT OF THE NORTH STAND AND ACROSS THE PITCH AT THE

 HALF-WAY LINE.                                                         \/

 I CAN UNDERSTAND PERHAPS THAT FIRSTLY CROWD CONTROL WAS NECESSARY,                  BUT

 ONCE THAT WAS ACHIEVED,       THEY WERE NOT USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE.

 D I D N ’T HELP DEAD OR INJURED.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 TjjpJE,   I FEEL THAT NO QUEUES IS THE IMPORTANT FACTOR.

 THE FACT THAT THERE WAS NO FILTERING AND NO ORDERLY CONTROL OF LARGE

 NUMBERS OF FANS     OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES ALLOWED TO MASS.

 FAR TOO MANY CAUSING A CRUSH, ALTHOUGH THERE WERE OFFICERS PRESENT AT THAT

 POINT IN LEPPINGS LANE, THEY WERE INSUFFICIENT.

 THERE WAS AN OFFICER AT THE TURNSTILES WITH A LOUD HAILER/PA SYSTEM

 WHO WAS TELLING     FANS NOT TO PUSH.     IF H E ’D ONLY ANNOUNCED THAT THERE

 WERE NO WORRIES     AND THE THE KICK-OFF WOULD BE OR HAD BEEN DELAYED

 AND TO TAKE THEIR TIME,       THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE CRUSH OR THE RUSH

 TO GET IN.

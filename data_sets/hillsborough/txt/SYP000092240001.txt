               already         parked.

               Most      of    the       fans       I saw        were       Liverpool            fans.              A    considerable                    number       of

             I became          immediately                aware       of       an    Inspector                who       is     not      known         to    me,

             goal       I saw       some       youths          on    the       pitch.              I cut       across             the      corner          and     saw

             GROBBELAR             walking        away         from       his       goals.

             On    reaching           the      goals       I went          to       a young             fan    who          was    sitting            on    th e

             He    said       his     leg      was    broken.               I attracted                  the       attention               of    a    nearby

             Ambulance             man    to    come       and       treat          him.           1 walked             a    short         distance          away

             and    on       the    same       side       of    the       goals          and       I found          another             fan      lying       on       t he

             ground,          his     friend         was       with       him       and       he    said       the          lad    lying         down       was

             having          difficulty           breathing.                   I bent          down       and       checked             the      lads       pulse

             and    it a p p e a r e d         OK.        This       lad       then       got       up    and       walked           off        with       his

                I then          became        aware          that       there       were       large          numbers             of    people             in

                shouting           at       people        to      move     back.             I became             aware       of       a mass          of       bodies

                at    the       front        of     the      terracing.

     Police           Officers             were       beginning            to    pull       people          over       the       top       of       t he

     fencing           but       were       having          difficulty               with    clothing                getting          stuck          on

     spikes           at    the       top    of       the    fencing.                I was       still          wearing          my       gloves           so    I

     started           bending             them       back       to    make      things          easier.

      I saw       there          was       a man       in    the       pile      a*    bodies,             upright          but       trapped              from

     don't        know          who    he    is,/leant                over      and    tried          to    puj^i      this        man         up.         ye

     grabbed           an       arm    eaon       and       tried       to      pull       him    >             but    he    was          stuck          fast.

     This        man       told       us    to    leave          him    f or     a    minute          whilst          he    loosened                his     legs

     a    bit.         This          man    was       aged       about       20-21         years,          slim       build,          thats          about

     all      I can         remember             about       h im .

      1 moved          to       my    right       along          the    fence         looking          for          someone        to      help          and     1

     then        saw       another          man       trapped          from      his       waist       down,          but    on       his       back

     stuck        out       of       the    mass       of    bodies.             1 tried          to       lean       over       and       reach           this

     man      who      was       apparently             in       some      difficulties,                   but       1 was       just          too       f ar

     away        and       1 c o u l d n ’t g e t           to    h im .        Whilst       leaning                over    my     radio            fell        out

     of     my    top       breast          pocket          of    my    raincoat            and       fell          into    the       crowd          an     top

     of     the       bodies.

     The      amazing            thing       was       that       someone            who    was       trapped          in    the          bodies           just

      passed          it    back       to    me       and    I put         it    in m y      side          raincoat          pocket.

      1 then          went       back       to    the       first       man      we'd       tried          to       pull    out       ajxd      1 feel

     sure        it w a s        the       same       officer          who      helped       me       again^SrHis                time          we    were

     able        to    pull          him    out       and    man       handle         him    oyjrr         the       fence,        he      then          made
    <*■—------------------------------------------------------------------
     his      way      onto          the    pitch.

     Again         I'm      not       sure       of    the       exact       sequence            of    events,             but     I remember

     seeing           a woman          being          pulled          through         Gate       3,    by       a    number        of      officers

     she      was      unconscious                and       stood       at      the    gate       but       the       sheer        crush            of

      bodies          prevented             her       being       released            I cannot             describe          her          at    all.

              It       didn/t       seem     to    be      working           I then          saw       an    ambulance             parked          behind       th e

              goal/          I asked       an     ambulance               officer        if       he    had       any       wire    cutter          in    the

              ambulance             and    he     said      they          d i d n ’t.        I then          went       back       to    help       the    lad

              at       the    fence.

              By       now    there       were     1 or         £    officers           in    the       pen       itself       one       of    them

              approached             the     lad      I was          helping,           he    grabbed             him       round       the    neck       and

              pulled          him    away       saying,             "What     do    you       think          you're          doing,“           I

              immediately                shouted        that         he    was     helping             me    and       the    officer          let       him    go,

              another          officer          joined          me    on     the    outside             in       effort       to    still          break       the

              fence          down.

              I have          no    idea     who      the       officer          was     inside             the    pen.

              Eventually             we    got     the      fence          peeled        back          into       the       pen,    live       and       fit

              people          started        to    come         out       through        the       gap       we'd       made,       X helped             them

              out.           I then       remember          seeing           a woman          lying          on    the       terracing,             with

{jj ^       through          the       gap     and       I realised        there          were          considerable              numbers          now       out

            I remember             one        man    being/passed              out,       he       was    very       well        built       he    weighed

            about       16    stone           he    was    sffiout 5 5 10 a g e d             about       35     years,          he    was       wearing

            brown       trousers.                    thijhk, w i t h       a 3          buttoned          green        I    shirt,         with        a

            It w a s     supporters                 who    carried        him       out       and        they left         him    there.               1

            lifted       his       T    shim,        up a n d      listened             for    a    heart beat.              There          was

            said    he       was       dead.         1 then        put    his       T    shirt           up    over    his face.

            Another          man       y^as    brought        and    put       down       near           us.    He    was    about          £Q--25

            years,       medilife b u i l d .              I think        he       had    a moustache,                 he    was       wearing             grey

             were       instj^Cted              to    form          a    sterile          area       across         the    pen.         I only

             recogjjrtsed           other        officer.                    His    name       is    Kevin       h e 5s    based        at

             the    West        Stand       was       unbelievable                   and       quite       upsetting.

             I'm    unclear           then       what          happened             but       I eventually            found        myself          on    part

             of    the       cordoa/across                 the          pitch.                                                                                )

             I then          went     to    the       gym    at some time a f t e r that                             for    a     drink,          and    at

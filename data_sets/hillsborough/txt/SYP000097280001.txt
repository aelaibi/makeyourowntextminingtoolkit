           NOTE

           It will      be seen        that most           licensees       have st a t e d that       they had no

           problem      but      it   is b e l i e v e d    from the       limited e n quiries made                that this

           is little more             than    'poetic         licence'.          A prime example           is the

           landl a d y of the                                             who v o l u n t e e r e d that   quote

           *We had no trouble,                they were           smashing,       m i n d you we had to throw

           about 20 of the m out                for fighting*.

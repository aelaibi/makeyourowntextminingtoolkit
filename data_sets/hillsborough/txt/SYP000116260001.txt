        On Saturday, 15 April 1989, I was on duty re the Semi-Final in the Incident

        Room next to Operations Room.                                                                Police Constable 1176 JONES was with me

        from 0600 hours that date and we were joined at approximately 10.00 am

        by Chief Inspector EDMLJNDSON.

        Police Constable JONES was manning the radio controlling traffic mobiles

        engaged in overseeing the arrival of supporters via major roads and the

        motorways.                        On the instructions of Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON I was updating

        the extended incident log on the Coirmand and Control System.

        Throughout the morning and dinner time period we had a lot of congestion

        on the roads but by approximately 1400 hours this had all but cleared and

        everything seemed to settle down and go smoothly and we had no major hold

        ups anywhere.                            I remember several mobiles asking to go into meal and this

        was refused.

        Whilst engaged on our duties on channel 1 VHF we were also monitoring

        Hillsborough Ground Control on channel 25 via a repeater set.                                                                                                PS GODDARD

        was the main operator at the ground.                                                                    I think that it is important to

          say that this radio was not being monitored constantly by officers in the

           Incident Room in fact most of the time it was turned down low (volume)

          as PC JONES had difficulty hearing transmissions from his mobiles if

          channel 25 was on at a normal setting.

           I could hear various transmissions on channel 25 and at approximately 2.40

          pm I heard a supervisory officer whom I did not know talking to PS GODDARD

          saying he had a large crowd outside the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

          He asked for more officers (Mounted I think) and a vehicle with a PA system

          to stop people pushing.           I believe one was directed to the scene.

          Transmissions on Channel 25 were getting more frequent from this time and

          you could hear the sound of a large crowd noisily in the background.                       I

          heard the sane supervisory officer ask several times for a gate to be

          opened at Leppings Lane.          Each time he asked he was more insistant and

          he stated finally that the gate had to be opened or else people would be

          fatally injured.      The sounds of the crowd seemed to suggest this as well.

          It was apparent that this officer was in the centre of the crowd.                    I then

          contacted ground control over Channel 25 (I think) or it may have been

          the telephone line to their ground control office, to see if any ambulances

          were required at the scene, it was so noisy and unruly over the radio that

          injuries were a definite possibility.                 I was informed by PS GODDARD that

          ambulances were not required at this time.                    I cannot remember the tine

          exactly but it would be about 3.00 pm.

          Various messages were being passed on channel 25 and I heard an officer

          state that numerous people were injured and a request was made for a fleet

          of ambulances.      I told Chief Inspector EDMUNDSON of this, he was half

          way through the connecting door to Operations Room, and then I contacted

          ambulance control by direct line and made the sane*request using the sane

          words.     I was informed that the usual response would be sent.             On

          termination of that call someone at the ground requested Operation Support.

          Mr EDMONDSON was informed and I was then engaged in various duties in

          relation to what we thought was a crowd disorder and were directing

          officers to the ground, motorcycles to cover hospital routes etc.                 At some

          stage we knew we had fatalities, we thought in the region of single

          figures, we even corrmented if the game would continue.               We spoke of this

          because if the game was cancelled we had the job of seeing to the crowds

          leaving the ground.          We were then informed the game was off and the crowd

          leaving.      PC JONES and myself then arranged traffic cars to assist in this

          task.     This we were engaged in for the rest of our tour of duty along with

          assisting in all the other arrangements.                 My tour of duty ended at 7.30

          pm.      I have read a transcript which implies that PC ROOK (2554) contacted

          ambulance control. At that time           I had no knowledge of this and I also

          contacted the ambulance control specifically requesting a fleet of

          ambulances and I received a reply from the female operator, you will get

          our normal response, one ambulance, I do not know any person by the name

          of Alf.     I am not known by this name.            At no time as far as I can recollect

          did I contact the Fire Brigade.

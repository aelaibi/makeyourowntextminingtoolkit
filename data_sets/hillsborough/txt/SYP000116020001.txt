              Last     year           I was      on    d u t y at | h e         Sejni^-iTrST'at Hi 1 lsfaorough w h e n

              Liverpool               played N o t t i n g h a m Forest.                   (At     t h^ 4     game       I was        posted       to

              Liverpool               fans      were     to    enter          the    g r o und,

              As     far        as    my     recollections               of    the    day     go       I remember             that     the    flow       of

               fans     to       the        ground     was     in a n         orderly        manner          up u n t i l      around        2.30pm

               ( 1 4 30).            It w a s    at    this     time          that    a    large mass              of    supporters           arrived

              at     th e       ground and            started        to       back    up     from       the       turnstiles           back       onto

              Leppings               Lane.       This       crowd        became       bigger           and    the       queues        merged       into

               one.         At       on e    stage     pressure           built       up     to    such an          extent          that     at    one

               point        a    horse        was     needed        to    break       th e    crowd          up    into       some     semblance          of

               order.

               It w a s         during        this     stage        t ha t     pressure           at    the       turnstiles           was    such

              that      I was           pressed        up w i t h m y          back       against        the wall             of    the    ground and

               I was        unable           to m o v e .      After          the    horse        had    broken          up    th e    crowd       the

               pressure              subsided         and     the    crowd          entered        the       ground.

              As     fa r       as    supporters            trying        to    enter        the       ground without                 tickets       I can

               remember              3 youths         in t h e i r       mid    teens        who       tried      to    jump        over     the

                         1988 F.A. CUP SEMI FINAL


LAst year I was on duty at the semi-final at Hillsbrough when Liverpool

played Nottingham Forest. At this game I was posted to work the turnstiles

at the Leppings Lane end of the ground! \itoere the Liverpool fans were to enter

the ground.

As far   as my reccolections of the day go I remember that the flow       of fans

to theground was in an orddrly manner up until around 2.30pm.      It was at this

time that a large mass of supporters arrived at the ground and started to

back up from the turnstiles back onto Leppings Lane. This crowd became bigger

and the queues merged into   one. At one stage pressure built up to such an

extent   that at one point a horse was needed to break the crowd up into some

semblance of order.

It was during this stage that pressure at the turnstiles was such that I was

pressed up with mjr back against the wall of the ground and I was unable to move.

Aftui? the horse had broken up the crowd the pressure subsided and the crowd

entered the ground.

As far as supporters trying to enter the ground without tickets I can remember

3 youths in their mid teens who trjed to jump over the turnstiles.

After the crowd had entered the ground I was directed to the central pen at

the Leppings Lane end and, after literally having to force my way into    Jrhe

crowd’I became pinned up against the rear wall of the stand and unable    to

move. I then left the stand and spent the rest of the match at the back of

the stand between the turnstiles and the tunnel into the ground.

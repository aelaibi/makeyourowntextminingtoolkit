               10.50 a.m.

              Following         packed m e a l , d e p loyed to            point    on Lappings      Lane      (see

              at t a c h e d map)      j u n c t i o n wi t h E s k d a l e Road.      Point    covered     by myself,

              PC 3145 P u n t o n and PC             1H 80 Hebdige.          None     of us were      in the

               po ssession of a radio,                the Serial       Sergeant         being   the only Officer             to
have     one.,     Duties        at this     point    involved        placing       barriers      across

E s k d a l e R o a d and only          permitting     local      residents access.               At    this

time     there were a few Liv erpool                  fans making         their w a y to the Lappings

L ane    stand for        the     opening     of the     ground at         12 noon.



As   ground opening              time    neared the number            of s upporters         gradually

i ncreased and there was a steady                      st ream of fans to the                g round.            I

remember         that    fro m    12 noon until        about 2 * 3 0      p.m.      the number         of fans

w al ki ng     up to the         ground seemed to          increase       once then s u d denly

decrease?         a l t h o u g h there was always a            large number          of them walk i n g

to the ground.



F r om   12 no o n unt i 1 3 .00 p .m » i t be came a p pa re nt t ha t 1a r g e numbe r s o f

fans were w al ki ng             up and down L e p p i n g s Lane         in search of anyone with

spare        tickets.       These       pa rticular     fans    seemed to        form     into    large

groups a 1 o ng Le pp i ng s Larie a nd we r e as k e d to d i s pe r s e by 0 f f i c e r s

which        they did only to gather a g a i n on some other                         part of the            route.

I was        not asked,      personally,         by any L i v erpool          fan    if I knew of any

spare        tickets,     although        1 believe      other O f f icers          may have      been.              I do

r e m em b e r t h at several           L i verpool   f a sis w ere as k i n g w her e t here w a s a

public: house.            This     h a p p en ed on several        occ a s i o n s and because              I was

u nf a m i l i a r w i t h the area         1 could    not     tell    them.        Several      times       I

n oti c e d that        certain fans a p p e a r e d       to be going         to the      ground only to

a fternoon.         Although        the     crowd seemed        in good humour            there were

numerous         fans who        1 w ou l d say had been d r i nking and a l t h o u g h they

were     not     too drunk        they were      very boist e r o u s and noisy.              Mounted

B r a n ch   p a trolled     continuously.

f r o m this      time    until         3.00    p.m.    the    crowd along L e p p i n g s Lane

increased                    i
                  d r a m a t c a 11y .        I remember       it was a continous               stream of

large       numbers      of fans,         some who had been drinking,                    others          who had

not.        H o w e v e r , the    crowd a p p e a r e d to be making              their way to the m atch

with no         problems an d from my own vantage                         point at the j u n c t i o n of

L e p p in gs    Lane and Eskdale Road,                  everything appeared               in order as             they

wal k e d    to the ground.               As    kick off time approached.,                 however,          more and

more    fans were         incr e a s i n g      their    p a t e , some     running,       o b v i o u s l y so as

■Just prior         to 3 , 0 0     p.m.    X was a p p r o a c h e d      by Police S e r g e a n t        Reynolds

who a sked me          to a c c o m p a n y him w i t h other             officers,       including Police

C on st ab le      E 6 6 8 F l e tc he r and Police C o n s t a b l e          114 B r a d l e y      to the

L ep pings Lane          end of the ground.                   1 u n d e r s t o o d at this      time      that

there was a d i st ur ba nc e              outside       the    turn s t i l e s and several              other

officers w ere m a k in g               their wa y there.            U pon arrival         ,1. saw       .targe

numbers         of L iv er p o o l      fans,    1 cannot        really say h o w many,               outside       the

ground gates and at t h e                  turn-stiles.            1 he    crowd was       not       pushing or

shoving,         but was m e re ly made            up of       numerous       people      just m i l l i n g       about

ar o u n d the t u r n™ st il e          area and the m a i n ground gates.                     (Please       see map)



At this time           I believe          gates    6 and C were            closed whilst             gate A was

also    closed and           1 believe,          a. ground      stew a r d was      in a t t e n d a n c e    at this

particu lar         gate,,        We were       ordered       by a Senior         Officer       to    clear       the

crowd from the            turn-stila.             I do not        remember        the    rank    of the officer

and    do not       know his         name.       In company with other                  officers,         the fans

were m oved         from the         turnstile area out              onto L e p pings Lane,               through

the    exterior        gates       to    the    ground.



J then heard an officer ask                       for men       to go      into    the ground            behind the
                                                                                             ./      n
             m a i n stand.        I went       forward    but was       then stopped         by another Officer

             who a s k e d us to assist wit h              crowd      control        just outside       the ground and

             to    clear    the wa y for e me rg e n c y vehicles,                 which arrived        in a very

             short      time.      At   no time was        I involved             in the   removal    of bodies.



             Subsequently          the L e pp in gs Lane         stand     began to e m p t y .       Numerous

             L iv erpool      fans were         hurling abuse         at Officers,          All   were     upset,      some

             rno r e than o t h e r s   , s a v e ra 1   were    1 im p i n g .



             A fter     one and half           hours approxi m a t e l y ,        we were told       to a t t e n d   in the

             N o r th S ta n d   for    de-briefing.            After    de-briefing         took meal      at

                further to our recent communication we would advise that the
         above group will be holding its second "cross party" meeting with
         H P ’s at 5.00pm. on Tuesday 27th February 1990, Committee Room 16,
         House of Commons.
              The first meeting was considered by those present to have
         been very constructive and we all felt positive progress was made
         towards the achievement of our objectives, (copies of which were
         circulated previously).
                    There are three objectives to this meeting:-
                    1) To ensure the necessary legislation is brought forward to
                    implement fully the recommendations of the Taylor Report.
                    2) To consider ways to remove the shortcomings regarding
                    compensation under the "Administration Of Justice Act 1982".
                    3) Discuss "no -fault" compensation legislation.
         should time permit, other matters relating to the this and other
         disasters will be discussed and actions agreed.
              Thank you for your interest to-date,              we very     much hope you
         can join us on the 27th.
                                                   incerly,

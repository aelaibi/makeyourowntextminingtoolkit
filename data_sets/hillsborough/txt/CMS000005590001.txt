Dear Mr

I have been asked to reply to your letter of                       11     December   to    the
Minister for Sport about football hooliganism.

The Government has been concerned for some time now about
football hooliganism and has worked closely with the football
authorities and the police in implementing a package of measures
to deal with the problem.       For example there are now strict
controls on the availability of alcohol at football grounds, the
police have been given stronger powers under the Public Order
Acts to take action against troublemakers, there is wider and
more effective use of close circuit television and better
segregation arrangements at the grounds.

An important new measure has also been introduced to prevent
convicted football hooligans from going to matches abroad.    The
Football Spectators Act 1989 give courts in England and Wales the
power to impose restriction orders on those convicted of football
related offences.   These orders require those in respect of whom
they are made to attend at police stations when specified
football matches are being played abroad.

As you are aware the Government has decided not to proceed with the
National Membership scheme for football supporters. In his final
report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster Lord Justice Taylor,
concluded that he could not support a national membership scheme,
because he did not believe that the type of technology envisaged in an
invitation to tender document would work well enough to avoid the
danger of congestion and disorder. The Government always made it clear
that it would not implement the scheme until it had given full
consideration to Lord Justice Taylor's report.

Lord Justice Taylor considered that all-seater stadia would do more to
improve safety and cure problems of crowd behaviour at football
matches than any other single action. All seating is a measure which
the Government supports fully and which it intends to see implemented
at all Football League grounds by 1999.


Lord Justice Taylor also recommended a number of other measures for
combatting  football hooliganism,   including the creation of new
offences   specifically related to    football. The home Secretary
announced in the House of Commons on 12 November the Government's
intention to introduce legislation banning the throwing of missiles,
V.




the chanting of obscene and racialist abuse and going onto the pitch
without reasonable excuse. A ticket touting offence at football
grounds will also be created.

The Government realises that conversion to all seater stadia
and the implementation of the other improvements recommended by Lord
Justice Taylor will be expensive.         In    recognition   of   the
importance  attached to this work the Chancellor of the Exchequer has
reduced the rate of Pool Betting Duty from 42h     to  40% with effect
from 5 April 1990.    This follows an understanding with the Football
League, the Football Trust 1990 and the pools companies that       the
money saved, estimated to be   £100m over the next 5 years, will be
administered by the Football Trust 1990 for use on capital works    in
accordance   with Lord Justice Taylor1s recommendation for improving
comfort and safety at Football      league grounds. The Chancellor has
said that he will make an early decision on whether to extend the
concession for a further five years provided there is firm evidence
that the football authorities and clubs have plans in place for the
Taylor timetable on all seating to be achieved.

This money is in addition to the £75m that the Football
Trust 1990 has said will be available over the next 10 years from
funding provided by the Pools Promoters Association from the
proceeds of the 'Spotting-the-Ball1 competition.

You may also be interested to read the attached extracts from the
Digest of Football Statistics 1989 published by the Football Trust and
the House of Commons Hansard for the 4 July 1990, which give the
number of arrests and ejections at football matches.

As you will be aware UEFA decided on 10 July following
applications    submitted      by     the    Football Association that
Manchester United and Aston Villa should be allowed to play
in their    competitions next      season.       Itis understood that           the
Football     Association      did    not    make    an    application    for    the
re-admission of Liverpool         Football     Club    because    of    the    UEFA
ruling   that     the    club    should be excluded for a further 3 years
after the general ban on English clubs was                lifted.    The    former
Minister    for    Sport in      his    letter    and    report to UEFA on the
1989-90 domestic      season     and    the   World     Cup   Finals    in    Italy
supported    the    return     of    English clubs. While there had been a
number of unacceptable incidents both            at     home    and during      the
World   Cup    it    was    felt    that    overall the behaviour of English
football supporters had improved and that there was no longer any
justification for a blanket ban on English clubs. The Minister also
stressed   that not all England supporters are hooligans and that not
all football hooligans are English.

Yours sincerely

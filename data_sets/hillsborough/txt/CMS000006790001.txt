POSSIBLE REVIEW OF THE ALL SEATER POLICY

Thank you for your letter of 20 March about the possibility of
a review of the all seater requirement. I apologise for the long
delay in replying to you. One effect of the delay is that your
letter is now more appropriate to the new Department of National
Heritage to whom responsibility for sports ground safety is in
the process of being transferred.   I assure you that this is a
circumstantial result of the delay and not the reason for it.
But it does mean that the views I provide do not come from the
Department who will in future be responsible for this area of
work.

As you know, prior to the General Election the former Education
Secretary who is now the Home Secretary, suggested that officials
at the Home Office and the DES should prepare a review of the all
seater policy.   However the then Home Secretary decided that no
such review should be considered until after the election.

During the election campaign the Prime Minister was reported to
have said that he would consider a change of policy for clubs in
Divisions Three and Four of the Football League.       You will
appreciate that it is now for Ministers in the Department of
National Heritage to determine whether the all-seater policy
should be reviewed, and if so, to what extent. I understand that
this is under active consideration and that a decision will be
announced shortly.

Your letter also mentions several matters which the Association
of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPO(S)) have raised
regarding sports ground safety legislation. I note their concern
about the gap in safety enforcement between the powers available
to a local authority in respect of sports grounds which are
designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and their
powers in respect of regulated stands under the Fire Safety and
Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987.
I am also aware that for sports grounds with accommodation for
fewer than 10,000 the 1987 Act requires only that stands at such
grounds which can hold 500 spectators under cover ('regulated
stands') require safety certification.    This does indeed result
in sizeable areas of some of the smaller sports grounds operating
without safety certificate cover.

As you know the 1987 Act was introduced as a result of Mr Justice
Popplewell's Inquiry into the Bradford Fire.    Paragraph 3.35 of
his Final Report states that:

     " The thresholds of 10,000 or of 500 are bound to be
     arbitrary and this is no more than an empirical
     approach.  I have to exercise my judgement as best I
     can.   It is an attempt to balance the expense of
     inspection against a reasonable degree of safety."

However, the Report goes on to mention other powers available to
a local authority under Section 10 of the 1975 Act to restrict
or prohibit the admission of spectators to any sports ground, or
an area of a ground, should they consider that admission would
involve a serious risk to the spectators.     In addition local
authorities are able to exercise control over the safety
standards in temporary grandstands through the Health and Safety
at Work Etc Act 1974.

I am not aware of any significant change in circumstances since
the Popplewell Report which would justify extending the 1975 Act
to require local authorities to issue safety certificates for all
sports grounds.    Indeed, there are strong cost and resource
reasons against such an extension. I would be interested to know
whether the certifying authorities themselves share the views of
ACPO(S) given the implications for them of widening their area
of responsibility.

You also make the point that ACPO(S) feel that there might be a
case for some football matches not presently included in the all-
seater policy and certain other sporting events taking place only
in all seated stadia. Following publication of the Taylor Report
in January 1990 it was agreed, after advice from our Legal
Adviser's Branch, that a safety certificate issued under the 1975
Act could not require that a sports ground should provide only
seated accommodation if the standing areas at that ground are in
a safe condition to accommodate agreed specified capacities
likely to use them.   For such a condition to be included in a
safety   certificate  it would be necessary      to change    the
legislation.

Consequently, it was decided that the elimination of standing
accommodation in England and Wales would be enforced through the
Football Spectators Act 1989.    This was already on the statute
book.   However, this meant using the 1989 Act for a purpose
different from that for which it was designed. Quite frankly it
is not well suited to this revised purpose and we have had untold
difficulties trying to prepare for subordinate legislation under
it to accommodate the FLA's wishes to introduce licensing this
year.  We have so far been unsuccessful.
»
    It would of course be interesting to know if ACPO(S) want
    legislation to be introduced in Scotland as a result of some
    unwillingness on the part of the Scottish Premier League clubs
    to go all seated voluntarily.       Should you be disposed to
    introduce legislation to compel the Scottish clubs affected by
    any revised all-seater policy to comply, I am sure you would
    consider the matter very carefully.       But I would strongly
    recommend that you not only consult the DNH and the FLA
    beforehand, but also that you do not use the Football Spectators
    Act 1989 as any form of model.

    ACPO(S) also appear to be concerned about the effect that reduced
    capacities will have on the designated status of some grounds
    under the 1975 Act and the consequential safety conditions at
    such grounds.   It is possible that some clubs, especially those
    in the lower divisions in both England and Scotland, will build
    new all seated grounds to accommodate fewer than 10,000
    spectators.   As you realise, under the law as it stands, such
    grounds would not require designation under the 1975 Act.

    It is possible that in time new stands may be built at such a
    ground raising its capacity to more than 10,000.       The ground
    would then require designation and a safety certificate from the
    relevant local authority.    Should the certifying authority be
    dissatisfied with safety standards in any part of the ground then
    the capacity of that part would have to be reduced to a limit
    which is considered safe in accordance with the recommendations
    of the Green Guide.

    It would seem foolhardy and wasteful for a club to build a stand
    that does not comply with the advice contained in the Guide even
    if it was clear the ground would not require designation in the
    immediate future.   The management of such a club would also be
    inviting litigation in the event of a safety incident.    But in
    any event it is likely that the stands at any new stadia will be
    regulated stands under the 1987 Act and as such these would
    require safety certificates.

    As I said earlier I am sorry that you have had to wait so long
    for   this  reply  and   that  since   you wrote    I have   lost
    responsibility for the matters raised.    You will gather that I
    am not convinced of the merits of the ACPO(S) suggestions.
    However, should you be concerned that the voluntary approach to
    all-seated stadia in Scotland is unsatisfactory I appreciate that
    you would have to consider the need for legislation.     However,
    I must leave you to pursue such matters in future with Mrs A
    Stewart at the Sports and Recreation Division of DNH, Sanctuary
    Buildings, Great Smith Street, London SW1P 3BT to whom I am
    copying this letter and yours.

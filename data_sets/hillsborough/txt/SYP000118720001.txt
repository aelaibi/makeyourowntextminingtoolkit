                I h av e 2 7 y e a r s            experience             as a    police       officer.           I have         held a

                supervisory               position            for 2 7 y e a r s .       I have        policed        football          matches

                at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F . C. ,             S h e f f i e l d U ni t ed F.C         a n d B a r n s l e y F. C

                marches          and      demonstrations                 in the     City Centre            of S h e f f i e l d       between

                1983 and           1987.          I have         policed 4 semi-finals                   - all       at H i l l s b o r o u g h .

                I have          p o l i c e d all        disputes          involving         the N a t i o n a l     Union       of

                Mineworkers,               and     sundry         other       disputes.         I enjoy       big      occasions          and

                believe          t ha t    firm      but       f a ir    policing       is    the    key    to      successfully

                managing           big     c ro w ds .

                In A p r i l       1988        I was      a Ground          Commander         at    Hillsborough Football

                Ground,          Sheffield,              when Nottingham Forest                     F.C.    played Liverpool                F.C.

                I worked           inside         th e    ground and apart               f r o m mi nor       problems           of

                drunkenness,               th e f t ,     and     the      discharge         of a    pyrotechnic            during        the

                match,          the    game       passed         off     without       serious        incident.

                The    earlier            rounds         of    the      1 9 8 8 - 8 9 F.A.    Cup    competition            produced         the

As     a Deputy Divisional                      Commander             I expected            to     play a key            supervisory

r o le    on the        day,      and my            then D iv is io na l            Commander,              Chief

Superintendent               B.L.        Mole,        d i s c u s s e d w i t h me at a f a i r l y                   early        stage

the      question         of m y        duties.            I had w o r k e d m o s t l y            inside         the      ground        in

1988 a n d        therefore             I agreed           this       year     to     perform an             outside          duty,

taking        charge        of    the        policing           of    the     Liverpool            fans.

In due        course       meetings             were       set       up w h i c h w e r e         attended         by    police

officers         from       *F*    Division and                  elsewhere,             along       with      representatives

of     the L o c a l      Authority,                Public       Transport,             Ambulance,            and       the    like.

Chief        Superintedendent                   Duckenfield,                who was         to     t ak e    o ve r     the    Division

on C h i e f     Superintendent                     Mole's       transfer,            was    also      present.

A    planning/logistics                      t e a m was        set     up,    headed         by C h i e f        Inspector          Beal

and      Inspector         Sewell,            they        commenced           to    prepare         a detailed

Operational             Order       to       cat er       for    the m a t c h .

Shortly         after      6 April            1989,        I received              from     Inspector             Sewell       a

detailed Operational                         Or d e r ,    setting          out     the m i n u t i a e       of      detail

associated with                  th e    game.

During        the      ensuing          week        I read       the     order        through and             noted my             own

role a n d        responsibilities.

I noted         that      I was         to    be     in    charge        of S e c t o r       2    (Liverpool)              and     that       I

would        be a s s i s t e d     by C h i e f          Inspector           Roy Waring,             Sector          2A,     and Chief

Inspector           Roger        Purdy,         Sector          2B.

I have        known       both      officers              many years           and worked             closely           during       the

l ate     1 9 7 0 ’s w i t h C h i e f          Inspector             Purdy.          Both        officers         have       police

experience             of w o r k i n g        in the H i l l s b o r o u g h           area and            had    performed             duty

at     the    ground        before.             Both       officers           had,      to my       knowledge,              good and

valid        experience           at     major        public          order        e ve n t s .

Both      officers          had my           full     confidence.

Sector        2 was       split         into        two    other        Sectors,          2A and 2 B .             Sector          2 A was

t he     area     to    the S o u t h          of    the L e p p i n g s       Lane       area       (for w h i c h C h i e f
Inspector           Waring          was       responsible);               Sector          2B    for     the N o r t h W e s t           area

(for w h i c h C h i e f            Inspector            P u r d y was         responsible).

The     chain       of     command            devolved         to       Inspectors,             of w h i c h         there    were       3    in

Sector        2A and 4             in S e c t o r       SB.

Additionally,                 I was          responsible            for       coach searching                   in two       locations

i.e.      in O u g h t i b r i d g e          Village,         about          two m i l e s      from          the    ground

(Inspector            Wardle);               and Tankersley,                  about       six m i l e s         from    the    ground

(Inspector            Morton).                Als o ,    6 mobile             "Tango"          units       under       the    direct

control        of     Inspector               Walker        and     Inspector             Robinson.

I was      not      actually             in     charge        of    the       serial       of    police          officers

employed         on t u r n s t i l e           duties        at L e p p i n g s      Lan e .         These          were    part       of

the G r o u n d       C o m m a n d e r ’s - S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            Greenwood              -    responsibilities,

b ut    it w a s      always            my    intention            to    be    in the a r e a           of      the L e p p i n g s      Lane

turnstiles            as      the       crowds         built       up.        I noted          that     Chief         Inspector

Creaser        was       in    charge           of     this    particular             area,        aided         mostly       by    *F'

Division         Inspectors,                  Sergeants            and Constables.                    The       offiers       involved

have     a wealth             of    experience              in h a n d l i n g       football           crowds         a n d most

officers         were         known          to me      personally.

I had      thus       no      qualms          t h at    g iven a normal               situation                the    number       of

officers         involved was                   r i g ht a n d      struck          the    correct             balance       between

t he m a i n t e n a n c e         of    law and         order          — the       necessity           to      s ea r ch fans          for

offensive           weapons             and     detect        crime w it ho ut             an op pr es s iv e           police

presence         — at w h a t            should         have       been a        pleasant          afternoon            of    sport.

At     10 a m F r i d a y ,         14 A p r i l        1989,       I attended             a Senior             Officers*

briefing         at      the S h e f f i e l d          Wednesday             Football          C l u b.        All    Inspectors

and     the    two       Chief          Inspectors            working          w i t h me       in S e c t o r        2 were

present.            Chief          Superintendent                  Duckenfield             gave a d e ta il ed               briefing

from a        prepared             br i e f ,    and     this       was       complemented              by a b r i e f i n g        by

Superintendent                 Murray,           who was           to    be    in    charge        of      the       police    co n tr ol

post.         Inspector             Sewell           then     gave       details          of a d m i n i s t r a t i o n ,     meals          etc.
                                                                                                                                PAGE           4
                                                                                                                                R233

When     these       officers           had    concluded          their       address            I took my              Chief

Inspectors           and      Inspectors            to a n a r e a      off       the N o r t h S t a n d w h e r e             I

personally           briefed          them     in d e t a i l     as    to w h a t         I required              from       them,        I

had    earlier        prepared           notes       of w h a t    was      required             of    us    collectively

and what        I required              from    them       personally,             and      I referred              to     these

n ot e s .     I have         kept      these       notes    and       they are a va i la b le                 for       inspection.

I provided an              opportunity              for    questions          and asked Chief                      Inspectors

Waring       and Purdy           if     they    had a n y th in g         to add.             Some      questions              were

a sk e d .

Some     of m y      Inspectors           were       from    *A*       Division and               'C        Division and

were     not    totally          familiar           with    the a r e a .          I therefore               took        them       to a

transit        van and wi th PS Fidler                      took       these       officers            on a g u i d e d         tour

of    th e    locality and              pointed       out    certain areas                  of    concern,              s u c h as

Leppings        Lane       roundabout,              coach and mi ni bu s               park in g ,          pubs        and    off

licences.

I a s k e d all       the       officers        to    ensure       that       they         r ea d th e O p e r a t i o n a l          Order

and were        familiar          with        its    contents          p r i or    to a t t e n d i n g       at

Hillsborough              the    next     day.

Later        that    day      I received            from    Inspector             Sewell         a m i n i a t u r i s e d Order,

which        I condensed           so    that       I had a       pocket          sized overview                   of    the    duties

involved        in my         sector      of    the       operation.

I added        to    t hi s     the     colour       coding       of    the       tickets         for       th e    various

sections        of    the       ground.         I have       retained             t hi s    document.

At    8.10 am Saturday,                  15 A p r i l      1989,       I came        on d u t y at H a m m e r t o n             Road

Police Station.                  The     d a y was        fine    and     sun n y.          The       weather           was    warm

and    ideal        for    a major        sporting          event.

At    9 . 2 0 am     I left        Hammerton Road Police                      Station with Chief

Superintendent                D u c k e n f i e l d a n d Mr.      A.     Hymas       a Force           Press           Officer.

We    went     to    the      entrance         to    the    police        a r e a at        the       rear     of       the N o r t h

Stand.         Other       officers           were     congregating               there       a n d w e re ,        in due

c ourse,      moved          into       pre-arranged              seating            in the N o r t h S t a n d .

At   10 a m C h i e f            Superintendent               Duckenfield               ga v e    a briefing.                 He was

followed          by S u p e r i n t e n d e n t       Murray,          DS Charlesworth and                          Inspector

Sewell.           Each       officer           spoke      about       particular                aspects         of    t he    policing

of   th e    event.

At   the     conclusion              of    the       general        briefing           Serial            Inspectors           were

invited       to       brief       their        Serials          in a c c o r d a n c e         with      their       general           and

specific          instructions                 contained          in t h e i r        o rd e r s .

I spoke        to C h i e f         Inspectors            Waring        and Purdy and                    re-affirmed what                    I

considered             to    be     the    salient         points          of    our       duty,         i.e.    searching,

coach       reception and                 general         standards             of    behaviour.                I told        the

officers          t h at     I would           pa tr ol    on f o ot        throughout               the S e c t o r         and       they

could expect                to    see     me    out a n d a b o u t         right          up to         kick-off.            I

distributed a one-sheet                           overview          of S e r i a l         deployment,               along        with a

list    of     pubs         in th e       locality where                th e     landlord            had    been       seen and

asked       his    intentions,                 i.e.    either         to    close          or    operate         a selective                 door.

About       10.15 am             I went        into    the       gym w here           I consumed a snack                      meal       and

took    the       opportunity              of     speaking          to m o s t        of m y S e c t o r         Inspectors

individually.                    I distributed             copies          of    the       document         mentioned              a bo v e .

Manpower          at    my       c o m m a n d was     S Chief          Inspectors,               11      Inspectors,              30

Sergeants          and 227 Constables.                           This      did       not    include         the M o u nt e d

Officers,          Dog Handlers,                  or    the C h i e f       Inspector,               2    Inspectors,              4

Sergeants          and 40 Constables                      who     would         be w o r k i n g         outside       the        Leppings

Lane    turnstiles                prior        to k i c k - o f f .

About       1 0 . 4 5 am         I commenced            fo o t    patrol         in the L e p p i n g s              Lane     are a,

checking          that       barriers           had been          p l a c e d at        the      ends      of    streets           opening

on   to L e p p i n g s          Lane.         The     purpose        of    the       barriers            is to       prevent

access       by f a n s          and minimise             the     nuisance            to    local         residents           caused

by   fans      (a)      using        the       back    gardens          and      gennels          as      toilets;           and       (b)

trying       to     climb         over     walls        and      fences         to    gain       free      access        into          the
                                                                                                                                    PAGE            6
                                                                                                                                    R233

ground.            Most       of    the     barriers          were       in    place         and     each        set    was       manned       by

2 Constables.                   I met       and      spoke       to all        these         officers            and asked          them

if t h e y k n e w w h a t           their        duties         were.         All     appeared             to    k now what         was

expected           of    them.

Inspector           S e l wo o d was         in      charge        of    this       a r e a a n d we m e t              briefly and

discussed what                 to    do a b o u t       an Audi          car w h i c h w a s           causing          an

obstruction              in the m o u t h            of V e r e     R oa d .

I then        continued             to L e p p i n g s       Lane       roundabout             and     on    into P e n i s t o n e

Road North and Claywheels                             Lan e ;      all    the       t i me     meeting           and    speaking          to

policemen and                 women        but    checking          that       they       had       been     b r i e f e d as       to

their        duties.           I paid        particular             attention             to    the C l a y w h e e l s           Lane

coach        reception Serials                    (Serials          34 and 35 - PS S he rr at t                         and PS

Lindop        respectively)                 as a k e y        role w a s           required          in r e s p e c t        of    them       so

far as        ticket          checking and              standards             of    behaviour           were        concerned.

Some    fans        were       already           moving       about       at       this      t i me a n d        going       from

public        house       to       public        house       looking          for    those which                 were     open.

I remember              sharing        a    j ok e    with       the     manager          of    the     newly           refurbished

Travellers              Inn    in P e n i s t o n e        Road North.               The       pub wa s          closed and          the

car    park was           thus a v a i la b le             for     use.        Our     jo k e       concerned            h o w m u c h he

could        charge       to a l l o w       fans       to    park       on    it.        All       t h i s a r e a w as          well

policed and              I wa s      happy        that       everyone          seemed          to    know what            they were

do i n g .

I then        patrolled             back     towards          the       ground and             into     the M i d d l e w o o d R o a d

area.         I c o n t i n u e d as         far as          the m a i n       shopping             area,        al l    the      time

meeting        and       speaking           to P o l i c e       Officers           about       their        duties.              In the

shopping           arcade          I met     and      spoke        to    two       officers and              the        security

manager        of       the     precinct.             We     discussed             possible          problems            involving

stealing           from       s ho p s ,    as    had      occurred           in    1988.           I then        p o p p e d my      head

round        the    door       of T h r e s h e r ' s        Off    Licence          in M i d d l e w o o d R o a d .              Tw o

female        s t af f    were       working.              Thefts        had       occurred          there        in     1988 a nd        I
                                                                                                                                     PAGE         7
                                                                                                                                     R233

therefore         assured          them      that         the     police         were       not       far a w a y      if      there        was

trouble.

There     was a l r e a d y        substantial               numbers            of    f an s     wandering            about         the

streets      and       I wa s      saddened           to     see       t ha t    most       were       openly         drinking

alcohol      from       cans a n d          lit re        bottles.              Many were             carrying         f ou r       p a ck s

and    I w as     asked         by a g r o u p        of      f a ns     where        they       could       find       pubs        that

were     open.         All      the    fans I e nc o u n t e r e d              were       Liverpool                 supporters. I

spoke     to one        man who         was       drinking             from a         can       of    strong       l ager       and       had

another      3    cans       in his         possession.                 I expressed                  the   view       t h at    were        he

to    d r i n k all     the      la ger      he    had       in his         possession                he m i g h t     l a t er      h a ve

difficulty         getting            into    the         ma t c h .

I patrolled            back      towards W a d sl e y Lane,                     arriving             there about            12 noon.

Crowds      were       now      s t a r t i n g to    build         up.         Many Liverpool                   fans       were

wandering         about         and    I wa s      being         asked where                open       pubs      could         be    found.

Again,      many       f a ns    were       openly         drinking             cans       of    beer      and     lager.            Fast

food     outlets        were      very       busy         in deed.

About     this     time         I heard       some          ra d i o    traffic            concerning            two     public

houses.          The    first         was    the F o x           Inn    in F o x h i l l         w h i c h was        said      to     be

very     busy     in d ee d.          This    was         not     surprising               as    the       landlord         had

publicly         expressed            his    intention             in the S h e f f i e l d S t a r                that        he    had

obtained an            extra       10 b a r r e l s         of    be e r    for       consumption               by L i v e r p o o l

fans.       The    p ub h a d a p p a r e n t l y            been       drunk         dry       in    1988.        I radioed

control      and asked             that      officers             visit         and     see      the       landlord and warn

him about         serving          drinks.

The    second      pub w a s          the H o r s e        and Jockey                in D y k e s      H al l    Road,         where

100-200      persons            were    said         to     be d r i n k i n g        outside.             Again       this

R o a d a n d W a d s l e y L a ne .          PC R o g e r         Pearce            was    a    passenger            in t h is        van,

w h i c h was     being         driven       by a Dog             Handler            from Nottinghamshire

Constabulary.                I spoke         to PC P e a r c e             and       directed          them      to    go      to    the

Horse        and Jockey and monitor                      developments.

I then         continued          pa t r o l     along       Middlewood Road                    out      of    c i t y as         far as

B a r n e t t ’s O f f      Licence.             This    was       closed and was                   being        guarded           by a

male        constable         and a female              constable.                 I spoke          to    both         officers.              I

then        crossed       the     road where            I saw          the m a n a g e r        of W i l l i s '

Supermarket.                These        premises        also          have       an    off     licence          facility.               I

spoke        to the m a n a g e r          who    g av e me        the       erroneous           impression                 that       drink

was      not      being     sold.

I continued my                pa t ro l ,      walking        down Leppings                   L a ne,     past         the

turnstiles            and     into P e n i s t o n e         Road North.                 T he    time was              now a b o u t         1 pm.

A    lot m o r e      fans       were      wandering          about.              I adjusted             the     points           of    two

groups         of   officers,            firstly        to    prevent             coaches        entering              Leppings          Lane

fo r     unloading          purposes;            and    secondly             to    prevent          obstruction                  outside          a

f a st      food outlet           n ea r    Leppings          Lane        roundabout.

I met        Inspector           Millett         at    the    end       of C l a y w h e e l s        Lane a n d we a r ra n g e d

for a        policewoman,               who was        directing             coaches          into       that      road,          to    be

given a fluorescent                      waistcoat           to    increase             her     visibility and                    personal

safety.

I continued               towards        the W a d s l e y B r i d g e            railway        station and                 en    r o u te       I

met Chief            Inspector Purdy.                   There          was    some       r a d io     traffic              that M o u nt e d

Officers            had    stopped a transit                  van       full       of    f a ns a n d         t hi s       was    parked

on the C o m e t           car    p ar k    o ff K i l n e r       Way.           T he m o u n t e d      officers               suspected

drink        was     on    board and           required assistance.                           There       were         a    lot    of

police         officers          about      but as we w e r e                not       far a w a y       ourselves               I decided

to     go    to     the    s ce n e .      On arrival             at    the       car     park      I saw a            nondescript

minibus which was                   filled        to    capacity with mostly male                                fans.            T hey were

truculent            a n d all      appeared           to h a v e       been       drinking.              They were               not    drunk.

I t oo k       charge       of    this      situation and with                         other     officers              invited          each

of     the     passengers           out     of    the     van      one       by one.            W i t h the        exception             of

the      f e m a l e al l     were       searched,           as w a s        the       van.       I remember                one    of    the

males       claiming          to      be a n       ex-policeman                from Cheshire               and     he     provided

his    service          number.             Th e      search was            negative             and    I gave       the     people

some advice             about         their        behaviour            and     directed            them      towards        the

ground.          I permitted               them       to    le a v e    their        van      in K i l n e r     Way      rather         than

move       it to W a r d s e n d Road .

Wit h Chief         Inspector               P u r d y we       returned             ba c k a l o n g K i l n e r        Way.         The

Gateway Supermarket                        was     doing       a    roaring          t r a d e at       its    'off       li c e n c e '

section with a                queue         of     f an s     buying       drink          t h r o u g h a door.            There         is a

lar g e     grass       verge         outside           Halfords          at    the       junction         of K i l n e r      Way and

Halifax          Road and            I estimated              that      100-150           persons,         mostly         m a le ,      wre

l yi n g    or    sitting            on    the     grass       drinking             from      cans a n d       bottles         in the

bright       sunshine.                At    t h is      time       there       was     no     trouble,         and      despite          what

seemed       to me       to      be       far    too m u c h        drinking           going        on f a n s w e r e       well

behaved.

I continued             ba c k       down Halifax              Road       towards           Claywheels           Lane.         I

remember          seeing         a    coach stopping                   in H a l i f a x       Road and         fans

disembarking.                 I went            across        to    this       coach with Chief                  Inspector              Purdy

and    spoke       to    the         driver.            He a s s u r e d       me    t h at      his    passengers           knew

where       they    could            rejoin        the      coach after              the m a t c h as          they       h a d all

been       before       in    1988.             There       was     not m u c h        I c o u l d do a b o u t           this

s i t u a t i o n at     that         stage        so      I let       it go a t          that.

I returned          to       the C l a y w h e e l s L a n e            area and            by     radio      checked with               the

Serial       Sergeants               that       coach       parking        was       going         to   plan.        There       were         no

problems          and    room         for a n o t h e r        15-16        coaches           at    that      st a ge .

I continued             into         Middlewood Road where                          I met        Inspector        Humphries.                  We

discussed          the       progress            of     the    operation             to     date.        There       was     then        some

radio       traffic          that         youths        were       causing          a nuisance           in W a d s l e y      Lane        by

urinating          in g a r d e n s .            Again        I was       n e ar     to W a d s l e y L a n e        so     I decided

to    patrol       in t h a t         ar ea,       and with            Inspector            Humphries          I walked            up    the

road.

There     were        now    very many Liverpool                       fans about.            Many were              drinking.

They were            m os t l y male.             Some    fans were           picnicking           in t h e i r       cars.          We

encountered            two y o u t h s        walking        d o w n W a d s l e y L a n e.            One    h a d a h a lf

full     pint        glass,       the     other         had a half-full               half-pint             glas s.        I asked

them what            they    thought          they were           doing.         Both mumbled a                 reply       to     the

effect      t ha t     they       h a d h a d a d r i n k at            the     pub.        I suggested              they      return

the    glasses         to    the       pub a n d a f t e r        a    little     hesitation                they accepted

this     advice        and       tu rn ed about,            ostensibly           to    return          to    the H o r s e       and

Jockey.          We    followed           them      for a s h o r t          distance.

On arrival            at    the    end       of M a r c l i f f e      Road     I saw       the    off       licence        wa s

very     busy        indeed.           About       30 males           were    standing        or       sitting        o n the

pavement         outside.              All    were       drinking        a variety           of    intoxicating

l i quor.       I saw       some       drinking          wine.         The m a jo r i t y were              drinking        beer,

l ager    and        cider.        Some       of    these       persons         were    clearly             intoxicated and

I spoke         to    two    or    three youths              about       their        behaviour.              At     this      p o int

a   'Tango*          van drew          up,    under       the     command        of P o l i c e        Sergeant        Miller.

I told him            to    keep an          eye    on t h e s e       youths     and also             the    crowd        drinking

outside         the H o r s e      and Jockey.

With     Inspector           Humphries             I returned           ba ck    down Wadsley Lane                    towards

M i d d l e w o o d R o ad .       As     I passed          the P a r k       Hotel     (which had              closed         for

th e   day)      I saw       groups          of    fans.        They were         drinking             on the        pub

forecourt            and were          chanting          football        slogans.            I told          them     to    shut       up

and    s a ve    their       shouting             for    inside        the    ground.         There          were     f i ve

constables            nearby and             I told       these        officers        to k e e p a n         ey e    on them.

I returned            once       again       b ac k a l o n g     Middlewood Road                 to    the     top    of

Parkside         Road.           It w a s     now       busy w i t h     fans,        and    cars       very much           in

evidence.             I saw a          l a r ge    group     of       skinheads        moving along                Middlewood

Road and         I followed             t hi s     group     for a time.

Shortly         before       2    pm    I heard          some     radio       traffic        that       the     special          train

escorting         Serials           ( S e r i a l s 3 6 a n d 37)               plus C h i e f          Inspector             Purdy and

mounted       officers          were       en    rout e      to       the P e n i s t o n e           Road        turnstiles.

I patrolled            towards        the       turnstiles,                pausing          en     r o ute        to    clear       youths

from    the      roadway         outside         the F o u r          Lanes        Ca f e .        I instructed                two

constables          to    prevent          the    overflow              of      fans       into       the       road.

Leppings         Lane     was       now    becoming          increasingly                   congested.                  Crowds       were

building         up.      There       was       considerable                 open      drinking              going       on a n d        the

fast    food      outlets           were       very    bus y.           There         were       no     problems          at       this

stage    and      in m y       view       there were             ample          police        officers             in the          area    to

help and assist                fans       to    find       the       r ig h t    entrance             and       carry     out       the

preventive          role       described          earlier.

Fans    were      entering           the       ground.           A    lot w e r e          stood around.                  I s a w f ou r

or    five    'F'      Division           CID    officers,              all      dressed           in      casual        clothing.

Their    brief         was     to    keep an          eye    open          for     criminal             activity,             i.e.

pick    pocketing,             and     I was      pleased             to     see      them       in the a r e a a l t h o u g h                I

d i d not a c k n o w l e d g e        their      presence.

I was    now      effectively              the m o s t       senior             officer          in the           vicinity          of    the

turnstiles,            although Chief                 Inspector              Creaser          was       in      charge        up    to    that

point,       assisted          by    Inspectors             Sykes          a nd Purdy.

Serials       16,      17,     18,     19,      4 Sergeants                and 40 Constables were                             on duty,

along    with Mounted                officers          from S o u t h Y o rk sh ir e                    and Merseyside.

The    area was          busy,       noisy and             colourful.                 The     crowds            were     not a       lot

different         from a         normal         match       d a y at         t h at    stage,           although          there          were

m a n y more      people         about.          The m a j o r i t y            seemed        to      be     from       the

Merseyside          are a.

It s e e m e d    that m a n y         fans      had       come       without          tickets             to     get    in.        I heard

many    passing          to a n d      fro a s k i n g       other           fans      for       "spares'.               This       toing

and    froing       was       constant          and    there          seemed          no    desire           or    urgency          on the

part    of    fans       to    gain       entry       to    the       ground.

Foot    Officers,             in a c c o r d a n c e       with       our       u s ual     practice,              were       stationed

outside         each       turnstile             chatting          to a n d      searching             fans       as    they    queued

to    p as s    through        the      stiles.               Other       officers        were         actively          encouraging

f a ns    to    enter       the     g ro u n d .

Mounted         officers          were       actively            shepherding             people         into       the       turnstiles

area      to get       them       into       the        ground.           I was     not a n x i o u s         at       this    s t ag e

a n d as       I surveyed           the      scene        I considered              events         were       proceeding             to

plan.          I remember           discussing                with       Inspector       Sykes,          the m o s t          senior

and      experienced           of      the       Inspectors,              h o w we w o u l d       handle          the       non-ticket

holders         post       kick     off,      a n d we a g r e e d            that we w o u l d          tr y      to    contain

them      in L e p p i n g s      Lane       and,        as    has       happned       in the          past,       they would

probably          find      someone          with a           r ad i o    on w h i c h    they         could       listen       to      the

g ame.         I did       not w i s h       fans        to    roam       the    roads a ro un d             the       perimeter          of

the      g r o u n d at w i l l        or    u n s u p e r v i s e d as         this     has      caused          problems        in the

past      for     local       residents.

By 2.15         pm L e p p i n g s      Lane        was       full       of   fans m oving             in b o t h       directions.

I estimate            the     numbers            at a b o u t      6 — 8 thousand.                They were             spilling          off

footpaths          into       the      roadway and making                       movement          of    vehicles

difficult.             Many       fans       continued             to     drink     from       cans a n d          I continued             to

hear       people      asking          others           for    spares.

My    own      position was             in L e p p i n g s         Lane       roadway        itself          at    ground        level,

where       I continued             to m o n i t o r          events,         talking        to     policemen and                fans.

The      traffic       situation             gradually             deteriorated              and       by 2 . 2 5       pm    it b e c a m e

apparent          t h at    we w o u l d         have     to     close        Leppings         Lane       to m o t o r        vehicles.

Inspector          Sykes       and      I discussed                this       and   I contacted match                        control

asking         that    the     r oa d       be     c l o s e d at        Leppings        Lane       roundabout               a n d at

C a tc h Bar       L a ne .       My    request was                acknowledged              but       for    some       reason was

not      immediately           effective.                 Traffic             continued        to      come a l o n g         Leppings

Lane       from    the      direction              of    the      roundabout           and     some       service            buses      came

down       f r o m M i d d l e w o o d Roa d.             I walked            up L e p p i n g s       Lane       to    the     traffic

l i g h t s at     the      junction with Catch Bar Lane                                 where         there       was       a queue       of

3    service          buses       being       held     up by a          constable.              The     constable             asked

what       he w a s        to   do a n d      I told       him     to    let      the     buses        go    through.              1 then

radioed match                   control       and     repeated my             request          that L e p p i n g s          Lane

should          be    closed         but     added     that       they       should       contact           Mr.   Bert

Middleton             of S o u t h      Yorkshire          Transport           and advise              him    that       buses

would       need       to be         diverted away            from Leppings                   Lane.         These       measures

are     not      usually          necessary           on n o r m a l     match       days.

I left a             constable          on d u t y at        the    junction and walked                       back       towards

the     turnstiles.                  Most     officers        were       now a c ti ve l y           suggest!ng              to f an s

to    enter          the    ground.           The     time    was       about       S . 30     pm.

I continued                to a c t i v e l y      involve m ys el f           in    crowd        control,          especially

in the          vicinity          of    turnstiles           A~G.        These       consist           of 3 d o u b l e

turnstiles             and       one    single        turnstile          and      feed        spectators           directly           into

a    l a r ge    concourse             at    the    rear     of    the W e s t       Stand and Terrace.                        All     the

turnstiles             were       open and were              admitting            a steady           stream        of    fans       into

the     ground.             I saw       Inspector          Purdy        to    the     right       of    the       turnstiles          and

he w a s        keeping         an     eye    on    the    queues.            The    Stand area              turnstiles             1 to     16

were       all       working         and again a steady                  stream          of    spectators           were       moving

through.

The     crowd         outside          the    turnstiles           at    t hi s     stage       appeared           reasonably

good       humoured and                I was       neither        frightened             nor a n x i o u s        for    anyone's

safety.              I heard         nothing        from ma tch          control          other        than       continuous

r ad i o    traffic             describing          relatively minor                  problems          here       and       there

inside and             outside          the     ground.           However,          as    time       progressed              the

s i t u a t i o n at        the      turnstiles           began     to       deteriorate.

At    one       stage        I remember            moving     on    the       outskirts           of    the       crowd       outside

turnstiles             A to G          to    the    relatively           free       area       beside        Gate       C.     Th e

crowd were             contained             by a n     open,      chest       height,          s t ee l     barrier          a nd Gate

B.    This       is a f a i r l y           narrow area.            I saw         Inspector            Purdy watching

movement             and also          Detective          Superintendent                 M c K a y a n d PC B o c k i n g ,           who

were    observing             the      c r o w d for           pickpockets.                 There     was         a    lot       of    pushing

and    shoving          going         on w h i c h w a s         causing           discomfort              within           the       press,

and    f o ur     or    f iv e       Mounted       officers            were        within         t hi s     part          of    the    crowd,

trying        to m a i n t a i n       ord e r.           I recollect              t h at     I entered               the       crowd

myself        and      shouted         loudly          to      people        to    stop       pushing         and          shoving          as

this was          hurting            people       at      the    f ro n t .        I used          phrased            like,

"Don't worry,                you'll         all    g et        in";    "Don't           push",       etc.         etc.           Sadly       this

had    very       little          effect      and         I pushed my way                    back    out      through             the       p r e ss

to    the     rear      of     th e    crowd.             I believe              that my a ctions                 were          filmed       by a

BBC    TV     cameraman              who    had    been         standing           on     the      parapet            of    the       riv e r

bridge,         for as         I forced my way                   out        of    the     press      the      camera             team

p a s s e d me w a l k i n g            down      the       road       t o w a r d s the        rear of      the S o u t h             Stand.

The    taller          of    the        two men,            who       I do       not k n o w but h av e               seen       regularly

at    incidents             in S h e f f i e l d       previously,                said words            to    the          effect          that       I

w ou l d have          a better            view      if     I went          to    the     position           he       had       occupied          on

the    parapet          of     the     b ri d g e .

I took        his a d v i c e         and went            to    the        bridge       and       climbed         onto          the

parapet.          From       this      position             I could          see        o v e r the h e a d s          of       the    crowd

and    the      only area               w h i ch was           obscured           in part w a s the a p e r t u r e                    of

Gate     B.       The       ti m e    was    about          2.40       pm.

A    vast and          progressively more                       unruly           crowd was          now assembling.                         It

was a volatile                 and     seething             mass      of     p eo p l e .         T hey were           pushing             and

shoving         as m o r e        and more           people         continued             to a r r i v e      in the             a r e a.        At

one    p o in t     I saw a y ou th               of      perhaps           11    or     12 y e a r s      start           to    scale        the

facade        above         the      West Stand             turnstiles.                 He    reached         the          to p a n d a

great       ch e e r    went         up but       he      clearly           did    not       enjoy what               he    saw       on    the

other       side       and       returned         back         to     the     crowd.

My a t t e nt i on          returned         to      the a r e a           in f r o n t      of    turnstiles               A ~G.          I saw

Inspector Purdy                   standing           on to p          of    the    s t e el       barrier         between             the

queuing         area and             the    r oa d     to      the S o u t h S t a n d .            He w a s          balanced             like a
tight        rope       walker        and was         shouting             and     clearly           doing       his      level      best

to m a i n t a i n        a    semblance         of      o rd e r .        The     Mounted           officers          were      in the

thick        of     this       press     and were           clearly             having        the     most       difficult           time.

Their        horses           were    struggling            and       I saw a n xi e ty w r i t t e n                on    the      face       of

more      than         o ne    officer.

The      crowd         build     up     continued           to    increase             and      it    seemed         to me       that

tempers           were        becoming        frayed.

I tried           to    radio        control        that       I needed            assistance              quickly         and a

tannoyed ann ouncement                        over       the     turnstiles              loudspeakers                to    ur g e    people

to     queue        in o r d e r l y     fashion and              also          that     PC B u x t o n ,        who      normally

drives          a Landrover             equipped with                 a    public        address           facility,          to     come

directly           to L e p p i n g s        Lane     to a s s i s t        me.        I did         not     get     an

acknowledgement                  from        control,          although            I h e a r d PC B u x t o n             come      o v er

loudly and              clearly         saying:          "I'm     on m y         way".          I cannot            now say with

certainty              how     long     it    took       for PC           Buxton       to a r r i v e        but     I recollect

looking           over m y       shoulder           at    some        stage        and     seeing          PC B u x t o n     speaking

i nto     the m i c r o p h o n e        in the          Landrover              w h i c h was        in the         road    in

Leppings           Lanes        I could        not       hear     what          he w a s      saying         d ue    to    the      noise

of     the      crowd.

Having          no a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t      of m y      request           for a t a n n o y            1 guessed           that

s o me    technical             fault        had af fected                the    radio        s ys t e m .       I therefore

changed my multi                     channel        set     from Channel                 25     <the m a t c h         channel)           to

Channel          35,     which        is H a m m e r t o n      Road Channel,                  and asked             the    controller

to     p a ss     on m y      request         for a t a n n o y e d             announcement               to    ground       control

by     telephone.              I subsequently                  learned           that      this was             passed      at 2 . 4 4         pm

and actioned,                 but     I cannot           remember           ever       hearing        what          was    broadcast.

Over      the      next       few minutes            the       scenes           outside        the     turnstiles

deteriorated                 very     rapidly        indeed.              An     enormous           crowd        continued           to

converge           on    the    turnstiles.                There          was     tota l       c o n f u s i o n as m a n y          di d

n ot     know which            area      they       had    to    queue           in to        gain    entrance,            and       the
                                                                                                                                       PAGE        16
                                                                                                                                       R233

signs above              the    turnstiles are                   rather          poorly marked.                    Very many

seemed        to    be    under          the     influence            of    dr i nk .       Fans        at    the      rear       pressed

forward            with     tot a l       irresponsibility and                         disregard             for    the     safety            of

others.            The    b e st     efforts           of F o o t      and Mounted              officers            failed          to

deter       them.         There          d i d not      seem      to       be m u c h m o v e m e n t         through           the

turnstiles           and       it    seemed          that       people        were       fighting            each     other        to go

through.            Some       started          to     climb      over        turnstiles.                I saw        one       fa n

actually           traverse          a    l e dge      o ve r    the       r i ver     on the       outside           of    the        bridge

to    bring        him    nearer          to the        turnstiles.                  Some     scrambled             on the          river

bank       itself.

As    I watched           I felt          someone           pushing         at m y a n k l e s          and    I interpreted

this       as a n a t t e m p t          to    p u s h me       off    the       bridge       into       the       river.          I

jumped        down and          r e m o n s t r a t e d w i t h a man.                   He a p p e a r e d        dr u n k .      I

remember           he w a s     wearing           sunglasses               and     these      fell       off       his     face,         only

to    be    crushed         underfoot             by o t h e r s        in the         crowd.           I could          only

remonstrate              with       this man and                he w a s      soon       swallowed            up    in the         crush.

By about           2.45     pm the            crowd was          jammed against                 the      turnstiles               in all

areas       b ut    the     press was worst                     against          turnstiles             A~G.        Fans        were

swarming           over    the       gat e s,        parapets          and       facade       of    the       turnstiles.                 I

recollect           seeing          Inspector           Bennett            on the        roof a b o v e        turnstiles                1-16.

He    d i d not      send       the       fans       back       down       into      the    crowd.            The     turnstiles

and    gates were              effectively              under         se i g e .       There       was       absolute           b ed l a m .

People        were       kicking          and     fighting            each       other      and     clearly m any were

absolutely           terrified.                 The M o u n t e d          officers         were        absolutely              valiant

but    their work              was       of    li t t l e   avail.

Inspector           Purdy       gesticulated                to me          and     I climbed            from       the     parapet            of

the    bridge        and       forced my way                to    the       r i g ht     hand      of    the       blue     heavy

turnstiles           A-G were             being         crushed          and     a s k e d me     to    open          gates.        He    was

not     specific          as    to w h i c h           gates     he      thought         should        be    opened          but    his

a n x i e t y was        apparent.                It    confirmed my              perception,               unprecedented                in

my     experience,             that       t hi s w a s      no      ordinary         crowd        of    fans          but    an

enormous        press          of    people            determined           to    enter        the     stadium          come w h a t

may.         I was,       nevertheless,                  unhappy          to a g r e e     to     the       requests          to

implement           it w o u l d         l ea d    to    uncontrolled               access        to    the       s ta di u m and

negate        all    our       efforts            to    prevent          hooliganism            in side.              I told       him

that     we w o u l d      have          to h a n g      on.        He    responded            by s a y i n g         that    unless

g a t e s we re o p e n e d          people            would     be      crushed.          The       look        of    extreme

anxiety        remained             on    his      face.         I took a cc ou n t             of     the       fact       that    this

was    an     Inspector             speaking            to me a n d         I made        my mind           up    immediately

that     the    only       practical               way     to    prevent          deaths        outside           would       be to

open     the    g at e s .          I nodded            to Mr.        Purdy and           told       h im    I would          contact

ground        control.              He    returned          to      his     position           by the        st e e l       barrier       and

I pushed my way                 back        to m y v a n t a g e          point      on the          bridge           parapet.

The     s i t u a t i o n was        u n ch an ged and was                  worsening           by the m i n u t e .               It    had

outgrown        our       capacity             to m a n a g e       it e f f e c t i v e l y .         The       s i t u a t i o n was

unprecedented              in m y         experience.

I s a w a b e er          can       thrown         from w i t h i n         the     crowd       jammed           in f r o n t      of

turnstiles           A-G.           It hit a M o u n t e d               officer         and    the     contents             ran d o w n

his     coat.

I radioed           ground          control            and asked          for     the     g a t e s at       the L e p p i n g s         Lane

end     of    the    ground          to     be o p e n e d .          There       wa s    no a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t .

Initially           I thought             my      own    r a di o     was      defective          so    I jumped             down       from

the     bridge       and       pushed my way across                         to    Inspector            Ellis.           I asked          him

fo r    his    radio,          which        I remember              was     an    old Bur n de pt            type.           I called

ground        control          in    Inspector             Ellis*         presence         and       repeated my              request

for     gates       to    be    o p e n e d at          the L e p p i n g s       Lane     end.         There          was    no

acknowledgement.

I again          returned             to m y v a n t a g e       point       and       scrambled           onto       the     bridge

parapet.              Once       again       I believe           I changed             channels           to 3 5 a n d        asked      the

staff       at H a m m e r t o n         Road Control               Room     to      pass     on m y       request          to    open

gates.           I believe             my message was a ck now le dge d                           but as       I changed              back

to    the m a t c h         control,             radio     cover       had       clearly          resumed.            I repeated my

request          that       the       gates at Le pp in gs                Lane       should        be     opened and             said

that       unless          it w a s      done      quickly          someone          would        be    killed.

It    is d i f f i c u l t        to     put      into w o r d s       now       the    scene          of w h i c h    I and          other

police          officers          were       a    part.        Radio        messages          were       almost        inaudible

due    to the          no i se .         The      s it ua ti on at          the      turnstiles            was    obviously

frightening                as m o r e       and more          fans     pushed          to g a i n       entrance.            There       was

no    semblance             of    queues,          neither          was     there       any       self-discipline                 or    order.

About       S . 48     pm      I saw C Gate              opened        slightly          from within              t he      ground.

This       was    not       immediately apparent                       to    the       crowd       in the        turnstiles             area

A - G as        the    gate was             invisible          to    them        from where             they were           standing.

A trickle             of    people          passed        through         the     gate.           I sa w     Inspector            Purdy

physically             pulling           people         from     the      p r e ss     under       the     barrier          and

thrusting             them       bodily          through       the     gate.

A Mounted             officer          was       by the       gate,       as w e r e      numerous           Foot      officers,

and    it s e e m e d          to me        that       the a c t i o n      of    opening          C Gate        brought          a

little          respite          to    the a r e a        in f r o n t      of    the     turnstiles,             but       t h is

lasted          only       seconds          as    the     c r o w d wa s     topped          up by o t h e r s         still

pushing          in L e p p i n g s         Lan e.

After       a short            period C Gate               was      cl o se d .        Large       numbers        of       persons       were

s t il l    flooding             into       the are a .          The      crowd        now    spilled         out      o v er     the

road       to    the S o u t h S t a n d .

Mounted          officers             then,       of    their       own     volition,             succeeded           in    closing

the    heavy          b lu e     s t ee l    perimeter           gates,          clearly with              the    plan        in m i n d

of    relieving             the       crush       on    the    turnstiles.                These         officers           stationed

themselves             behind          the       gate.        Fans     continued             to    climb over              the w a l l s

and     parapets        of      the      turnstiles               in    l a r ge    numbers,             but w h e t h e r        t h is     wa s

to     prevent       their         being       crushed            or    to   gain        f r ee     entrance           to    the

ground,       I cannot             say.

The     heavy      stee l       perimeter              gate was          being          shaken and              was clearly

coming       under      enormous            pressure.                  I believed             th a t         it w o u l d    o n l y be a

matter       of    time       before        it w a s         knocked         down        completely and                  the      thought

crossed my m ind                that       our     horses          would       be       impaled            on the p o i n t s          of the

metal     rails       of w h i c h         the     gate was             constructed.

About     2.52       pm the         gate       burst         open and          the M o u n t e d          officers           were

b rushed aside.                A    crowd        of     people          surged          through          into      the      turnstile

area and          service          road.

I remember           looking          across           at G a t e       A which          provides            access         to    the

N o r t h Stand.          I had          not     earlier           seen      th is       gate       opened.            It w a s        under

pressure          a n d wa s       being       shaken          by a      large          pr ess      of    p eo p l e .       I radioed

ground       control          and asked            for       the N o r t h         Stand       gate       to     be    opened,             and

after     a short         time        t hi s     wa s       done.        Fans       entered            but     I cannot           s a y no w

in w h a t    numbers.              I noted            there were            police           officers           on    both       sides          of

th e   gate and         they        seemed         to       be q u i c k l y       in    co n t r o l     of     the     situation.

The    desperate          push        to    enter           the    ground          continued             in the        front          of

turnstiles          A-G.           The     Mounted           officers          were       s till         trying        to    co n t r o l

the    situation.              About        th e       same       time    Gate          C opened again and

simultaneously                there was            a    roar       from      inside           the      ground.           This         excited

the a t m o s p h e r e       e v e n m o re .          A    l a r ge    number          of    fans      -     I cannot           say       how

many - entered                through          the      gate.           I cannot          s a y to w h a t            area       of    the

ground       they went.

Some     still      went       in t h r o u g h         the       turnstiles             but      the     crush        visibly

diminished.

I di d    not      see G a t e        B o p e n e d at a n y             st ag e .

Shortly after             3    pm t h e r e w a s a               r a d io m e s s a g e       passed          that      t h e r e was

                                                                                                                                R233

available          officer         to a s s i s t .

There     were       s t il l    l a rg e      numbers        of     people          in L e p p i n g s      Lane    so    I s e nt

about     30 men        i n si d e:      the        remainder         stayed          in the       vicinity          of    the

turnstiles.

There     was      further         ra d i o     traffic          that      there        were      injured        people         inside

t he   ground.

It q u i c k l y    became         apparent           that       there       ha d     been a       serious          incident          on

t he L e p p i n g s    Lane       Terrace           and    soon      the      concourse           at     the    rear      of    the

West    Stand was           thronged with                  f an s    coming          from    the     tunnel.          Some       were

carrying         injured         comrades.             These         persons          had    the a p p e a r a n c e       of

having      been       crushed.

Some    casualties              appeared            dead,     although           I could          not     say    how many            or

from what          area     they        ha d    come.

Al l   police       officers            present        responded             i m m e d i a t e l y a n d we         tried       to

bring     order        to a      scene         of    pandemonium and                  chaos.         Many       officers         were

trying      to     resuscitate              pe ople,        using         mouth       to m o u t h      resuscitation and

cardiac         massage.

Whilst      officers            were     trying        to     save        l i ve s    of    fans     th e     conduct       of

other     fans      was     deplorable.                A drunken man                  swore       obscenely          at me a n d              I

was    s pa t    upon.

We were         j o i n e d at     the      b ac k    of    the W e s t        Stand        by m a n y       other    police

officers,          then,        by f i r s t        one,    then a growing                  fleet       of a m b u l a n c e s .

Ambulances           could       no t    enter        through Gate               C    so as       b es t we      c o u l d we

tried     to     get    casualties              down       through         the       concourse          to    the    roadway          by

th e   gate.        They were            there        separated            into       three       groups        - those

apparently          dead,        those         seriously            injured,          and    those        less      seriously

hurt.       At     some     stage        I spoke           to a s e n i o r          fireman and asked                him       for

some    sheets         to   screen          bodies         which were            being       placed          in the       road.           I

recollect          asking        for     the m a j o r        incident           boxes       to    be     brought         from

Hammerton Road Police                       Station         to      the    ground.

                                                                                                                       R233

             All    officers      present         were    employed attempting               to    bring    some     order   to

             the    very   difficult         situation.

             I learned       that     the    match       ha d    been abandoned and when                this    became

             public     knowledge          fans    started        to    drift   out    of   the     ground.

             I was     directed       to    report       to m a t c h    control      and about       5.15     pm   I was

             transported        to H e a d q u a r t e r s      where    I briefed      the C h i e f     Constable      and

             th e D e p u t y C h i e f    Constable         regarding      these      ev en t s.

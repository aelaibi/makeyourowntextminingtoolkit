              I have been employed for some thirteen years at the Northej^T G e n e ral

             Hospital,          Sheffield,      for that length of time I was engarged as Porter,

              but in recent weeks have been engaged as a messel

              On April       15 1989 (150489),         I was on duty at the hospital working

              10.30am (1030)               1900 h r s , at approximately       1535 h rs w h i 1st in the mess

              Casualty Department and to find as many trolleys and oxygen units as

              we could find.               This we did and subsequently rushed to the Casualty

              De p a r tme nt.      When the first ambulance was arriving,                    I recollect there

             were four p e r s o n s on the ambulance, two on the floor and two on beds.

              assessing the patients as they arrived.                        On the direction of Mr

         resuscitation room or the physio therapy room,                   to be re-assessed at a

         later s t a g e .   Amongst the patients were varying injuries and some

         apparently dead.

         I took a number of pat ients to respective a r e a s .                I recollect taking



         a p p r o x imiitely 16 sto n o   _   T     ci   assisted by                   and

                     ind possibly                            I do not recollect anything else

         about this person.          This youth would poss ibly about 32 years of a g e .

         He was laid on the plaster room floor and I continued on my with a

         trolley to another theatre where                   it was required.

         For the rest of the day,              I was involved with assisting the walking

         wounded and ferrying these patients to X-ray departments and generally

         assisting where I could.

         I had nothing more to do with any deceased persons and cannot assist

         with the identity or description of those persons.

         I subsequently went off duty at 2000 hrs that same evening.

                                                                                              SIGNED

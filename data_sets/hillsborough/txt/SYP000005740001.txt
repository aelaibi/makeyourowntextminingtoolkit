when a match              is under way,,             U s u a l l y howBver          wne n the          crowd    sways

forward           they almost       immediate ly sw^y back                     but      this        time    every tiffse

they went           forward      they just           seanted to stay t h e r e so                    that    the    peopIe

at the           front w ere     getting j r f a r e      ana more          crushed-              I saw a few         people

 climb over           the   top of tne          fence       out onto         the       pitch arid also             some    were

 being        1 i f ted u p 1 n t o o u r s t a n d to our                right,.       I then saw           that a,-few

 the fence           just   behind       the    goal.         This was a slow                 process        and    they

were        only getting         out     in one's ana twos,                  1 also          noticed        that    the

terraces           on either       corner       of    the ground were almost                         empty.,

Soo n there were              quite a few            people         on the     edge       of the        pitch      behind

the goal           and then      the p atch was             stopped.           I then         saw people

uncons cious           on the      pi t ch and othe r s were                 t ry i ng to           r esus c i tate    Inem „

I also       saw blankets               and      jackets        being     put over       peooles      faces     ana    I

assumed           they were         dead.         We    stayed where we were                u n 1 11 about      4,3 0 prrs

( 1630)      and         saw the      tragedy          unfold,,         We saw the       fans    carrying       bodies

to the       other         end of the            pitch on the            advertisement          hoardings,,          A lot

of    poo pis had           left      the     ground      oy this         time and we        left     oy the     same

entrance we               nad    come      in,     There were            only a few people           aooul      at    this

We were           o b viously       very w o r r i e d about Pater                so we went        back     to the        oar

there were               long    queues       outside       them all,,           We asked a policeman                if he

had any           information but                he d i d n ?t ana        said    the    best    thing was       to

phone       the emergency               number,.         We decided          that we would maKe             our way

I    felt    that wnen             the m a t c h had been stopped                     the Police     were     very     slow

NOTE
TO:     Mr. E.A. Croker

FROM:
RE:     The Football Supporters Association



On Monday morning (6th April) I answered Mr . Bird's
telephone and spoke to a __________________ of The Football
Supporters Association.
            sai^ that his organisation had a Petition and
Dossier on the distribution of Cup Final tickets and had
been told to contact Mr. Bird to see if he would accept
these items* on behalf of The Football Association, on
Friday 10th April.
When Mr. Bird came back to his office I advised him of the
call and he asked me to telephone              and inform him
that he would accept the Petition and Dossier as long as it
could be before 11.00 a.m. on Friday, 10th, as he had a
meeting at that time. I telephone               and he
confirmed he would arrange for someone from The FSA to be at
Lancaster Gate before 11.00 a.m., on the 10th.

At approx. 9.30 a.m. this morning Mr. Bird met the
representative of The FSA in Reception and was somewhat
surprised to find reporters from Capital Radio and Hayters
were also present.
 Mr. Bird said he was non-committal to the FSA representative
 and said the- documents would be put to the appropriate
 Committee. I believe he spoke very briefly to both Capital
 Radio and Hayters.
 Mr. Bird realised when he received the documents that the
 matters referred to therein were rather more controversial
 than he had been led to believe.
 The "Dossier" refers to safety matters at Wembley Stadium.
               from Wembley has since telephoned Mr. Bird on
 the matter, as he has been contacted about the documents and
 was very unhappy about their contents. I do not know how
 Mr. Bird left it with

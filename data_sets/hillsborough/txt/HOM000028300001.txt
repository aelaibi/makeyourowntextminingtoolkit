Note



The Home Office have just unearthed this 1971 report on tests of
static loads on live subjects.   It apparently preceded the 1973
paper (copied to you while we were in Sheffield) which itself
preceded the 1975 Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

INTRODUCTION

        This study deals with experiments, performed on live subjects,

to determine an individual’s tolerance to static loads applied to the

thorax and abdomen.     The tests were designed to provide information,

hitherto non existent, which is necessary to formulate standards in

connection with crowd control crush barriers.

        Two series of tests were carried out:

        1.     Each subject was pressed against a steel tube located

horizontally against various positions on the trurik.

        2.     Each subject was pressed against a wooden plank, again

located horizontally against various positions on the trunk.

Since the tests involved live subjects there was no question of using

loads of such a magnitude which might conceivably cause injury.     Con­

sequently the decision on what was considered tolerable was left

entirely at the discretion of the individual undergoing the test.

APPARATUS

        Figures 1, 2 and 3 show photographs and a line drawing of the

apparatus used in the tests.

        The basic iron framework is 36 inches long, 28 inches wide and

25 inches high.     The subject is drawn forward on to the barrier by means

of a pack frame via four cords which are mounted on an adjustable T-frame

which is constrained to move in the horizontal direction only.      The

constraint consists of a precision-machined, one inch diameter steel bar

which runs freely in a nrulti-race bearing.     The load is applied to the

subject by two wires attached to the T-frame end of the steel bar which

run over pulleys to a weight hanger which can take a dead load.     In order

to apply the barrier to various positions on the trunk the subject’s height

above ground level is adjustable by means of wooden boards ox various

thickness.

        Incorporated on the steel bar is an adjustable stop which limits

the travel of the T-frame to 0.;) inches at any state of loading.

METHOD

1.        Each subject was asked to confirm that he had no disease or injury

which might be influenced by the tests.       In the first series of tests, an

ECG was first taken from each subject.

2.        Immediately before the test the purpose of the experiment and

details of the experimental procedure were explained to the subject and

each was asked to sign a form giving "informed consent" to the procedure.

3.        The age, sex, height and weight of the subject were noted.

4.        The position of the first load application point was identified

on the subject’s body, and the height of the point above the ground was

noted.

5.        The subject stood against the barrier on the appropriate number

of wooden boards.     Subjects wore normal clothing, without jackets, and

any hard objects etc. were removed from their pockets.

6.        Weights were placed on the weight hanger in suitable increments

until the subject stated that he felt the onset of discomfort.       The

load was noted.     Further weights were added until the subject felt the

second level of discomfort and similarly for the third level.       The

subjective levels of discomfort were defined as follows:-

          Subjective load level A - the first sensation of discomfort

                                      felt by the subject.

          Subjective load level B - discomfort which was estimated by

                                      the subject to be tolerable for

                                      about half an hour,

          subjective load level C - discomfort which was estimated by

                                      the subject to become intolerable

                                      after a few seconds.

7.        Stages 4, 5 and 6 in the method were then repeated for the

remainder of the load application points using the tube or the 4" wide

planlc.    In the first series of tests the load application points were as

defined in fig. 4 , but it later became apparent that no more useful
                                  7


information would be obtained from further tests at points 1 and 2 and

the remainder of the tests were only performed at the application points

3 and 4 , and in addition at the conventional barrier height of 42 inches

from the ground.
8.       Using the tube at the height of 42 inches, the subject was loaded

in the usual way to load level C.      He was then asked to adjust his

position by bending or standing on tip-toe in an attempt to improve his

tolerance of the load.    He was then asked to push against the barrier

with his hands in any way that he chose and the load was increased until

the subject again felt discomfort corresponding to load level C.

SAFETY
         Only healthy adults were used as subjects for the tests.        An

electrocardiograph was taken from most of the subjects.       There is

evidence that a blow on the chest over the heart may cause some disturb­

ance of function of the heart even in a normal person.       Although it was

felt highly unlikely that the slowly applied pressure of our experiments

would have any effect on the heart, we thought it prudent to exclude any

subject with any abnormality of the heart.       The subjects were therefore

screened by recording the ECG and blood pressure, and briefly examining

the cardio-vascular function of each subject.       The ECG’s were also

checked by Dr. P. Kidner of the Cardiac Unit, King‘s College Hospital.

No abnormalities were detected, although one ECG which was unsatisfactory

on technical grounds could not be repeated as the subject declined to

 continue with the experiments.       In the second stage of the tests the

 testing procedure did not require pressure over the heart and it was felt

 that the ECG screening was no longer necessary.
          Particular care was taken in the design of the apparatus to ensure

 the safety of the subjects.      The method of loading by dead-weight was

 chosen as a failure could never result in an increase in the load.           Two

 experimenters were present during each test so that the load couM be
                                8



"rapidly removed by one experimenter pushing against the ram and so

releasing the load from the subject.    An adjustable stop was provided

bo   that, should the subject become fatigued, the maximum increase in

deflection which could occur was 0 .5 inches.

         ‘An alarm bell was provided for the subject in case speech was

impeded by pressure on the chest.

RESULTS

          The results are tabulated for each of the 48 subjects and the

                                               W
are included in Appendix l(pages 27 - 75)*

          In the first series of tests 17 male and 12 female subjects

were tested at all four load application points and then a further 15

male subjects were tested at points 3 and 4»        42 " inches from ground

level only.

          The results obtained are presented in histogram form in Tables

1 to 8 (Pages 13 - 20).

REPRODUCIBILITY

          For a given individual it was found that, if the tests were

repeated after an interval of a few days or mere, the two sets of

results corresponded in all cases to within 20% or less.

CAUSES OF DISCOMFORT

          Subjects reported four main causes of discomfort from the tests.

(a)       Localised pain.   If the tube or plank was at a level where it

rested on a bone immediately beneath the skin, the force was applied only

to a small area and considerable pressure developed in the trapped skin.

This was painful in the area over which the pressure was applied.       The two

sites at which this phenomenon occurred were level 1 (the manubrio—sternal

angle) and in subjects of slim build at level 4 (the anterior superior

iliac spine).

(b)       Restriction of breathing.   When force was applied over the lower

chest or upper abdomen (levels 2 and 3 and 42 inches in short subjects)

many subjects complained that they found difficulty in breathing and asked

for the tests to be stopped.     It is unlikely that this difficulty was

caused by a simple mechanical restriction of the chest.      In most cases

subjects contracted their respiratory muscles (the diaphragm and intercostal

muscles and the muscles of the upper abdominal wall) to support their ribs
                                 11


against the applied force.     The contracted muscles were then unable to

provide respiratory movements.        Some subjects were able to hold their

breath ftm-ing the time the load was applied and so restriction of breathing

did not constitute a reason for stopping the test.

        High loads which restricted breathing were never applied to any

subject for longer than about 30 seconds.       If loads were to be applied

for a longer period the need to breathe would, in many cases, produce a

considerable reduction in the maximum tolerable force.

(c)    Muscular Fatigue.      Loads applied to the lower chest and the

abdomen were resisted by contraction of the underlying muscles, and this

strong muscular contraction was sometimes a source of discomfort.

(d)     Internal Pain.     In some cases tolerance is limited by an

ill-defined "deep" discomfort which is presumably caused by deformation

or displacement of internal organs.

             SUBJECTIVE LOAD LEVEL




The Subjective load levels are defined as follows




   A   - the first sensation of discomfort felt

           by the subject.




   B   -   discomfort which was estimated by the

           subject to be tolerable for about half

           an hour.




   C   - discomfort which was estimated by the

           subject to become intolerable after a

           few seconds.

 CONCLUSIONS

1*1        Steel Tube Crush Barrier - Subjects passive

           The mean values of the maximum tolerable force as defined

by subjective load level C (Tables: 1, 2, 3 , 6 & 7) were as follows:

                                        Male             Female

Application Point 1                     94 lbf           30 lbf
                     2                  88 lbf           34 lbf
                     3                  90 lbf           39 lbf
                     4               106 lbf             51 lbf
42" from ground level               107 lbf              Not measured

       Evidently application point 4» at the anterior superior iliac

spine, enabled most subjects to tolerate a higher load.

       Table 5 indicates that application point 4 was at a mean height

of 41*5 inches from ground level.        Since the mean of the maximum tolerable

force at this point is 106 lbf, and that for 42 inches it is 107 lbf, this

shows a remarkable confirmation.        These results therefore indicate that

the present barrier height of 42 inches from ground level is to be preferred.

       The forces taken by the twelve female subjects Here so consistently

low that one cannot dismiss them on mere psychological grounds.         However it

would be unrealistic to design crush barriers from these figures alone.         In

a mixed crowd it is likely that the more slight female form would be protected

from the maximum crowd force by the likelihood of there being a male either

side of her at the barrier.

1.2    Steel Tube Crush Barrier - Subjects active

       Table 4 shows the results obtained for male subjects only when the

subjects were allowed to:

       (i) Adjust their own position for maximum comfort

       (ii) To actively push on the barrier to ease the force on the trunk.

       The results indicate that the mean maximum tolerable force is increased

by 12 % when the subject adjusts his own position, and by 6T% when he is allowed

to push.

          It may be noted that there is a remarkable correlation between

the percentage gains in the three cases.        Clearly the gain of a third

indicates a significant rise in the average tolerance level.
DISCUSSION

          The highest loads were tolerated when the subject was allowed to

push on the barrier.      The actual values ranged from 98 - 233 lbf with

a mean force of 179 lbf.     In using these figures as design criteria
the questions arise:

(i)      Should the value chosen be the lowest, ensuring that no one in

the crowd is likely to be subjected to severe discomfort?

(ii)     Should some intermediate figure be chosen such that a proportion

of the population is subjected to a degree of discomfort which they would
judge to be intolerable.

(iii)    Should it be the highest, based on the surmise that if one mart can

tolerate a given load it is unlikely to cause injury to any other person,
irrespective of what pain or discomfort he might experience?

       This latter argument could be extended by reasoning that, since

the man who tolerated 233 lbf was clearly not likely to be near the

threshold of injury, therefore the design force could be raised to

300 lbf.     However, it mast be appreciated that this is miere speculation.

It may well be true, but until subjects are available who are prepared

and willing to be subjected to this force, irrespective of the consequences,

the point cannot be proved.

       The choice of an actual value for design purposes will be influenced

by the conditions for which the crowd control systems are being designed.

If -it is felt that the ma-vimum crowd force will only be exerted under rare

and extreme conditions, then it may well be acceptable to choose a value

which is considered to be near the threshold of injury.      If however one is

designing for crowd conditions which are expected to occur regularly and

frequently during an event, then it would seem unreasonable to choose a

value above the ma.yirmim value of 233 lbf or even the mean value of 179 lbf ^

and the mini rmim value of 98 lbf might well be preferred.

       The report by Mr. L. E. Creasey (January 1948) suggests that the

force/foot width of barrier for each row of the crowd when      " the crowd

exerts an additional pressure in its effort to see items of special interest

ahead" is:


                        12 x 4 = 16 lbf
                             3

       Multiplying by the factors for a mixed crowd

of a man (l^-) gives:


                        Force = 16 x | x 1^ = 21 lbf


This is the strain force produced by each person in the crowd.      Clearly

a crowd of 8 persons would produce a force of 1C8 lbf on the back of an
                                 24



individual pinned against the barrier - or nearly the same force s,s the

mean of the main'mum tolerable force obtained in these tests (viz 179 lbf).

Consequently the depth of the crowd can be 9 persons or 10 feet.     If the

highest ina.TMmum tolerable force of 233 lbf is used instead of 179 l"bf this

will permit the depth of the crowd to be raised to



                   1 +      x | or 15 feet



        These calculations assume that only the strain force and not the

heave force is being developed by the crowd.    However, the heave force

in any crowd would tend to be a transient phenomenon and as such might

be considered to be a dynamic rather than a static force.     Bone itself

exhibits increased strength at the high strain rates associated with

dynamic loading, and if the transient forces are applied through a bony

structure this may well provide the additional safety factor required to

allow for the transient heave force.    In the subjects tested the average

height of the strong bony pelvis is 41 .•5 inches, which is sensibly at the

same height as the normal crush barrier.

        In order to ensure that this possible advantage is experienced by

a significant cross section of the population the barrier should have

sufficient depth to make contact with the pelvises of most individuals

in a crowd.   In the subjects tested it was found that a barrier of 4

inches depth* extending from 40 inches to 44 inches above ground level

would have met this requirement for 27 out of the 36 subjects tested.

        The test results also indicated that a four inch deep plank

increases the average tolerance to static load by approximately one third.

Hence the use of a deep top rail would have a distinct advantage as far as

the more static crowd lean force is concerned, and in addition may well help

to reduce the risk of injury which may be caused by the more transient

heave force of the crowd.
                                25



        The results obtained testing female subjects have been ignored

in the foregoing analysis because the values appear to provide design

criteria which would be nearly impossible to comply with in practice.

Whether this is a valid reason for ignoring the results is open to

discussion and the answer would depend on many factors other than those

considered in this report.

1.      The use of live subjects obviously limits the load which may be

applied, possibly to well below the value which would cause injury -

particulary when loading at the level of the pelvis.     An indication of

the load necessary to cause injury might possibly be obtained by the use

of fresh cadavers.     However, although this may be quite feasible where

the rib cage is involved it might well raise serious ethical problems

where the pelvis is to be fractured.

2,      All the previous results relating to crowd forces were obtained on

level ground.      The effect a slope would have upon the results remains to

be investigated.      Since it is to be expected that the crowd forces would

be larger, it is difficult to conceive how such values may be used to

achieve a better ergonomic design of the barrier, although they would

certainly be useful in designing the supporting structure.

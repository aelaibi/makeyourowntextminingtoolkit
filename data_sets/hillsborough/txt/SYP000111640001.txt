Together          w i t h PC E l l i s         I toured        the      area     qf    the     ground       so as        to

Penistone           Road.          Other       mounted       officers          from     the     serial        were       working

the    road         and      enter       the    ground.           There       was     a good      presence          of    foot

patrol       officers           outside         each    turnstile             in P e n i s t o n e     Road.        The       cro w d s

directed          to    the     turnstiles            and    into       the    ground.          There       were      quite         a

Liverpool           fans      were       moved    immediately              and      directed away             from       the

ground.           There       were       very m an y        people        approaching           the     ground who             had

been    drinking           alcohol         and    the       numbers        who      were     a r r i v i n g w i t h — can s of

this    was       turned        down.

There    was        only      one    special          train       carrying          Liverpool         supporters              to

then     I heard          nothing          on m y      radio         for     some         time.          I l o o k e d at m y w a t c h

the    ground        by    that       time.

I heard a          request           on the         rad i o     for      more      horses           at    L^ppiri^s^ane                      and a

The y were         very        hositle        towards           me     and were            attempting                 to    get        past       and

            As     people were             entering           the    ground          they were           standing             on     empty

            alcohol        cans w h i c h w e r e             littered everywhere,                          I then          saw     exit       g ate      'B'    ,

            which     had       been       closed whilst               I was         there,        open and             fans        a gain      entered

             the    ground.            I saw       no    one    corfe out.                                                                 1

            Nearly        everyone           I saw       left       in L e p p i n g s          Lane   was        in    possession              of     cans

             of    beer    or       lager.

             At    approximately                3.10     pm    I went        w i t h P S 399,               P C ’s 357,           E47S,        1498,

             2613    and 2316           to      the m a i n P o l i c e         Access           entrance,             to    th e    ground          on

             Penistone          Road and           i n to     the    ground          to     stand       by at          the    entrance            to      the

             playing       area        because          it s e e m e d     that        a    pitch       invasion was                 likely.              On

             my arrival             I could        see      down     the     side          of    the N o r t h S t a n d to             the       goal

             a r e a at    the       Spion Kop           end    of     the      ground.            The       goal       area was           empty and

             I didn't           think      the     game       had    started.

             We w e r e    joined          by    Insp.        Hand-Davis             and        then    I heard a             rad i o      message

             requesting             that     a temporary             mortuary              be    set    up     in the         gymnasium.                  I

             saw many           injured and             apparently           dead          people       being          brought         from       the

             playing       area        a n d we w e r e        moved       to        the    rear       of    the jgymna^tjjym^and still

                                                 the     game was          officially              abandoned                I patrolled

             Penistone          Road and Herries                    Road areas              and     then      round          the     ground          u n ti l

             stood    down.

             I returned             to N i a g a r a     and    finished              d u t y at 8          pm.

              i am a Police              Constable! in the                     South         Yorkshire            P o l y e and             I have

              almost        twenty       six       years^service,                   I h ave          been a member                    of    the    Mounted

              Department           for    the        past     twenty years,                   and       throughout               my    service       I

                 ave    regularly         worked         M o u n t e d Police- d u t i e s                 at     the H i l l s b o r o u g h

              Football           Ground.

              I am a b l e        to    say     t hat     I have         never          known        ho rsjps to            be    used       inside       the

              tuj^istile a r e a,             or     inside       the       perimeter               walls        of    the H i l l s b o r o u g h

             ground         before       the       start      of a n y         f               h                 there.

              Horses        do    go    i nto      the L e p p i n g s L a n e           e n d of          the    ground          v i a g a t e *C *

              when      all      turnstiles          are      clear         on     the       outside         of       the    ground,          and    this

              is a l w a y s      after       the     game     has       started.

              Horses        were       used     at    half-time             at     Leppings             Lane      end       to    form a          cordon

              between         home      and     away Supporters                    using           toilets        beneath             the    West

              Stand,        but    this       p roblem was             solved           by    building            the       brick          wall    between

              Gate      'S'      and    the     rear     of    the       West       Stand.

              Horses        were       also     used and         still         are,          at half        time        to       help form

              orderly         queues      at       the r e f r e s h m e n t       hatch           at      the    rear       South Corner                of

              the      West      Stand.

              I have,         in the      past,         worked         my      horse         inside        the t u r n s t i l e s           at

              Leppings          Lane   at    the    end    of    the     matches     to    reinforce      cordons   of    Foot

              Patrol       Officers         at   the   end      of   the    tunnel      under     the   West   Stand,    and      at

              the       South    Enclosure         side    of    this      Stand   in     order    to   ensure   that    the

              crowd       left    without        fighting.

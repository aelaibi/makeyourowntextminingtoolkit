                      Coroner himself (p318E) says to Biehard MIf I tell you

          Para 4 -    The camera that took          the pictures   was   Indeed   in
                      wox-Mclng order . . . . . .

                      Prior to thin statement the South Yorkshire Police
                      position haa always been that the scoreboard camera
                      was faulty, (transcript* confirm this.)

                      South Yorks Police tried to discredit Houldsworth (who
                      stated that he had repaired the camera) as recent as
                      December 1996.


          Para 5 -        live transmission of the pictures ijjto the police
                      control point at the time was of poor quality. «...
          PAra 5 -    It has always heen assumed that thm interference

                     CCTV systems are hard wired with screened co-axial
                     oafele and piatuxes from the oaaera are fed to the box
                     down these cables and not "transmitted*

                     it would render crowd control at all these events
                     unsafe hence it would have surfaced before now.

                     In a ractmt conversation with the BSC in Z*ee>ds they
                     confirmed no knowledge of this -problem". Houldswcrfeh
                     and Hicks have no knowledge of such problems.
                     Th* Tara*t0<3irlpti» show that police evidence w&* that
                     other cameras were satisfactory. They d s s fcha eame
                     cables and terminate in the police box - why did the
                     previously unknown interference not affect them.

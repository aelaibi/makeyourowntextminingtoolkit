POLICE SERGEANT 266




DOG SECTION, NIAGARA




I am Police Sergeant 266 of the South Yorkshire Police at the present time

attached to the Dog Section.

On Saturday 15 April                 1989 I was a patrol Sergeant attached to Hackenthorpe

Police        Station    and     together        with ten Constables I commenced duties                        at the

Hillsborough Football Ground in charge of Serial No 4 with my ten officers.

The    Inspector         in     charge      of    my    serial       and    several       others     was     Inspector

Han s e y .

I was      responsible          for policing of the car park from the directors/players

entrance         to    the    main    gates      in    Penistone       Road      North,    which     also     included

supervision of turnstiles leading from the car park to the terraces.                                               I was

in possession of a personal radio but my officers were not.

Everything appeared quite normal where we were until about 2.00 pm, when I

noticed         that    large    numbers         of    supporters         were     arriving    at    the     Penistone

Road North end.               The volume of supporters increased to a point where in 24

years     of     policing       football         matches      at     Hillsborough,        I   had    never    seen    so

many people there.

A   lot    of    supporters          entering         via    the   Penistone       Road North        car    park were

Liverpool         supporters,         the majority            of   whom     were    drinking beer          from cans.

Whilst they were not drunk, I would describe their behaviour as boisterous.

My officers and myself were engaged in preventing these supporters entering

into      the    ground       with    the     cans      of    beer    and    directing        them   via     the    side
streets      to     the    Leppings            Lane    entrance         where      at    the    briefing         we    had been

instructed         to send        them.          But,       due    to   sheer      numbers       of people,           many must

have got through as kick off time approached. I remember thinking to myself

that I could have done with extra men in the car park in case there was a

last minute surge into the car park from this large crowd of supporters.

At about 2.50 pm onwards,                       I became aware of crowd problems at the Leppings

Lane entrance to the ground as I could hear Superintendent Marshall over my

personal       radio.           He       was    asking       for    reinforcements             and    for    a    gate    to    be

opened to relieve what appeared to me over the radio to be a serious crush

on    the    outside       of     the      gates/turnstiles                at     that    end.        The    situation         was

obviously serious as I heard him call for the gates                                            to be opened on three

occasions         and he said words                   to the effect             that    there was a risk of people

being       crushed       to    death          if they were         not     opened.           There       was I noticed         an

urgency in his voice.                     At this point, as I                    was the only one with a radio, I

went    to my officers               and explained to them what was happening.                                        Due to the

still       large     crowds         I    decided       that       there         was no       way    we    could leave         our

positions          and    take       a     meal       break        at     3.00    pm     as    instructed          and    so    we

remained.           Due to the large crowds and some hot heads amongst them, I made

sure that all my officers were in twos and in sight of one another.                                                       I just

had    a    feeling       that       trouble          was     brewing       especially          with       the   problems       at

Leppings       Lane       and     due      to     the       fact    I     was    satisfied          that    many      Liverpool

supporters          had    got       into       the     Kop       where    the     Nottingham          Forest         supporters

were.

About       3.20     pm        supporters         were        shouting            to us        whether       the match         was

cancelled and asking us what was going off.                                       Also ambulances were arriving

into the car par via Penistone Road North.                                        My officers were engaged with

escorting ambulances from this point on until well after 4.00 pm in and out

of the car park.
At this time we were constantly pestered by some supporters wanting to know

what was going off, some were threatening in their manner and I detected an

attitude     of hostility       towards    the Police,      so much so that I did something

that   I    haven't     done   before   at a football match,           I started   to look   for a

suitable place where I could with my officers make                      a stand if some of the

crowd turned their hostility against us into violence.

Some   of    the   comments     from    supporters   that    I   received   amazed me,   I shall

never forget them and are as follows

1)          "Are they dead then?"

2)          "Where do we get our fucking refund from?"

3)          "No cunts dead, they're saying that to get us out".

I was of the opinion whilst things were happening that there was a problem

with radio communications as mine went quiet for a time and I was unable to

get    through     on   it.    In   the end I gave       it up    as   a bad job   and continued

doing what I have described in the previous pages.

Dear Diane

Please find enclosed a couple of letters from Professor Scraton
who is acting as advocate I think for one of the Hillsborough
victims Mr Edward Spearritt.

I have met with both of these individuals in the past to try and
address Mr Spearritt1s concerns.   I am disinclined to continue
with correspondence, I have drafted a provisional reply to the
letter and would be grateful for your comments.


Yours sincerely

Dear Professor Scraton

Thank you for your letter 18 November regarding Mr Spearritt.
I am afraid I cannot shed any further light on this issue.

As you know, I met with yourself and Mr Spearritt and following
this I did try to look into the problem fairly extensively and
no new evidence has come to light.

I am sorry I cannot be of further assistance in this matter.


Yours sincerely

              Dear Mr Wardrope

              Ref: Mr Eddie Spearritt and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s Scrutiny

              You might remember that a while ago I visited you with Mr Eddie Spearritt
              concerning his admission to the Northern General following the Hillsborough
              Disaster. Mr Spearritt was, and remains, concerned to trace what happened
              between losing consciousness on the terraces at approximately 3 p.m. and his
              arrival in the A and E department at 5 p.m. His hospital notes, a record of a
              meeting at the hospital a month after the disaster and your co-authored BMJ article
              each point to 5 p.m. as the time of arrival.

              As you will be aware, this issue was taken up with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in the
              course of his recent Scrutiny. In his Report the Judge states that he was “unable
              to ascertain at what time Mr Spearritt reached hospital, though according to Mr
              Wardrope it was before 5 p.m.” (para 32, p45).

              I would be most grateful if you could indicate the basis on which you have revised
              your estimation of Mr Spearritt’s time of arrival. And further, if you could give
              some indication as to the new estimated time. I am sure that you will understand
              that this issue continues to trouble Mr Spearritt.

              Yours sincerely

              Dear Mr Wardrope

              Ref: Hillsborough and Mr Edward Spearritt

              I wrote to you on 14 October 1998 requesting information concerning conclusions
              drawn by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, and based on his contact with you,
              concerning Mr Edward Spearritt and his estimated time of admission to the
              Northern General Hospital on 15 April 1989.

              In case the original letter went astray I enclose a copy and request that you might
              give a response to the issues raised in the near future.

              I realise that you are busy and apologise for any inconvenience caused. However
              I know that you will appreciate Mr Spearritt’s continuing anxiety on this matter.

              Yours sincerely

Dear Jim

Hillsborough Scrutiny

Sincere apologies for the delay in responding to the latest correspondence from Professor Scraton -
this case always seem to blow up when I am on annual leave!

I am not entirely sure of my facts on this but I have attempted to put a draft response for you to
send to Professor Scraton. Please feel free to amend it as appropriate. If you think I have
misunderstood the situation, please do not hesitate to contact me - 1 would be happy to discuss it
by telephone or alternatively pop over to the Northern General to see you. I am actually in the
department next Monday at 1.30 pm with Francis Morris and one or two others who are involved
in a criminal case. If you are around either just before or after our meeting, I would be more than
happy to have a chat to you then. Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Dear Professor Scraton

Ref: M r Edward Spearritt: The Hillsborough Disaster

I refer to your letter of 21 January.

Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s comments on individual cases are not included in the published
report as you will know, the relevant sections having been sent directly to those concerned.
I have not seen the full text of any of these "relevant passages" and I am not prepared to
comment upon them.

It is not for me to question Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s conclusions and whether or not they
satisfy individual’s concerns. Equally it is not for me to say whether those conclusions are
reasonable in the circumstances, whether they accurately reflect the evidence given to the
Scrutiny or whether the language used is appropriate. If as you believe, Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith has implied that other records exist, then you must surely ask the Secretary to the
Scrutiny; neither I nor the hospital hold any other records than have already been disclosed
to the Scrutiny and the fam ilies’ solicitor Ann Adlington.

As to my replies to the questions to the Scrutiny, firstly I do not have these and secondly
even if I did, I think you ought properly to apply to the Scrutiny for a transcript.

I would however just comment that on his own evidence apparently, Mr Spearritt recalls
gaining consciousness in the hospital at around 1700 hours and it would not seem
unreasonable on that evidence alone, for the Scrutiny to have concluded that Mr Spearritt
arrived at the hospital some time before 5.00 pm. Finally, I note that your concerns largely
stem from comments the Judge has made since the Scrutiny, which I find most curious and
unhelpful. In the circumstances I do not feel it appropriate to comment any further.

Yours etc.

Dear Jim

HUlsborouttlUScrutiay
Sincere apologies for the delay in responding to the latest correspondence from Professor Scraton -
this case always seem to blow up when I am on annual leave!

I am not entirely sure of my facts on this but I have attempted to put a draft response for you to
send to Professor Scraton. Please feel free to amend it as appropriate. If you think I have
misunderstood the situation, please do not hesitate to contact me -1 would be happy to discuss it
by telephone or alternatively pop over to the Northern General to see you. I am actually in (he
department next Monday at 1.30 pm with Francis Morris and one or two others who are involved
in a criminal case. If you are around either just before or after our meeting, I would be more than
happy to have a chat to you then. Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Dear Diane,

Please find enclosed some, yet further correspondence from Professors Scraton asking for yet
more information regarding Hillsborough.

I am increasingly worried regarding Professor Scraton’s correspondence.

I get the feeling that increasingly some individuals are still out to find someone to blame
regarding this issue.

As far as I am aware Mr. Spearritt has been given copies o f his medical notes made at the
time.

I have seen Mr. Spearritt and Professor Seaton to discuss these issues with them. As you will
see he is asking for a copy o f my response to the Lord Justice Stuart-Smith enquiry. I think
this is improper.

I would be grateful for your further guidance.

Yours sincerely,

                          Dear Mr Wardrope

                           Ref: Mr Edward Spearritt: The Hillsborough disaster

                          Many thanks for the telephone conversation this morning. I realise that this is a
                          particularly demanding period in accident and emergency departments and I
                          appreciate you taking some time to respond to myrequests.

                          I am writing to confirm matters wediscussed and to request further information,
                          the provision of which should not be too onerous. I accept that you could not
                          provide “quick answers" to my questions over the telephone yet I am concerned
                          that you feel that to respond would involve “a considerable amount of work".
                          What I am requesting was seemingly provided for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s
                          Scrutiny over a year ago.

                          While you stated that there is nothing to add to what has been said already there
                          are significant issues which do require clarification. They are of profound concern
                          to Mr Spearritt. On the telephone I reminded you of a conversation between you,
                          Mr Spearritt and myself in which you stated that on admission to the Northern
                          General he was deemed as not being seriously ill but stable and put to one side.
                          His records begin at 5pm yet there seems to be no record of any assessment
                          prior to that time.

                          In his Scrutiny Report LJ Stuart-Smith concluded that Mr Spearritt “according to
                          Mr Wardrope" arrived at hospital “some time before 5pm". If the judge is
                          accurate in recording his communication with you, on what do you base this
                          reassessment? Further, how long before 5pm do you think it was?

21 January 1999

Mr James Wardrope

As I said over the telephone, the judge has since stated that the “doubt" over Mr
Spearritt’s admission time arises “from the hospital records as to precisely when
Mr Spearritt arrived at hospital ... some suggested it was 5pm ... others that it
could have been earlier". You “categorically” assured me that no other records
exist than those in Mr Spearritt’s medical file and in his possession. What I am
deeply concerned about is the judge’s misapprehension that “other" records exist
and have informed his conclusions on Mr Spearritt’s submission. I would be
grateful if you could provide the text of your response to LJ Stuart-Smith.

I am sure that you are aware of the seriousness of these issues for Mr Spearritt.
Rather than clarifying matters the Scrutiny Report has compounded the confusion
over medical records, admission times and his whereabouts between 3pm and
5pm.

Many thanks for your help. I look forward to a prompt reply.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Pyne

Further to your telephone enquiry I have searched my records. The correspondence
that I can find regarding Mr Spearritt is in a letter o f 5 January 1998. This was in
answer to a letter from Mr Bone dated 19 December 1997. In this Mr Bone stated
‘"the Nursing Record (form G2546) appears to show admission to the CITU at 17.00”.
In formulating my reply I was taking that evidence contained in the letter as fact and
therefore if Mr Spearritt had reached the CITU by 17.00 by definition he must have
passed through the Accident and Emergency Department before then. I know o f no
other information where I could have extracted these times. I enclose copies o f both
documents for your assistance.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bone

Re:        Edward Spearitt

I have been passed your letter regarding Mr Spearitt.

I am afraid I can give little further definite information to
that contained in the A&E records. We know that Mr Spearitt was
in the department before 5 pm but his exact time of arrival is
unknown.

As far as I am aware all other records have been sent to you
apart from 2 pages that have been sent from Medical Records
regarding Paul David Brady and I enclose these for your
information.

If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to
ask.

Thank you for your letter of 15 December 1997 and enclosures.

A question arises in this case as to the precise time he was admitted to hospital on 15 April 1989. We
have not found it altogether easy to follow the documents, but believe the position to be that he was
admitted to Casualty at 5pm (first sheet) and transferred to the Intensive Care U nit at 5.45 (see undated
form S3G 276) with this time. The Nursing Record (form G2546) appears to show admission to the
CITU at 17.00 but the first entry on the detailed Nursing Record is timed 21.00.

I am sorry to trouble you with this matter of detail. Please confirm that you have now sent me all the
medical records in relation to those who died and were taken to the Northern General Hospital (other
than Anthony Bland). You have previously sent the records of Philip Hammond (one page) and Lee
N icol. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is anxious to see all the documentation, even if it is only one page that
refers to the patient by number.

Dear Diane

Please find enclosed a request from Ed Walker who is requesting
access and to make photocopies of all the notes from the
Hillsborough victims.

I am extremely reticent to allow this as then we would have
little control over the documentation.   I might be willing to
allow access to the records of those patients who died but
certainly would not be willing to allow photocopies to be made.

Dear Ed

Thank you for your letter 5 August regarding the Hillsborough
Disaster.

I wonder if you could be specific as to exactly which records you
wish to review.   I think it would be a very difficult task to
look at all the records of the Hillsborough victims.      I have
passed your request to the appropriate authorities for advice.

Dear Sir

I am a Consultant in Accident & Emergency Medicine at        the
Northern General Hospital NHS Trust, Sheffield, and was      the
Consultant who co-ordinated the hospital's response to       the
Hillsborough incident on 15 April 1989.

I have received correspondence from Dr Ed Walker, copy attached,
requesting access to the medical records of all patients who
attended at the hospital on the day of the tragedy and you will
see from my response that I feel unable, at the present time, to
accede to this request.   You will also note I am uneasy about
giving Dr Walker access to all patient records when he was not
involved in the care of many of these patients.

I am writing to advise you of this correspondence and also to
stress that neither myself or the Trust wishes to place any
impediment int he way of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny and
indeed on the contrary I would be more than willing to assist in
whatever way I can, having previously reviewed all these cases
in anticipation that they might be needed by Lord Justice
Taylor's inquiry and thereafter the Coroner's inquests.

I am unclear at this stage what constitutes the "fresh evidence"
referred to in Dr Walker's letter and whether individual patient
medical records will be of any significance, however it would
greatly assist both mine and the Trust's position to have some
formal indication about the requirement for access by Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith to confidential patient records.   If there
is an independent medical expert assisting the Scrutiny, I would
be happy to liaise directly with him/her.

Please let me know if I can by of any further assistance.

Dear Dr Walker

Re:      Hillsborough

Further to my letter of 12 August, I have consulted with the
Trust's solicitors who advise that I have no authority to release
confidential   medical   records  of   patients  without   proper
authority. I understand that under the Access to Health Records
Act, the personal representatives of deceased patients can apply
for access where they are contemplating legal action arising out
of the death, and clearly those patients who survived would need
to give their written consent to release records for specified
purposes.   I certainly would find it difficult justifying your
having access to all patient records rather than just those cases
where you were directly involved with the care and I wonder what
basis for your authority is for making such a request.

You may be aware that all the medical evidence was offered to
Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry and I myself attended all the
Coroner's inquests.  Having reviewed all the cases previously,
I would be happy to assist Lord Justice Stuart-Smith1s scrutiny
should he so desire and I have written to the Secretary today
copying him in on our correspondence.

Dear Jim

Hillsborough

Thank you for your letters of 7 and 12 August concerning Dr Ed Walker’s request for access to
copies o f the medical records of the Hillsborough victims. Like you I am somewhat uneasy about
this request and do not like the tone o f his letter at all.

I have drafted a response for you to send to Dr Walker and also a letter for you to send to the
Secretary to the Scrutiny, Mr C F Bone. I am afraid I have drafted the letter to Mr Bone on the
basis that you have not heard from him at all, however I realise you may well have had some
official contact from him already and therefore you may well need to change the letter quite
substantially. Broadly the gist o f what I am trying to get across is that we are not happy giving
records direct to Dr Walker but do not want this to be seen as obstructing the Scrutiny and indeed
both you and the Trust are happy to co-operate in whatever way you possibly can. Please feel free
to amend the letter using your own form o f words.

If the response back from the Secretary to the Scrutiny causes you any difficulty, please let me
know. Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

evidence surrounding tke Hillskorougk footkall stadium disaster of tke 15tk of April 1989. I skould
tkerefore-like to arrangean appointment in order to view, and make salient, copies of, tke medical records
of all patients wko arrived at tke Nortkem General Hospital from tkis site on tkat day. It would ke
kelpful if tke records could ke arranged into tkose tkat died wkilst in tke kospital, and tkose tkat were
disckarged alive, kut if tkis is not possible it would ke easy to organise tkis myself.

if I am called upon, it would certainly ke useful to kave seen tke notes of tkose patients tkat I tended.
Okvoously I skould not like to kave to tell Lord Justice Stuart-Smitk tkat I kad keen refused access any
medical record.

Please let me know if it will ke necessary to oktain next-of-kin permission, and I skall do so. I skall
telepkone you in tke next few days to arrange tke details.

         Coroner's inquests.  Having reviewed all the cases previously,
         I would be happy to assist Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny
         should he so desire and I have written to the Secretary today
         copying him in on our correspondence.

    Thank you for your letter o f 2 September enclosing one you have had from Dr Ed Walker.


    It might be helpful if I explain the background to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny o f
    evidence relating to the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster. The Judge has been
    appointed to carry out this task by the Home Secretary. His objective is to establish whether
    there is any significant new evidence about the disaster which was not previously available to
    Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary authorities.
     If there is significant evidence, he will aim to see whether it would have affected the
    outcome o f any o f the proceedings.


    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith hopes to report his findings to the Home Secretary by the turn o f
    the year. You may be interested to see his terms o f reference, and I attach these.


    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will be seeing Dr Walker with regard to his factual evidence of
    what he did and observed on 15 April 1989. For this purpose it should not be necessary for
    Dr Walker to see the hospital records o f the patients whom he attended at the Northern
    General Hospital on that day.


    Lord Justice Stuart-Smith would however be grateful if you could make available to him (that
    is to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, not Dr Walker) the records o f those patients whom Dr Walker
    examined. We know that Dr Walker examined Lee NICOL and Philip HAMMOND, both o f
    whom died, and it seems that he also examined others. We do not know the names o f these
    other patients, but it would be helpful if you could if at all possible identify them and make
    their records available to the Judge also.

    G:\HILLSBOR\MAIN\WARDROPE. 086
You ask whether the scrutiny has appointed an independent medical expert. We have not
done that as yet, but we will o f course do so if necessary.


Your letter did not include a copy o f your reply to Dr Walker as you had I think intended, and
we would be interested to see that also. I am happy to discuss matters further by telephone
if you wish.

Dear Mr Bone

I can confirm that Dr Ed Walker visited the hospital today to
review notes of patients who died in the Northern General
Hospital following the Hillsborough disaster.

I was somewhat surprised when Dr Walker arrived in the company
of the solicitor representing the families.

Dr Walker reviewed those notes of those patients who had died and
he was unable to identify any notes of patients where he had been
personally involved.


Yours sincerely

Dear Diane

Please find   enclosed   a   further   letter   to   the   Hillsborough
Scrutiny.

I was somewhat dismayed when Ed Walker arrived in the presence
of Miss Adlington, the solicitor representing the families.   I
am afraid I had to refuse Miss Adlington access to the notes.
She said that she did have some authority for these notes. I
advised that she should proceed with these requests through the
proper channels.

Yours sincerely

    Further to my letter 12 September, please find enclosed the notes
    on the patients as you have requested, the patients being Lee

    As you can see, there are no clinical notes on Phillip Hammond

Room 1160,

LONDON,

Dear M r . Bone,

Thank you for your letter of the 10th September, 1997.

I enclose a copy of my reply to Dr. Walker. I have also been in
touch with him by telephone and have advised him that I do not
think it would be appropriate for him to have photocopies of all
the records but I would like to assist in certainly identifying
those patients whom we may have treated.    Dr. Walker is coming
to look at some records with me later in September.

I do admit I am somewhat mystified regarding any "new evidence".
We have established the fact that at least two of the victims
were "alive" in terms of having output from the heart for
sometime after the disaster both these patients were treated in
intensive care.   One died shortly after and one was declared
"brain dead" some three days later.

However if one defines life as having a functioning brain, it is
quite clear that none of the victims treated through the Northern
General Hospital who subsequently died showed any signs of any
brain function. These facts have been known to everyone involved
in the initial investigation and indeed the public domain, having
been published by myself and others in the British Medical
Journal.

My understanding was that the Coroner found that all the patients
who had died had received their fatal injuries before 3.15. From
my own understanding of the situation, this was an entirely
reasonable conclusion.     The fatal injury was one of crush
asphyxia.   I do not believe the Coroner determined that all
deaths occurred before 3.15.
M r . C . F . Bone        -   2 -             1 2 th Septem ber, 1997


The victims were unable to go oxygen into the lung. This meant
a gradual drop in the level of oxygen in the blood. This would
have starved all tissues of oxygen.     The brain is especially
sensitive to lack of oxygen where the heart muscles can be
relatively resistant and also it is more likely that heart
muscles can recover from a period of lack of oxygen and the brain
cannot.

This concept is exemplified by the two cases mentioned above and
also to some extent by the tragic case of Tony Bland. He reached
hospital in a deeply unconcious state but his heart was still
beating.

I would like to reiterate my previous letter that I would be
willing to help the Scrutiny in any way possible. You probably
access to the statement that I made at the time that I could
provide a further copy if you wish.

I have asked that copies of the notes that you have requested be
sent to you. I am due to meet with Ed Walker later in September
in trying to identify the notes of any other patients that he
might have treated.

I would be happy to provide the Scrutiny with details of the
resuscitation efforts at the hospital, both in general terms or
specific to any individual patient, or indeed to assist in any
other way.

Yours sincerely,

Dear Jim,

Just a skort note to thank you for your time today.
I skould also like to apologise for arriving witk tke family group solicitor witkout your prior knowledge.
I realise tkat your agreement to see me was as a fellow professional, and I did not mean to akuse tkat
relationskip.
To ke frank, I did not know quite wkat form our meeting would take, and kalf expected tkere to ke a
representative present from tke trust's legal or administrative department. It is for tkis reason I asked Ms.
Adlington to attend. Once ske knew ske was coming, ske sougkt consent to release to a third party of
medical notes from tke families concerned, koping tkat ske migkt ke akle to 'kill two kirds witk one
stone.' Whatever, we should have let you know tkat ske was going to ke present, and I apologise for not
doing tkis.
It is unfortunately an unpleasant time for everyone concerned just at tke moment.



Yours sincerely,

Dear Kevin

Access to Medical Records - Hillsborough Victims

Further to our telephone conversation earlier today, I am just writing to enclose a copy o f the letter
I have sent to Ann Adlington.

As discussed, strictly speaking I do not think there is any easy authority for the families to request
access to these notes. They are records o f deceased patients and under the Access to Health
Records Act there is only limited access by the Personal Representatives of the deceased who are
contemplating a claim arising out of the death. As I pointed out to you when we spoke, in fact the
records pre-date the Access to Health Records Act which means we are not bound by it and
certainly are not bound by its charging structures.

The most common other form of seeking access to records is the traditional "pre-action discovery"
route under the High Court or County Court procedures where either a claim is contemplated
against the hospital or a third party. There the applicant is obliged to let us know either by
Affidavit or by letter, the grounds of their application and we have to be satisfied that there is a
prima facie case.

As discussed, I do think it is important that we have a record of the grounds upon which the HSFG
are seeking access to all these records. Whilst it is unlikely there will be any allegation of breach
of confidentiality, nonetheless I think we should at least have this information for the record. I
anticipate that ultimately we will be forced to release the records in any event and I do not want
to appear over obstructive to the solicitors, however I do feel we ought to put them to the trouble
o f explaining what authority they have for seeking access to the records.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Dear Madam

Medical Records of Hillsborough Victims

We refer to your letter o f 26 September 1997 addressed to Mr J Wardrope, Consultant in Accident
& Emergency, which has been forwarded to us as the Trust’s solicitors.

We should be grateful if you could let us know the authority upon which the applications for copy
records of the deceased victims are requested and we can then advise our clients as appropriate.

Yours faithfully

      Dear Madam

      Hospital Records o f Hlltetorough V f o t o

      Further to our letter of 7 November* we have now received instructions from our clients.

      Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has not, as far awwe or our clients are aware, formally requested records
      direct from the hospital, however as he is heading a Judicial Inquiry, then presumably he would
      have authority to request documents and the attendance of witnesses. Indeed our clients through
      their Consultant, Mr J Wardrope, Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine, who gave
      evidence to Lord Justice Taylor’s Inquiry, has already offered assistance to the Inquiry. Mr
      Wardrope has also copied to the Inquiry his correspondence with Dr Ed Walker, to ensure the
      Inquiry is aware of the hospital's desire to assist the Inquiry objectively and practically. We note
      that you do not have any authority yourselves for the release of the records. We do not understand
      your reference to the Home Office when, as we say, our clients have indicated on more than one
      occasion to Lord Justice Stuarl-Smith’s Inquiry their willingness to co-operate and provide
      documents to the inquiry. Surely if the Inquiry requires records they w ill write either to the Chief
      Executive or Mr Wardrope direct.

      Yours faithfully

     Dear Kevin



     Further to our recent correspondence regarding release of medical records to Ann Adlington,
     solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group, I enclose a copy of Miss Adlington’s latest
     letter to me, which I have sent a holding reply to and I am also copying to you my proposed draft
     reply for commentMmendment,

    Miss Adlington’s letter to me was prompted by a request I made to her to let me have her
     "authority" for release of the records. Her response to this was to remind me that she had sent to
    me signed authorities from the parent of the deceased. I advised her that this was not the
     "authority" I was referring to and reminded her that she should let us know what legal authority
    she had for the request of the records and hence her reply. Clearly not having any legal authority
    for release of the records, she is resorting to the threat of referring our "refusal" to the Home
    Office. This is nonsense as clearly if Lord Justice Stuart-Smith requires all these medical records
    for his Inquiry, then I know the hospital would be willing to supply them to the Inquiry and that
    is the gist of the reply I have drafted to Ann AdJington.

    I would just sound a note of caution here Firstly, it is very difficult to argue confidentiality when
    one is talking about deceased patients ami therefore it is difficult for us to use the potential breach
    of confidentiality as an argument for net releasing the records to the deceased’s families. I am also
    conscious of the unwelcome media attention the Trust's perceived refusal might attract. However
    on the other hand, I think we have made it plain both in this latest correspondence and previously
    in correspondence with Ed Walker (copied to the Inquiry) that the Trust is more than willing to
    provide whatever information and assistance it can, to the Inquiry direct. I am not sure whether
    Ann Adlington can really argue with that point, however I feel that you should be aware of the
    potential bad publicity the Trust might attract if Ann Adlington misrepresents the position to the
    media.

    Please would, you let me have any comments on the draft reply. I am certainly not aware of our
    releasing to the Inquiry any records but if we have, then perhaps you would let me know under
    what circumstances, whether this is rectmt etc.

    I look forward to hearing from you. Kurnl regards.

    Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Bone

NQrteem General Haaftital
Medical Records of Hillsborough Victims

I understand you have had some correspondence with Mr J Wardrope, Consultant in Accident &
Emergency Medicine, concerning The Scrutiny’s access to relevant medical records and I
understand Mr Wardrope has already supplied to The Scrutiny, copies of two victims’ records.

We have recently received correspondence from Ms Ann Adlington, Solicitor to the Hillsborough
Family Support Group, requesting copies of several other sets of records (see schedule attached).
Ms Adlington has confirmed that she hits no legal authority to request release of these records on
behalf of The Scrutiny. In the circumstances I felt it appropriate to alert you to this latest
development and enclose a copy of my letter to Ms Adlington, which I believe is self-explanatory.

As previously indicated by Mr Wardrope, the hospital is more than happy to assist The Scrutiny
in whatever way it can, either by supplying documents to The Scrutiny or by Mr Wardrope’s
personal attendance, as deemed necessajy. I am happy for you to write direct to Mr Wardrope or,
if you prefer, to myself, should you require any further information.

Yours sincerely

Dear Madam

Hospital Records of Hillsborough Victims

Further to our letter of 7 November, wt; have now discussed this matter in detail with our clients.

We understand that Mr J Wardrope, Consultant in Accident in Emergency Medicine, has already
provided two sets of records to the Inquiry at their specific request and Mr Wardrope has
subsequently offered to provide any further documentation or information to the Inquiry as may be
necessary. As Lord Justice Stuart-Siriith is heading a Judicial Inquiry, then presumably he has
authority to request documents and the Attendance of witnesses. We would comment that some of
the notes contain only post mortem information which would be the property of H M Coroner.

We note that you do not have any authority yourselves for the release of records. Mr Wardrope
has copied to the Inquiry his correspondence with Dr Ed Walker, to ensure the Inquiry is aware
of the hospital’s desire to assist the Inquiry objectively and practically. We do not understand your
reference to the Home Office when, as we say, our clients have indicated on more than more
occasion to the Inquiry their willingness to co-operate and provide documents to assist the Inquiry.
In the circumstances it would seem appropriate that the Inquiry should notify either the Chief
Executive or Mr Wardrope direct of their requirements.

We are copying this letter to the Inquiiy for information.

Yours faithfully

  Dear Mr Bone

 Hillsborough Scrutiny

 Thank you very much for your letter of 24 November very helpfully setting out the background to
 Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny of evidence. Whilst personal representatives of the deceased
 do not have an automatic right to access patient records, nonetheless we are sure our clients w ill
 be comforted by your letter and we have requested them to release the records in accordance with
 your letter.

 Tf in the meantime either the hospital or Mr Wardrope can be of any further assistance to the
 Scrutiny, please do not hesitate to contact them. I am sure Mr Wardrope would be more than
 happy to confirm exactly what evidence was presented on behalf of the hospital to Lord Justice
 Taylor's Inquiry. Certainly as far as I am aware, none of the documents to be disclosed to the
 family are "new evidence",

 Many thanks for your assistance.

 Yours sincerely______________ ^

     Thank you for your letter o f ] 0 November about the release of medical records to the
     Hillsborough Family Support Group.

     It might help if 1explain that the Home Secretary has asked Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to
     carry out a scrutiny o f evidence about the disaster at Hill sborough Football Stadium in order
     to establish whether there is any significant new evidence which was not previously available
     to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary
     authorities. I f there is significant evidence, the Judge w ill see if it would have affected the
     outcome of any o f the proceedings. I attach his terms of reference.

     I have discussed your letter with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. He has no power to compel the
     release of records from the Northern General Hospital for the purposes of his scrutiny. But
     we asked Mr Wardrope for ihe medical records relating to Philip Hammond and Lee Nicol,
     two victims o f the disaster who were treated at the Northern General Hospital, and he kindly
     had copies sent to us.

     Lord Justice Stuart-Smith takes the vitiw that the hospital should release medical records
     relating m people who died in the disaster where these are requested by a person who has a
     properly signed authorisation from somebody who is entitled to act as the personal

           be comforted by your letter and we have requested them to retdiase the records in accordance with
           your letter.

          If in the meantime cither the hospital or Mr Wardrope can t>e of any further assistance to the
          Scrutiny, please do not hesitate to contact them. I am sure Mr Wardrope would he more than
          happy to confirm exactly what evidence was presented on be.f,fjalf o f the hospital to Und Justice
          Taylor’s Inquiry, Certainly tis far as I am aware, none of the documents to be disclosed to the
          family are "new evidence",

          Maay thanks, for your assistance.

      Thank you lor your Utter of 19 .November about the release o~ medical records to the
      .Hillsborough Family Support Group.

     It might help if J explain that the Home Secretary has asked _L b ifd Justice Stuart-Smith to
     carry out a scrutiny o f evidence ahoul the disaster at Hillsboro ugh Football Sradiwm in order
     to establish whether there is uny s ig n if ie s n^w evidence whic H was not previously available
     to Lord I ayior’s Inquiry, u> the Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary
     authorities. If there is significant evidence, the Judge will sefc* if it would have affected the
     outcome o f m y o f the proceedings. I attach his terms o f reference.

     I have discussed your letter with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.     Ie has no power to compel the
     release o f records from the Northern General Hospital for the urposes otVhis scrutiny. Bui.
     we asked Mr W? • ope for the medical records relating to Phi ip Hammond and Lee Nlcoj,
     two victims o f v,     .aster who were treated at the Northern Gs ncraJ Hospital, and he kindly
     hs<f copies sent i

     Lora Justice Stuari-Sqiith. takes the vkiw that the hospital shun! d release medical records
     relating to people who died in the d ie t e r where these are reqt ested by a person who has a
     properly signed milhamation from somebody who is entitled tP act m the personal
     represenuuiv« ol the docoased. The documents should then tn copied at the expense o f the
     person requesting thorn.

Dear

Please find enclosed a letter from the Hillsborough Scrutiny.
I would be grateful if the appropriate photocopies could be sent
to Mr Bone, Secretary to the Scrutiny.

He is requesting the notes of Eddie Spearitt and also requesting
the notes of all those who died in the incident and were seen at
the Northern General.

Yours sincerely

I am afraid I must trouble you for copies o f some more medical records in respect o f the
Hillsborough football disaster. You have already, o f course, very kindly supplied us with
copies o f the records o f Phillip HAMMOND and Lee NICOL.

First, we understand that the Northern General treated Mr Eddie SPEARITT, who survived
the disaster. He has told us that he regained consciousness in the hospital at around 1700
hours on the day. Could we see a copy o f his records, please? (in strict confidence, o f
course).

Second, would it be possible for you to let us have copies o f the records o f all those patients
(except for Phillip Hammond and Lee Nicol) who were taken to the Northern General but
died?

As you know (and as we have recently explained to your hospital’s solicitors following an
approach from the Family Support Group) Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has no power to compel
the release o f hospital records for the purpose o f his scrutiny. He would nevertheless find
this material very helpful at this stage. He very much appreciates your assistance.

An early reply would be appreciated if at all possible. As you may have heard, Lord Justice
Stuart-Smith has recently written to the Family Support Group and others involved to say that
he intends to let the Home Secretary have his report by the end o f the year.

Dear Madam

Hospital Records o f Hillsborough Victims at NGH

We refer to your letter of 10 February which arrived whilst the writer was on annual leave. Your
letter causes us some consternation.

We would refer you to our letter of 19 November which plainly states that some o f the hospital
notes only contain post-mortem information (copy letter attached for ease of reference).
Additionally we are advised that Dr Ed Walker reviewed the notes when he visited the hospital with
yourself, on 24 September (see copy letter attached of Mr Wardrope to Mr Bone).

We have to say that if the expectations of relatives have been raised in any way, then we can only
assume that has come from their advisors including yourself and Dr Ed Walker. We have
previously advised Mr Bone that none of the information we hold and have disclosed to you or the
Scrutiny is "new evidence".

In the horrendous circumstances under which most of these tragic cases were "admitted" to hospital
we wonder what sort o f records you anticipated. If Dr Walker was directly involved with events
on the day then no doubt he can give you a first hand account and explanation as to why so little
was recorded. Presumably one of the reasons Mr Wardrope was asked to give oral evidence to
Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry, was to explain the particulars of what happened in more detail than
could possibly have been recorded in the extreme pressure of the situation.
We look forward to payment of our client’s costs as soon as possible.

Yours faithfully

          Dear Madam

          Hospital Records o f Hillsborough Victims at NGH

         I refer you to my letter o f 21 January 1998 in which I gave my undertaking to meet the
         charges involved in photocopying the medical records o f the victims o f the Hillsborough
         disaster who died at the Northern General Hospital. I was, therefore, somewhat surprised by
         documentation you forwarded to this office in response. In most cases this amounts to no
         more than a poor copy o f a post-mortem report. Incidentally, can you explain how these came
         to be in your possession?

         I have informed the families whose children and loved ones died at the Northern General
         Hospital o f the contents o f your letter and this has caused both anger and distress. In the
         meantime, I am considering my position regarding the undertaking I gave you, reliant on your
         description o f the documentation as ‘medical records’. It is regrettable that I was not
         informed o f the nature o f the documentation you held when I first approached the Northern
         General Hospital last September. Much valuable time has been lost and the expectations o f
         bereaved relatives raised.

Dear Madam

Hospital Records of Hillsborough Victims

Further to our letter o f 7 November, we have now discussed this matter in detail with our clients.

We understand that Mr J Wardrope, Consultant in Accident in Emergency Medicine, has already
provided two sets o f records to the Inquiry at their specific request and Mr Wardrope has
subsequently offered to provide any further documentation or information to the Inquiry as may be
necessary. As Lord Justice Stuart-Smith is heading a Judicial Inquiry, then presumably he has
authority to request documents and the attendance o f witnesses. We would comment that some o f
the notes contain only post mortem information which would be the property o f H M Coroner.

We note that you do not have any authority yourselves for the release o f records. Mr Wardrope
has copied to the Inquiry his correspondence with Dr Ed Walker, to ensure the Inquiry is aware
o f the hospital’s desire to assist the Inquiry objectively and practically. We do not understand your
reference to the Home Office when, as we say, our clients have indicated on more than more
occasion to the Inquiry their willingness to co-operate and provide documents to assist the Inquiry.
In the circumstances it would seem appropriate that the Inquiry should notify either the Chief
Executive or Mr Wardrope direct o f their requirements.

We are copying this letter to the Inquiry for information.

Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Bone

I can confirm that Dr Ed Walker visited the hospital today to
review notes of patients who died in the Northern General
Hospital following the Hillsborough disaster.

I was somewhat surprised when Dr Walker arrived in the company
of the solicitor representing the family.

Dr Walker reviewed those notes of those patients who had died and
he was unable to identify any notes of patients where he had been
personally involved.

Dear Kevin

Hillsboroueh Scrutiny

Thank you for your letter o f 23 February. I have not received a copy of Lord Justice Stuart
Smith’s report although I have asked our library to obtain a copy for me as soon as it is published.

In the interim I enclose a copy of some information which Dr Robert Forrest, Assistant Deputy
Coroner and Toxicologist who was involved with the Hillsborough samples, has obtained for me
from the Internet. I thought you might be interested to see the information and that there now
appears to be a "fighting fund" o f approximately £1 million to support the families launching
private prosecutions against the policeforces involved and "others whose actions on the day and in
the period afterwards should be called into question". You will also see from the papers an
allegation that there was a delay in activation of the major incident plan and an inference that the
experts who gave evidence at the Coroner’s inquest inaccurately portrayed the likely mode of death.
There is reference to the medical experts all being pathologists but I had understood that Jim
Wardrope also gave evidence at the Coroner’s inquests, although I may be wrong. Perhaps you
would like to copy all this to Jim for information.

Finally, you might be interested to know that according to Dr Forrest, Limeland which appears as
part of the Internet address, is Ed Walker’s home address.

                                                               The F ight Goes On....
     On Wednesday February 18th, the Home Secretary announced that as a result o f the Scrutiny of
       TSfew Evidence1conducted last year, NO new inquiry would be forthcoming, and the original
     inquest verdict o f ACCIDENTAL DEATH would stand. (Click HERE to see the Home Office
                                                press release.)
         The families are obviously bitterly disappointed, but some o f them are not too surprised.
   The Chief Constable o f South Yorkshire police, Richard Wells, gave his strongest condemnation o f
      his own force yet on BBC regional news that evening, and named David Duckenfield as being
    partly responsible for the disaster. NO police officer has ever been disciplined for the disaster, no-
                        one has even lost their job. No-one has even lost a day's pay.
      It seems likely that the families will now follow the only route left to them and launch private
      prosecutions against certain members ( both retired and serving) o f South Yorkshire and West
     Midlands police forces, along with others whose actions on the day and in the period afterwards
                                        should be called into question.
                                                               T he Figh t Goes O n...              ____

      On Saturday the 15th of April 1989, Liverpool football club were due to play Nottingham
       Forest at a ’neutral' ground in the F.A. Cup semi-final. The ground chosen was that of
                          Sheffield Wednesday, at Hillsborough in Sheffield,

     No-one has ever suggested that those deaths were caused deliberately. W hat is suggested is
     that there has been a monumentally arrogant cover-up of inadequacies and incompetence.
      Indeed, 'cover up' suggests something passive and quiet. What happened instead was the
       active propagation of mistruths. What is suggested is that no-one, let alone the 96, need
                                                                have died on that day.

          Medical Journal about tie blood alcohol testin


    This is Philip Hammond, who was fourteen when he died. Philip was one o f the first victims to
 reach hospital. His father, Philip senior, is secretary o f the HFSG. It was not until November 1989,
  more than six months after his death, that Philip's parents ever even knew he had got as far as the
   hospital. Philip, along with every other victim, was taken back to the temporary mortuary at the
   ground, and had a post-mortem blood alcohol level taken. Someone was very keen indeed to try
  and establish that victims had been drunk. Other victims are remembered at the Anfield Memorial,
   Click the image below (kindly provided by Paul Lewis at Wvcombe W anderers) to view the




                           memorial in detail.

 At the inquest, the coroner heard evidence! from certain medical experts (ail pathologists) that
 death would have been instantaneous, and tliat all victims were effectively dead by 3.15 p.m.

 The assumption o f instantaneous, pain-free death has since been challenged, as has the coroner's
 decision not to hear evidence o f anything that happened after 3.15. This included a delay in
 activation o f the major incident plan, and the refusal to allow ambulances on to the pitch.

 At the time, this was what the families wanted to hear - that their loved ones had not suffered. It
 now seems that there may have been ulterior motives for this, including the avoidance of
 compensation payments.
  The verdict reached at the inquest was one o f accidental death, which meant that no-one could be
  brought to account for their actions on that day.       amilies are pressing for a judicial review o f
                                          the inquest verdict.

H ILL SBO R O U G H SCRUTINY

I am writing to ask your consent to the release of material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in
his scrutiny of evidence about the Hillsborough Disaster.

When the Home Secretary anounced the outcome of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny of
evidence, he undertook to release as much of the material considered in the course of the scrutiny as
possible by placing copies in the House of Commons Library.

I would be grateful if you would let me know whether you are content for your letter of 12
September 1997 to Mr Bone, Secretary to the scrutiny, to be released. If there are any objections, it
would be helpful if you could let me know what they are so that we may advise the Home Secretary
accordingly.

                                            Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Pyne

Thank you for your letter 27 February regarding the Hillsborough
Disaster. I confirm I have not objections to this document being
placed in the House of Commons Library.

In reviewing the letter, there is a small typographical error on
top of page 2, it should read "victims were unable to get oxygen
into the lungs". The second is in the third paragraph, page 2,
the second sentence should read "you probably have access to the
statement I made at the time but I could provide a further copy
if you wish."

Yours sincerely

Dear Kevin

Hillborough Scrutiny

Further to our recent correspondence, I have now obtained a copy o f Lord Justice Taylor’s Scrutiny
of Evidence relating to the Hillsborough Disaster. It is rather a large document (220 pages in total)
and I am therefore enclosing the first page of chapter 5 setting out the other matters o f concern to
the victims’ families and also the whole o f chapter 7 which is the summary o f Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith’s findings.

There are a number of appendices to the report, including the handwritten statement o f Ed Walker
to the West Midlands Police dated 20 July 1989 and also a transcript o f his interview with Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith in the presence of Ann Adlington, solicitor for HFSG, which makes interesting
reading - it seems to me that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith had little time for Ed Walker’s opinions and
views.

If you would like to borrow the document at any stage, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I am copying this letter and enclosures to Jim for information. There appears to be no reference
in the report to the need to obtain medical records.
Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

 CHAPTER 5




Other matters o f concern to the victims' families


1. As an important part of my scrutiny 1 visited Liverpool in early October to meet the
families of victims of the disaster and listen to the matters which concerned them. 1 held
an open session to which 1 invited all the families of those who died, and I was pleased
that many were able to attend. 1 then held sixteen private meetings with families who
had asked for them. I had two other meetings with family members later, at the scrutiny
office in London.


2. Many of the relatives of victims whom I saw during these meetings raised questions to
do with the video and medical evidence about the disaster, which I have discussed in
Chapters 2 and 3 of this report. But. both in my discussions with them and in writing,
victims’ families have made other allegations as well. To summarise them briefly, they are
     _ there were inconsistencies between the way in which the police summarised the
       facts about each individual death at the ‘mini-inquests" and evidence about what
       actually happened to that person;
     _ the Coroner was biased;
     _ Liverpool supporters were treated unfavourably and in a hostile manner when
       they gave evidence at the inquest;
     _ South Yorkshire Police have failed to give families documents to which they are
       entitled:
     _ victims were confirmed as being dead on the basis of cursory examination;
     _ the West Midlands Police investigation team was biased in favour of South
       Yorkshire Police;
     _ South Yorkshire Police have never apologised for the disaster.


3.   I consider these points in this Chapter.


Inconsistencies in the evidence about individual deaths


4. O n e o f the m o st c o m m o n c o m p la in ts w h ic h fa m ilie s had was that t h e y had n ot been
able to fin d o u t precisely when and w h e re t h e ir re la tion s died, in some eases because the
evidence was v e rv sparse and in others because it was said that the e vide n ce was
c o n flic tin g , o r d id not su pp o rt the s u m m a ry given about t h e ir re la tive at the m i n i ­
inquest. 1 1‘u llv u n d e rstan d the fam ilie s' a n x ie ty to k n o w all the facts as fa r as possible.

Summary


1.     In this chapter 1 summarise the lindings which 1 have made.


2 Before doina so 1 must make it clear that anyone who is familiar with the terrible
events of 1^ April 1989 at Hillsborough is bound to have great s\ mpath\ with the
relatives of those who died and the spectators who were injured. I have now spent many
weeks studving the evidence of what happened and considering
submissions made bv the families and their legal representatives. I tind it dilficult to
imagine anything more horrific than that experienced by those who enduied it and
those who lost their children, relatives and friends.


3 That 96 people, the majoritv of them young, should set out in high hopes and spirits
on a fine S p r i n t , and yet whhin a space of less than half-an-hour suffer crushing
injuries from which they died, is nothing less than appalling. 1 have the most profound
sympathy with all the families and friends of those who suffered in this way, many of
whom 1 liave met. 1 also understand the dismay that they have that no individual has
personally been held to account, either in a criminal court, disciplinary pioceedings,
even to the extent of losing his or her job.


 4. I realise that my report and advice will come as a disappointment to them especially
 since thev had had their hopes raised that something m ore could be done B ut 1 cannot
 allow compassion to cloud my .judgement. I have had to look f ' sPa^ ° " a ' e‘y “ d had
 objectively at what is said to be fresh evidence, in the light o f the idence which had
 previously been considered.


 5 Havino done so, for the reasons I have set out. I have come to the clear concluston
 that there is no basis upon which there should be a further Judical " 4 ™ ?         ...
 reopening of Lord Taylor's Inquiry. There is no basis for a renewed                 the
 Divisional Court or for the Attorney General to exercise his powe.s.unde, ‘^ C o ro n e rs
 Act 1988 I do not consider that there is any material which should be. put befoix the
 Director of Public Prosecutions or the Police Complaints                          “ u£
 them to reconsider the decisions they have alieady taken. or o          .
     any justification for setting up any further inquiiv into t l e pci < i n n jn c e ' p    w hjch
     emergency and hospital services. I have carcfully considered
     alterations were made 10 some of the self-written statements ol South Y oilk nc P ohec
     officers, but I do not consider that there is any occasion lor any lui thci n m s li^ itic .


     6. N o n e of the evidence 1 was asked to co nsid e r added a n y th in g significant lo the
     evidence w hich was a va ila b le to L o r d l a y l o i s ln c |iiiiy 01 to I le nques s.
Video evidence

7 Chapter 2 of this report deals with video evidence of the disaster. My conclusions
about t h a m e that there is no new video evidence o f it or video evidence which was not
available to Lord Taylor, the Coroner, or the other authorities who examined the
disaster at the time.

R Two video tapes which were stolen on the day of the disaster remain missing. They
were tapes of pictures from CCTV cameras operated by Sheffield'W ednesday Football
Club They were not police tapes and would not have shown anything significant. Th
theft is unsolved. The suggestion that the police tried to blame their failure to spot
overcrowding on the terraces onto faulty CCTV equipm ent is wrong. T heydid not
blame the CCTV equipment. The police controllers had a good view over the terraces
from their control box and did not pretend otherwise.


9 The allegation that police hid videotape evidence of the terraces is unfounded and
the allegation that the Coroner failed properly to pursue the question of this mlssmg
police footage is equally unfounded. Police officers did not give false evidence about the
state of the police CCTV system at the ground, and I do not accept the evidence of
R oger Houldsworth, video technician at Sheffield W ednesday Football Club, tha e
realised from looking at police CCTV pictures of pens 3 and 4 at about the time G ate C
was opened at 14.52 that these pens were dangerously overcrowded.


 T h e a fterm a th o f the d isaster


 10 I deal in Chapter 3 of the report with suggestions that the inquest into the deaths of
 those who died in the disaster was seriously flawed, and that there should now be a
 public inquiry into what was done, or not done, to help them and others who were
 crushed.


 11. I do not consider that the Inquest was flawed. M ost o f the criticisms relate to the
 cn railed “3 15 cut-off point”. I do not agree with these criticisms. The Coroner
 " e r e i f t e questions o f who the deceased were and when and where they died a u h e
 mini-inquests, and this involved consideration of matters long after 3.15. Itw a s on lym
 relation to the question of how, i.e. by what means, the deceased came to their deaths
 that the Coroner imposed a cut-off point of 3.15 pm. H e had good reasons for deciding
 to limit the inquiry in this way and the cut-off did not limit inquiry into that question.


 12. Questions of whether the response of the emergency services was adequate were
 not relevant to the task the Coroner had to perform. It was suggested to me that the tact
 that Dr Walker, Mr Houldsworth, and others were not called as witnesses at the inquest
 amounted to fraudulent concealm ent of their evidence. That suggestion is false and
 regard it as wholly irresponsible.



                                             104
13. Lord Taylor inquired into the rescue operation and his findings are published in his
report H e made criticisms of the slow response of the police and recommendations for
the future. I cannot see that any useful purpose would be served by having any further
inquiry into the rescue operation. In my opinion there is no evidence of want of care by
the emergency or medical services. A ny wide-ranging inquiry into this aspect of the
disaster would place huge burdens upon them, but to no purpose.


Interference with witnesses

14 Chapter 4 o f this report deals with suggestions that the evidence o f witnesses to the
disaster was tam pered with, so that the truth did not emerge either at Lord Taylor s
Inquiry or the Inquests. These allegations are of two types - that the W est Midlands
Police put pressure on D erek Bruder, Debra Martin, and Paul Taylor which affected the
evidence they wished to give, and that the way in which the South Yorkshire Police went
about collecting evidence from their own officers who were at Hillsborough and
witnessed the disaster was unacceptable. I have interviewed Mr Bruder, Miss Martin,
and Mr Taylor and have come to the conclusion in each case that there was no improper
attempt to affect their evidence.


M r Bruder


15 So far as Mr Bruder is concerned, I am quite satisfied that the W est Midlands
Police, in seeking to confirm details o f his statem ent relating to Kevin Williams, did not
subject him to improper pressure. H e told me him self that they did not. His statemen s
were accurately summarised at the inquest on Kevin Williams and there was no attemp
to discredit him.


Miss Martin


 16. I did not find Miss Martin a reliable witness. Her statement about events at
 Hillsborough, where she was on duty as a Special Constable, was seriously at variance
 with the account o f everybody else who was there. She remains plainly - and
 understandably - deeply upset by the disaster, and her memories of the day and of
 subsequent events relating to it are vague and confused. I think that she gave: her
 account of Kevin Williams sitting up in her arms and saying “M om in good faith. But it
 cannot be relied upon. It contradicts Mr Bruder’s evidence and is also contrary to the
 pathological findings.


 17. I interviewed the W est Midlands police officer who Miss Martin claims bullied her.
 I found this officer to be an impressive witness. I cannot see that she had any reason to
 discredit Miss Martin, and she told me that she did not bully or browbeat her. I accept
 her account and prefer it to Miss Martin’s.




                                             105
Mr Taylor


18. A s far as Paul Taylor is concerned, I do not accept his evidence that he was bullied
or intimidated by a W est Midlands officer. His account of what he saw at Hillsborough
has changed in various ways over the years, and he does not appear to have raised any
complaint about the conduct of this officer until 1997.1 prefer the evidence o f the
officer, which is supported to som e extent by the contemporary documents. In any event
he had no reason to put pressure on Mr Taylor.


South Yorkshire Police statements


19. I have looked with great care at the way in which the South Yorkshire Police
obtained written evidence from their officers who witnessed the disaster to put before
the W est Midlands Police investigators and Lord Taylor’s Inquiry. Soon after the
disaster officers were asked to write out in their own words their recollections of the day
and of the part which they them selves had played. Many o f these statements were
submitted to Hammond Suddards, solicitors to the force, to advise whether they were in
a suitable form for submission to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry.


20. The solicitors made no com m ent on the great majority o f these statements, and in
others their advice was confined to clearing up ambiguities and removing hearsay,
com m ent or inappropriate language. In a very few cases, which I have referred to in
Appendix 7, what has been excluded is either factual or com m ent in which factual
matters are implicit. In these cases I think it would have been preferable for the factual
matters not to have been excluded, or the com m ent elucidated.


21. It was well known to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry Team that the statements were being
vetted in this way. The process did not materially differ from the way in which
statements were taken from w itnesses who were em ployed by Sheffield W ednesday FC
or the Ambulance Service.


22. Towards the end of May 1989 the South Yorkshire Police team responsible for
collating the evidence o f officers in the Force began to suggest amendments to
statements without referring them to the solicitors. The suggestions they made were on
the same basis as those made by the solicitors. I have looked at all the statements that
were altered in this way. In m ost cases the alteration is trivial. W here comment or
opinion is excluded the amendments cannot in my opinion be criticised. In no case is the
statem ent rendered misleading.


23. I am quite satisfied that Lord Taylor’s Inquiry was not in any way inhibited or
im peded by what happened. Lord Taylor was w ell aware o f the criticisms made by som e
junior officers. His Inquiry exam ined these issues and he made findings about them
which were adverse to the police.



                                            106
24. I am also satisfied that the exclusion of these comments did not affect the outcom e
of the Inquests, or the decision by the Director of Public Prosecutions not to bring
criminal charges as a result of the disaster. I do not consider that there is any question of
m isconduct either by the solicitor who gave the police advice upon the statements or by
the police officers who suggested alterations to the statements without referring the
statem ent to the solicitors.


O ther issues


Inconsistent evidence


25. It is clear that there is inconsistent evidence about precisely what happened to
som e of the people who died at Hillsborough. Such conflicts of evidence are inevitable
given the scale of the disaster. The Coroner did his best to resolve these questions at the
Inquest, and I have tried to get to the bottom of som e o f those which remain and which
the fam ilies o f those who died have asked me to look into. I have not been completely
successful in this. What is clear however is that no further inquiry involving examination
o f the witnesses could help after this lapse o f time.


The Inquests


26. The D ivisional Court found that the Coroner was not biased and had no conflict of
interest. I see no reason to disagree with that. I can find no evidence to support the
suggestion that Liverpool supporters who gave evidence at the Inquest were given a
difficult time in the witness box.


27. I do not agree with the criticisms which have been made o f the Coroner and the
way in which he ran the Inquests. But I endorse the recomm endation o f the H om e
O ffice W orking Group on Disasters and Inquests that the role o f the Coroner should be
lim ited in circumstances such as these. I have reached the firm conclusion that is not
satisfactory to have an inquest into the deaths caused by a major disaster when an
Inquiry chaired by a High Court Judge has already covered the same ground.


The police


28. Som e o f the families o f those who died have told m e that they have been unable to
obtain copies o f documents to which they were entitled from the South Yorkshire Police
archive on the disaster. Two families supplied m e with material to enable me to check
on this. In neither case did I think the complaint was justified.


29. The investigation o f the disaster by the W est Midlands Police was not biased in
favour o f the South Yorkshire force.



                                             107
30. The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire has on many occasions apologised for the
disaster on behalf of his force.


Examination by doctors confirm ing death


31. Criticism that doctors who exam ined bodies at the ground did so in a cursory or
inadequate manner is wholly unsubstantiated.


The state o f the ground


32. There are two questions to do with the state o f the Hillsborough football ground
which seem to me to have aspects which were not considered by Lord Taylor’s
otherwise very full Inquiry. These questions are to do with the height o f the crush
barriers on the Leppings Lane terrace where the disaster happened and the overall
capacity o f that terrace. I do not consider that they give grounds for reopening the
Judicial Inquiry or any other proceedings.

            The Secretary of State for the Home Department (M r. Jack Straw); With permission,
            Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the Hillsborough stadium disaster.

            Ninety-six people tost their lives as a result of the Hillsborough disaster, which happened on t
            1989. That was more than eight years ago, but no one who saw the news reports on that drer
            Saturday will have forgotten those terrible events. For those who lost loved members oftheii
            the pain is ever present. Following Hillsborough, Members of the House were united in their
            determination to do all in their power to prevent anything like that ever happening again.

            After the Hillsborough disaster, a number of inquiries and investigations took place. The most
            thorough and wide ranging of those was the public inquiry led by the late Lord Taylor. The t "
            reference of that inquiry encompassed not only inquiring into the disaster, but making
            recommendations about crowd control and safety at sports events

            Lord Taylor's inquiry took oral evidence from more than 170 witnesses at public hearings
            and June 1989 and considered many hours of video evidence from different sources. In his ii
            report in August 1989, Lord Taylor found that the disaster had a number
            attribute all the blame to a single cause or person, but in paragraph 278 he made it clear that

                 "The main reason fbr the dliaiter w u the failure of policc control"

        Lord Taylor made 43 recommendations in hit interim report His final report in
        farther 76 recommendations. The developments that have taken place since then
        grounds and in the policing of football matches have been based largely on those
        Football in this country has been transformed since the Taylor report. To a large
        Lord Taylor's wide-ranging and soundly based conclusions.

       The deaths that occurred on 15 April 1989 were also the subject of inquests conducted by the <
       of the western district of South Yorkshire After examining the evidence, the jury at the coroner's
       inquest found in March 1991 that the cause of death of those who died at Hillsborough was accidental
       death. A fUrther investigation was conducted by the West Midlands police, supervised by the Police
       Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any grounds for criminal proceedings and to
       consider whether any police officer should be subject to disciplinary proceedings

       That investigation involved the taking of more than 5,000 statements and the scrutiny of all the
       material that had been examined previously by the Taylor inquiry. After that investigation, the
       evidence was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, who concluded that no person shoirtc
       subject to criminal proceedings.


       charge on the day should fece disciplinary charges for neglect of duty. In the event,1
       superintendent retired due to ill health in advance of a ruling by a disciplinary tribunal.

       Column 25

       Under police discipline rules, a disciplinary hearing cannot proceed when a police officer retires I
       the hearing takes place The Police Complaints Authority decided later that disciplinary proceedings
       against the superintendent should be withdrawn because the retirement of the chief superintendent
       meant that what, in effect, was ajointallegation of neglect of duty could not be heard fairly in the
       absence of the more senior officer.                                                                                            '

       Hon Members will be familiar with the unhappiness of the families of those who died regard
       outcome of the inquest. They later applied for judicial review of the coroner's proceedings Ii
       November 1993, the divisional court ruled that none ofthe matters raised in the judicial review
       proceedings justified intervention by that court in the verdict ofthe inquest jury The events
       surrounding the disaster have, therefore, been subject to investigation on several occasions. However,
       concerns have remained about whether the full Acts have yet emerged. 1 have met relatives ofthe
       Hillsborough victims whose suffering is exacerbated by their belief that there are unresolved isaies that
       should be investigated further.

       Representations were made to my predecessor and have been made to me, to the Attorney-General
       and to the Director of Public Prosecutions. A Granada television programme in December last year
       dramatised the disaster and raised a number of Issues that, in the view ofthe programme makers,
       represented new evidence. The programme prompted an Adjournment debate on 1? December 1996,
       which was led by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Mr. Kilfoyle), and to which my
       predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (M r Howard), replied. 1
       know how seriously my predecessor viewed the matter.

       Since that programme, ftirther material has been submitted on behalf of the Hillsborough families
       support group. Those representations have related in particular to video evidence of the disaster and

        took the view-again, on the basis of the material presented to him--that any application

        None the less, I am acutely conscious that the families of those who died at
        others, including hon Members, are very concerned that unresolved issues
        go as fcr as I can to ensure that no matter of significance is overlooked and that we do not
        final conclusion without a foil and independent examination of the evidence

        The Attorney-General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and I have, therefore, agreed that it is in
        the public interest to establish an independent scrutiny to ascertain whether there now exists any new
        evidence relating to the disaster which was not previously available.

        I hope that this examination will enable us to establish conclusively whether material

Houm of Common*         D oU tai foi 30Jua 1997(pt • )      hUaV/wwwp«rli«n«nlthc-jt*l)eftery-ofl'..l/<mliamf<i/cmV



       The right hon. Gentleman asked four questions, the first of which was on the timetable. Lord Justice
       Stuart-Smith has told me that, cutyect to a case that he is currently hearing in the Court of Appc«l
       being concluded a* soon as possible, he intends to do some work in respect of the new duties before
       the end of July ami to start his proceedings in September. We hope that the matter will be concluded
       and that he will be able to produce his report by the end of the year. However, the House will
       understand that that is a judgment which only Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
       representations that he receives

       Secondly, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether, in addition to publishing the advice that I receive
       from Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, I will publish all the evidence that is considered by him. My answer to
       the right hon. Gentleman is provisional. I shall do my best to ensure that that is the case, but there may
       be good reasons-for example, in respect of criminal or disciplinary proceedings-why such evidence
       cannot be published at the same time as the advice is published However, if evidence is to be
       unpublished, I shall make that dear at the time

       Thirdly, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether there can be examination in public ami whether the
       families and others would be able to make representations. The answer to the latter part of the
       question is yes. As the House would expect, the exact proceedings of the scrutiny are

       Column 28
       matters for Lord Justice Stuart-Smith to decide and he will base his decision on his long experience as
       a senior member of the judiciary

       T h e f o u r t h issue that the right hon. Gentleman raised was whether, when the advice is received, t
       would discuss with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House the matter of a debate. O f course!
       shall do that.

       M arla Eagle (Liverpool, Garston): I congratulate my right hon Friend on his statement ! also
       congratulate Granada Television and Jimmy McGovern whose efforts have brought this matter back to
       the attention of the House Can my right hon Friend assure the House that the families who have
       fought for so long will have the opportunity of legal representation to enable them to present their
       cases, whether orally or in writing, to the Lord Justice? WUI they receive some financi*! is«rt»nce to
       enable them to do that?

        M r, Straw; I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her remarks and for her welcome for the statement.
        The costs of those who have to travel to appear before the scrutiny will be met by my Department. My
        hon. Friend aaks about legal representation. That issue has not been raised by me during my
        discussions with the families. 1 understand that they already have legal repreaentationtf a fttrtherisaue
        arises, I shall, of course, consider it.

        M r. A. J. Belth (Berwick-upon-Tweed): Is the Home Secretary aware that Liberal Democrat
        Members welcome this focused re-examination of the evidence, including                              Gn
        these terrible events, which have been etched into the minds of all the people who saw the television
        coverage at the time and etched dreadfully into the lives of the people who lost family members, but
        will he confirm that it is very unlikely-and perhaps impossiWe-that police discipline proceedings
        could be reopened as a result of what might be found in the inquiry? Does he recognise that the public
        find it difficult to understand how police discipline proceedings can be brought to a halt when
        retirement on health grounds takes place before the hearing has begun? Given that Lord Taylor's main
        recommendation was that, although there were many Actors, the main reason for the disaster was the
        failure of police control, that will leave questions In the public mind, which will pass beyond the
        inquiry into what can be done when conclusions are reached.

               M r. Straw: I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his welcome for my statement. He asked me to say
               that fUrther police discipline proceedings would be very unlikely. That is to anticipate the view that
               Lord Justice Stuart-Smith may or may not come to and, with great respect to the right hon.
               Gentleman, I shall not do that. He also invites me to make general comments on police discipline
               regulations. There may be an occasion to debate the generality of such regulations, but I do not believe
               that now is the time.

               I say only that the police discipline regulations exist and have been approved from time to time by the
               House; they are statutory regulations. It is, o f course, open to Secretaries of State and to the House to
               change them in the light of circumstances.

               Helen Jackson (Sheffield, Hillsborough): I am sure that the Home Secretary realises that the most
               tragic

               Column 29

               trauma of the event was suffered by the families of the Liverpool fans who attended the match, but it
               was also one of the most traumatic events in their history for the people of the Hillsborough area of
               Sheffidd~the links that they have made and maintain with families in Liverpool bear witness to that
               While he considers the evidence that, I believe, he is rightly having another look at, will Lord Justice
               Stuart-Smith consider in detail the lessons to be teamed both for the communities living around big
               football stadiums and for the policing of football matches?

               M r. Straw: I accept entirely what my hon. Friend said: this tragedy went beyond the people directly
               affected who were supporters of Liverpool football dub and traumatised the people living around
               Hillsborough end all the people in Sheffield and in south Yorkshire as well We should not forget that,
               on that day, there were many individual acts of great courage by people from south Yorkshire, by
               people in the police, fire and ambulance services and by many other ordinary citizens

               My hon. Friend asked me whether wider lessons, induding lessons about the policing of football
               matches, can be considered by Lord Justice Stuart*Smith in his scrutiny. The answer to that, I am
               afraid, is that we do not anticipate that they can be. The scrutiny will look at new evidence that has
               come forward since the earlier inquiries, to find out whether that evidence is sufficiently significant to
               trigger either a new public inquiry, ordered by myself, or action by the Attorney-General, the Director
               of Public Prosecutions or the chiefofficer of South Yorkshire police, I do not believe that, at any stage
               since the late Lord Justice Taylor reported, there has been any criticism of his wider recommendations,
               most of which have been implemented, on the policing of football matches and on crowd control

               M r. Tony Baldry (Banbury): I am sure that no hon. Member would challenge the judgment that the
               Home Secretary has come to today, but will he confirm that, in his statement, he said that, on the
               evidence submitted to her, the Director of Public Prosecutions had concluded that nothing justified
               fresh criminal investigations? Could he give two undertakings to the House, that, in due course, Lord
               Justice Stuart-Smith will make it dear what new evidence he is considering that was not available to
               the Director of Public Prosecutions in making that judgment, and why that evidencewas^ available
               earlier?

              M r. Straw: I can confirm exactly what the Hon. Gentleman says. I s&id that the Director of Public
              Prosecutions hs* taken the view that the material so far presented to her would not justify fresh
              criminal investigations. I also referred to a judgment made by the former Attorney-General, the right
              hon and learned Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Sir N Lyell), but I ought to make it dear that,
              as I understand it-as I am informcd-he based that judgment on information other than that which
              arose following the television programme screened last December

              It is in the nature of asking a senior and highly respected judge of the Court of Appeal to look at all
              the fresh allegations and the fresh evidence that he may come to a different view from that which the
              Director of Public Prosecutions has so far come to on the evidence that she

              Column 30

              has available That is not in any sense to imply any criticism of the work of the Director of Public
              Prosecutions or the Crown Prosecution Service.

              tragically affected by this event, may I ask my right hon. Friend whether the fresh inquiry will bring
              about some consideration of the way in which the coroner's court conducted its affairs during the
              inquiries i
              that should have perhaps come to the coroner's court eartier--now becoming more widely available?

              M r. Straw; There has been continuing concern about the way in which inquests generally are
              conducted There was a working party report into large-scale disasters and inquests, which
              recommended significant changes, including a change whereby if there were, God forbid, a disaster of
              a similar scale and nature in the future, there would be one inquiry similar to that conducted by the iate
              Lord Justice Taylor, which would be the general public inquiry and also take the form of an inquest, so
              that the relatives would be spared going through the agony caused by two separate inquiries.

              The issue of the way in which the first inquest was conducted was the subject of great consideration
              by the divisional court when there were proceedings for judicial review It is a matter for Lord Justice
              Stuart-Smith, but I expect that he will not wish to go over that ground but will instead, as part of his
              scrutiny, wish to consider with greet care the new allegations of evidence not put before the
              inquest-especially, as the House is well aware, arguments about the time of death which, in the view
              of the relatives and programme makers, the inquest was not property able to take into account.

              M r. Nicholas Soames (Mid-Sustex): I warmly welcome the right hon Gentleman's statement and the
              measured and sensitive way in which he outlined his plans. I take the point about the issue o f police
              discipline in respect of this inquiry, but will he nevertheless undertake to consider a
              re-examination-not necessarily in the light of these events, but more generally-ofthe police
              disciplinary code, w h ic h provides that once an officer has retired, any matters under investigation
              lapse? Does he agree that that should be reconsidered, and will he undertake to do so?
              M r. Strawt Yes, without reference to this particular case, I accept that many members of the public
              regard it as odd that when an officer retires, that is the end of all disciplinary processes However, one
              of the things on which I am currently taking advice is the fact that, as I understand it, regulations
              expect chief officers not to permit the retirement of officers on grounds o f ill health where disciplinary
              proceedings are still pending. There is, therefore, an issue not only of whether disciplinary regulations
              should be changed, but of whether chief officers of police arc properly fulfilling the terms of existing

           Ms Louise Gilman (Liverpool, Riverside): I welcome the Home Secretary's statement jn that it
           opens up the

           Column 91

          possibility ofjustice for the families whose lives have been so cruelly devastated Is my right hon.
          Friend able to assure the House that while the inevitable legal considerations take place, he will keep in
          mind the prime consideration of the feelings of the families involved and their beliefthat they have
          been denied justice, in that information was not brought forward at theappropriate time?

          M r Straw: O f course I give that assurance to my bon. Friend. I made the decision fo ask Lord ^ustice
          Stuart-Smith to conduct forther scrutiny because I fdt that there was fresh evidence thst required
          proper and independent examination tn reaching that decision, of course I took fUU aeeount of the
          profound distress and grief felt by relatives of those who lost their lives. As I said in my statement,
          those feelings have been compounded by a beliefthat some aspects of the tragedy-its causes and the
          culpability of those whose actions may or may not have led to the tragedy-have not been folly
          examined.

          M r. Damian Green (Ashford): 1 am sure that the Home Secretary will be aware that although the
          events of that day were particularly traumatic for the people of Liverpool and o f Sheffield, tl
          traumatic also for football fens across the country. He will also be aware that, in the past 12
                                                                                                                rap
          after years in which incidents of hooliganism at and around football matches was declining, there to’
          been worrying signs that hooliganism is beginning to increase. In the light of his answer to the h<m
          Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Helen lackson) that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith will not be able to
          consider the wider issues arising from the Hillsborough tragedy, will he tell us whether,
          ultimately-should the incident be examined by a public inquiiy-*a public inquiry will be able to
          consider the wider issues of crowd control and policing at football matches?

          M r. Straw: For well over the past 10 years, 1 have taken my children to football matches. The hon
          Gentleman is right to say that, since implementation of Lord Taylor's recommendations, there has been
          profound improvement in football fans' behaviour at and around football grounds. The
          recommendations have led also to significant improvements in policing football matches. Now-as we *•..
          saw during Euro 96—it it a pleasure to take anyone, including one's children, to football matches, T f " ^
          years ago, as! know for certain, it was often a frightening experience. I have received no     ' ;■ >
          representations that there need to be changes in this criminal law to deal with crowd control at fopib:
          matches, although I will consider any such representations that might be made.                      ' —■ ■ -

          ! should make it clear that the purpose of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny will be to consider the
          fresh evidence that has become available on the Hillsborough tragedy I cannot anticipate the foil terms
          of reference of any fUU public inquiry that 1 may establish. As I said earlier in answer to my hon.
          Friends, however, what is clear and beyond peradventure is that no one has criticised Lord Taylor or
          the way in which he conducted his inquiry, particularly on crowd control at football matches.

          M r. Edward O’Hara (Knowsley, South): May I again express my condolences to the Hillsborough
          families?

               M r. Straw; If there are any Individuals who have material evidence that was no
               inquiry conducted by the late Lord Taylor, at the inquest or in relation to the pc
               investigation by Wait Midlands Police, I appeal to them to come forward

               I did not properly answer the second part of the question from my hon. Friend the Member for
               Knowiley, South (Mr. O'Hara) in relation to allegations liy'                                                             ;K::■
               that, let me make it quite clear that Lord Taylor's report dismissed entirely rt
               certain newspapers and clearly came to the view that the principal reason for the
               failure of police control. I hope that remains a matter of reassurance for the families.                         ■‘-V

               who has since left the House Sheffield Wednesday football club has the d  -
               victims and wilt be happy to co-operate in any way with the inquiry.

               1have two questions for my right hon. Friend. First, will the evidence be given
               great interest in that. Secondly, he will recall that the previous inquiry cost
               compensation, Will the Government pay for the inquiry and refUnd all the exr ;
               concerned, including the witnesses and relatives of the victims? Will it be possible to
               of compensation? Can he give us some information about that?

               M r. Straw: 1 am very grateful to my hon. Friend, especially given his position as a
               Sheffield Wednesday football chib. He asked whether evidence before the scrutiny
               Stuart-Smith will be given on oath. We are not planning that that should be the ™
               Stuart-Stnith considers that he has inadequate powers to conduct the scrutiny, :
               any such representations from him, but I do not expect that it will be a problem,
               the scrutiny that we are asking him to undertake in respect of the new evidence.

               My hon. Friend
               for the cost of the inquiry itself and will refund the travelling and incidental ext
               a p p e a r before it to make representations I dealt with the inue of legal repre

               wider issue. So far, I have had no calls for legal aid. That would involve some large decisions to -
               I cannot commit myself With respect to my hon Friend, the issue of compensation for trauma
               suffered does not arise as a result of this scrutiny.

               M r. Dennis Skinner (Bolsover): Does my right hon. Friend recall that, a short time before the
               general election, traumatised policemen were awarded substantial aims because they had witnessed
               the horrific events? It is well known that many of the Liverpool families of the victims have not
               received anything. I take it, from his answer today, that compensation will not be dealt with by the
               inquiry. Will he give a guarantee that if the results of the inquiry lean in the direction that many of us
               hope for, consequential payments could be made to those Liverpool families?

               M r. Straw: The issue of some police officers receiving compensation while some of those who were
               on the terraces have not is not a matter for this scrutiny-not because it is unimportant, but because it

Dear Kevin

Hillsborough Disaster "Open Review11

I met with Mr Wardrope today and we had a very useful session together re-acquainting ourselves
with the issues. Mr Wardrope is going to copy to you the statements o f the various hospital staff
who were involved at the time and which he has already located. I am still waiting for my file to
be retrieved from archiving and if there are additional statements or reports over and above those
which Mr Wardrope has, then I will let you know in due course. In the meantime, once Mr
Wardrope has copied the statements to you, do you think you could let me have a set of the
statements just in case Mr Wardrope is called to the "open review" at short notice.

I have discussed the likely procedure o f the open review and I think Mr Wardrope is feeling
slightly easier knowing that evidence is not to be taken on oath and that he is unlikely to be cross
examined by the family’s lawyers and others. I very much hope that the nature of the review will
be similar to that conducted by Sir Cecil Clothier following the Allitt incident.

Mr Wardrope reminded me o f some of the pressures and problems on the day of the incident in
Casualty and these are also set out in some detail in Dr Ed Walker’s statement which he made at
the time. Whilst Dr Walker never gave evidence (as far as we are aware) to either Lord Justice
Taylor’s enquiry or the inquests, his statement was submitted along with all the others to the West
Midlands Police who conducted the independent review with a view to recommending disciplinary
action against South Yorkshire Police. Also, Mr Wardrope tells me that although he did not
personally give oral evidence to the Taylor enquiry, he did submit evidence to the enquiry and Lord
Justice Taylor would have had every opportunity to call either Mr Wardrope or indeed anyone else

from the hospital to give evidence had he thought it relevant. Mr Wardrope did in fact give
evidence to the Coroner’s Inquest but I believe he was the only doctor to do so. Mr Wardrope has
no difficulty with the Coroner’s decision not to hear evidence o f what happened to the deceaseds
after 3.15 pm and Mr Wardrope agrees with the Coroner that by 3.15 pm those who were already
dead or were going to die had already sustained their fatal crush injuries.

Having said all that, Mr Wardrope is acutely aware that although hospital matters were not under
detailed scrutiny previously, the families may well latch on to events at the hospital to justify a
request for new inquests or a further enquiry, or simply as a focus for their own anger and grief.
Hopefully it will not be the latter but clearly we all need to prepare for that eventuality.

I have advised Mr Wardrope that if it is at all possible, should he be called to give evidence to the
open enquiry and to have a friend/representative with him, then I would be more than happy to
attend with him. In any event once I have my full file of papers and have reviewed the statements
referred to above, we feel we ought to start preparing him to deal with some o f the more difficult
questions which may arise concerning unavailability o f equipment, poor identification o f the bodies,
delay in implementing the major incident procedure etc.

I hope you agree with this however if you wish to discuss this with me further or if Andrew wishes
to have a word with me, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind regards.

Yours sincerely

Thank you for your letter 21 August, I apologise for the delay
in replying but I have only just returned from annual leave.

Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention. I would have
thought that if Ms Adlington wishes a copy of my statement, the
proper thing would be to approach me directly so that I might be
made aware of the reasons for the request. In the circumstances,
I would be grateful if you did not release the statement and
advise Ms Adlington that if she wishes to contact me directly
this might be the best way forward.

Yours sincerely

Ms Adlington, a solicitor representing the Hillsborough Family Support Group at Liverpool has
asked to be provided with a copy of your statement. Before I release a copy of your statement I
think it only proper that I seek your view on the matter.

Please accept my apologies for raising this issue at this time, but I trust that you will appreciate

approval.

I enclose a pre-paid envelope for favour of your reply.

Dear Jim

Thank you for your letter of 2 September together with enclosures and I note your reply to South
Yorkshire Police. I am quite happy with your refusal to allow the Police to disclose your statement
to the Solicitor for the Support Group. I cannot see that it is any business of theirs to be looking
at evidence which was already available to the Police, Lord Justice Taylor and the Coroner, "the
first time around". In any event this is a review by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and I am sure he
does not need the Solicitors for the Support Group to tell him what is in your statement or its
import and relevance to his enquiry. One can only pre-suppose that the Solicitor requires the
statement for other purposes pertinent to the aims of the Support Group. Ms Adlington’s only
legitimate concern should be that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has available to him your statement.

I am sorry this is all becoming rather involved and I fear it may become somewhat nastier even
before the start of the enquiry. I am enclosing two extracts of articles which our Library has
obtained via the Press Association, for your information.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.

  1 13 Aug 97 Inquiry: Fresh Appeal To Hillsborough Disaster Fans: Press
         Association (Ql:29)

  By MARIA BRESLIN
A Hillsborough disaster support group today called on more survivors to come
forward with information to help the new inquiry which opens next month.
The Hillsborough Families Support Group believes many fans at the 1989 FA
Cup semi-final have vital information even though they were not called to
give evidence at the original inquest.
High Court Appeal Judge Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, 69, will start sifting
through evidence at the beginning of September but is not expected to make a
decision until the end of the year.
Although a private enquiry, the Home Office has promised to make public any
developments from the investigation which will include evidence from
Sheffield doctor Ed Walker whose testimony was not heard in the 1991 inquest
as well as video evidence which may show the police were aware of the
unfolding tragedy.
Legal representatives are to visit Liverpool next week, said Tom Glover,
whose brother Ian died in the disaster.
'The Home Secretary said there should be a full disclosure of all the
evidence. A lot of lads weren't called to the inquest. There's a lot of
stuff being missed,' said Mr Glover.
'We would like to hear from anyone with information regarding the way they
were treated by the police after 3.15 that afternoon. At the original
inquest 3 .15pm was seen as the cut of point.
'But there was a lot of stuff that happened after that. We have always
objected to that part of the inquest.'

Dear Kevin


Re:      Hillsborough Disaster
Please find enclosed a copy of a statement of Ed Walker and a
copy of my statement. I have other statements but I do not think
there will be any merit in copying these wholesome.

Please note I have marked these highly confidential and I think
they should go to yourself and Andrew Cash and further
circulation I would like restricted.

Ed Walker has been asking for copies of all the notes of the
Hillsborough victims. I think this would not be appropriate and
as these notes contain information written by other practitioners
and also information that is the property of the Coroner. While,
I wish to help Ed in his evidence, I think he should only have
access to those records that he has in fact made at the time.


Yours sincerely

CONSULTANT IN ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY MEDICINE

Mr(
    !                        STATEMENT
    i

I




    James Wardrope will say as follows



        I am a Consultant in charge of the Accident & Emergency

    Department at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.         I

    have been a Consultant at the hospital since 1 May 1987;

    prior to that I held the post of Senior Registrar at the

    Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield.       I qualified in

    MB.CHB (Edinburgh University)in 1978 and my qualifications

    are B.SC (Med Sci), MB.CHB, FRCS (Edinburgh)       (General Surgery)

    FRCS (Edinburgh) (Accident and Emergency Medicine and Surgery)

    FRCS (England) (General Surgery).


        The Accident & Emergency Department is quite a busy one.        It

        had 55,000 patients last year, of which 42,000 were new

    patients.       In terms of medical staffing, there are seven

        Senior House Officers, an Associate Specialist (six sessions

    A&E,       four sessions Fracture Clinic) and five GP Clinical

    Assistant sessions.       I am permanently the first on call,

        except every other weekend when one of the Orthopaedic

        Consultants takes the on call duty.



        Saturday is usually a busy day for the Department, especially

        in the afternoon.    On Saturday, 15 April there were two

        medical staff, of   SHO grade, on duty and I was on call.   I

        had been into the   Department at 10.00 am on the morning of

        the 15th.   The Department was fairly busy.   At about 1.00 pm

        I telephoned the Department from home to let them know I was

        going to be out as I planned to take my family to the park.
I ascertained the waiting time in the Department was two hours

which means it was quite busy.    I took my wife and children

to Graves Park.   We were just returning, and were about 200

yards from our home in Crosspool, when my bleep which I had

beeri carrying went off.   I arrived home within about a minute

and telephoned the hospital immediately.    I spoke to Charge

Nurse Batty, who indicated he had been notified of some sort

of incident at Hillsborough and that the hospital was to stand

by and to expect to receive some crush injuries.     He gave no

indication of numbers or that a major incident had been called

He indicated that no patients had yet arrived and from the

details he gave me I thought perhaps the hospital would

receive half a dozen or so.    I knew the Department was fairly

busy and I decided I should go in to help out, but I did not

think it was a major emergency.



I immediately left for the hospital in my car.     The time on

the car clock, which is two minutes fast, was 3.25 pm.     (ie

the correct time was 3.23 pm).    The journey was very quick as

the roads were quiet and I arrived at the hospital at 3.35 pm,

(the correct time was 3.33 pm) according to the car clock.        I

parked my car in the Consultants' car park.    I started

walking towards the Department, but as I approached the

entrance I saw three ambulances and I began to run.     I was

met at the door by Charge Nurse        who informed me three

patients were undergoing resuscitation in the Resuscitation

Room which is adjacent to the side entrance.    I asked him

whether he had implemented the Major Disaster Plan and he

replied he had.   It was obvious to me that it was necessary
to implement the Major Disaster Plan.



I went into the Resuscitation Room where there were three

patients undergoing resuscitation.   One was a teenager

who was being attended by the Senior Paediatric House

Officer.   I gather she had been called when the Department

were alerted to expect a paediatric cardiac arrest.     A Senior

House Officer from Rotherham, who had just been passing the

hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one of my

SHOs was working on the third patient.



More ambulances arrived almost immediately.   I went to the

front door with Charge Nurse _____ to receive the injured,

almost all of whom were dead or dying.   Some were sent to the

Resuscitation Room and I then went to the Resuscitation Room

myself to intubate with endotracheal tubes.   I cannot now

recall how many patients were in that batch of arrivals.



I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about

5.00 pm, to triage patients as they arrived, and also to

triage Doctors so that they could be assigned to appropriate

duties.



By about 3.45 pm a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

and the Resuscitation Room was fairly well manned.    I

allocated Doctors to the Resuscitation Room initially, and

then into Ward 60 which had been cleared and which was acting

as the receiving ward.
I realised the Resuscitation Room was becoming very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation.

I therefore requested the Ambulance Liaison Officer to divert

cases to the Hallamshire.     I believe that Mr Duncan, Senior

Registrar in Surgery, also telephoned SYMAS at that time with

the same request.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

tagging system to identify the casualties.     Because of the

volume of patients arriving staff were unable to use the

coloured labels.



At about this time I started sending patients arriving with

no cardiac output direct to the Plaster Room (mortuary).        Up

to that point patients with no cardiac output who were having

active cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance were sent

to the Resuscitation Room to continue resuscitation, in view of

their age and the nature of the injury.



Also about this time I received a request to send a mobile

team to the Hillsborough football ground.     The request came

to me by word of mouth but I believe that the call originated

over the direct line to the Accident & Emergency Department

from SYMAS Headquarters.    At that time there was a large number

of seriously ill patients in the Department with not sufficient

medical staff.     However, very quickly more staff arrived and I

was able to despatch two Doctors with the Major Accident

Equipment Boxes.     The staff who went were Dr Davidson, Senior

House Officer, and an Anaesthetic Senior House Officer.     The
Department has specially prepared boxes of equipment for just

such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

only two weeks earlier.     As it transpired, when the mobile

team arrived at the ground there were sufficient medical

staff already there and the Doctors were sent back to the

hospital and only the equipment retained.



By about this time I think I was notified the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital were receiving about half the

casualties.



After 4.00 pm the situation became more controlled and less

serious injuries were arriving in the Department.     These were

sent to the Physiotherapy Department which had been cleared

to receive non-urgent casualties requiring minor treatment or

rest or awaiting transport home.     By about 4.30 pm the

Department was becoming much quieter.     I asked Dr R Elson,

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, and Dr D Edwards, Orthopaedic

Registrar, to attend the non-urgent casualties in the

Physiotherapy Department.



Dr Tim Shaw, Consultant Anaesthetist, was in charge of the

Resuscitation Room.



The last patient I remember receiving arrived at about 4.45

pm.   He had fainted from the exertion of carrying bodies out

of the ground.



At the time I did not know how many patients the Department
had received, although I knew at one point that about sixteen

patients were all undergoing resuscitation.   The Department

is set up for ten resuscitation points and all these points

were being used with often more than one patient to each point.



The triage area was established near the side entrance to the

A & E Department.   In a major disaster the main entrance is

closed and all casualties are brought into the side entrance

and thus through the triage point.   The Resuscitation Room is

immediately adjacent to the triage area in room 23 and beyond

that rooms 18 (Treatment), 16 (Anteroom), 14 (Plaster Room),

15 (Treatment Room), 57, 58 and 61 (Examination/Treatment

Rooms) and cubicles were used.   Any casualties who did not

require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward, ward

60, or, if they were minor casualties, to the Physiotherapy

Department.   Only one patient required surgery - a

laporotomy.   Almost all the resuscitation patients required

intensive care and therefore were transferred from the

resuscitation areas to either the General Intensive Treatment

Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.



In the initial ten minutes the Department was overwhelmed by

the volume of patients requiring resuscitation.    I think this

is due to three factors, namely the speed of extraction of

casualties from the site, the speed of transportation to the

hospital in view of its proximity to the football ground, and

the nature of the injuries.



I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.      I believe
at one time we ran out of oxygen flow meters, but these were

provided very quickly by the Supplies Department.     The

hospital does not have a CT scanner and one of the

ventilated casualties required a CT scan during the

afternoon.    He was transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.    A further two patients were transferred during the

evening and four patients were transferred during the night

to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.



By about 5.30 pm the Department was almost clear of

casualties.



Non-urgent casualties were directed to the General and

Maternity Wing Physiotherapy Department.    The dead were

transferred to the mortuary which had been set up temporarily

in the Orthopaedic Plaster Room.    The bodies were later

transferred to the temporary mortuary which was established

at the football ground.



The Major Disaster Plan provides for patients to be labelled

with appropriately coloured labels once they have been triaged,

so that, for example, those requiring immediate resuscitation

should receive a red label, those requiring urgent admission

and surgery should receive a blue label, non-urgent a green

label and dead a white label.    In fact, because of the speed

of arrival of the casualties in the first twenty minutes, it

was impossible for staff to use the coloured labels.        This

did not make any material difference as staff were writing on

to the labels the patients' destination, once triaged.
I only had contact with the families of the patients later in

the evening.      I recall I was in the Control Room when one

woman arrived trying to find her husband and daughter.              I

recall speaking to her and telling her that her husband had

survived but that her daughter was dead.             The families

appeared to be well marshalled on Level C, which is the floor

below the A & E Department.          I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.              I think there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.              By the following morning I

was able to calculate that eighty-eight patients had been

through the Department from Hillsborough.             Fifty-five of these

were admissions, twenty-one were discharged to home after

treatment and twelve patients were dead.             During the time of

the alert, the Department also dealt with five other patients

who were not from Hillsborough.           Of the admissions, fifteen

were admitted to Intensive Care and two further ventilated

patients were transferred to the Hallamshire Hospital.              Later

that evening a further five patients were transferred to the

Hallamshire Hospital for CT scanning.



The type of injury sustained by the casualties - traumatic

asphyxia - is fairly uncommon.           In the two years I have worked

at the Northern General Hospital I have only seen one such

case.    The most common cause of this type of injury is a car

falling on top of someone working beneath it, or from heavy

industry.     The Northern General Hospital treated twenty-five

cases of severe traumatic asphyxia in the space of one hour and

I believe it handled the incident extremely well.


Signed    .................................

Dated    ..................................
Statement of Dr Edward C Walker, SHO in Anaesthetics at Rotherham DGH
ftsjgaftding the Hillsborough Incident on Saturday 15th April 1989_______


At 3.00 pm on the day   of the incident I had just returned home and

happened to turn on the television to see pictures of the crowd disturbance

at the Hillsborough ground.     There was no talk at that time of any

casualties nor from the pictures did it seem apparent that there would be

a great number of people injured or killed.

However, I decided that it might be worth my travelling to the Northern

General Hospital just to see if I could be of use in the event of any

casualties being received.

I live at Tinsley and as Idrove out of the house I encountered an

ambulance travelling towards the centre    of Sheffield with lights and

siren on and I put my own headlights onand followed     immediately behind

this ambulance.

It transpired in fact that this ambulance was in fact on its way to

Hillsborough but it passed the Northern General Hospital in doing so.

I turned off into the hospital grounds.

I arrived at the Casualty Department to    be told that they did know of a

disturbance at Hillsborough and also that ambulance control had told them

that there was a paediatric cardiac arrest coming into the department.

However, the two events were not linked as far as we knew.      We learned

later that the paediatric cardiac arrest was in fact from the ground.

This first child received was in cardio-respiratory standstill and we

instigated routine cardio-pulmonary resuscitation.     I intubated the child

and in doing so noted that there was evidence of gross inhalation of

stomach contents.   As far as I can recall we did establish sinus rhythm

and an output at one stage although the boy's pupils were fixed and dilated

throughout.   I believe this boy has since died.

Whilst resuscitation was being carried out on this first patient the second

child arrived also in a state ef cardio-pulmonary arrest.     Similar measures

were carried out and this child was brought back into sinus rhythm with a
good output although he also had fixed dilated pupils throughout and

has also I believe since died.

These two patients had taken up the available space in Resuscitation room

and I believe,the next case was taken into the "clean theatre area".

This patient had a good cardiac output but was irritable cerebroid and

in a decerebrate posture although not actually fitting at that time.

I intubated this patient without any drugs and another doctor took over

his further care.    During this time more casualties had arrived and

were being taken through to Plaster room area, one of these was in a

similar position to the last patient, ie cerebrally irritable but

breathing and with a good cardiac output.     I took the decision to leave

this patient in the care of a non-medical member of staff as there were

further patients in cardiac arrest state coming in.

As far as I can recall the next patient I dealt with was also in the

plaster room area.     He was cardiac and respiratory arrest.   I intuba

him and was joined by a doctor whose name I never found out, who was

apparently at Hillsborough and had come to the hospital from there.

I think he said he was from Liverpool.

There was also a police officer present who assisted us with ventilation

and cardiac massage.     We had dificulty establishing venous access and

we eventually resorted to a central line patients was re-established with

a good cardiac output.     However, his output fell at one stage and he

re-arrested.   We re-started him but then he arrested for a third time and

his pupils were fixed and dilated throughout.     At this time as there

were more casualties arriving we took a joint decision to abandon          -   ___ ^

resuscitation on this patient.     It was during this time that we ran into

most difficulties obtaining equipment such as intravenous catheters and

drugs.   These were of course not available routinely in the plaster room

and people that we asked to fetch drugs were of course not familiar

with resuscitation proedures (for example junicr student nurses) and I

remember one particular incident where I was brought back a phial of Atropine
and a vial of Adrenaline but no syringe or needle with which to draw

them up.     I eventually resorted to drawing up the drugs in a discarded

syringe, dilating under tap water, and injecting down the endo-tracheal

tube.

As I recall the next patient I attended to was       the recovery area

of the clean theatre.      He was having closed cardiac massage and being

hand ventilated with a face mask.     I inspected this patient and we

continued routine cardio-pulmonary resucitation.     Unfortunately due to

the large number of cardiac arrest situations that were going on at

this time there were no cardiac monitors at all available and we

resuscitated this patient 'blind' throughout the procedure.     As a result

we also ran into a problem here in that although there was an ambu

bag available to \eitilate the patient through the endo tracheal tube

we had great difficulty in finding a) suitable piping and b) a suitable

oxygen outlet through which to oxygenate the patient.      This patient

was therefore ventilated on air before this situation was remedied.

I believe at this stage I was asked to go round to the dirty theatre

area where there was, a young boy who was fitting.    He had been treated

by one of the casualty officers and by Dr Ryan and required intubation

and ventilation.

Operating department assistants were available at this stage and I

carried out a routine rapid sequence induction before transferring the

patient to GITU.

An identical procedure was then carried out on the second patient in the

dirty theatre area who was also transferred to GITU.

I then got involved    in the resuscitation of a patient in the Resus area

and inserted a central line on this patient.     This patient was in

asystole for some 15 minutes and I believe resuscitation attempts were

abandoned.

I then went up to ward 60 where the victims who had been sent to GITU

were admitted, several of these deteriorated neurologically on the ward
and I carried out rapid sequence induction on two of these patients before

transferring them to CICU.

As far as I can recall this covers the major amount of work in the immediate

primary care of the patients which I encountered.

I would like to list a few of the difficulties which I encountered during the

course of the afternoon -

a)     There appeared to be considerable delay before activating the Major

Accident Procedure, I am unclear to exactly how long this was but I

understand that members of casualty staff were trying to do this and found

that they could not get through to the hospital switchboard.

I am not aware of the standard procedures for activating the Major Accident

Plan     but I am unclear as why this could not have been done by Ambulance

Control.

b)     Identification of patients - obviously the standard Major Accident

Procedure did not get under way until a good number of patients had come

into the department.      Had I personally known what the scale of the

disaster was going to be, I think the simplest way would have been to Letter

or Number the patients with a marker pen.

c)     Although this was probably a unique event in the number of cardiac

arrest situations that were going on simulataneously.      I am sure that the

lack of available cardiac monitors was detrimental to some patients.

d)     I noted that in the Major Accident packs all the endo tracheal tubes

that I could find were uncuffed and of one size.      They were also uncut

and didn't have     any angle piece connectors already attached.   This led to

some delay in establishing satisfactory ventilation due to the large extent

of inhalational lung injury that was present cuffed tubes were essential.

e)     As I mentioned previously there was difficulty in oxygenating one

 patient due to the lack of available suitable oxygen tubing to conenct

an ambu bag to an oxygen outlet.     As I recall there was only one oxygen

outlet in tfie recovery area for clean theatre and this was connected to a
Boyle's machine.

 f)   There appeared to be a lack of suitably large venous cannulae.

g)    The only available peripheral venous cannulae were of Jelco or
 Cathlon types, ie they require a separate injection port to be attached
once they have been inserted into a vein and they are also difficult

 to secure effectively.   I would stress very strongly that Ventolon catheters

should be available as these do not require separate needles to be attached

to the syringe with which the injection    is to be given and there are also

much easier to secure.     "H Sleek" adhesive tape is undoubtedly the easiest

and msot effective tape to use when securing venous cannulae and drips in

a hurry.   This was not available.

Again this is probably due to the number of cardiac arrests which was going

on at one time.    We encountered a shortage of basic cardiac arrest drugs such

as Adrenaline, Atropine and Lignocaine.   We very soon exhausted the supplies

available of inject preparations.    As I recall most of the cardiac arrest

drug trays that were opened   only contained one or two vials of Atropine and

Adrenaline.    In the situation that we found ourselves in during the day

Atropine, Adrenaline and Lignocaine were the only drugs which we really needed

in the acute stage of cardio pulmonary resuscitation.



These points are purely those which came to mind in the immediate aftermath

of the disaster.    I make no claims whatsoever   as to their relevance for

future planning and as much as anything this is merely a wayof noting them

before they get forgotton by me.

Dear Ed
Thank you for your letters 15 February and 8 February, I was in
the process of answering your letter on 8 February but it has
taken us some time to get the records out of the patient
involved.
In that record, there is absolutely nothing written and I would
ask if you are absolutely sure that Philip Hammond was the first
victim to arrive at the Northern General Hospital and I wonder
if in fact this was the first victim to arrive. We certainly did
get sinus rhythm back into one young chap who was admitted to
Intensive Care but was subsequently pronounced brain dead some
days after and another who died subsequently on Intensive Care.

Regarding being contacted by West Midlands Police for an official
statement, I know of no reason why you could not have been
contacted and as you know I was careful to ask you to make a
statement at the time and I gave the names of those involved in
my own statement. At all times, I have tried to assist with the
investigations both of the police and of the families and I wish
you well in your efforts.

H illskorougk, and n o t asked for a pokce statem ent, to approack tke fam ily support group.

I skould like to assure you tk a t I kave n o t seen anytking tk a t criticises in any way procedure or tre a tm e n t
of tk e casualties a t tke kospital. T ke tk ing tke fam ikes are pusking for is a review o f tke 'accidental deatk'

attempts.
99... PHILIP STEELE........................................................
              There is no evidence in the medical record nor any evidence from the post
              mortem findings that Mr. Steele received any resuscitation.                                                                                         I think it
              likely that he was triaged                                        as dead.


119.          ARTHUR HORRtXKS......................................................
              There is no evidence in the medical record of any resuscitation attempts
              and there is no evidence in the post mortem findings of any resuscitation
              attempts.                    I therefore think it likely that Mr. Horrocks was triaged as
              dead.


In summary, there is definite evidence both from the hospital records and post
mortem reports that six patients received resuscitation attempts.                                                                                               In a further
three patients there us sorae evidence that the patients may have received some
resuscitation attempts.                                         In four patients there is no evidence of resuscitation
and it is likely that these patients were triaged to the mortuary on arrival
at the Accident and Emergency Department.


I feel it may be helpful to give a brief summary of our experience of traumatic
asphyxia.                   Traumatic asphyxia is a fairly uncommon condition, normally occurring
in sporadic cases, either in car accidents, or heavy iniury.                                                                                          There are a
number of well documented instances where large numbers of people have died
in crowds as a result of traumatic asphyxia.                                                                     Such events are fortunately
rare.                  The Northern General Hospital Accident and Emergency Department
admitted                   fifteen cases of severe traumatic asphyxia within a space of one
hour. on. the _1.5th.April.,, and .this.is. in. addition .to. the. p.a.t.i.e.n.t;g .i^entipped. ab.ove.

            15th June, 1989




            Dear Colleague,

            As you may know, the West Midlands Police are investigating the incident
            at Hillsborough Stadium on the 15th April 1989.     One arm of the investigation
            concerns the Coroner and he is especially interested in the patients who were
            brought to the Accident and Emergency Department of the Northern General
            Hospital and have subsequently died.   I have provided an over used statement
            of the situation but the Coroner would'like much more detail on the
            activities in the Resuscitation Room on that day.   I have therefore provided
            the Police with a list of people involved in the Accident and Emergency
            Department.

            You may therefore be asked for a statement by West Midlands Police.
            There may be difficulties in patient identification but all the available
            information on patients is housed with Mrs.                  Ln the Medical
            Records Office.

            I have contacted the Solicitors acting for the Health Authority in this
            matter and they have advised that if you have any reservations regarding
            these statements, you contact them before speaking to the Police.

            The\Solicitors concerned are Oxley & Coward, address - 275 Glossop Road,
            Sheffield S10 2HB, Telephone No. 727485 and the person dealing with this
            matter is Miss D. Hallatt.


            Yours sincerely,




            J. WARDROPE
            Consultant in Accident and Emergency Medicine.

Some time after 3 pm an ambulance brought        a patient to the department and

mentioned that there was an incident going on at Hillsborough.        They thought

thff*e had been an RTA outside.

Shortly afterwards I was sat in the office when the emergency phone rang.

I don't remember who answered it but the message was that there was a

paediatric cardiac arrest arriving within a few minutes.        No mention is made

where from or that there will be any other casualties or where from.

I bleeped the paediatric SHO.        I asked her to come down and made my way round

to resus with the narses.

The ambulacne arrives and the patient is brought into resus.        I notice that

Ed Walker had walked in before it.       The patient arrived almost immediately

and was greatly cyanosed and had no output.       He was not breathing.   Someone

commenced cardiac massage,     Ed intubated the patient and ventilation

commenced.   In inserted an iv line and gave Atropine      and Adrenaline.   I cannot

remember what else we did.     The    patient regained an output.

Suddenly I am aware that several more patients were being wheeled into resus.

As far as I can remember all the casualties in this initial influx showed no

signs of life.   I have no recollection of exactly where I see myself dealing

with the following patients.      Youlook up and see someone struggling with a

patient, go over try to sort out the airway, tear off the clothes and gain

venous access.   I think Adrena'.ine and Atropine     was given to most of these

 patients.   None had anoutput.      They all seemed to have fixed and dilated

pupils on arrival.   Few of them had any obvious external injuries.

Having commenced the initial resuscitation measures, the attention was caught

by yet another patient requiring resuscitation.       Initially we moved from

patient to patient, doing a few things and then having your attention diverted

to a different new patient.

Ed described this very aptly as a plate spinning act.
I had no real idea of the passage of time initially.        I suspect all this


must have been only 10-15minutes.   I realise that there appeared to be no

other medical staff in the resus rooms apart from Miles, myself and Ed.

I tried to ring switchboard from the phone in resus but could not get an

answer.    I then went to the front desk and asked them to get as many medical

staff as possible down to resus.

Next I was aware that almost all of the patients, who were showing any

signs of life, were fitting.   I am unsure whether these were entirely new

patients brought in fitting, or whether those patients who were responding

from resuscitation were then starting to fit.       The problem of insufficient

medical staff was soon overcome.

The twomain problems then seemed to be congestion in the resus rooms and

a lack of oxygen'and suction points.    This was especially so in the plaster

room .    I assume patients were being pushed into the main resus room through

the clean theatre all the time looking for a resus point.        Plaster room was

just the end of the line, especially once dirty theatre was full.       The wooden

table, without legs, in the plaster room caused quite a hindrance.

Patients were brought in and placed onto this once a decision had been made

to move patients out towards 60        some    time was lost trying to locate an

 empty trolley to place the patients on, and then to manoeuvre it into the

blocked up plaster room adjacent to this bench.

I remember trying to sit up once patient during the afternoon, he was

conscious and breathing spontaneously, with some shortness of breath.

Unfortunately he was positioned the wrong way on the trolley.       It may useful

tomark more obviously the head end of the trolley, I have       known thisproblem

before even in a more controlled situation.

The initial half hour in resus was extremely chaotic.       I feel this was due

to the overwhelming input of casualties with no warning or preparation possible.

All of the staff seemed to be conducting themselves in a calm professional

manner.    There were many frustrations.      Immediately supplies of certain drugs

did become scarce.    I suspect the need for Diazepam outweighed any previous
estimates.       The drug would be asked for and then my attention would be

diverted   to   a further patient   before it became available.     Alternately

on those occasions where it was necessary to go and look for the drugs

yourself, you would return to find somebody else had taken over the

management of the patient (this is not a criticism!).

The most poorly functioning and irritatingpiece of equipment used was the

standard iv cathether.      The need for a separately packaged       bung     to be found

caused many problems.      They are also extremely difficult to securely anchor

in place with tape.      This is so even in the case of the non shocked and non

sweaty patients.       Removing the bung to connect certain infusion, or changing

theinfusion itself can become almost impossible to do with the fingers

especially if they are damp.        The adhesive qualities of the tape available,

which have possibly deteriorated during storage, were not adequate.             I suspect

normal micropore would be better for anchoring iv catheters in situ.

The safe disposal of sharps is hammered into us from a very early age!

The number of sharps used meant an inadequate means of disposal and this

created a real hazard.      I nearly stabbed myself several       times.

Initally at least at first you were forced to drop them on the floor or waste

time in their disposal.      I hope somebody inspected the tops for window and

door frames in the resus rooms, this is where most of mine went.              A supply of

lidless plastic tubs may well have overcome this problem.

After the initialy half hour the Disaster Plan seemed to work excellently.

Once a decision was taken that a patient could be removed from resus, there

always seemed to be nursing and portering staff available to do so immediately.

At one stage after the initial continuous influx of patients had abated, I was

handed a set of blood results for a numbered patient written on a paper towel.

Nobody seemed to know exactly where that patient had gone to.              I do not know

what system of the Disaster Plan advocates the dissemination of results.

Perhaps it would be sensible to collate the information from biochemistry

and haematology in their laboratory suites, it could then be rung through to

one designated phone and recorded onduplicate sheets.         Copies of them could

then be taken to each of the receiving wards.        There was certainly enough
runners available to do this.

After the influx of new casualties had stopped, I was asked to go and

help out in the physiotherapy department where the walking wounded were

to be treated.

Here there were many staff both from Northern General and other local

doctors.   The     medical staff must have outnumbered the patients    by at least

three to one.       We were having no trouble getting x-rays on those patients who

required one.        The only problem that came to light there were    inadequate

x-ray viewing      facilities.   There was a bank of viewing screens   in one of

the offices away from the main treatment area.      However, understandably the

penetration on some of the x-rays was not ideal.      It proved absolutely

impossible even for a senior physiotherapist used to working in the department,

to find a portable lamp with an ordinary domestic bulb in it to view these

x-rays.

One of the most      noticable features was the excellent provision of refreshment

facilities.      The first time that I had an opportunity to have a drink there

was immediately one available.

        Casualty Department at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.                                                                                     At
        approximately 3.27 p.m. that day, the emergency telephone from
        Rotherham Ambulance Headquarters rang and we were informed that there was
        a Paediatric cardiac arrest coming into the Department.                                                                          About 3 minutes
        later the ambulance arrived, bringing a young boy, who looked to be about
        10 or 12 years of age.                                It was at that point that we were told by the
        ambulance drivers who brought him in that a major incident had occurred
        at Hillsborough.                         The boy was taken into the resuscitation room and
        attempts to resuscitate him were made by myself, Dr. Glendening, Dr. Walker,
        Anaesthetist, and one of the Paediatric Doctors.                                                                 No more than 2 minutes
        later a second ambulance arrived, bringing a man looking to be in his late
        20's.          He too was brought into the resuscitation room.                                                                Some 2 minutes
        after the receipt of the second patient, we had another 2 ambulances outside
        bringing patients in.                              I believe that the time now was approximately 3 . 3 5 p.m.
        I find the events of the next 5 minutes very difficult to remember exactly.
        I remember the arrival of several other cyanosed young patients and the
        early arrival of a number of our colleagues who were on-call in the hospital.

        STATEMENT FOR THE HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY
        At around 3.45 p.m. I was told by Mr. Wardrope the Casualty Consultant,
        to go to the ground because there had been a Police request for a medical
        team on site.              I helped to load some of the emergency supply boxes into
        the back of an ambulance and waited for the Anaesthetist
        who had also been directed to come                   to the ground. There was a slight delay
        of a couple of minutes before he was                    able to join us and I would estimate
        that this ambulance left the Department to go to the ground some 7 or 8
        minutes after the directive had been given.                          There were two Ambulancemen
        in the vehicle and two Policemen as v/ell as myself and the Anaesthetist.
        The ambulance went into one of the entrances off to the bottom of
        Herries Road by the Sports Hall at Hillsborough where there was a large
        Police               presence and a great deal of commotion.                 On getting out out of the
        ambulance, myself and the Anaesthetist automatically headed for the pitch
        where we presumed the majority of casualties would be.                              I now know that
        this area of the pitch was the area between the spion cop and the North
        stand.               About 20 yards into the field of play from that corner of the
        pitch, we attempted to resuscitate a male patient who was laid on a board
        with an advertising slogan on it.                    I have already submitted a report
        to the Enquiry regarding this patient.                      Neither myself or the Anaesthetist
        were wearing any identifying clothing, which in the rush to load the
        ambulance with airways and lines, we had omitted to pack.                              Because of this,
         there was an element of delay in trying to ask where any further seriously
         ill patients were.              I think if we had been identifiable, we could have
         been directed by the Police to the casualties needing attention most.
         At this point, I got separated from the Anaesthetist who I did not see
            for the rest of my stay down at Hillsborough.                         I went around a number
         of patients who were lying on the pitch.                        It was diflicult to tell at
            a glance, the nature of the majority of injuries whether people were
            seriously hurt or not.            After attending perhaps another 15 or 20
            individuals, I found no one who was in need of urgent medical attention.
            I was not able to tell where the crush had been and at this point, I
            went to one of the Senior Police Officers on the pitch and explaining who
            I was, asked if he could tell me where any of the serious casualties were

        and he directed me through to the Sports Hall.                          The Sports Hall was being
        used as both the mortuary and a resuscitation room half and half, and as
        I went along the line of some 15 casualties requiring attention.                           It was
        obvious that almost everyone of the them was being attended to by a
        Doctor who had been in the ground, either General Practitioners or
        Hospital Doctors.         Two of them I recognised.                 The ambulance crew that
        we had come down to the ground with, had already taken the majority
        of medical supplies into the Sports Hall and by the time I had got into
        the gymnasium, a number of intravenous lines had been sited and a central
        pool of drugs and equipment had been established in the middle of the floor.
        I examined about 6 casualties who were not being attended to.                           One male
        patient was unresponsive to verbal questioning.                           His eyes were staring
        straight in front of him.             His pupils were equally responsive to light.
        His pulse was weak and I checked his blood pressure which was satisfactory.
        He had air entry to both bases of his lungs but on inspection of the
        back of the rib cage, he appeared to have a small flail segment.                           I borrowed
        a biro off one of the Policeman and wrote flail on his flank, inserted an
        i.v. line and asked one of the Ambulancemen if he could be moved as a
        priority from the Sports Hall, if possible maintaining a recovery position
        he was in.         I now know that this patient carne to the Northern General
        Hospital.         There were a lot of people down at the ground who, whilst not
        requiring immediate resuscitation, appeared quite dazed and confused.
        Seeing as there was now a plentiful supply of Doctors having a good
        supply      of   equipment,   I   decided      that I would be better off back in the
        Casualty Department.          Ambulances now appeared to be going to the
        Hallamshire and I approached one of the Senior Police Officers who
        arranged a lift back to the Department for me.                          I would estimate that
        I arrived back at the Casualty Department at the Northern General Hospital
        at approximately 4.30 p.m.             The resuscitation rooms were, at this time,
        filled to capacity.           I saw that each patient had at least two Doctors
        attending them and I reported back to Mr. Wardrope who directed me to go
        back to the main Department and the cubicles there were a number of
        casualties not requiring immediate resuscitation had been sent.                           1

        quickly as possible to either ward admission, or if I considered their
        injuries to be minor, to direct them to the Physiotherapy Department
        at the Hospital where I understood there to be a number of General
        Practitioners who were dealing with the less seriously injured patients
        who, it was intended, would be discharged.                      The majority of patients I
        saw were ones who had been in the ground and who had been crushed and had
        suffered a degree of asphyxiation.                It is difficult to remember individual
        cases.          The majority of them were in a degree of discomfort'on inspiration.
        A significant number of them appeared to be under the influence of
        alcohol, though I could only say that one or two of them were intoxicated.
        I remained in the main part of the Casualty Department for perhaps
        90 minutes after returning from Hillsborough.                         By this time, we had no
        more minor injuries left in the Department.                        Although notparticipating
        in any further emergency resuscitation of patients after returning from
        Hillsborough, I felt happy that the more senior staff who had arrived
        in the Department were dealing with this aspect of patient care and that
        my time could best be served by trying to keep the rest of the Department
        clear in anticipation of any further casualties and of those walking
        wounded, who we all felt sure would be coming in to fill the Department.
        As it happened, we did not see much minor trauma at all.

         of patients who were lying on the pitch.                       It was difficult to tell at
            a glance, the nature of the majority of injuries whether people were
            seriously hurt or not.            After attending perhaps another 15 or 20
            individuals, 1 found no one who was in need of urgent medical attention.
        ■I was not able to tell where the crush had been and at this point, I
            went to one of the Senior Police Officers on the pitch and explaining who
            I was, asked if he could tell me where any of the serious casualties were

        and he directed me through to the Sports Hall.                            The Sports Hall was being
        used as both the mortuary and a resuscitation room half and half, and as
        I went along uie line of some 15 casualties requiring attention.                             It was
        obvious that almost everyone of the them was being attended to by a
        Doctor who had been in the ground, either General Practitioners or
        Hospital Doctors.                 Two of them I recognised.           The ambulance crew that
        we had come down to the ground with, had already taken the majority
        of medical supplies into the Sports Hall and by the time I had got into
        the gymnasium, a number of intravenous lines had been sited and a central
        pool of drugs and equipment had been established in the middle of the floor.
        I examined about 6 casualties who were not being attended to.                             One male
        patient was unresponsive to verbal questioning.                             His eyes were staring
        straight in front of him.                  His pupils were equally responsive to light.
        His pulse was weak and I checked his blood pressure which was satisfactory.
        He had air entry to both bases of his lungs but on inspection of the
        back of the rib cage, he appeared to have a small flail segment.                             I borrowed
        a biro off one of the Policeman and wrote flail on his flank, inserted an
        i.v. line and asked one of the Ambulancemen if he could be moved as a
        priority from the Sports Hall, if possible maintaining a recovery position
        he was in.                 I now know that this patient came to the Northern General
        Hospital.                 There were a lot of people down at the ground who, whilst not
        requiring immediate resuscitation, appeared quite dazed and confused.
        Seeing as there was now a plentiful supply of Doctors having a good
        supply              of   equipment,   I decided that I would be better off back in the
        Casualty Department.                  Ambulances now appeared to be going to the
        Hallamshire and I approached one of the Senior Police Officers who
        arranged a lift back to the Department for me.                            I would estimate that
        I arrived back at the Casualty Department at the Northern General Hospital
        at approximately 4.30 p.m.                  The resuscitation rooms were, at this time,
        filled to capacity.                   I saw that each patient had at least two Doctors
        attending them and I reported back to Mr. Wardrope who directed me to go
        back to the main Department and the cubicles there were a number of
        casualties not requiring immediate resuscitation had been sent.                             I
        understood my role here to be to assess and re-direct patients as

        quickly as possible to either ward admission, or if I considered their
        injuries to be minor, to direct them to the Physiotherapy Department
        at the Hospital where I understood there to be a number of General
        Practitioners who were dealing with the less seriously injured patients
        who, it was intended, would be discharged.                     The majority of patients I
        saw were ones who had been in the ground and who had been crushed and had
        suffered a degree of asphyxiation.              It is difficult to remember individual
        cases.      The majority of them were in a degree of discomfort on inspiration.
        A significant number of them appeared to be under the influence of
        alcohol, though I could only say that one or two of them were intoxicated.
        I remained in the main part of the Casualty Department for perhaps
        90 minutes after returning from Hillsborough.                         By this time, we had no
        more minor injuries left in the Department.                       Although notparticipating
        in any further emergency resuscitation of patients after returning from
        Hillsborough, I felt happy that the more senior staff who had arrived
        in the Department were dealing with this aspect of patient care and that
        my time could best be served by trying to keep the rest of the Department
        clear in anticipation of any further casualties and of those walking
        wounded, who we all felt sure would be coming in to fill the Department.
        As it happened, we did not see much minor trauma at all.

Saturday 1 5 th April, 1989

This was a sunny Spring-like day.    At approximately 1.00 p .m. I
telephoned the department.    I spoke to Charge N u r s e ! k n d he told
me that the department was fairly busy with approximately a two hour
waiting time, but all was well otherwise.     I informed Mr.         ;hat
I was going out on my long range bleep.

I was returning from the park with my children and wife when the long
range bleep went off.   v/e were approximately two hundred yards from
home and it took me a further minute to get home and then call the
hospital.    I spoke to Charge Nurse        tfho informed me that they
had been notified that there had been some form of incident at
Hillsborough and we were to stand by to expect some crush injuries.
There was no indication of numbers and there was no indication that
this was a major accident.

I therefore immediately left home.   xhe time on my car clock was, I
think, 3.25p.m. (I have subsequently checked the car clock and it is
two minutes ahead of the exact time i.e., the time would have been
about 3 .23p.m.)

The roads were clear and I arrived at the Northern General Hospital
at 3.35p.m. I met Charge Nurse)______ fit the door who informed me that
he already had three patients undergoing resuscitation - the first three
were less seriously injured.    I asked him if he had implemented the
Major Disaster Plan.   He answered "Yes”.     I therefore went into the
Resuscitation Room.   There were three patients, one was a young child
being resuscitated by the Paediatric Senior House Officer and another
being attended to by Dr. Walker, an Anaesthetic Senior House Officer
from Rotherham and a further patient being attended by one of the
Accident and Emergency Senior House Officers.     The other Senior House
Officer was clearing the department of its normal Saturday afternoon
patients.    Just about then, a large number of ambulances arrived with
severely injured patients.   I began triaging.     Many of them were
not breathing and no output, but in view of their youth and the fact
that they were suffering from severe hypoxia, I elected to triage
these to resuscitation, rather than to the Plaster Room.    However,
there were no Doctors in Resuscitation at that time so I had to intubate
some patients myself and leave these in the care of staff while I went
back to the Triage Point.

More and more patients were arriving, most of them requiring resuscitation
facilities.    At about 3.45p.m. large numbers of Doctors were arriving
and I felt that the Resuscitation Area was becoming adequately staffed,
although large numbers of patients were still arriving.    Patients who
were moving around and localizing with adequate pulses and no obviously
respiratory distress were triaged to Ward 60, since there were large
numbers of unconscious patients requiring immediate resuscitation.

At around this time the Triage Point was set up properly to ensure
adequate documentation.

After around 3.50p.m. I received a request for a mobile team to go to
the ground.   At this time I felt that although large numbers of staff
were arriving I was aware that there was still a shortage of staff on
Ward 60 and that some of the patients that I had sent would probably need
fairly urgent re-assessment and perhaps operation, since they were
complaining of crush injuries to the pelvis and to the chest.   I therefore
did not feel in a position to release medical staff to the ground at that
time.
                            -   2 -

At about the same time it was obvious that the department was becoming
swamped with severely ill patients.     I asked the Ambulance Liaison to
divert patients to the Hallamshire Hospital.    I also asked ambulancemen
coming in with patients to radio Control and ask them to divert ambulances
to the Hallamshire.      About a minute later I was told that the Hallamshire
was receiving fifty per cent of the patients already.     My heart sank as
I realised that if we were only receiving half of the serious casualties
then this was a disaster of an enormous scale.

At this time, less seriously injure dpatients were beginning to arrive and
these were triaged to Physiotherapy. At about 4.00p.m. there were large
numbers of Doctors arriving and I therefore despatched Dr. Miles Davidson,
Senior House Officer in the Accident and Emergency Department and an
Anaesthetic Registrar to the ground.     ^he Anaesthetic Registrar took
some convincing to go, since he was on for Labour Ward and felt his
time and responsibility was for that ward.     They took down our boxes
of intravenous fluids, dressings, airway care apparatus, which are kept
on permanent stand by.

After around 3.50p.m. most of the Resuscitation Points were full and the
crews were still bring in patients, many of them young - no pulse, no
breathing and fixed dilated pupils.    I had to triage these patients to
the Plaster Room. Probably three or four patients were triaged dead.
At this time I also asked the Senior Surgical Registrar to go through
the Resuscitation Room and to pronounce dead those patients who had had
initial resuscitation and who were not responding.

After around 4.00p.m. I asked Dr. Daw   Senior House Officer in Medicine
to go to the Plaster Room to check that the patients we were sending
there were dead.

By about 4.00p.m. the situation was becoming under control and even so,
the department was very busy.    There was certainly about fourteen
patients undergoing resuscitation and I was sending patients to the
Accident and Emergency cubicle, since all our acute Resuscitation Points
had been used.    By about j5L15P large numbers of staff were arriving,
along with walking wounded and conscious patients on stretchers with
lower limb crush injuries.

From about 4.30p.m. fewer patients were coming in. At approximately
4.45p.m. one patient was brought in by ambulance.   He had been carrying
dead bodies and had collapsed.     When brought in he had dilated pupils,
breathing slowly with a bradycardia.    From the history, it seemed like
a vaso vagal attack.

A sunny day, spring-like, just returning from a visit to the park with

the children when approximately 200 yards notified by C/N                that he

had been notified of an incident at Hillsborough and we were to expect

some crush injuries, unsure of numbers.     No Major Incident at this point.

Immediately went to the Northern General Hospital.         The roads were

clear arriving there at 3.35 pm.     C/N          had already three patients

already in situ attempting resuscitation by Paediatric Registrar and

Anaesthetic SHO from Rotherham, who happened to be passing.            Almost

immediately large numbers of ambulances arriving with severely injured

patients, most not breathing, with dilated pupils, directed to Resus -

no doctors in REsus.      Triage to Resus, - no     octors in resus.

ET tubes passed left to nurses returned to Triage.        More patients

arriving, by this time anaesthetic help beginning to arrive.           Again

more patients, - triage to resus point.      By now almost all resus points

were filled including resus in clean theatre, anaestheticroom, plaster

room and dirty theatre.

Less severe injuries beginning to arrive - one young girl irritable but

moving around.   Seemed all right.     Triage to ward 60.      At this point

another batch of patients arriving having had CPR in the ambulance but

no response, all resus points filled, Triage - dead to Plaster Room.

Probably three or four patients like this.

By now much more staff arriving, many less severe injured patients with

a lot of lower symptoms but chest and head OK, fully conscious - Triage to

ward 60.    Walking wounded Triage to Physiotherapy.

At this point Ambulance Control notified to direct patients to the Hallamshire

Hospital.   This must have been around k pm.       By this time the situation was

very much in full swing.     Large numbers of doctors and nurses, portering staff

absolutely marvellous.      The patients were moved quickly from the triage area

to allotted sites.     By now radiologists were arriving A.15 to A.30, now

arriving with conscious, walking wounded type emergencies.

Physiotherapy.    Unfortunately at 5 pm one unconscious patient brought

in seemingly had walked from the ground and collapsed, was sitting up

about 45° in ambulance, slow pulse, diagnosis vaso vagal attack.

Triage to Resus in view of clinical state recovered very quickly,

confirming diagnosis.       By about 5 pm and 5.15 pm the department was

almost clear, three patients left.      One who had been in asystolic arrest

for approxiamtely 40 mins inspite of intensive resuscitation.

One obviously with early cerebral oedema      and            ....           response

with a cardiac arrest - successfully resucition and sent to ITC.

Approximately 6 pm and the department now quiet.

Large number of colleagues come in offering support.       Of great note were

the anaesthetic staff, of course the nursing staff.       Frank Ryan was of

immeasurable help in advising     for treatment of cerebral oedema.        Now

the first lot of patients being transferred across the Royal Hallamshire

Now about 6.30 pm - liaison with Unit Administrator regarding numbers of

patients and numbers for possible transfer to the RHH.       Decision made to

keep the department open.

Inevitable Press Conference - some blood silly questions !       Lots of

Some               need counselling in depth.       I suspect              will

Report on the Hillsborough Major Incident for Mr J Wardrope

On the 15th April 1989 I was on duty with John Glendeningin the A & E

Department.      We had b een on duty from 9.00 am that morning.      It had been

a busy morning and I would have estimated that patients coming into to the

department at 3.00 pm could have, anticipated a 2 \ hour waiting time before

being seen.

At about 2.30 pm Charge Nurse           had suggested to me that if the work got

any greater then we should consider calling in Mr Wardrope and we had

decided to wait and see if any of the minor injuries could be sorted out

quickly.     At what I would estimate to be about 3.15 pm Charge Nurse told me

than at ambulance driver bringing a patient into the department had reportedly

heard on the ambulance radio that there had been an incident at Hillsborough

and there were some casualties, although at that time it was not know how

many.   There had also been an RTA.

I continued seeing the patient I was with.      I remembering John Glendening

answering the phone some minutes later and asking if anybody had bleeped

Mr Wardrope who was on the line.      I then overheard Charge Nurse          Lnforming

Mr Wardrope that reputedly there was an incident at Hillsborough and overheard

that Mr Wardrope would be coming in.

About two minutes later the emergency phone rang in the sister's        officer and

we were informed that     there was a paediatric cardiac arrest coming in to the

department.    At this point I walked through to the Resus room to remind myself

of the paediatric doses for cardiac arrest and waited for the arrival of the

ambulance.

About three minutes later the ambulance arrived bringing a young boy who looked

to be about 10 or 12 years of age.     A minute before the ambulance had arrived

I noted the presence of both the Paediatric SHO on call and one of the on call

anaesthetists.

The boy was taken to the far bed.in the first resus room and initial resuscitation

was commenced.    He was intubated by the anaesthetist.     At the time both myself
and John Glendening were with him along with the Paediatric SHO.

No more than two minutes later a second ambulance arrived and another casualty

was brought into the resus room and I moved over to work on him.    I cannot

remember much about the details of this patient but on talking to the

ambulance men who had brought the boy in it was becoming apparent that there

had been a crush at Hillsborough and that more casualties could be expected.

Some twominutes after receipt of the second patient we had another two

ambulances outside bringing patients in.   It   was at this point that I noted

the presence of Mr Wardrope in the department. I believe    that the time

now was approximately 3.35 pm.    It was also atthis time   that I understood

that the Major Disaster Plan had gone into operation.

The next five minutes and the events of, that period are difficult to

remember exactly.   I remember the arrival of several other cyanosed young

patients, who were placed in clean theatre and intubated by the anaesthetist.

Even at this point there did not appear to be a lack of trained medical

staff with the early arrival a number of our colleagues who were on call in

various disciplines.    After seeing that the new arrivals were receiving

medical attention I moved back into the entrance foyer of the department

where I was told by Mr Wardrope to go to the ground because there had been

a police request for a medical team on site.    I helped load some of the

emergency supply boxes into the back of an ambulance and waited for the

anaesthetist SHO who had also been directed to come to the ground to join,

us.   There was a slight delay of a couple of minutes before he joined us

and I would estimate that this ambulance left the department to go to the

ground some seven or eight minutes after the directive had been given.

There were two ambulance in this vehicle and two policemen, as well as

myself and the anaesthetic SHO.

The ambulance went into the entrance opposite the bottom of Herries Road

by the Sports Hall at Hillsborough where there was a large police presence

and a great deal of commotion.

I and the SHO carrying one of the orange resuscitation cases and a bag and

                                     2
mask pack with airways, proceded onto the pitch where we assumed the

majority of casualities would be.    About 20 yards into the field of play

from that corner of the pitch there was a male patient who looked to be

in his late twenties laid on a board with an advertising slogan on it who

appeared to be being resuscitated by some of his friends.    He had apnoeic,

had no major pulses and his pupils appeared fixed and dilated.      One of the

lads who was trying to revive him obviously had some medical knowledge

saying that he had carotid or femoral pulse.     In retrospect I wondered if

any resuscitation attempts on this patient were warranted, and my worries

at the time were those of perhaps missing a patient who wasn't in quite as

dire a state who might have been close by.     The anaesthetist intubated

the patient and I put in an iv. line into what was a well filled vein in the

anti cubital fossa which gave me a little hope that the patientmight have

had some form of output.   I remember wishing that I could have an ECG

tracing on him to go on.   At that point twoambulance officers arrived to

take the patient to the ambulance.   I gave him a bolus dose of Adrenaline.

Advised that CPR needed to be continued and moved on to try and find another

patient.

Neither myself or the anaesthetist   were wearing anyidentifying clothing

which in the rush toload the ambulance with airways and lines etc we had

omitted to pack.   Because of this there was an element of delay in trying

to ask where any further seriously ill patients were.    I think if we had

been identifiable we would have been directed by the police to the

casualties needing attention most.     At this point I got separated from the

anaesthetist who I did not see for    the rest of my stay down at Hillsborough.

I went around a number of patients    whowere lying on the pitch.    It was

difficult to tell at a glance the nature of the majority of injuries -

whether people were seriously hurt or not and after attending perhaps another

15 or 20 individuals I found no one who was in need of urgentmedical attention.

At this point I went to one of the senior officers on the pitch and explaining
who I was , asked if he could tell me where any of the serious casualties

were and he directed me through towards the Sports Hall.

The Sports Hall had been divided into two halves and on going     through the

entrance   the first half was covered in bodies of some fifty individuals.

It must have been now about an hour after the first bodies were brought

 out of the crowd.    Along the left hand wall of the gymnasium and at the

far end there were perhaps another fifteen casualties, none of them were

receiving CPR and as I went along the line of patients it was obvious

almost every casualty was being attended to by a doctor who had been in the

crowd, either GPs or hospital doctors.     Two of whom I recognised.

On arrival at the ground the ambulance crew had taken the majority of

medical supplies into the Sports Hall and by the time I got into the Sports

Hall a number of vent... had been sited and a central pool of drugs and

equipment had been established in the middle of the floor.

I examined about six casualties who were not being attended.     Four of these

appeared to be quite well and were responsive, breathing spontaneously, not

cyanosed and having a good pulse.     One male patient was lying in    a recovery

position and was unresponsive to verbal questioning.     His eyes were staring

straight in front of him but his pupils were equally responsive to light.

His pulse was weak and I checked his blood pressure which was 130/90.       He

had air entry to both bases of his lungs but on inspection of the back of

rib cage he had an obvious small flail segment.     I borrowed a biro off one

of the policeman and wrote 'flail' on his flank, inserted an iv line and

asked one of the ambulancemen if he could be moved as a priority from the

Sports Hall, if possible maintaining the recovery position he was in.

I believe by this time ambulances were being directed to the Royal Hallamshire.

A lot of the patients who were not requiring immediate resuscitation appeared

dazed and confused.    Seeing as there appeared to be a plentiful supplyof

doctors now having a good supply.6f :equipment, I decided that I would be

better off in the A & E Department.      Ambulances now appeared to be going

to the Hallamshire and I approached one of the senior police officers who
arranged a lift back up to the department for me.

On arrival back in the Casualty Department, which I would estimate to be about

A.30 pm, the resuscitation room, clean theatre, plaster theatre, dirty

theatre and two of the ambulance cubicles in the main department contained

patients being resuscitated.    Each patient had at least two doctors attending

them.   I reported back to Mr Wardrope who directed me to go back to the main

department where a number of casualities not requiring immediate resuscitation

had been sent.

My understanding of the system of process of the patients through casualty,

at that time, was that as casualties came through the door they were

being assessed by Mr Wardrope as to whether they required immediate

resuscitation or not or whether they were dead.

Many patients being declared dead in the resuscitation areawere being

transferred round to the plaster room in the orthopaedic out patients.

Patients no requiring immediate resuscitation were being round to the main

rooms in the department where I understood my role to be, to assess these

patients and direct them as quickly as possible to either ward admission, with

whatever low priority investigations I deemed necessary, or if I considered

their injuries to be minor to direct them to the Physiotherapy Department where

I understood there to be a number of GPs and house officers who were dealing

with the less seriously injured patients who it was intended would be

discharged.

The majority of patients I saw were ones who had been in the crowd and

who had been crushed and had suffered a degree of a asphyxiation.     The

majority of them were in a degree of discomfort on inspiration.     Two of the

patients were normally asthma sufferers and were in bronchspasm following the

asphyyxiation and these were given nebulisers in the department.

I understood that the wards on take for those patients to be admitted but not

requiring immediate resuscitation were 60, 65 and 66 and admitted patients

to those wards in that order.    Apart from a gentleman who I believe had been

at the match who appeared to be about 70 years of age and clinically had a

                                     5
fractured neck of femur, in view of the workload being undertaken by the

radiographers at that time I decided that he needed admission primarily and

x-rays later and   rang to the orthopaedic wards, which were full.

I therefore rang   one of the geriatric wards and spoke to a sister who agreed

to accept the patient to where he was discharged, I noted on leaving the

department that the patient was actually 63 andnot 70, but I was     happy that

 at least he had   left the department andwas going to   a ward that couldshare

the workload of new admsisions.

On assessing the crush injuries patients were discharged from the department

to the ward after ascertaining that they had a good pulse, blood pressure,

responsiveness and had air entry to both lung bases.     Of the patients which

I saw all fulfilled these criteria but in early for an early pneumothorax or

broken ribs to be excluded, I decided that they needed to be admitted for

later x-rays.

I remained in the main part of the Casualty department attempting to keep

it clear by passing patients onto the GPs in Physio or by getting patients

the ward for perhaps 90 minutes after returning from Hillsborough.     By this

time we had no more minor injuries left in the department and had only a

young man who was being attended to by an anaesthetist and two other doctors

in one of the cubicles.   Although no participating in any further emergency

resuscitation of patients, after returning from Hillsborough, I felt happy

that the more senior staff who had arrived in the department were dealing

with this aspect of patient care and that my time could best be served by

trying to keep the rest of the department clear in anticipation of any further

casualities and of those walking wounded who we all felt sure would be coming

to fill the department.   As it happened we did not see much minor trauma at all.

                         AMBULANCE SERVICE O PERA TIO NA L ARRANGEMENTS

                                           AMBULANCE CONTROL


IN IT IA L CALL

1.    Although the initial call will frequently come from one of the emergency services it may come from any
source and it may not, therefore, always be clear to ambulance control whether the incident is one of major
proportions. Therefore ambulance crews should have standing instructions to report back to control
immediately whenever they consider that an incident, to which they have been sent in the ordinary way, could
be a major accident.

IN IT IA T IO N OF MAJOR A CC ID EN T PLAN

2.    As soon as reports indicate that a major accident may have occurred (the number of casualties may not
be easily determined at the outset) the senior officer on duty should initiate the major accident plan. It may
be better to bring the major accident plan into operation too early and possibly unnecessarily rather than to
delay doing so with consequent risks to the injured. The plan should indicate the initial action to be taken by
ambulance control, by the first ambulance crew at the site, the role of each senior officer and the extent to
which those senior officers not on duty are to be called out.

A LE R TIN G PROCEDURES

3.      Because major accidents and local circumstances vary, controllers must always be ready to use their
initiative and to meet the unexpected. Action likely to be needed initially at control and which ambulance
plans should cover includes

      i.    despatching a number of ambulances and sitting case vehicles in the light of information received

      ii.   radio communications - immediate utilization of the Emergency Reserve Channel (

     iii.  notifying police and fire services that the major accident plan has been put into operation and
     giving them essential information about the location and nature of the accident

     iv.   selecting from the RHA's list o f hospitals suitable to receive casualties, the hospital (the designated
     hospital) most appropriate in the circumstances of the accident to receive the initial flow of casualties
     and a second hospital (a supporting hospital) to act in support of the first. Both hospitals should be
     informed immediately by telephone to the main switchboard (not to the A & E Department) using the
     words "(                                   |. This phrase should only be used to initiate the major accident
     procedures. The use of code words and/or special telephone numbers is a matter for local decision.
     Where the information received by control Is-so imprecise that the implementation of the major accident
     procedure is not immediately justified, it may be appropriate for the hospitals to be given advanced
     warning via the main switchboard of the possibility of a major accident

     v.     despatching a senior officer with mobile radio to act as "Ambulance Incident Officer" at the site

     vi.   requesting the attendance of a mobile medical and nursing team where the intial reports suggest
     that this is desirable and providing transport for the team if necessary (the Site Medical Officer will be
     despatched by the appropriate hospital as part of the standard procedure for major accidents)

     vii.   despatching the ambulance mobile control to the site

     viii. despatching an equipment vehicle to the site

     ix. despatching officers with mobile radios to act asAmbulance              Liaison Officers at the designated
     hospital, and at other hospitals expected to receive casualties

     x.     alerting neighbouring ambulance services

     xi.    checking the bed states at the designated and supporting hospitals

James Wardrope will say as follows



I am a Consultant in charge of the Accident      &   Emergency

Department at the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.          I

have been a Consultant at the hospital since 1 May 1987;

prior to that I held the post of Senior Registrar at the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital,     Sheffield.   I qualified in

                        in 19    and my qualifications are




The Accident & Emergency Department is quite a busy one.             It

had 55,000 patients last year, of which 42,000 were new

patients.      In terms of medical staffing, there are seven

Senior House Officers, an Associate Specialist (six sessions

A   &   E, four sessions Fracture Clinic) and five GP Clinical

Assistant sessions.      I am the first on call, except every

other weekend when one of the Orthopaedic Consultants takes

the on call duty.



Saturday is usually a busy day for the Department,       especially

in the afternoon.     On Saturday,   15 April there were two

medical staff, of SHO grade, on duty and I was on call.          I

had been into the Department at 10.00 am on the morning of

the 15th.     The Department was fairly busy.   At about 1.00 pm

I telephoned the Department from home to let them know I was

going to be out for the afternoon as I planned to take my
family to the park.     I ascertained the waiting time in the

Department was two hours, which means it was quite busy.              I

took my wife and children to Graves Park.     We were just

returning, and were about 200 yards from our home in

Crosspool, when my bleep which I had been carrying went off.

I arrived home within about a minute and telephoned the

hospital immediately.    I spoke to Charge Nurse :          who

indicated he had been notified of some sort of incident at

Hillsborough and that the hospital was to stand by and to

expect to receive some crush injuries.     He gave no indication

of numbers or that a major incident had been called.        He

indicated that no patients had yet arrived and from the

details he gave me I thought perhaps the hospital would

receive half a dozen or so.    I knew the Department was fairly

busy and I decided I should go in to help out, but I did not

think it was a major emergency.



I immediately left for the hospital in my car.     The time on

the car clock, which is two minutes fast, was 3.25 pm.           The

journey was very quick as the roads were quiet and I arrived

at the hospital at 3.35 pm, according to the car clock.           I

parked my car in the Consultants' car park.     I started

walking towards the Department, but as I approached the

entrance I saw three ambulances and I began to run.     I was

met at the door by Charge Nurse          who informed me three

patients were undergoing resuscitation in the Resuscitation

Room which is adjacent to the side entrance.     I asked him

whether he had implemented the Major Disaster Plan and he
replied he had.   It was obvious to me that it was necessary

to implement the Major Disaster Plan.



I went into the Resuscitation Room where there were three

patients undergoing resuscitation.    One was a ten year old

boy who was being attended by the Senior Paediatric House

Officer.   I gather she had been called when the Department

were alerted to expect a paediatric cardiac arrest.       A Senior

House Officer from Rotherham, who had just been passing the

hospital, was resuscitating another patient and one of my

SHOs was working on the third patient.    I could see the staff

were having trouble getting intravenous access on the child

so I assisted with that.



More ambulances arrived almost immediately.    I went to the

front door with Charge Nurse         to receive the injured,

almost all of whom were dead or dying.    Some were sent to the

Resuscitation Room and I then went to the Resuscitation Room

myself to intubate with endotracheal tubes.    I cannot now

recall how many patients were in that batch of arrivals.



I then returned to the entrance and stayed there until about

5.00 pm, to triage patients as they arrived, and also to

triage Doctors so that they could be assigned to appropriate

duties.



By about 3.45 pm a lot of staff had arrived in the Department

and the Resuscitation Room was fairly well manned.    I
allocated Doctors to the Resuscitation Room initially, and

then into Ward 60 which had been cleared and which was acting

as the receiving ward.



I realised the Resuscitation Room was becoming very full as

almost all the first lot of casualties required resuscitation

and I therefore sent one of the SHOs, Mr Duncan, to telephone

SYMAS Control and request cases be diverted to the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital.



By this time Medical Records staff had implemented the

tagging system to identify the casualties.      Because of the

volume of patients arriving staff were unable to use the

coloured labels.



At about this time I started sending the dead on arrival

direct to the Plaster Room.    Previously,   I had sent the whole

batch of casualties,    including dead, into the Resuscitation

Room to attempt resuscitation in view of their age.



Also about this time, I received a request to send a mobile

team to the Hillsborough football ground.      The request came

via                            .   I realised everyone was very

busy and that we could not spare sufficient staff to send a

mobile team immediately and I decided it was more important

to retain the resources within the Department.     However, by

about 4.00 pm the position had eased such that I was able to

despatch two Doctors with an equipment box, in an ambulance,
to the football ground.     The staff who went were

Dr Davidson, SHO, and an Anaesthetic Registrar.       The

Department has a specially prepared box of equipment for just

such an emergency and this had been checked and re-stocked

only two weeks earlier.     As it transpired, when the mobile

team arrived at the ground there were sufficient medical

staff already there and the Doctors were sent back to the

hospital and only the equipment retained.



By about this time I think I was notified the Royal

Hallamshire Hospital were receiving about half the

casualties.



After 4.00 pm the situation became more controlled and less

serious injuries were arriving in the Department.      These were

sent to the Physiotherapy Department which had been cleared
                                                 <

to receive non-urgent casualties requiring minor treatment or

rest or awaiting transport home.    By about 4.30 pm the

Department was becoming much quieter.    I asked Dr R Elson,

Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, and Dr D Edwards, Orthopaedic

Registrar, to attend the non-urgent casualties in the

Physiotherapy Department.



Dr Tim Shaw, Consultant Anaesthetist, was in charge of the

Resuscitation Room.



The last patient I remember receiving arrived at about 4.45

pm.   He had fainted from the exertion of carrying bodies out
of the ground.



At the time I did not know how many patients the Department

had received, although I knew at one point that about sixteen

patients were all undergoing resuscitation.      The Department

is set up for ten resuscitation patients and all the beds

were being used.



The triage area was established near the side entrance to the

A & E Department.   In a major disaster the main entrance is

closed and all casualties are brought into the side entrance

and thus through the triage point.    The Resuscitation Room is

immediately adjacent to the triage area in room 23 and beyond

that rooms 18 (Treatment),   16 (Anteroom),   14 (Plaster Room),

15 (Treatment Room), 57, 58 and 61 (Examination/Treatment

Rooms) and cubicles were used.   Any casualties who did not

require resuscitation were sent to the receiving ward, ward

60, or, if they were minor casualties, to the Physiotherapy

Department.   Only one patient required surgery - a

laporotomy.   Almost all the resuscitation patients required

intensive care and therefore were transferred from the

resuscitation areas to either the General Intensive Treatment

Unit or the Coronary Intensive Care Unit.



In the initial ten minutes the Department was overwhelmed by

the volume of patients requiring resuscitation.     I think this

is due to three factors, namely the speed of extraction of

casualties from the site, the speed of transportation to the
hospital in view of its proximity to the football ground, and

the nature of the injuries.



I do not recall any desperate need of equipment.     I believe

at one time we ran out of oxygen flow meters, but these were

provided very quickly by the Supplies Department.     The

hospital does not have a CT scanner and one of the

ventilated casualties required a CT scan during the

afternoon.    He was transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.    A further two patients were transferred during the

evening and four patients were transferred during the night

to the Royal Hallamshire Hospital for CT scans.



By about 5.30 pm the Department was almost clear of

casualties.



Non-urgent casualties were directed to the General and

Maternity Wing Physiotherapy Department.    The dead were

transferred to the mortuary which had been set up temporarily

in the Orthopaedic Plaster Room.   The bodies were later

transferred to the temporary mortuary which was established

at the football ground.



The Major Disaster Plan provides for patients to be labelled

with appropriately coloured labels once they have been triaged,

so that, for example, those requiring immediate resuscitation

should receive a red label, those requiring urgent admission

and surgery should receive a blue label, non-urgent a green
label and dead a white label.     In fact, because of the speed

of arrival of the casualties in the first twenty minutes,          it

was impossible for staff to use the coloured labels.        This

did not make any material difference as staff were writing on

to the labels the patients' destination,    once triaged.



I only had contact with the families of the patients later in

the evening.   I recall I was in the Control Room when one

woman arrived trying to find her husband and daughter.        I

recall speaking to her and telling her that her husband had

survived but that her daughter was dead.     The families

appeared to be well marshalled on Level C, which is the floor

below the A & E Department.     I was not too conscious of the

presence of the press and media.     I think there were some

press outside the A & E Department but they seemed to keep

well back from the arrival area.     By the following morning I

was able to calculate that ninety-three patients had been

through the Department, of whom fifty-five were admissions,

twenty-seven discharges and twelve dead.     Of the admissions

fifteen were in intensive care, although by the following

morning (Monday) that figure had dropped to eleven.     Seven

patients had been transferred to the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital.



The type of injury sustained by the casualties - traumatic

asphyxia - is fairly uncommon.     In the two years I have worked

at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital I have seen only one such

case.   The most common cause of this type of crush injury is
from a car falling on top of someone who is working beneath

it.   The Department had approximately twenty-five to thirty

traumatic asphyxia cases in the space of an hour and I

believe handled the incident extremely well.

Page b   2nd Paragraph. "I therefore requested the Ambulance Liaison Officer to
          divert cases to the Hallaashire. I believe that Mr. Duncan, Senior
          Registrar in Surgery also telephoned SYMAS at that time with the same
          request*   At about this time I started sending patients arriving with
          no cardiac outppt direct to the Plaster Room (Mortuary).    Up to that
          point patients with no cardiac output who were having active cardio
          pulmonary resuscitation in the ambulance were sent to the Resuscitation
          Room to continue resuscitation, in view of their age and the nature
          of the injury.

         Also about this time I received a request to send a mobile team to
         Hillsborough Football Ground.   The request came to me by word of mouth
         but I believe that the call originated over the direct line to the
         Accident and Emergency Department from SYMAS Headquarters.    At that
         time there was a large number of seriously ill patients in the department
         with not sufficient medical staff.    However, very quickly more staff
         arrived and 1 was able to despatch two Doctors with the Major Accident
         Equipment Boxes.   The staff who went were, Or* Davidson, Senior House
         Officer and an Anaesthetic Senior House Officer*    The department has
         specially prepared boxes of equipment for just ouch an emergency and
         this had been checked and re-stocked only two weeks earlier.
Page<$   First Paragraph*    “The Department Is set up for ten resuscitation points
          and all these points were being used with often sere than one patient
          to each point"

Page 8   Middle Paragraph.    "By the following norning I was able to calculate
          that eighty eightpatients had been through the department from
          Hillsborough.   Fifty Five of these were admissions, twenty one were
          discharged to home after treatment and twelve patients were dead.
         During the time of the alert, the department also dealt with five
         other patients who were not from Hillsborough.     Of the admissions*
          fifteen were admitted to Intensive Care and two further ventilated
         patients were transferred to the Hallamshire Hospital.     Later that
          evening a further five patients were transferred to the Hallamshire
          Hospital for CT scanning."

         Bottom Paragraph. "In the two years I have worked at the Northern
         Qeneral Hospital I have only seen one such case.    % e most common
         cause of this type of injury (delete terush*) is a car falling on
         top of someone working underneath it, or from heavy industry.
         The Northern Qeneral Hospital treated twenty five cases of severe
         traumatic asphyxia in the space of one hour and I believe it handled
         the incident extremely well.

I am sorry to have to make so many changes, but as you say, if this statement is
going to be copied to the Press then I would like it to b® absolutely correct.


Yours sincerely.

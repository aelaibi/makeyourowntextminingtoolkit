Assistant Chief Constable                                      Headquarters
(Discipline 1 Complaints)
                                                         IT July 1991
Chief Superintendent Duckenfield



                DISCIPLINARY HEARING


You will by now have received the Discipline Form which I caused to be
served on you by Acting Chief Superintendent Fell following the direction
given to me by the Police Complaints Authority in accordance with Section
93(3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

The unprecedented circumstances of the investigation carried out by Mr
Geoffrey Dear, then Chief Constable of West Midlands Police and continued
by Mr Leslie Sharp, then Chief Constable of Cumbria Constabulary have
meant that it is as yet not possible to give you the information and
documentation to which you are entitled under Regulation 10 of the Police
(Discipline) Regulations 1985*

I consider   It appropriate, however, to give you earliest notice of the
charges to   be brought and let you know that it is anticipated that the
hearing will take place in October or November 1991.    It would be helpful
if you would complete the Discipline Form at Questions 1, 2(a), 3, 4 and
6 at this stage and let me have your response to Question 2(b) in good
time for any necessary arrangements to be made.

The amount    of material that falls to be considered under Regulation 10
of the Police    (Discipline) Regulations 1985 is enormous.  It occurs to
me that you and your legal representative, if you decide to be
represented, might find it convenient to view the material at Hammerton
Road Police Station, where it is stored and indexed using a computer.
I will provide facilities also to view related photographs and videos
there if you would find it helpful.    Anything which you would be entitled
to receive under Regulation 10 would be supplied as a copy if that is
your wish but I am hopeful that you will find it convenient to view and
have copies o f particular material that you require as opposed to the
generality of material.    Perhaps you would let me have your thoughts on
this suggested course of action when you have had time to consider the
implications.

   From :   Assistant Chief Constable                         Station I Dept: Headquarters
            (Discipline &. Complaints)
   To   :                                                     Date:   17 July 1991
            Chief Superintendent Duckenfield


            SUBJECT:        DISCIPLINARY HEARING


            You will by now have received the Discipline Form which I caused to be
            served on you by Acting Chief Superintendent Fell following the direction
            given to me by the Police Complaints Authority in accordance with Section
            93(3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.

            The unprecedented circumstances of the investigation carried out by Mr
            Geoffrey Dear, then Chief Constable of West Midlands Police and continued
            by Mr Leslie Sharp, then Chief Constable of Cumbria Constabulary have
            meant that it is as yet not possible to give you the information and
            documentation to which you are entitled under Regulation 10 of the Police
            (Discipline) Regulations 1985-

            I consider   it appropriate, however, to give you earliest notice of the
            charges to be brought and let you know that it is anticipated that the
            hearing will take place in October or November 1991- It would be helpful
            if you would complete the Discipline Form at Questions 1, 2(a), 3, 4 and
            6 at this stage and let me have your response to Question 2(b) in good
            time for any necessary arrangements to be made.

            The amount of material that falls to beconsidered under Regulation 10
            of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 is enormous.  It occurs to
            me that you and your legal representative, if you decide to be
            represented, might find it convenient to view the material at Hammerton
            Road Police Station, where it is stored and indexed using a computer.
            I will provide facilities also to view related photographs and videos
            there if you would find it helpful. Anything which you would be entitled
            to receive under Regulation 10 would be supplied as a copy if that is
            your wish but I am hopeful that you will find it convenient to view and
            have copies of particular material that you require as opposed to the
            generality of material. Perhaps you would let me have your thoughts on
            this suggested course of action when you have had time to consider the
            implications.

               I instructed             these       serials       to    change          duty     locations          hourly.

Chief    Ins p. L a x .             On     completion             of t h i s       briefing,           I briefed           my

officers       and       gave       instructions                 as     o u t li ne d above.




During       the    course          of     the     d a y , the          service         area was          fairly       busy         but

certainly          not    crowded.               My    officers             performed          their        duties        as

instructed and                it w e n t       very well.



At    3,10    pm    ( 15 1 0       hrs)     the       same       date,          1 was    informed           "Operation

support"       had       been       called        ov e r      the      air.




Using    the       radio       in     the      Police         post,         I confirmed              this      and   we w e r e

instructed          to    travel          to     the H i l l s b o r o u g h        ground.




As w e w e r e      public          order        duties,          I assumed             the    call       sign       'Woodall

support'       and       in 3 v e h i c l e s ,            my O f f i c e r s      and myself             travelled            to    the

g round.




In my    vehicle,             PC    Peter        N i c h o l s o n wa s          driving       and     PS Wi lki e         was       a

front    seat       passenger.



We    encountered             no    problems           on     route,            traffic       w as    b u s y as     we    neared             the

ground.        We    arrived             on P e n i s t o n e         Rd    outside       Gate       0.




There    were       many ambulances                    and Police                vehicles        present.            P C 2892/5111 ith

one   of m y O f f i c e r s ,           asked        my    permission             to    enter       the       ground      as       his       son

was   a spectator.                  I (tyave p e r m i s s i o n a n d             I instructed                PC461      Wheeler             to

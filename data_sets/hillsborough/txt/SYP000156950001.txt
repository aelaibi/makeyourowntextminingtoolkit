               then d e t a i l e d         to Serial     59 under PS Ve n a m e s               and    Inspector           Burgess.

               S h o r t l y after          brief i n g a packed meal              was     provided and taken                in the

               m a i n stand.          All     officers        in my detail           were made aware              of the

               l o c ation of our             detail     and the area             surrounding          it.

               A fter    the meal,            together       with PS V e n a b l e s       the    serial       made     its way to

               Penistone       R o a d where           upon,    together          w i t h PC 2434 Gardner,             took      up a

               The    vast m a j o r i t y      of these        suppo/ters           seemed to be            in good spirit.

               Approximately            3 . 5pm    (1505)       Ij^s      at my       point with         Inspector Burgess

               whe n we     received           instruction        over       the     radio    to make         c m r _ way    into the

               ground     to a s s i s t       with     crowd    control,          this we d i d ' a r r i v i n g at about

               3. 1,0pm (1510).               On entering        the      ground      I was      instr u c t e d    by a

               Superintendent,                together w ith other                officers,       to make        our way towards

               the L e p pings         Lane     end     lining    up on the           touch      line.        I found nvyself at

               the    end of the mai n stand at                    its     j u n c t i o n with the LeppLriqs Lane

            end.      At this          time   there        were   hundreds     of fans        on the     playing surface

            shout i n g and        scr e a m i n g    for    help.      I could not        see    into the Leppings

            Lane      pen because         of the fans.              I was    then a p p r o a c h e d by a

            Superintendent              an d told to         face    the    crowd,     this    I did until         ten

            minu t e s    later a young              boy a p p r o x i m a t e l y 9 years was       thrown to the

            floor      near to me and a p p e a r e d             to be unconscious.              I gave m outh to

            mouth      r e s u s c i t a t i o n to the      boy because        I. could not feel           a pulse,         when

            the      boy came      round we were             found    by his father.             At thi s     point      I

            received from an unkn o w n                    person a kick        to my     right     shoulder.         I was

            assisted        to my feet        by the        boy's     father,      shortly a f t e r w a r d s we

             carried      the boy to the a w a iting a m b u l a n c e s              at the     other     end of        the

            g round.                            ■

            On a r r iving        we    helped       the    boy   into an a w a iting         ambulance.

            As    I was ma k i n g       my way back          to the L e p p i n g s    Lane     end,    I was again

             i n s t r u c t e d to make my way to the H o p end and                      line    up on the        touch

             line     facing      the    crowd,       this    I did for       some time.          T h e n orde r e d to

             line     up on the         half way        line and form a cordon.                  During my time at

            t h i s p o i n t h u n d reds      o f s u p p o r t e r s (L i v e r p o o 1 ) were m :i.1 1 i n g a r o u n d a n d

            as a result           several       fights       broke    out    on the     field and        in the      stands

            but were        defused       by Police.

             1 could      see from       this       point    that     numerous        Police     officers were still

            helping       at the L e p p i n g s        Larie end giving          first     aid and      ferrying bodies

            from one        end    of    the ground          to the    other.

            This     type    of    confusion          c o ntinued until        shortly after 5pm              (1700)      when

            we were       i n s t r u c t e d to     leave    the    gr o u n d and    remain on s t a n d b y until

            approx.      6.45pm         <1845).

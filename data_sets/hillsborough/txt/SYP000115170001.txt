down      the hill were             all    carrying       cans of alcohol                and then they went

into      the <j^T«E p ^ l i t        h ou se      car park an d c on su m ed their                drinks.

^ilout ,143Q, hours we were                  joined at this                location by serial 34 and

I n s p e c t oj^T o w n e n d .

It-was at this            time       that    the a re a s t ar te d to get very busy wit h fans

ret ur ni ng down the               hill    towards       us.      The w hole        of the     pavement         on

both      sides of the             c a rr ia ge wa y became a mass                of persons.         We were

inst ru ct ed to         carry out          checks      of these           persons and to stop them from

progre ss in g a ny          further        with any alco ho l              they had wit h them.                The

m a j o r i t y of these           persons were all             young males and seemed                 in high

spirits,        they had all              been drinking          but were          not d is or d er l y    or

incapable.            I p er so n al l y     noticed a number                of faces       that    I had seen

earl ie r     in the       day going         up the       hill     looking         for    licensed     premises.

A number        of    them s to pp ed and            passed the            time of day etc.,           wit h me.

(one      such person         I later        saw was amon gs t              the    dead d r ag ge d    from the

crowd).           A large      number        of such m ales were stopped an d re qu es te d to

leave at          this    location the             cans    or bottles of alcohol               they were

drinking          from at that             time,    these were all placed upon the wall                         of

the GATE          public     house.          (At the       end of the period this                  are a was

A bo ut    1455 hours wit h               other    officers,         I a t t e n d e d at the GAT E            public

spoke to a couple who had just e m er ge d from the premises and

ascertained           that    inside        it c ontained a number                  of fans     from both t eams

dead and then             I e n te r ed this ground               via a large          open metal         gateway

upon doing             so one       is confr on te d       by a central           tunnel     w hi ch     is

playing a r e a at the                   end of the       tunnel.

At this a r e a there were                   now a number             of     s upporters     I saw a man           in his

twent i e s wit h         long hair,             his face was a purple                colour,      he was         being

tended to by a me mb er                    of the St.       J ohns ambulance.

Opposite         him was a young                 boy age d about             IS years,      he   was having

breathing          d i f f i cu l ti e s and was          being       g iven oxygen.         This       entrance was

blocked wit h such                  persons and we had to                  climb over       them.

As    I p r o g r e s s e d t hr ou gh       this    tunnel       1    saw a police wo ma n e scorting a

man out        of the         ground towards          us he was            bleeding      from a cut on his

head.        We then went                down the tunnel          onto       the end of      it an d as           I saw

L iv e rp o ol   fans were        then able'-' to start         passing        out of the         enclosure

ained that the external dooors were locked,I spoxe to a couple^          _
had who had just emerged trom t h e premises and ascxertained that
inside it contained a number of fans from both teams and tygnatg           #

Short     ly'after1 this o ^ f o f f i c e r s came from inside these premises •
and informed me that it was all ovber now inside.                        _
1 then went to jion the remainder of my serial on the rounddabout
and then walked down to the Leppings Lane end of the ground wher^
we met a number ofother police officers.
At this time this area wsas clear of any football supporters.
We were instructed to form a cordon and await further instructions.
At  ttli         time it was not apparent to any of us outside the ground.what
was occurring inside that stand.
About 1515hrs,an elderly man emerged from out of the ^eP P ^ s L a n e
end area and informed us that there were people inside there who
were dead and then I entered this gron§ via a large open meta^ gateway
upon doing so one is confronted by a central tunnell which is 1
 immediately in front of y o u , from this position one can see the playing
 area at the end of the tunnel.
 At this area there were now a number of supporters I saw jjJ"*"                 Q
 his twenties with long hair,his face was a purple colour,he wAS b fig
 tended to by a member of the St J ohns ambulance.                      v,_
 O p p o s i t t e him was a young boy aged about 12 years ,he was having
 bcaathing difficulties and was being given oxygen. This entrance
 was blocked with such persons and we had ot climb over them .

 As I progressed through thbis tunnel I saw a police woman escorting
 a man out of the ground towards us he was bleeding from a cu. on

 W ^ t h e r ^ w e n t down the tunnel onot the end of it andas I saw onto
 the terrace           Iwas met by the sight of the  plfcaying area being covered
 with numerous people.
 These persons to me appeared           to be wandering about.      ^
 As I advanced down the terracing 1 saw piles of bodies d deep
 against the inside of the retaining wall.
 police officers were either side of this fence m the process
 physically demolishing it.
   I went through the open gate on to the playing area.
 I tUSn assisting in pulling the fence away.Police officers andLiverpo<
 fans were then able to start passing out of the enclosure these in;jur<

 Some°of0 these persons were taken straight across the pitch others
 were laid out , I went and assisted to try And revieve one man by
 giving him chest massage      but unfortunately   he was already dead.
 I was then instrur .ed to     try and make a pathway   for the movement
 of the dead and injured.                                   . ,     ,
 The Liverpool supporters at this became extremly aggrovated and start
 d spitting upon us and hurling abuse.
 I then assisted in the carrying of an injurewd person to the far
 end of the ground near to the Kop area and then I returned togoal
 areaat the Leppings Lane end.                         _______ uH+h
  By this timew the area was completely littered with bod
 their heads covered by their coats.                            i i v o mn ni
 At one point the Notts Forest fans started cheering and the Liv
 fans started to surge toawrds them.We then ran back                  Centr
 line and an order was given by C.SUPT Nesbitt to prevent them by
 forming a cordon across the centre of the pitch.
 This calmed down the situation.but      the majority of these men e ^
 just wandering about still wanting      trouble   with the polic
 nothing to assist the situation.
                                                                       :   r-

Bodies were, still being brought through our line towards the kop
end.
Shortly after this Mr Nesbitt instructed us to usher the persons
off the pitch who were not injured, this was done and we then formec
along in front of the Lepping Lane terrace.                       .•
                                                                  •
Shortly after this I went down the paSSageway to leave the terrace
and it was as I got out of the passageway that I saw an area with.
bodies and ambulances .                                       .
Iwas then able to jion together with other members of my serial
we were then requesated to go into the North stand which we compliec
w i t h aND was eventually stood down.

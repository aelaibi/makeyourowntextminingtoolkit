Lord Justice Taylor telephoned me this afternoon with a couple of
points relating to the PCA dimension of the current enquiries.    He has
been in conversation with Sir Cecil Clothier and is happy with the
exchanges between ourselves and Sir Cecil about the use of the West
Midlands police enquiries under Lord Justice Taylor's direction as
sufficient to satisfy the needs of the Police Carrplaints Act and the
Police Complaints Authority should same complaints (as seems
inevitable) be received; Sir Cecil Clothier would then act as the
supervising officer in co-operation with Lord Justice Taylor.


2.    Sir Peter Taylor asked whether Mr Wright could be expected, to
appoint Mr Dear for the purposes of the Police Carrplaints Act.   I
I thought he would (Lf that had not already been agreed}since any other
arrangement would clearly be very wasteful.


3.   Sir Peter Taylor also drew attention to the need to serve Section 7
notices under the Police Carrplaints Act to South Yorkshire officers who
might face criticism; in discussion with Mr Soden we agreed that we
could'assume proper working knowledge of Police Carrplaints Act
procedures on the part of West Midlands in the event of Police
Carrplaints Act complaints being received.

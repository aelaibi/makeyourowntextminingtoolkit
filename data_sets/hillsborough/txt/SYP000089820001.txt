             I was on-c al1 for my practice                  in                      Sheffield,   on Saturday

             15 April      1989 (150489).          I had arranged admission of a patient to

            Middlewood H o s p i t a l , but she refused to go unless I took h e r .                   I set

             off from my home                                 sometime after     1pm (1300), aware that I

            mi ght find t raff i c problems at Hi 11s bo ro ug h.                I approached

             Hillsborough from Herries R d , intending to go along Herries Rd S , but

            was diverted by Police and continued along Herries Rd.                           That   confused

             m e , and I turned into Penistone Rd, away from Sheffield,                       at the

             roundabout, instead of Leppings L n .                      I was aware of a lot of people

             walking towards the Football G r o u n d , both on the pavement and on the

             dual    carriageway separation.                 The traffi c moved slowly for a while,

             and it proved impossible to turn my car round - the re were too many

             pedestrians.               I turned into Parson Cross Rd and found my way to
                                                                                   PAGE     2.
                                                                                   S34G8
Middlewood Hospital,



I don't know how long I was at the hospital ~ I had difficulty getting

my patient      to the ward, and then stayed with her for a while.                 At one

point,I was aware of acrowd roar from Hillsborough -■                     that must have

been soon after 3 o ’clock          (1500), as I remember thinking the match had

started.     I also heard emergency vehicle sirens,                  presumably from

Middlewood Ambulance Stn,           but I d o n 't know what time that w a s .



I set off for h o m e , along Middlewood R d , deciding to go a different

way.     I recal1 stopping my car on that road to J m l 1 my radio aerial

o u t , in order to listen to the Radio Sheffield Sports programme.

Robert JACKSON,       the presenter, m e n t i o n e d s o m e   kind of problem at

Hi 11 sb or ou gh, but no news yet as to/'what it was - the match had

been halted and not yet restarj^a.               A little later, he asked for

any doctors     in the area tji^go to Hillsborough Football Ground.

F rom this point on I dte^not remember             looking at my watch for some

while,     but my retrospective impress ion was that it was between 3.30

(1530)     and 3.45    (1545).     My   initial thought was "Well, they w o n ’t

need me."     But conscience w o u l d n ’t allow me to p as s .          I had just

gone past the first few shops and turned left into,                     1 think,

Parks ide Rd.     I asked a policeman on this road, where I should g o , and

he suggested the Northern General Hospital.                      1 decided to go there,

but was a while getting to Penistone Rd (due to traffic).                      I remember

quite a number of spectators streaming along the road in the opposite

direction, and the bonnet of my car was tapped by hands once or twice.

I felt then that       it would be better to go to the ground, and another

policeman directed me to a particular entrance                     (I can't remember

the letter) and there to the Gym.
                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                          S34Q8

I was stopped at the doorway                 to the Gym,   by a police officer, but

allowed in when I said I   was a d oc to r. My first recollection within
O A rC  Gtv M     A T T
the Gym was of bodies laid out with heads covered. They must be

sleeping,     I t h o ug h t.   They can't be d e a d .       I had   no idea       of what ha

happened,     or of the magnitude.             1 guess I knew they were dead and

hurried on to the centre of the Gym.                    1 told another officer that I

was a d oc to r, and asked him where I was n e e de d.                He told me to look

around and do what         I could.         An officer - it may have been the same

one - took my name and asked where 1 worked.



I   remember seeing a further section in the Gym -                    at the opposite         end,

separated from where I was by netting,                  I think, as was the section

with the dead bodies.             I       was in the middle     section.     There were some

tables and chairs        in the           far section and I     thought    people had been

separated into dead,            seriously injured and slightly injured.                  I ’m not

sure now that that was so.



H e l p l e s s , utterly helpless.         What do I do next?        Talk to people, y e s ,

must talk to them.          Reassure them.         The first person I saw (1) was



                                             with a woman - “I ’m a doctor" she said.

          Tables & chairs                    The next   (2) - Oh his name, was it

                                                                                ?   something

                                             common ~ had injured his ch est .            I ’d

                                             not worked out yet that there were

     ----------------------                  crush injuries.     He wanted to sit up             and

                                             I persuaded him to keep lying -

3 . gap                               5      help was on the w a y .      Why did I

                4.                           leave my bag in the car?           Can *t even

                                             check blood pressure.         I moved around

                                            this section,      talking to people,

   1.                                       enquiring as best I could.

                                            The man (3) was crying "W he re's my

                                            son?"     There was a doctor with him.

                                            Then there was                       - face

                Bodies                      knew ~ that helped.          I was    reassured,

right, arm.       (lylfhink the arm was broken)/.             I went off to find a bag of

fluid.     Someone had found some before me.                  I helped           put up the

drip.     I moved a ro u nd .      Helped put up one or two more drips.                   "Do n’t

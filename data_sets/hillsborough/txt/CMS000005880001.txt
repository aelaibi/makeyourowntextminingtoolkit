Sports Policy Statement

In [November 1991] the Department published a statement of the
Government's policies and priorities      for sport and active
recreation. This statement announced the proposed setting up of a
UK Sports Commission to bring together the work of the home
country Sports Councils at UK level and. in particular to take
forward the development and co-ordination of initiatives to
promote performance and excellence. A Sports Council for England
is to be established. The Government has given its support to the
establishment of the British Sports Forum which brings together
the voluntary sector of sport. The statement also contains
proposals for increasing the opportunities for young people to
participate in sport and to promote performance and excellence as
well as setting out what the Government has done in a number of
other areas including providing opportunities       for disabled
athletes, encouraging fair play, tackling drug abuse in sport
and promoting international sport.

As part of the follow up to this document the Department will be
publishing later this year a booklet providing examples of good
practice   in promoting    opportunities   for young people to
participate in sport, drawing out the lessons to be learnt.

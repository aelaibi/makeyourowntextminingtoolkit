           Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                  Sheffield on 11th August, 1983

PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

           Dr. W. Eastwood (Eastwood & Partners)

           Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

           C. W. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)
                    (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

           D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 .______ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the "summer"
inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th June). Reports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

2 ._____ Ground Inspection

A.      Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1983, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands. Evidently, it
was proving to be a most welcome feature.

B.     West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium. One had
failed and been replaced.
IT WAS AGREED -
(i)     That, if the Club intend   to continue to use the former A.R.P. building
adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would require attention
in particular, as would the general maintenance of the building.
(ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork at
the rear corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.
(iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
loose concrete rendering apparent in places.
C.      North West Terrace
As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
water between the two.
IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
continue to monitor the position.
D.      North Stand
The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was in hand
as a matter of maintenance.
E.      Spion Kop
As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the
North Stand end). Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
increasing the headroom.
Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spion Kop following digging out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the firm opinion that further work was essential. Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement. Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
former retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of the existing barrier rails. The Club would have to look to the contractor
 (or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.
As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing). Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).
IT WAS AGREED
(i)     That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
principle.
(ii)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
rails must be stabilised (possibly by drilling holes at intervals and
inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
where these are capable of being generated.

(iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

F.     "Stands" Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club. It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of defiectiÂ°n in the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)    That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.     South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
steel supports to the sides of the concertina-type exit gate from the
Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would remove the remaining coping stones and arrange
for the remainder ofthe pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

(ii)   That the Club would shortlyconsider a scheme tobe prepared by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners forreplacement of bothsteelsupports  to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop).
H.      Gr ound Fitness C er tif ica te


Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate. However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, as required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate
to the County Council, excluding the Penistone Road end of the Stadium at
the present time. 1

          Mr. E. England,
          The Secretary,
          Sheffield Wednesday F.C.,
          Hillsborough,
          Sheffield,
          South Yorkshire,
          S6 1SW.


         Dear Mr. England,

         SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

         Following a test and appraisal of the emergency procedure at the Sheffield
         Wednesday ground, held just prior to the commencement of the Milk Cup Match
         onTuesday 4th October, 1983, please find my observations below:-

          1.     On this occasion no prior warning was given by the Fire Service
                of the intention to test the emergency procedure. This was done
                in order that staff reactions could be observed when they thought
                that they were responding to a genuine emergency.

         2.    The procedure was initiated by the announcement, over the public
               address system of the message "Will Mr. Derek Knight report to the
               Secretary's office". It was cancelled approximately five minutes
               later by the announcement of "Mr. Derek Knight need not now attend
               the Secretary's office".

         3.    My Officers questioned a number of stewards manning the exit gates
               at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road ends of the ground. In
               both instances the stewards had not heard the emergency procedure
               announcement and therefore had not carried out their duties in relation
               to the evacuation procedure.

         4.    Further investigation revealed that, in a number of areas, listed below,
               the public address system was not audible.

                (a)      Area between the kop and Penistone Road exits.

                (b)      Area between the west stand and Leppings Lane exits.

                (c)      Walkways at ground and upper levels to rear of North Stand.

                (d)      Areas in South Stand.

                (e)      Parking area.                                                                                           /Â§0

               There are speakers at the rear of the west stand but these were not working
               on the night of the test. It is possible that speakers at the Penistone
               Road end may have been removed or are not functioning correctly because of
                                          All communications to be addressed to the Chief Fire Officer.
Sheffield Wednesday F.C.            -   2   -
                                                       7th October, 1983



     the alterations currently being carried out at that end of the ground.

5.   Because of the problem with the audibility of the public address system
     it was not possible for my Officers to assess the effectiveness of the
     emergency procedures. They did, however, report that the stewards they
     questioned would have known what to do if the message had been heard
     by them.

6.   A number of stewards were not wearing identifiable dress, i.e. fluorescent
      tabards, as required by condition 9(c) of your General SafetyiCertificate.

7. My Officers also reported that staff manning refreshment bars in the
    north and south stands did not know the position of fire alarm call
    points or the position of and how to use fire extinguishers.

I have informed Mr. D. Vaughan (Secretary Officer Working Party) of the
problems listed above and he will be arranging a site meeting as soon as
possible to resolve the matter of the public address system. Item 6 is
a matter which I think you can deal with yourself.

On the subject of staff training, which is a condition placed on the Club
by the General Safety Certificate, I am prepared to make my Officers
available to instruct your stewards and staff members in the emergency
procedure and use of fire extinguishers.

Please contact Divisional Officer Johnson at the above address if you wish
to take advantage of this offer or if you require any clarification on the
contents of this letter.

Yours sincerely,




Chief Fire Officer

Dear Hr. Wright,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROCWDS ACT 1975

Further to your letter of the 7th October re your visit and
appraisal of he emergency procedure at this ground on
Tuesday, 4th October, when your Divisional Officer Johnson
came to see rae after the match and explained thatiin his
opinion there were'dead* areas in our ground, as it appeared
that stewards had not heard the emergency announcement, to
say the least this surprised me, as only this last close
season have we had the P.A. System further improved.

I have taken the opportunity this morning to try out the
system in all the areas that were supposedly âdeadj and
I must report that everything that was said, was heard
clearly and distinctly.

I have informed Hammerton Road police of this, and It
has been suggested to me that perhaps it would be a
sensible idea for one or two of your officers to cane
to the ground at say 1.00 oâclock on Saturday, 29th
October when we play Huddersfield Town and go around the
ground with the police and hear the broadcasts for themÂ­
selves.

Yours sincerely,




Secretary.

             Dear Sir

             Thank you for your letter dated 13.10.83. As you suggested, 2 Fire Prevention
             Officers visited the ground before the match on Saturday 29 October to carry
             out further checks on the effectiveness of the public address system when used
             for emergency procedures.

             In conjunction with the County Police, the public address system was checked
             and found to be satisfactory in all areas.

             If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
             this Department.

             Yours faithfully

 1.    Purpose     of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football League
grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate Officer Working Party.

The Club reported that the majority of the items listed as normal maintenance
items following the. "summer" inspection had yet 'to be carried out. This was
due to a combination of the change in Club Secretary and certain development
proposals (outlined on a confidential basis) which the Club had in mind.
However, those which the Club's staff could undertake would be commenced shortly
and tenders had been invited and received for the urgent remaining larger
items (to be carried out commencing in May).   The exception was the roof of the
tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the North Stand end) in view of its
possible inclusion in the development proposals outlined.

2 â¢___ Ground Inspection

A.      West Stand and Terrace

It was noted that the former ARP building adjacent to the boundary wall was
in the process of demolition and the site cleared  and levelled. This would
have the additional benefit of improving the access/egress.

B.      North West Terrace

It was noted that whilst generally the sealing of  the cracks beneath the Terrace
to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
seepage from one of the repairs.

The possible need for protection of the wire mesh on the inside of the upper
access deck was also discussed.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would continue to monitor the slight seepage of water
from the repaired cracks under the Terrace.

(ii)   That the possible need for lateral bracing to the frame of the*wire
mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access deck be investigated by a (_& ^
test loading during the forthcoming close season.
C.       Spion Kop


As previously indicated, the Club confirmed that the remedial work to the
existing access ramp and barrier rails required as the result of the
construction of the new refreshment and toilet^ together with the erection
oi barriers to prevent access to the roofs of the new facilities, had been
carried out.

The present condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the roof of
the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop was inspected.

The stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end of the ground
was also discussed.

IT   WAS AGREED   -


(i)   That theBuilding Authority and Mr. J. Strange of    Messrs. Eastwood &
Partners should discuss and inspect that part of the perimeter fencing
erected at the northern end of the ramp to prevent access to the roofs of the
new facilities.

(ii)  That the Club would undertake continuous maintenance work on the roof
of the tunnel exit, pending a decision on any development proposals.

(iii)  That the Building Authority and Dr. W. Eastwood should discuss and inspect
the stability of the perimeter wall at the Penistone Road end during the
forthcoming close season.

D.      Lighting      Pylons

The Club undertook to carry out a visual inspection of the lighting pylons during
the forthcoming close season and to make more detailed inspections should this .
prove to be necessary after the visual inspection.

Eâ¢      Emergency Lighting, Fire Alarm and Public Address   Systems Test

IT WAS AGREED - That the County Fire Service in conjunction with the South
Yorkshire Police and the C l u b âs staff, would carry out a test of these systems
at the evening match against Fulham to be held on 7th March.

  Dear Dick,
                                                      Barrier Testing 1984

       On 18 and 19 June, crush barriers 155, 156, 157, 158, 159,
  160, 164, 165, 166, 167, 167A, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173,
  174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180 (spans 3 and 4), 182, 183
   (spans 1 and 2), 184 and 185, on the north west corner terrace,
  were tested in accordance with the procedure laid down in the
  Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.                                           The barriers are shown
  on the attached print of our drawing 1610/64C.
       Barriers 161, 162, 163, 180 (spans 1 and 2), 181, 183
     (spans 3 and 4) and 186 could not be tested because being                                                    very
  close to the back of the terrace the testing rig would not fit
  into the space available. Because the distance behind these
  barriers is so resitricted it is extremely unlikely that the few
  people behind them will exert the full load suggested in the
     'green' guide.
              In all cases tested the barriers sustained the test load.
              On 20 June the fencing along the internal edge of the
  access walkway at the rear if the north west corner terrace was
   tested.           Thirteen spans were tested and although the wire mesh
  deformed by as much as 36mm during the load application,

 recovery at the end of the final test was 100%.
      On 22 June the concrete parapet wall along the front of
 the suspended section of terracing, in the north west corner
 was tested.   During the load application, movement of the
 wall was so small that readings using the measuring equipment
 could not be taken.
      Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing
 the results of all the tests on the barriers and fencing.
 We are pleased to report that none of the barriers needs
 strengthening work.
      This set of tests now complete the five year test cycle
 at the ground.

"Stands" Club had been braced by metal supports.

It was noted that the condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the
roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop had continued to deteriorate, as had the
dividing wall between the Spion Kop and the South Stand and the outer perimeter
wall at the Penistone Road end of the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED   -

(i)       That Mr. Strange should let Mr. Sheriff have proposals in writing
for stabalising the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop (in
view of the Club's reported intention of proceeding with development proposals
in the comparatively near future), following which Mr. Sheriff will let
Mr. Vaughan have detailed comments.

(ii)      That the removal of loose coping stones and the pointing of the wall
between the Spion Kop and the South Stand (mentioned at the 11th August, 1983
inspection) should be carried out as an urgent maintenance item.

(iii)     That, as it apparently now serves no useful purpose, the damaged
corrugated metal sheeting between the Spion Kop and the South Stand should be
removed.

(iv)      That pointing work should be carried out as a matter of urgent
maintenance to the outer perimeter wall pending agreement between the Building
Authority and Dr. Eastwood as to its stability (during the present close season,
as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection).

(v)       That the redundant  wooden post and loose wire adjoining the walkaway
at the top of the Spion Kop should be removed.

F.        Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons during the present close season
(as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection) had not yet been carried
out.

IT WAS AGREED  that, pending the visual inspection of the lighting pylons,
corrosion of the base of thepylon at the rear of the West Stand and of the
adjoining fence posts and manhole cover, required attention.




                                                                                  1
G.          Crush Barriers

It was pointed out that the sets of tests carried out in June had completed
the five year test cycle at the Stadium.  The cycle would re-commence next
year.

3 .______   General Safety Certificate

The numerous alterations to the Stadium since the issue*of the General Safety
Certificate on 21st December, 1979, were recalled.

IT WAS AGREED that up-dated plans were required for incorporation into the
General Safety Certificate in order to indicate the present facilities at the
Stadium.

4 .________ Toilet and Catering Facilities

The Club gave an advance indication of the likely up-grading of toilet and
catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the outcome
of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust.  In the more
immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serve food
from the rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of from inside
The area used would remain the same.  If structural alterations were required,
the Club would also require building regulation approval from the City Council

Dear Dick,
                                                  Perimeter Fencing
        As requested we have prepared a possible scheme for a
perimeter fence along the front of the uncovered seats of the
South stand, and also the North stand.
        Enclosed are two prints of our drawing 6517/2 showing
a cross-section through each fence.
        We propose that a 150 x 75 mesh is used with the
150min dimension mounted vertically.                                    This has the advantage
of not obscuring the view as much as the 50 x 50 mesh used in
front of Spion Kop and still does not offer a good foothold for
anyone wishing to climb the fence.
        We have shown a crank at the top as you asked.                                                 This
will make the fence more difficult to climb over but could you
also consider a vertical fence of the same height, as this would
mean that the steel angle at the crank could be omitted which
would be one less visual obstruction.
        Including professional fees we estimate that the cost
of the two fences, plus a return barrier along the east end
gable wall of the North stand is likely to be approximately
Â£17,200 plus V.A.T. If access gates are required in the fencing
we estimate that these would cost about Â£300 each.                                                The police

  Dear Dick,

                                  Alarm Points and Fire Extinguishers

              Thank you for sending the note written by Mr. Lock
  about the alarm points and fire extinguishers in the
 West and North stands.
              The original philosophy behind installing the call
  points in the bars was that in the event of fire during
  a match the alarm could be sounded from an area that
  was always occupied, i.e. by the bar staff.                                         At the
  same time the call points are out of reach by the public.
  Although out of match hours an alarm cannot be raised
  without going into one of the bars we believe that the
  call points are mounted in the most appropriate place.

              We have discussed the matter with the Fire Service
  and they are happy with the present arrangement.

              A fire is most likely to start in one of the bars
  where there are gas appliances and flamable material
  present and we believe that the extinguishers should,
  therefore, be close at hand in the bars.                                       However, we
  learn that the Fire Service may soon be asking for
  additional extinguishers to be provided in circulation
  areas in the event of a fire occurring somewhere else

                                                                                                               â2 j O

                        Dear

                        F o llowing our recent t e lephone conversation, I am writing
                        to confirm deta i l s of our new 'SAFEGATE' crowd control
                        b a r r i e r system.

                        As you will see from the enclosed d e s c r i p t i o n                                                                                         the main
                        benef i t s of our product are as follows:

                        1.            Full electrical control over opening.

                                      Can be opened                                locally                (with a key)                         or r e m otely                             (by
                                      switch).

                        2.            Fail-safe opening.

                                      If electric c i rcuitry is broken, the gate opens

                 THE   'SAFEGATE'



A new innovative safety gate called 'Safegate' is now
available frcm Selflock Limited, a Firsteel Company
within the Lonrho Group.


Our engineering design and manufacturing expertise has
enabled us to produce a product that could completely
eliminate crowd-control problems. Increasingly, crowd-
control is presenting a major problem for organising
bodies, the police and safety officers; and the results
of poor control were tragically highlighted during the
recent disasters at Bradford and Brussels, but similar
problems could be averted with the use of our new
electronic 'Safegate'.

A crucial feature of the design is the ability to open
the 'Safegate' either by remote control or manually at
the gate (by key) - immediately access is required.


In the event of a disturbance in the crowd, a bcmb scare,
or fire, the gate can be opened instantaneously by a switch
frcm the controller's box, police command post or indeed
frcm any pre-determined position around the stadium. In
this way emergency services can enter an otherwise fenced area
quickly for control purposes, or in the event of a fire, the
crowd will have another or several other exits to safety.
Painted bright yellow, a recognised and approved colour for
safety equipment, the visual significance of the 'Safegate'
is further emphasised by a yellow flashing beacon vfoich
operates when the gate is opened. This feature is of vital
importance for in the event of an impending disaster the
crowd need to find the emergency exit as quickly as nossible.


The 'Safegate' can incorporate a fail-safe back-up power
unit so that in the event of a power failure the gate will
still operate.


In composition, the main frame posts toaether with the
bottom and top rails and also the main gate structure are
manufactured from mild steel structural hollow section.


To prevent people climbing the gate but still allowing people
to view through the gate, 9rrm dia. rods at approximately
75nm centres are welded to the inside top half of the gate with
a central bracing to prevent the bending of the bars by vandals,
whilst the bottom half of the gate has a heavy gauge diamond
pattern close set expanded metal panel welded to the inside,
with a cross bracing to stop vandals kicking the panel through
 (see attached drawing). Also to help deter climbing over the
gate, barbed wire is installed.
The gate is hinged down the one side, the type of hinae
used allows the gate to open past 90 , also when the
gate is being closed, because of the gap between the main
frame post and gates people would not trap their hands or
clothing.


The locking system has a unique locking/release type of
mechanism actuated by a solenoid, controlled electrically
from either remote positions, or locally by use of a key.
When the command is given the gates open even if there is
crowd pressure against them. Subsequently, when the gates
are closed manually, the locks are re-set electrically.
The totally enclosed locking mechanisms are stainless steel.


It is recanmended that the 'Safegate' has a brightly
coloured paint finish to attract the eyes of spectators in
an emergency (Paint Finish: Canary Yellow), althouah other
coatings can be supplied on request.


The first gate to be put into use is at the International
Ground at Ninian Park for Cardiff City A.F.C. This
installation consists of a single gate which forms part
of the perimeter fencing separating the pitch frcm the
spectators enclosure. In this simple application alone the
advantages of 'Safegate' are enormous. The 'Safegate'
prevents spectator access to the pitch but in the event of
an incident the police or first aid services can gain
immediate access. If desirable the gate allows entry onto
the pitch if a spectator in the enclosure needs to be
vacated quickly in an emergency.


'Safegate' is a truly significant advancement towards
eliminating crow} problems. Moderately priced, the
'Safeaate' can be tailor made to suit almost any application
frcm a simple fence, or barrier, or a safety door: all
remotely controlled, easily installed and presenting a real
answer to crowd control problems.


In certain circumstances such installations can be eligible
for grant aid, through the Football Ground Improvement Trust.


Selflock Limited provide a comprehensive installation and
after-sales service.

Dear Sir,

Confirming the 'phone conversation which Messrs. Eastwood & Partners have had
with you, arrangements have been made for a meeting of the Officer Working Party
(Sheffield District) to be held on Wednesday, 22nd January, 1986, at the Hillsborough
Stadium at 2 p.m.

The purpose of the meeting will be two-fold; firstly to discuss with Messrs. Eastwood
& Partners the further details of development proposals forwarded with their letter
dated 23rd December, 1985 and, secondly, to carry out the "winter" inspection of
the Stadium.

As agreed, no doubt you will arrange to be present or represented at the meeting.

                                                   Yours faithfully,




                                                    County Solicitor.

D ear Sir,

       I w rite to draw your a tte n tio n to a r e c e n t innovation in th e field of
crow d/ground s a fe ty .

       This e n tire ly new ite m of equipm ent will sh o rtly b ecom e co m m ercially available
and av ailab le fo r d e m o n stra tio n a t chosen venues around th e country.

       THE IDEA: to allow in s ta n t e g re s s /a c c e s s from a fen ced in crowd a r e a              of a
stadium in case of fire or d istu rb a n c e -o n to th e playing a r e a fo r s a fe ty .

        THIS MEANS: a s e t of fen ce po sts which a re hinged a t ground level and held in
th e upright position by an explosive bolt r a t e d a t 5 - 10 tons.

         T hese po sts fit in to existing fen ce s tru c tu re s or m ay be e r e c te d as p a rt of a new
fencing sy stem . The existing fencing is used when th e new p o sts are in sta lle d . The po sts
a re in sta lle d in tw o's (or more) th e re b y m aking a g a te in th e fen ce o p e ra te d sele ctiv ely ,
by crow d/ground sectio n .

          A lthough th e p o sts a re o p e ra te d by 'explosive bolts' th e b olts are abso lu tely safe
i.e. th e y do not s h a tt e r and a re co n tain ed w ithin th e hollow m e ta l fen ce posts.

w arran tin g th e ir need p rev ail. A low vo ltag e visual con tro l box is used fo r this purpose,
w ith num erous s a f e ty devices b uilt in.

         I          am sure you will a g re e th a t th is idea will rev o lu tio n iz e c ro w d /s a fe ty and to th a t
end I ask th a t you consider th e idea seriously and correspond showing your in te r e s t or
o th erw ise w ith a view to a tte n d in g a d em o n stra tio n in your p a r t of th e country.

      The cost of th is /th e s e item (s) is n o t y e t av ailab le, bu t if s u ffic ie n t in te r e s t is
shown a p ric e would also be av ailab le shortly.

Dear Dick,
                                                      Ground Safety
                Thank you for your letter of 21 April enclosing a copy
of the communication from Peter J. Kirby.                                          You will probably
know that there are several of these quick acting bolt devices
on the market.                      We have inspected some of them and have not
yet been convinced that any of them are foolproof and good
value for money.   The South Yorkshire Fire Service have
also been keeping their ears to the ground and share our view.
       The one which is proposed by Mr. Kirby sounds to me
to be possibly dangerous. Firstly, the gate is hinged about
its bottom edge and falls forward on to the pitch surround
when the explosive bolt is released.                                      It has to be kept in mind
that police walk past the gates and clearly there could be a
risk of injury.                           It is also undesirable that the crowd should
have to walk out over the top of the gate which would be lying
on the ground.
       The arrangement is also likely to be very expensive as
it would be necessary to buy completely new gates and fit them
in the safety fence. There will also be the cost of wiring
all the gates back to the central control point.
                It seems the device is unlikely to be attractive but if

   Dear Dick,
                                      Home Office Document on Fire Safety and
                                    Safety at Sports Venues
                        I have read through the part of the document which deals
   with Sports Grounds.                                     I do not see any grounds for objecting to
   any of the recommendations.                                               There will be little if any change in
   the procedure already established at Hillsborough.                                                  The document
   envisages that far more grounds for various sports will be designated
   but in appropriate circumstances the procedures will not be so
   onerous as those relating to Hillsborough.                                               However, as it is a
   'top' ground we cannot expect that there will be much relaxation
   compared with the present arrangements.
            There is a welcome statement on page 11 that due account
   should             be taken of the need to keep the costs to clubs and local
   authorities to reasonable proportions. There are also various
   references to Safety Certificates reflecting the circumstances of
   each particular ground and the number of spectators who are likely
   to attend (see page 14).   These words may be useful to us in the
   future, although we can expect to have more stringent requirements
   compared with some of the smaller clubs.
            It is comforting to know that the new Green Guide will not
   become             astatutory code, and will continue to be subject to
                                                                                                                    .2% o

    interpretation.
             The reference to prohibition notices by either the fire
    authority or the local authority on page 19 may cause concern to
    some clubs.   But in paragraph 2.38 on page 20 there is a clear
    implication that it is only necessary to reduce the risk to
    an acceptable level, rather than trying to remove all risk.     This
 wording will help curb excessive demands, and may be useful to
    us sometimes in negotiations.
             I am returning the document herewith.


                               Yours sincerely,

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - The Spion Kop -
 Application for Increase in Crowd Capacity_________

 I refer to the meeting held at the stadium on 10th July about the above
 development and to Messrs. Eastwoods' letter of 26th June.

 Officers met on 15th July to discuss the application in the light of new plans
 submitted by Doctor Eastwood (which were received on 14th July). The following
 points arose from the discussion

         (a)     No plan has been suppliedshowing the remainder of the exit route
                 between the new construction at the north corner of the Kop and the
                 final gate on Penistone Road - this omission means that the capacity
                 of the escape route cannot be assessed;

          (b)    the plan 6648/54 does not show whether or not there will be any
                 handrails or other narrowing of the new escape route;


          (c)    reservations were expressed about the 8 minute rule (relating to the
                 evacuation time of the new terrace) and Officers are making
                 further enquiries into that issue with the benefit of
                 Doctor Eastwood's comments on 10th July.

  Please arrange to supply plans showing the details mentioned in items (a) and
  (b) above.




  PB                                                  - 1                                  734690 - Mr. Bownes

 It seems to me that the Council will not be in a position to decide on the
 capacity issue much before the completion of works; I therefore propose to place
 the application before the appropriate Committee when the Kop is complete. This
 arrangement will also give Officers a chance to assess the structure when it is
 fully operational.

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Inspections

 As you requested the Inspection of your Stadium which was to take place on
 Tuesday 5th August has been rearranged for Thursday 7th August commencing at
 9.30 a.m..

 I would like to reassure you that I will make every effort to ensure that
 Inspections take place at times convenient for both Officers and the Club; you
 will, however, be aware that the arranging of inspections involves a lot of
 people and short-notice rearrangements may not always be possible.

 I have sent a copy of this letter to Messrs. Eastwoods for thttr information.

 Penistone Road,
 SHEFFIELD 6

 Dear Sir,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Application
 for Increase in Crowd Capacity on the Spion Kop

 I am writing to confirm that your application for an increase in the crowd
 capacity on the new Kop will be considered at a special meeting of the General
 Purposes Panel to be held on Thursday 21st August 1986 at 2.00 p.m. in the Town
 Hall, Sheffield.  The Panel has the right to decide on your application.

 In dealing with the application the Panel will also consider the following
 matters

        (a)        The new terrace construction does not comply with the plans
                   submitted to the Council for Building Regulation Approval, in
                   particular in that the slope of the terrace is now steeper
                   than originally proposed and as such could be dangerous;

        (b)        it is considered that the vertical distance in some places
                   from terrace level to the new gangway level is so great that
                   it is a safety hazard;

        (c)         the sheeting at the rear of the Kop near the "Ozzie Owl" Club
                    should be brought down to ground level;

        (d)         the bearings of the pre-cast concrete unit onto the steel
                    rakers are substandard in at least one case;

        (e)         the provision of a kiosk and toilet underneath the new terrace
                    did not feature in the application;

        (f)         the Fire Service is concerned that the evacuation time for the
                    new Kop is in accordance with the "8 minutes" discussion as
                    detailed in the Green Guide, the Popplewell Report and other
                    requirements. The capacity of the new Kop should be
                    calculated accordingly.

                                                                                                             Contâd ...


                                                                                           734690 - Mr. Bownes

    I wish to invite you and your representatives to attend the meeting so as to put
    your views on these matters and the capacity issue.  I appreciate that there are
    discussions already underway on the above points with the appropriate Officers.

    I have sent a copy of this letter to Dr. Eastwood.

    If you have any general questions to ask about this matter or if you wish to
    discuss the format of the Panel meeting please do not hesitate to contact my
    Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, on the number given below.

Dear Dick,
                               Spion Kop Development
              Please find enclosed two prints of our drawing No.6648/140.
The drawing was produced for the C.C.T.V. and counting system contract
but we have added a proposed numbering system for the turnstiles at
the Penistone Road end of the ground, starting at the South stand.
     Turnstiles 37 to 76 inclusive serve the Spion Kop. Turnstiles
77 to 80 serve the North stand.

                                                                Yours sincerely,

  Dear Dick,
                                                     Testing of Crush Barriers

               â¢As part of the five-yearly cycle of testing, the barriers
   on about one-third of the old Kop need to be tested this year.
   I presume you would like us to get on with it as soon as
   possible, so as to have the test certificate ready before the
   renewal of the Ground Safety Certificate is due at the end of
   the year.                Unless I hear from you to the contrary I will
   arrange for the testing to be done in early September.



                                                                            Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Capacity of the new Spion Kop

I refer to the meeting of the General Purposes Panel of the City Council which
took place on Thursday 21st August 1986 which you and other representatives of
the Club attended.

I am writing to confirm that the Panel agreed to increase the capacity of the
Kop to 21,000 spectators subject to the following conditions

         (a)   that the infilling of crush barriers takes place prior                                         to thematch
               on 25th August;

         (b)   the other work referred to before the Panel be completed within                                            2
               weeks (i.e. by 4th September 1986);

         (c)   extra stewarding be provided during the next 2 matches                                         to the
                satisfaction of the Fire Service and the Police.

Obviously, all work is to be carried out to the satisfaction of the
Certificating Authority and the Panel authorised me to take any necessary action
to secure compliance with the above conditions.




                                                                                         734690 - Mr. Bownes

During Mr. Bownes1 visit to the match on 25th August it was noted that very
little of the fencing which should have been installed to protect the sheeting
at the rear and sides of the Kop was in fact in place and it is also understood
that the P.A. System on the Kop was not in operation during that match.  It was
also noted that several pieces of fencing were in fact wired to the structure of
the Kop presumably as a temporary measure.  I consider these items important and
that it is in everyone's interest that they are dealt with immediately and in
any event before the match on 30th August.

I have sent a copy of this letter to Dr. Eastwood as usual.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

Dear Dick,
                                 General Safety Certificate
               As promised I looked through your existing safety certificate
to see whether there are any matters which we might raise before
the next certificate is issued.
     My only suggestion is that the position of the disabled should
be regularised by including them in Schedule 3 of Part 1.                                              The
entry might read "disabled and helpers in front of the North
stand".             If the number is 74, this would bring the ground capacity,
including the extra 4150 so far agreed for Spion Kop, to 54,398.
We will of course be applying for an increase after the completion
of the north corner and would hope that we will at least reach the
magic figure of 55,000.                                   The 74 disabled and helpers may be
useful in attaining that number.
     We discussed the other day the requirement for policing.
This is dealt with in clause 7 which refers to "adequate
number of police officers".                                       It goes on to say that the n u m b e r
 shall be agreed between the Chief Constable and the Holder at
 least 21 days before a specific activity takes place.                                           This is
 certainly a more civilised wording than that which appears to be
 in use by North Yorkshire County Council but in the end, it does
                              An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144

  give the Police a very considerable authority to decide
  how many men they wish to have on duty.

     For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes


     Dear M r . Bownes,
                                         Safety of Sports Grounds Act
                               Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                In looking through the Club's Safety Certificate it has
     been noticed that the number of spectators who can be admitted



;    to various parts of the ground does not include any reference
     to the disabled and their "helpers".
     oversight when the original certificate was made out and I
     think it likely that you will wish to correct the matter when
     the certificate for 1987 is issued.
                                                                                     This was clearly an




                The Club does not like to admit more than 40 disabled people
     in wheelchairs plus one helper with each of them.


                                                                          Yours sincerely,

For the Attention of Mr. R. Chester

Dear Dick,
                                                              Barrier Testing 1986

     Between 18 and 24 June, the second part of our five yearly
cycle of testing was completed on the Spion Kop in accordance with
the procedure laid down in the Guide to Safety at Football Grounds.
The location of the barriers tested is bounded in red on the enclosed
print of our drawing 8334/1.
     Barriers 19, 20, 2 2 , 2 1 , 41, 65 and span 2 of barrier 62, span 1
of barrier 75 and span 3 of barrier 88 could not be tested because
being in front of entrances there is no reaction point available
against which to jack, or they are now too close to the newly
constructed lateral wall, and the test rig will not fit in.
     In all cases the tested barriers successfully withstood the
applied load. Visual inspection of the remaining barriers revealed
a corroded clip an barrier 1 1 0 and a broken rear l e g o n barrier 1 2 0 .
These will be repaired, and then tested next year.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the tests on the barriers and a print of our drawing No.
8334/1 which is a plan on the Spion Kop showing the new barrier
numbering system adopted as from September 1986.
                                                                           Yours slncer^1"

Dear Dick,

                                                                       Safety Work 1986

                   During the summer inspection Inspector Calvert asked for some
of the barriers at the Leppings Lane end of the ground to be
removed so as the allow easier access into the various pens.
Rather than                ask Ackroyd & Abbott's sub-contractor to do the work,
who were at                that time working overtime, we instructed George Shaw
Engineering                Ltd. to have the work completed before the Everton
game. This                 they did and today we have forwarded a certificate
for the payment of Â£129.92 plus V.A.T. to them. The original of
the certificate and their invoice is enclosed. Payment should be
received by them no later than 16 October 1986.

                                                                          Yours sin

Dear Sir,

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC -
Spion Kop Development________________

Thank you for your letter of 15th October in reply to mine of 9th October
addressed to Sheffield Wednesday.

I am very grateful for the plans which you have supplied which I am sure will
help the Council as Certificating Authority in the exercise of its
responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

I feel that it is important to carefully distinguish between plans, etc., which
are forwarded to the Council in its role as Building Authority and those which
are submitted to it as Certificating Authority. It is my .understanding that the
County Council, when it received plans, ensured that copies were submitted to
the interested Officers for comment; indeed the situation then was somewhat
clearer as the County Council had, as Certificating Authority, no connection
with the Building Authority.

I think that this arrangement should continue - that is plans relating to the
1975 Act should be forwarded to my Licensing Office for distribution.



                                                                                                          Continued                  /




                                                                                              734005 - Mr. Bownes
                                    For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring .................................
                                                                                                .........                (STD Code 0742)
                                                              Telex 64243 (Administration & Legal)
                                      -2-



It may be appropriate where identical plans have already been submitted to the
Building Authority for you to point this out in a letter accompanying the plans
there would then be no need to forward additional copies of plans to them.

I would add that the Council as Certificating Authority wish to see the most
efficient system possible in operation as regards Safety of Sports Grounds, and
obviously this requires a good working relationship with the representatives of
the Clubs. If you have any suggestions for improving the system or saving the
Clubs from unnecessary expense please let me know.

I have, as usual, sent a copy of this letter to Sheffield Wednesday.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

Dear Mr. Bownes,

                                                       South Stand Roof
                 During the discussions which took place at the meeting on
Tuesday, 25 November, in connection with the South stand roof,
I explained that a draft Code of Practice for snow loading has
been published in recent months which is helpful in assessing the
structural adequacy of the roof steelwork.                                        I also promised
at the meeting to let you have a note explaining more fully
what is meant by the term over-stressing.
                 Dealing first with the question of snow loading, it was
standard practice until just after the war                                      to design all buildings
to withstand a snow load of 10 lbs/sq.ft.                                       From check calculations
which we made a few years ago, it seems highly likely that this
load was used by Leitch who was the designer of this stand.                                                Almost
20 stands which he designed between the late 1890's and the
early 1930's are still in existance in England and Scotland
and all would have been designed for that snow loading.
                 In the early 1950's a Code of Practice was issued which laid
down a standard snow loading of 15 lbs/sq.ft. for roofs of any

 shape or size situated anywhere in the British Isles.
       Thus the same value was used for a building in Penzance
 where deep snow is almost unknown as would have been used for
 a building in the Cairngorm mountains of Scotland.    This was
 unscientific,but was generally very safe indeed except
 that it made no allowance for build-up of snow behind high
 parapets or due to drifting where a low building might be
 in the lee of a high building.
       At the time I wrote my letter of 12 June, 19 85, it was
 a requirement of the Building Regulations that all new buildings
 throughout the country should be designed for 15 lbs/sq.ft.
 Nevertheless a major proportion of the building stock
 in Sheffield, and of course throughout the country, was
 designed in the days when the general practice was to allow
 for only 10 lbs/sq.ft.   So far as I know, there has never
 been a case of a building properly designed for 10 lbs/sq.ft.
 which has failed in Sheffield or any other location in the
 country,except in the special cases associated with parapet
 walls or drifting due to a neighbouring building which is higher.
       It also has to be emphasised that when there are changes
 in the Building Regulations there is no requirement that buildings
 built to previous standards should be in any way strengthened
 or adopted to the new standard.      A building which had been
 given Building Regulations approval at the time of construction
 or which was in existance before the various public health
 acts automatically satisfies the law.
       A department in the Building Research Establishment has been
 studying snow loading for many years and has published various
 papers on the subject.   As a result, prudent designers started
 making special allowances for greater snow loads behind parapets
 and in the lee of higher buildings some five years ago but for
 obvious reasons, the reductions which could be made in snow
  loadings for most parts of the country according to the Building
 Research Establishment, were not applied until there was a new
 British Standard Code of Practice.

draft of the new British Standard BS:6399 which deals with snow
 loading for buildings.      Comments on this draft could be submitted
up to 30 November 1986 and those comments will now be under conÂ­
sideration.         However there is everyreason to expect that the
requirements of the draft Code will be largely unchanged when the
final version is published in a few months time.
      The most important aspect of the new Code is that it contains
a map on which the basic snow loads for various locations are
shown.      This is reproduced overleaf.    It will be seen that
Sheffield lies within a large loop bounded by a 0.6 kN/m2 line.
The required loading in Sheffield will be slightly above 0.6 kN/m2
but a correction then has to be applied depending on the height
above sea level.       The snow loads on the chart are those which
are to be designed for if the building is 100m (330 ft. approximately)
above sea level.     If the building is at a greater or lower altitude
a correction is applied with a higher snow load being applied on
high ground (say Lodge Moor) and a lower value in the lower parts
of the city (say down by the river in the East end).   The
Hillsborough ground is on the low side of the city at 70m altitude,
so after applying the correction, the design snow loading intensity
will be almost exactly 0.6 kN/m2 which is approximately 12 lbs/sq.ft.
         It also has to be kept in mind that in designing for
10 lbs/sq.ft. Leitch would have to choose steel angles which
were at least strong enough.      As with most designs, choosing
steel angles which satisfy the Code almost invariably     means
having to use an angle which is slightly bigger than is theoretically
necessary.     As a result, we can now say that when the new Code
of Practice comes into being, we shall return to a position where
the South stand at Hillsborough does satisfy the latest requirements
for snow loading as near as no matter.   I should also stress
that the required snow loading is of an intensity which can only
be expected to occur about once in 50 years.With a snowfall of
this intensity there should be no question of the ground being in
use for football therefore endangering spectators.   It might be
thought that in the strict terms of the law the City Council has a

 special responsibility for football grounds even when no
 spectators are present, but the common sense of the situation
 is that many other buildings in the city designed in the same
 era as the   South stand will be fully occupied by work people.
 If the extremely remote possibility of overloading by snow
 is tolerable by society in these many other buildings which
 are occupied by large numbers of people, the City Council could
 in my view be acting reasonably in not being too concerned
 about an empty Hillsborough stadium.
       Another matter which it is extremely important to explain
 to lay members of the Committee is that if a roof is designed
 for say 12 lbs/sq.ft. of snow load, it will not fall down if
 the snow load is say 13 lbs.sq.ft.     The working stresses which
 are allowed in the steel roof trusses contain an inherent factor
 of safety of about 1.65.    This applies both to the self weight
 of the structure and also the snow.     The self weight of the
 struct-axe is of course constant so that this means that the
 roof would not be expected to collapse until the snow load
 reached about 25 lbs.sq.ft. . Hence if in a once in a 100 years
 storm, the snow load reached 15 lbs.sq.ft., the roof would
 still be perfectly safe.
       Turning now to the question of wind loading, our check
 calculations carried out some year ago showed that the roof
 was probably designed for wind intensities similar to those
 which were applied to the design of buildings prior to 1972.
 Typically, a building in an exposed part of Sheffield was
 designed to resist winds of 72 m.p.h.     As a result of several
 intense gales in localised parts of the country (the Sheffield
 gale of 1962 and the Glasow gale of 1969) which caused a great
 deal of damage to roofs and sheeting, a new Code of Practice
 was issued in 1972.    This gives a basic wind speed for Sheffield
 of 103 m.p.h. although corrections are made for the degree
 of exposure of the building and for height.
       If this 1972 Code is applied to the roof of the South
 stand, it is found that in the uplift condition (a gale blowing
 into the open front of the stand from the north) , the bottom tie
EASTW OOD & PARTNERS




 of the roof truss becomes overstressed.    (I will discuss
 the term overstressing in more detail later in this letter).
       At the time the new wind loading code was introduced
 there was very considerable opposition amongst practising
 engineers.   There is little doubt that wind gusts of the
 intensity laid down in the Code are experienced at any particular
 location about once in 50 years.    Nevertheless, the experience
 of engineers had shown that if frames of buildings were designed
to the'Old Code, they were perfectly satisfactory.      Indeed, in
an open discussion at the Institution of Structural Engineers
I issued a challenge to anyone to find a single structural
member properly designed to the pre-1972 Code which had failed
under wind loading.    I knew from my own investigations in the
aftermath Â°f t^ie Sheffield gale that although many roof tiles
and roof sheets were lost and old walls blew over, there was
no instance of any structural member including walls which
fully satisfied the old Code having failed.    The Building
Research Establishment which, produced the data on which the
Code was based searched their records to see whether I was right
and they also could not find a single building in the United
Kingdom where a structure properly designed according to the
old Code had failed.
      With this in mind, I have every confidence in the many
buildings in Sheffield designed before 1972 being completely
adequate in freak gales, and this does of course apply to the
south stand at Hillsborough.     I should also point out that
if there were a gale of such an intensity that it only occurs
once in 50 years, with gusts of 103 miles per hour, there could
be no question of a football match being in progress.     Thus, there
will be no danger to spectators.
      The word "overstressed".which appeared in one of m y earlier
letters to the predecessor licensing authority has I think been
misunderstood.    A little explanation is necessary. In order
to make it easy for your committee to understand I will explain
the design process using stresses which are expressed in old
imperial units.                                           '

                                                               3cr

       A piece of steel used in the construction of a roof truss
might typically have a guaranteed yield stress of say 16 tons/sq.inch.
 In order to achieve a factor of safety of say 1.6 the structural
designer provides sufficient steel in the structure to ensure
that under the design conditions, the stress in the steel does
not exceed say 10 tons/sq.inch.    If, due to some overload
condition, the stresses in the steel   .rises to 11 tons/sq.inch,
we would say that the steel is overstressed by 10%.      However
 this does not mean that there is any risk of the steel yielding.
Yield will not take place until the stress reaches 16 tons/sq.inch.
There is therefore no danger of the structure failing and collapsing.
Thus, when in an earlier letter I referred to parts of the
 South stand roof being over-stressed when analysed using the wind
 loads given in the 1972 Code, I was merely saying that the
 stress would be higher than that recommended, but there would
nevertheless still be a very handsome factor of safety against
the roof deforming and collapsing.
       Structural designers have of course always used good
 factors of safety in this country with the result that it is
completely unknown for a properly designed steel frame or
concrete framed building to collapse and    cause death or injury.
       The other matter which caused some concern in 1979 when
the first safety certificate was issued was the fact that
trusses near the eastern end of the stand are leaning.      At that
 time, the likely cause was unknown and there was also concern
 in case the roof was gradually falling over.As a result of
 investigations which we carried out,which showed that the bolted
 connections between the timber purlins and the steel trusses
were sound and undistorted,it became apparent that the movement
 had been caused by the purlins shrinking as they dried out.        Once
 this had occurred there has been no subsequent movement.     The
 roof is close boarded and that form of construction gives
 considerable resistance to racking movement.
       With the passage of time, the nails fixing the roof boarding
 may become rusted thus reducing the resistance to further

 appear when the roof is highly loaded by a freak        snow storm
 or wind.Under these conditions there will be no danger
 to spectators.
       We do of course have to consider the safety of people
working in the    offices at ground floor level, but as pointed
out at the meeting on 25 November, there are two concrete
decks between the roof and the offices at ground floor level.
The reinforcement in these decks will ensure that if the
roof fell,it would not cause the building to collapse.
The reinforcement will resist the impact load of the roof
 falling even    if this necessitates catenary action.    I should
explain thatall new     buildings over five storeys high have
to be checked nowadays to ensure that if there were an
explosion on an upper floor, the floors of lower storeys
will be able     to take the extra weight due to collapse of the
superstructure.      It is perfectly legitimate to adopt the
same philosophy in considering the south stand as that which
is used for large public buildings of more than five storeys.
       The overall position therefore is that in the light
of the proposed new Code of Practice on snow loading, the roof
will come very close to having a normal factor of safety.           And
although the roof was not designed to meet the requirements of
the 1972 wind loading code, this should be viewed against the
background that there is no known case of a roof properly
designed to the old Code failing due to wind.        Finally, the
 leaning of the roof almost certainly took place within a very
short time of the roof being constructed as the timbers
dried out, and there will have been no subsequent movement.
 In the light of its age (almost 75 years old) it will obviously
be prudent to replace the roof within a reasonable period but
in my view, the City Council will be acting perfectly reasonably
 if it permits   the replacement to be delayed by up to five years.
 This will enable the Club to set aside the necessary money over
 a reasonable period.

Dear Graham,
              You may       have gathered that we carried out testing
of the crush barriers around the stadium as part of the
certification procedure.                                     We test approximately one fifth
of the barriers each year so that each receives a test load
once in five years as recommended in the green guide.                                            In
addition, we do a visual inspection of every barrier on an annual
basis.
      It had been the practice to test the barriers on Spion
Kop in three annual instalments and to do those at the Leppings
Lane end in two instalments.                                      The barriers which were due to be
tested this year were all on the Kop and so the work was delayed
until after the work on the roof had been completed and the
tests were carried out during September.                                     I reported on the
tests to Dick Chester on 26 September 1986.                                        A copy of the
report was sent to Sheffield City Council.
              I now have pleasure in enclosing our fee account for this
work.
                                                                      Yours sincerely,

  Dear Graham,
                                              South Stand Roof
                 You will know that following the meeting with
  representatives of the Licensing Authority which was held
  at Hillsborough on 25 November, I undertook to write a note
  regarding the structural stability of the South stand roof.
  A copy of the note dated 19 December is enclosed for your
  records.                The Chairman already has a copy and I have also
  passed copies to Keith Addy and Ernest Barron, both of whom
  were good enough to support me at the meeting with the
  Town Council on 5 January..
        You will probably have heard that the General Purposes
  Committee decided that subject to agreement between the Club
  and the Building Surveyors Department regarding some bracing
  to give additional stability, the roof would be acceptable for
  up to five years.                              I will be entering into discussions with the
  Building Surveyors Department fairly shortly.     I have discussed
  the matter with the Chairman and it has been agreed that provided
  the measures which are requested do not .cost more than about
   Â£7000 - Â£8000,1 can go ahead on your behalf.

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




          I shall of course start from the basic position that
in my view no bracing is necessary but tactically I think
the Club will have to concede a little.      I shall try to limit
the amount that has to be spent to a figure as far below the
maximum which the Chairman has set as possible.

For the attention of Mr G Mackrell

Dear Graham

                   New Entrance to Car Park from Penistone Road

             We have received four tenders for the work associated with
forming the new entrance from Penistone Road.                                        I opened the tenders,
in the presence of Mr A Jones, who prepared the contract documents,
on Monday 19 January 1987.
             The total tender sums given                          inthe documents are as follows:-

             R M Walker Construction Limited                                           Â£27,073.00
             A J Loveland Limited                                                      Â£28,575.00
             W Torry & Company Limited                                                 Â£34,058.28
             Messrs J Lee & Sons                                                       Â£34,650.00

             Each of the tenders includes a contingency sum of Â£2,000 which
may or may not need to be expended. Also included in each tender
is a provisional sum of Â£1,300 for the installation of two illuminated
signs which the Club may wish to have erected                                   on the new gable walls,
to identify the entrance to the Sports Hall.                                    We would need the
approval of the Local Authority for the size and position of the
signs before placing an order for them.
             We were expecting to have to pay the local authority Lighting
Division for moving the lamp standard in the pavement outside the


                              An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144
EASTWOOD &- PARTNERS



new entrance. However, we have been able to argue that as the
lighting standards along Penistone Road are to be replaced by the
Local Authority soon anyway, there should be no charge to the Club.
This argument has been accepted.
       R M Walker Construction Limited have stated that they expect
the work to take twelve weeks to complete.      To add to this is a
period of about six weeks which is the time needed by the various
Local Authority Departments and Statutory Undertakings to cut off         *â 
and make safe the      services to the two properties.   So, from the
date of receiving      an order from the Club you can expect the Contractor
to complete the work within eighteen weeks.
       Not included inthe tender is any surfacing on the existing
car park and any new fences at the back of the North Stand that you
may consider necessary to isolate the gymnasium and car park from
other parts of the ground.     These are two points which Dick Chester
said could probably be considered at a later date, if any difficulties
were experienced.
       We recommend    that the tender submitted by R M Walker Construction
Limited is accepted and in     anticipation that you agree with our
recommendation, we enclose a draft of an order from Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club pic to R M Walker.
       Also enclosed are single prints of our drawings 7593/1A and 2.

                             Yours sincerely

Chairman,
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC,
c/o Presto Tools,
Penistone Road,
Sheffield 6.


Dear Chairman,
                                              South Stand Roof
                First I should report that we have still not received
 a copy of the letter which you have had from David Bownes.
Quite by chance, a few minutes after you telephoned me,
Mr. D. Sheriff of the Building Surveyors Department, rang me
on another matter and I was able to establish that he also had
gained the impression that the five year reprieve had been
 granted subject to his department reaching agreement with us
on minor remedial works and maintenance,and the Committee was
 not deferring its decision until it had received another report.
                A few days later, Mr. Sheriff telephoned to say that he
 had now been asked to put in a report to the General Purposes
 Panel for its meeting on 2 February and that this left very
 little time for us to negotiate an agreement.
                Needless to say, it has not been possible to reach
 agreement in the time available.                                   Mr. Sheriff wishes to inspect
 the top boom member of every roof truss as                                    he suspects that
 these will not have been painted over the years and are now heavily
 corroded.            He therefore requested that we should scaffold the
 full length of the stand a bay at a time.                                     As it would have cost
 about Â£600 per bay, I refused to countenance such a suggestion or
                                 An Unlimited Company, Registered in England - No. 1833144                       ^
                                                                  SHEET

even his alternative suggestion that we should do every alternate
bay.   For the time being he has agreed that we should inspect
the trusses either side of the TV access platform and as much
of the top boom as can reasonably be looked at from a ladder
at the back of the stand.     Depending on the findings, I hope
to be able to persuade him that nothing further is necessary
in that regard.
       He is still wishing to have some additional bracing
installed but I have persuaded him that it should be left to
us to make proposals.     In that way, I think that we have a
better chance of limiting what is eventually agreed.
       The discussions have been kept at a very friendly level
and as a result, I have been given in confidence a copy of the
report which is going to the Committee on 2 February.     A photoÂ­
copy is enclosed.     The important parts are the recommendations
at the end.     If taken literally, these can have very considerable
financial implications but I think there is plenty of scope
for "damage limitation1'.
       My   feeling is that there is no need for us to request
permission to be present at the meeting next Monday but if the
Club so wished, I can arrange to attend.


                                 Yours sincerely,

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Graham,
                                Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                          Cracked Beams in North Stand
                During last Summers inspection cracks in two concrete beams
in the North stand were noticed by two members of the Officer
Working Party.                     We knew that the cracks were there and they have
probably been present, though not as wide, for many years.                                                 However,
we were asked by the Officer Working Party to have the concrete
repaired.
                Although the cracks are wide, and in one case the end corner
of the beam has now come away there is no danger of a failure at
present.             But the reinforcement of the concrete beams is open to the
atmosphere and will continue to corrode.                                       This will result in
further damage which could eventually lead to some danger.                                                 As
damage progresses the repairs will become more expensive.
       Having looked at the cracks again last week we believe that the
time has come to have the repairs carried out.                                             We have spoken to a
local specialist who has given us a price of E5J.0.00 for repairing
the broken beam end and for also injecting the crack with epoxy
material. The repair of concrete using epoxy materials requires the
services of a specialist and there are not many suitable firms in 0 JO

 the country.   We doubt whether any firm from outside Sheffield
 will be able to give a lower price for the work.
        We consider that Â£510.00 is a reasonable price and therefore
 recommend that the Club employ V.A. Crookes (Contracts) Ltd. to
 carry out the repair.
        Enclosed is a copy of their quotation.   Perhaps the matter
 could be given consideration by the Club so that the repairs can
 be completed before the next visit of the Officer Working Party,
 whichis likely to be in February.
        If you want to see the cracks for yourself, walk   along the
 ground floor of the North Stand, from the Spion Kop end, and the
 cracked beams are just past entrance N, at high level, one over
 the bar, the other over the ladies toilet.

Dear Graham,

              Thank you for your letter dated 7 February 1987 referring to
the various matters discussed at last week's board meeting.                                                Progress
on the items is as follows:-


a)            South Stand Roof

              After our meeting on Monday afternoon we inspected the south
stand roof.             We saw that there is probably a fairly simple method
of providing sufficient bracing in the roof.                                      Design calculations
and a drawing are now being prepared so that our proposals can be
forwarded to the local authority for comment.


b)            North Stand Roof

              Drawings and tender documents are almost complete and will be
 issued within the next day or so.                                  The tenders are due back on
 11 March, in plenty of time for the next board meeting.


c)           Entrance to the Car Park from Penistone Road

      We have had a meeting with R. M. Walker Limited this morning
 and they intend to begin demolition on 23 March 1987. Your official
 order has been given to them, thank you.

d)   Cracked Beams in the North Stand
     By the time you receive this letter we expect that the repairs
will have been completed.


e)   "Stand's" Public House
     We have sent a letter of intent to Re-mastic Limited and
materials are now ordered.    They expect to begin work within seven
to ten days, depending upon deliveries of materials.
     Perhaps an official order should be sent to them from the Club.
A draft of a possible order is enclosed.
     Although it is too early to begin painting the outside of the
property, we are obtaining prices for painting and woodwork repairs.
The work is probably best done during the summer or autumn, after the
woodwork has had the chance to dry out.


f)   Further Safety and Maintenance Work

     As we mentioned in our meeting last Monday, the steel frame
supporting Gate 'A' at Leppings Lane is severely corroded and over
the last few months has begun to lean outwards.    We have prepared
a drawing showing repairs and strengthening of the stanchions on
either side.   Tenders for the work will be issued shortly.    Included
in that work are several other small items of safety work, requested
last year by the Officer Working Party.     We will report on the
tenders in time for the next board meeting.

                              Yours sincerely,

  Dear Sir,

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
  have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
  received them as yet.

  The Police have indicated that as at 6th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
  with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
  receive is very satisfactory.

  The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
  information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
  letter have now been further clarified as follows 5â

  (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
  from the walkways.

  (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
  dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

  (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
  cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

   I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would
   particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of fina*
   exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
   the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
   their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
   Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
   better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry rom    e
   outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this Jjook
   type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than tne
   current locks, about which they are very concerned.

   Encs.
   BH                                                                                          734005 - Hr. Bownes

                                                                                             .......................(STD Code 0742)

Would you please let me have your comments on the Fire Service letter as soon as
possible.

Yours faithfully.

Dear Bill,

             I was somewhat worried to get the Bttached letter.

             Is the movement Intended, or is It Imagined? I would like your
professional opinion.

             Kind regards.

                                  Yours sincerely,




                                  H.E.McGee

Dear Graham,
               Following the receipt of the copy of the letter from
Mr-         which referred to movement in the deck of the
Kop at high level, John Strange has had a careful look when
the Kop was empty. There are no signs that any movement of
the concrete steps has occurred.
               As I said in my letter of 10 March, there would be no
cause for concern if some parts of the deck were deflected
as much as 1| inches when the Kop is fully occupied.                                             But the
spectators are not aware of this deflection because it gradually
builds up as the crowd gathers and then gradually reduces as
they leave.
      We know that there is very slight springiness if someone
jumps on the deck, and a slight vibration can be felt.   This
arises mainly because the frame is of steel, which is more springy
and has less 'damping' than concrete.   I think M r . m u s t
have felt this vibration when someone purposely jumped.                                              I suspect
the movement was less than one-hundredth of an inch, but as I said
beforejthe human frame is so sensitive to vibration that the movement
feels much more.   It is not at all uncommon to have statements that
'it moves an inch' when the true position is that the movement was
probably not more than one hundredth of an inch.

           There is absolutely no cause for concern.   If Mr.     is at
     all worried, ask him to phone John Strange before he next attends
     a match and John will meet him at the top of the Kop and chat with
     him about the design.


                                   Yours sincerely,

Dear Mr.

Thank you for your recent letter.

I an delighted that the transport authority are now providing football
specials fran the Shiregreen estate and trust that you and other
supporters now find the situation acceptable.

With regard to the concrete on the Kop I have drawn the matter to the
attention of our Architects and have been assured that it is structually
sound. I take your point however that one cannot be too careful when
safety is concerned and will advise you once again when I have received
a formal response.

Yours sincerely,




G.H. Mackrell

                                      Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                           Safety Work 1987
                   Thank you for your letter dated 27 May.
                   Referring to the last paragraph, I understand that on 28
April, John Strange spoke to you about the possible courses of
action that could be taken in response to the letter dated 22
April from David Bownes, and it was agreed that perhaps a
meeting with the respective members of the Officer Working Party
would be the best way of dealing with the matter.
                   It was our intention to wait until the summer meeting to
discuss the matters raised in David Bownes' letter but if you wish
we would be willing to meet the Fire Officer and David Bownes sooner.
                   Before Sheffield City Council took over the responsibility for
administration of the Safety Certificate regular meetings were held
twice a year, one in the winter and one in the summer. You will have
noticed that this is no longer the case, the last meeting with the
Officer Working Party being last August.                                                                There are advantages in
having fewer meetings.                                         It is less costly to the Club, but it means
there is likely to be more correspondence.                                                                      We have less chance to
deal with matters before people have committed themselves in writing.
It is then difficult to persuade the writer that in many instances

 their comments are misdirected or inaccurate, which is largely
 the case with the letter from the Fire Service.
       If you wish us to organise a meeting perhaps you would
 let John know a convenient date.   I suggest it should be held
 at the ground so that we can inspect the items mentioned in the
 Fire Officerâs letter.

                              Yours sincerely

 For the attention of Mr. R. Walker,


 Dear Sirs,

                                    Safety Work 1987 - Barrier Repairs

                 Recent load tests have revealed that certain barriers
  on Spion Kop have failed to satisfy the requirements of the
  test procedures set out in Guide to Safety at Sports
  Grounds.                     Those barriers need to be repaired ready for use
  by the public for the first home game on Tuesday 18 August
  K.O. 7.30 p.m.
                  Please find enclosed two prints of each of our
  Drawings 9305/1, 2, 3 and 4 showing details of the repair
  work.                  The specification for the concrete and steelwork is
  the same as that for the new entrance contract.

                  Would          you be kind enough to send us a price for the
  work shown on the Drawings.                                               If your price is acceptable
  we propose to add the work to your present contract with
  the Club for the other items of repair work.

                   It may be worthwhile for you to speak to George Shaw
   about the metalwork part of the job.                                              His firm has done
  that type of work for us in previous seasons.

Dear Sirs,

                          New Bracings in South Stand Roof
                                             1         --

          Whilst the scaffolding is in place at the west end of the stand
would you please supply and fix four timber purlins 150 x 57 along
side the following existing purlins which have been found to be split.
The timbers are to be tanalised or liberally treated with a water
borne brush applied preservative.                                  Each purlin is to bemeasured                                  on
site and cut to suit (the purlins are approximately 4.2m long).                                                                  Please
remove the bolt at each end of the old purlin and fit new bolts,
through the new purlin and old purlin and into the steel cleat on
top of the truss. Install 8 No. 120mm long nails, at equal staggered
spacings, to secure the new to the old purlins.

1)        First bay from the west gable, purlin No. 2 (counting from the
          back, including the rear purlin).
2)        First bay from the west gable, purlin No. 5.
3)        Second      bay              from the west gable, purlin No. 4 .
4)        Second      bay             from the west gable, purlin No. 7.

                                                       Yours faithfully.

         The barriers which have been repaired can be tested again
  next year.
         Although safely supporting the test load, it was noticed
 that the concrete support post number 9 of barrier 98 and the
  terracing around support number 5 of barrier 1 10 was cracked.
 Those two items should be closely inspected next year and
  repaired if they have deteriorated.
         Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
  results of the tests on the barriers.


                                            Yours sincerely,

   Dear Sir,

   Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 Edition

    I refer to the revised Guide which was recently published by H.M. Government
    following the Poppelwell Report. I would like to draw your attention to the new
    Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled "Management Responsibility".

    This Chapter sets out in detail the sort of matters which ground management
    should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management of
    designated stadia should be entirely familiar with it and follow its guidance.

    Would you please, therefore, confirm in writing:â

    (a) that you have obtained and intend to retain on the premises a copy of the
        Guide;

    (b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and intend
        to perform the management duties outlined in Chapter 2 of the Guide; the
        Company should also take immediate steps to appoint a Safety Officer as
        defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should be sent to
        the Council as soon as possible.
u Yours           faithfully

          Dear Sir,

          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
          Annual Inspection of the Sheffield Wednesday Stadium -
          6th August, 1987___________________________        _____

          I enclose for your attention a list of comments made by Officers arising from
          the above inspection.

          I anticipate that during the course of your Clubs' normal maintenance
          arrangements many of the items listed will have already been attended to.                                            Would
          you please let me have your comments on the points raised in due course.

          If you require any clarification of the individual comments made you will see
          that on the right-hand side of the sheet an abreviation of the title of the
          Department/Authority concerned. At the end of the list is a Schedule showing
          the appropriate Officers to contact if necessary.

          The Fire Service has recently reminded me that no reply has yet been received to
          my letter of 22nd April enclosing their letter of 18th February. You will
          recall that you were asked in that letter to comment on the points raised by the
          Fire Service and I would appreciate those comments as soon as possible. I take
          the view that it is appropriate for a Certificate Holder to have the opportunity
          to comment on the views, of Officers before final decisions are taken on works
          that are required. If, however, you do not wish to avail yourself of this
          opportunity to comment please let me know so that appropriate requirements can
          be framed.

          I have passed a copy of this letter onto Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.
    JL*
          Yours faithfully,

1.0   Spion Kop

1.1   The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main
      means of escape exit route from the KOP should be removed, since
                                                                                    /
      it is causing both a high risk and a narrowing of the escape
      width.                                                       B.S.

1.2   A broken concrete post supporting the end of a crush barrier                   /
      adjacent to the tunnel exit at the north end of the KOP to be                 *
      removed,' and the crush barrier be modified to join onto the end
      of the new steel supported barrier directly adjacent to it.             B.S.

1.3   A timber hut at ground level, under the KQP structure should be
      removed.                                                        B.S.
                                                                                      /
1.4   An additional length of crush barrier is required to be installed              *?
       adjacent to the base of the ramped stairway from the extended
       terracing. This was agreed on site by Dr.Eastwood.                     B.S.

1.5   An area of the corrugated metal sheeting used ascladding to the
      side of the Kop is corroded and tom.                                    HCS

1.6   It was noted that in some places the stair nosings serving radial       ââ y
      gangways had become defective.                                          HCS

1.7   At some positions within the new development there is a
      difference in height between a terraced area and radial gangway                *7
      of over 600mm. As such these areas require to be protected by a                 '
       suitably constructed pedestrian guardrail.                             HCS

1.8   Some areas of the front terracing were found to be in need of
      minor repairs. It was agreed, however, that this defect would be
      adequately controlled by means of "ongoingâ maintenance.                HCS
                                                                                         /

       Binding wire ties are not considered to be satisfactory for this
       purpose.

       Additionally the sign brackets adjacent to seats 62 and 72 are to
       be correctly bent (or otherwise suitably checked) and secured.

3.2    Rain water drainage holes through the upper level slab should
       have a gauze inserted so as to inhibit the dropping of missiles
       onto the crowd below.                                               B.S.

3.3    It is felt that discussion should take place regarding the
       suitability of the gate fastening device at the base of the
       emergency exit stairway on the south end of this stand. The
       fastening consisting of a patent lockable barrel bolt which
       cannot easily be unfastened in the direction of travel, and is
       impossible to be unfastened from the other side.                    B.S.

       Miscellaneous Points

4.1    At a number of points within the stadium various pieces of
       abandoned builders' waste were readily available for use as
       projectiles by the crowd. Such material should be collected and
       suitably disposed of.                                               HCS

4.2    The main first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate

       first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should they
       become ill or injured within the sports ground.                     HCS

4.3     The provision of qualified first aiders is being reviewed atthe
                                                                                 /

Dear Graham

                                     Safety of Sports Grounds Act 19 75
                                                   Gate Release Devices

             During the August inspection one of the points raised
by the Fire Service and Police was that the pitch periÂ­
meter gates cannot be opened easily if at the same time
they are being pushed from the terrace side.                                                       There is
sufficient friction to prevent the sliding bolts from being
operated.

              There was also some criticism of the release devices
on the folding shutter doors, but I think we can fight
them off on that particular issue.

              As I mentioned to you on Thursday 14 January we have
received two tenders for a prototype of a release device,
which we designed, together with a price for the
manufacture of eleven more devices if the prototype is
accepted by the Officer Working Party.                                              A sketch of the
device was sent to them and we received general approval
subject to a site trial.
               Copies of the tenders are enclosed.                                          Three firms were
 invited to tender but only two have submitted prices.

               As requested I have written to Specialist Welding &
Engineering Services Ltd., on behalf of the Club,

J . A. Strange                 A. J . Clough                             R. Tandy                      J . M . Wood

also enclosed.

     I will invite the Officer Working Party to inspect
the prototype after it has been fitted.

Dear Graham,
                                         South Stand, Fire Certificate
                                          Fire Precautions Act 1971

    At the meeting with Fire Officer ________________ last Friday
we agreed to have three things done to the offices at the back
 of the kitchen of 'Steps' restaurant.
     a) To remove the internal door between Steve Russell's office
 and the secretary's office.
     b) To remove the fridge which at present obscures the vision
 panel in the secretary's office wall.
     c) To fit a self closing device to the door between the lobby
 at end of the bridge at the kitchen.
     The fire officer accepted that the office construction
 probably gave half hour protection. We are lucky that he did not
 ask for any major work doing.
     He was not happy that the vision panel between the ticket
 office and main office had not been fitted. I told him the reason
 why and he is                to take up the question ofBuilding Regulations
 Approval with                his colleagues, but we canexpect a fight with them.

                                                                       Yours sincerely,

Dear Graham,

                                    Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975

                 As requested the other day I have replied to David
Bownes1 letter dated 22 April, 1987 and the
accompanying letter dated 18 February, 1987 from the
Fire Service.                    A copy of our letter is enclosed.                                        I have
marked in the margin where action is needed by the Club.
They are minor matters and some may have already been
attended to.

               As requested in your letter dated 8 January, 1988 we
reply to your letter dated 22 April, 1987 and the letter
from Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 18 February.                                                        We
reply in the same order as the letter from the Fire
Service, for easy reference.


               Means of Escape in Case of Fire

               North Stand

                       With the exception of a small hut and the steel
               clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
               located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
               clad buildings have been removed.
                       We believe that the reference in the minutes
               dated 7 August, 1985 was to storage facilities and
               not to buildings.

     removed so that the width of the exit route is not
     reduced.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.
     c)   Some of the concrete terrace steps have been
     repaired but, as has always been accepted, the
     repairs will continue to be a regular maintenance
     job .
     d)   The intention of the mesh was not to prevent
     people from climbing onto the steelwork but to act
     as a guard preventing spectators damaging and
     possibly loosening the rear sheeting.
          We disagree that spectators climb onto the
     steelwork in large numbers although we do not deny
     that the police have, at some matches, had to tell
     a few spectators not to sit on the steelwork.
          The cost of erecting a full height fence
     would be several thousands of pounds.    The Club is
     not at present contemplating that magnitude of
     expenditure just to protect a few spectators from
     their own foolish behaviour.
     e)   There are four or five lengths of barrier
     where the drop in front is just over one metre,
     but as far as we are aware this has not created
     any hazard.    In fact to the contrary, because
     people can leave the ground by going under the
     barriers onto the lateral gangway.    This is a
     common feature of most league grounds.
          The welding is performing well and it seems
     that any additional vertical support is
     unnecessary.    However, the welding can be inspected
     at regular intervals to make sure that it conÂ­
     tinues to hold the mesh securely.

     f)    Exit gates are unlocked before spectators enter
     the ground.     The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand

     a)   Do we understand correctly that the
     reference to 'timber framed and clad units' is to
     the bar fittings at first floor level?        If so, then
     those fittings were part of the original construction
     for which Building Regulations Approval has been
     granted.     There has not been any previous comment
     about the presence of the bar fittings in that stand
     or other stands.     We do not consider that they
     present a hazard.
     b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
     letter dated 15 January.

     South Stand

     a)    (i)    We note the comment about the doors and
     this point has been dealt with under the regular
     procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
     the Fire Precautions Act of 1971 for the offices.
     Fire Officer                    has been dealing with
     the matter.
         (ii)          We see the principle behind the creation
     of fire compartments.     That is sensible.     Sealing
     off the windows is not difficult but the provision
     of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
     very expensive.     A major exercise such as providing
     ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
     redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.
EASTWOOD fr PARTNERS                                         SHEET




          (iii)     We agree that stored materials should be
     removed from stairways and exit routes.       There is a
     particular problem outside the kitchen area, at
     ground floor level, but the caterers have been asked
     to clear that particular area well before the public
     are admitted on match days.
     b)       (i)   It was agreed in 1979 that the fans
     ventilating the lounges at first floor level should
     be fitted with intumescent grilles with smoke
     controlled shutters.       Those grilles and shutters
     were fitted although we see that two recently
     installed fans do not appear to have similar grilles
     and shutters.      As the form of fire protection from
     those lounges has already been agreed with the Fire
     Service, the Club are not prepared to have ducting
     installed, although the new fans should perhaps be
     fitted with intumescent grilles and smoke controlled
     shutters.
           (ii)     A close inspection of the gas supply pipeÂ­
     work in the five bars revealed that four bars have
     valves fitted to the feed pipe or to the appliance
     when there is only one appliance in the bar.         The
     pipework in the bar nearest to the Spion Kop has
     been replaced recently but without a valve.
               However, there is a master valve, at
     ground floor level, which isolates the gas supply
     to the whole of the first floor.       That valve was
     installed at the request of the Fire Service in
     1980.
         (iii)         We confirm that all the timber facing onto
     the public circulation areas was treated with an
     intumescent paint during the work carried out in
     19 80.     Since then the walls have been re-decorated
EASTWOOD & PARTNERS                                         SHEET




     but this does not reduce the effect of the
     intumescent paint underneath.
            (iv)         We cannot understand this comment because
     the paint store was constructed in its present
     position on the advice of the Fire Officer.        A
     special 'non-sparking' light fitting was even
     installed on his recommendation.        It is not contemÂ­
     plated to move the store again after spending money
     to build the store in its present position.
             (v)    We do not consider that the two laminate
     covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.        As for the
     wooden cupboards, they have been on the first floor
     for many years and no previous adverse comments
     have been made by the Fire Service about their
     presence.
            (vi)    We agree that the holes round the cables
     should be plugged with, an appropriate fire resisting
     material.
           (vii)    As far as we are aware all doors leading
     onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
     areas were provided with 25mm rebates and the doors
     made up to a nominal one hour standard.        That work
     was done in 1979-80.
          (viii)    We agree that the spaces above toilet
     accommodates should not be used for storage but
     believe that the Club have now removed the stored
     materials.

     c)      We    believe that clinbing over the existing low
     wall does not present any difficulty in the event
     of an emergency.        Spectators will go over the wall
     whether there are gates or not.        We do not consider
     that the installation of gates is necessary.

     d)   Escape through the rear of the stand has always
     been accepted by the Officer Working Party.     FurtherÂ­
     more, it has been readily accepted with the
     protection which has been provided so far to the
     escape routes.


     Automatic Fire Protection

          We will suggest to the Club that proposals
     should be put forward for the provision of a fire
     detection system but the system is not likely to be
     installed until the major re-development of the South
     stand which is planned for 1991

     Emergency Lighting

          Testing of the emergency lighting system is
     being organised and we will be contacting the Fire
     Service in the next day or so to agree a date and
     time for carrying out the test.
          The testing of the general electrical circuits
     will also be organised over the next few weeks and
     a current IEE Certificate produced.

     Fire Alarms

          The Club was told by the Fire Service to put
     the call points in the bars in the stands.    Moving
     the call points again is out of the question.

     Inidcator/Control Panel

          The Officer Working Party was asked, at the
     time of installation, where the indicator/central
     panel should be placed.     The Club was told that it
     should be located in the Police control centre,
     where it is now.     No duplicate panel was asked for
     and it is not considered that one is necessary.

     Gates
             The comments about the gates are noted.


     The Club have expressed to us their increasing conÂ­
cern that with the introduction of each new member of the
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors.     Whereas we agree that   many
of the observations and recommendations are of a
subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion.     Some consistency in the comments
offered by members of the Officer Working Party would be
appreciated.

             Further to our telephone conversation held on 25 February I have
pleasure in enclosing single photocopies of the two quotes obtained
for the I.E.E. Certificate Work.                                         I have accepted, on the Club's
behalf the quotation from H.E. Barnes (Electrical) Ltd.                                                        A copy of
our letter is enclosed. Both firms said that they could not start
the work for two weeks because they each need their specialist
electrician who is experienced in that type of work,to become
free from present jobs.
     Be prepared, after the completion of the initial testing, for
some expenditure associated with items that require immediate
attention and other items that should be attended to in the near
future.
     After that work has been completed those particular circuits
will need re-testing so that they can be included on the Certificate.
             We will be able to advise on the present loading on the mains
after the initial testing has been done.
                                                                Yours sincerely,

 Dear Sirs

 RE:   SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB - ELECTRICAL INSTALLATIONS

 Further to our recent visit we are pleased to provide the following
 estimate of costs for carrying out an inspection and test of the
 installation throughout the ground.

 We wouid examine, test, check the functioning of the electrical equipment
 in the following areas:-

  1) The mains switchgear room including flood lighting controls.
  2) Outgoing sub-mains cables.
, 3).Lighting towers-                      __
  4) Sub-mains cupboards and fuseboards generally.
  5) Power and lighting final circuits to all areas both inside andoutside
      including the restaurant etc.
 6) Lighting fittings, sockets outlets, flexes to appliances (butnot the
      appliances themselves) and generally other fixed equipment.

 All tests and inspections will be done randomly on final circuits to give
 an indication:of condition of each group of items generally.

 A IEE regulations test certificate will be provided. This will detail any
 important and serious defects'or conditions.. We anticipate a further list
 of items reporting situations in which alteration would be desirable.

 We have allowed the following ^period to be worked.

 An approved electrician (15th certificate), assisted by a trainee to attend
 for 2 weeks. We have also included for the pair to spend 3 periods of 4
 hours outside normal hours to test installations which cannot be turned off
 during normal working hours or are not convenient to be done at that time.

 PRICE    Â£1471.00      + VAT.   (ESTIMATE).
 Terms Strictly Nett 28 days.

 We trust that the above meets with your requirements.
 Yours faithfully                                                                            On i

    Dear Graham,
                                           Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                                                            Gate Release Devices

                  As related to you on 10 March we have discovered that the
     recently installed gate release devices can be tampered with at the
     Leppings Lane end by spectators on the terrace.                                    This is because
     the mesh at that end is 100 x 75 as opposed to the 50 x 50 at the
     Spion Kop end. The mesh at the Leppings Lane end was changed for
     the larger size, without our knowledge at the time,a few years ago.
                  To prevent tampering with the devices we have instructed the

#    contractor to replace the larger mesh on the gates with the smaller
     pattern. We have also instructed them to adjust the fit of the
     gates. Some of them did not fit properly and would not open freely,
     One of the gate frames at the Leppings Lane end has been damaged by
     probably a vehicle going round the perimeter track.                                             This was done
     at least two years ago, I noticed.
          The additional work to the gates and fitting the new mesh*
     is likely to cost approximately Â£600 and together with the gate
     release devices the total cost will be between Â£1040 and Â£1100.
                  We have been told that the new mesh will be fitted during
     the week commencing 21 March and two days will be needed to
     complete the work.

 Dear Sirs,
                        Crush Barrier Testing - Safety at Sports Grounds
              We act as consulting engineers to a number of football clubs,
 one of which has sent us a copy of your letter of 14 April
 enclosing your booklet showing testing of crush barriers on
 football grounds.
              I am most concerned to see the equipment which is
 apparently being used to test the barriers.                                                              There are
 two essential elements, these being the horizontal rail and
 the other being the vertical supports.                                                       The horizontal rail
 is often continuous over two or more spans and it is essential
 in these circumstances that the barriers be tested two bays at
 a time.              The horizontal load on each of the two rails needs
 to be reasonably uniformly distributed which generally means
 applying point loads at not less than four places in each of
 the two spans, that is at eight places in all.   The equipment
 which is used to apply these loads needs to be either
 hydraulically activated so that it is certain that each of the
 eight points receives the same load, or if it is done through
 linkages, there needs to                               be pinned joints at each linkage point
 so as to ensure that all loading points receive the same thrust.


 AMOdatat:

 The linkage therefore needs to be very complicated and heavy
 to manhandle.
       The equipment shown in your photographs is clearly not
 capable of applying equal loads at four points on even one
 span let alone eight equal loads over two spans.       In addition,
 it seems that the vertical legs are tested one at a time.
 This is unlikely to give a true reflection of the loads which
 may be applied when neighbouring spans are loaded.      If two
 spans are loaded together and the supports are very stiff,
 the load on the central support may be increased by 25%.
 The amount by which it is increased can be affected by the
 elasticity of the post and also the deflection pattern of the
 two horizontal rails either side of it.    If the loading
 mechanism consists of say eight hydraulically activated rams
 or alternatively, a fully articulated system of eight point
 loads, then the 'green' guide load is applied uniformly on the
 two side spans and any concentration- of load on the central
 post is faithfully reproduced.
      From the information given in your brochure it seems
 that the test procedure which you are adopting is quite
 inadequate and could lead to misleading test results being
 obtained.    I should be pleased to have your comments.


                                    Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

Sheffield Wednesday South Stand
T.V. Camera Platform

As you are aware, we were asked by the BBC to inspect this
platform and we enclose a copy of a letter sent to them.

This platform, designed by ourselves, is over 30 years old
and was added to the original stand roof structure which was
built at the turn of the century and which has also been
slightly modified by war damage repairs.

We carried out a visual inspection only on Tuesday, 5th April
1988, and whilst we are reasonably satisfied that the structure
is adequate at present, only a full survey involving close
inspection of all the supporting steelwork would enable us to
give categoric assurances.

During our inspection we did note some deficiencies which we
would bring to your notice.

1.          The steelwork supporting the platform is rusting,
             and in some areas most of the protective paint has
             disappeared.   As some of these sections are thin
             walled tubes, we strongly advise that the steel should
             be re-protected in the very near future.

2.          The two timber huts on the platform are not fastened
             down and could be dislodged in a gale.

3.          Slight moisture penetration is occurring at the edges
             of the mastic asphalt surfacing, which may in time
             cause rot in the timber decking.


                                                                                                                     Cont/...

 4.      The railing along the front edge of the platform may not
         conform to current standards for strength (BS 6399:Pt 1:
         1984).

Dear Sir,

Sheffield Wednesday South Stand
T.V. Camera Platform

We write in response to your request for us to comment on the
perceptible vibration of the platform, resulting from personnel
movements.

Following our meeting and inspection of the platform on 5th April,
we confirm that in the subsequent conversation with you at the
ground the writer gave his opinion that the small amount of
movement noticeable did not warrant concern, being quite normal
for such cantilever construction, and there did not appear to be
any evidence of structural weakness.   We understand that the
total loading will not exceed 16 men plus 3 cameras each weighing
500 lbs,and some ancillary equipment weighing approximately
500 lbs total, and that the loading will be distributed.

We are pleased to reassure you in this instance, and should you
have any other structural problems, we should be glad to be of
assistance.

We shall send an account for our fees shortly.

Yours faithfully,
HUSBAND & CO.

 Dear           Graham,

                 Further           t o our             telephone                  conversation                   on M o n d a y        18 A p r i l               I
 have           pleasure              in e n c l o s i n g                a copy         of t h e          list        of d e f e c t s            recorded
 by H.E.                    Barnes       (Electrical)                      Limited.               You will               see     that           they appear
 to h a v e                 done    a very              thorough               job.       However,                   many of         the        items
 listed,                    although           not         strictly               in a c c o r d a n c e w i t h            the        I.E . E .

 that            they be attended                             to.
                 I have            therefore                  spoken           t o Mr.      M.       Barnes            about        the         items

 those             items             that,             if a t t e n d e d to,             would allow                  an   unqualified
 I. E . E .           Test           Certificate                         to be issued.
                 I have             also           asked             him to price              for d o i n g           the n e c e s s a r y work
 but            I will         also         invite Bownes                          S Co.       Ltd. a n d            Bradwell            Electrical

  Dear Graham,
                 Thank you for your letter of 19 April enclosing a copy of
  the letter form Husband & Co. regarding the T.V. camera platform.
  The various matters raised in Husbands letter do not cause concern
  except possibly the statement that the timber huts on the platform
  are not fastened down.                                            We shall be checking on this point and
 will write to you again shortly thereafter.
                 The rusting of the steelwork mentioned in point 1 is not at
  all serious.                       It is true that the protective paint has almost
  disappeared in many parts of the south stand roof but the inspections
 which we carried out at close quarters in the summer of last year,
 when adding the new sway bracing to the roof, showed that loss of
 metal is not a cause for concern.                                               With regard to the moisture
 penetration in the timber at the edges of the mastic asphalt
  surfacing, we do not recommend any action bearing in mind that the
  roof is likely to be replaced in the next four years.
       The comment about the strength of the railing in front of
  the platform is perhaps a little misplaced in that British Standard
  6399 Part I 1984 refers to railings where crowds of people may
  gather.                  Also it is not normal to strengthen or modify every
  item of a building whenever the British Standard is changed.
  However, now that the matter has been raised we will have a look

EMERGENCY LIGHTING - ASSIMULATED MAINS FAILURE

Dear Sirs,

On Tuesday 15th March 1988 in company with Mr. Clough of Eastwood & Partners,
Mr. Bounds the Electrical Contractor and Station Officer        |of this Authority,
a full electrical mains failure for the entire ground was assimulated for a
period in excess of one hour during which time a full inspection of the area
covered by the emergency li'ghting system at the ground was carried out.

Detailed below are my observations and comments on the inspection.

South Stand
One light not functioning in the ladies toilet, west end lower terrace.

Spion Cop
Satisfactory.

North Stand
From row 43 to the back of the stand, insufficient illumination throughout
the whole area. This appears to be caused by screening of the lights by the
roof girder supports resulting in shadowing. The lights need either, reÂ­
positioning or a further row of emergency lights installing. One light not
functioning in the centre of the upper corridor at the rear of the stand.

West Stand
It would appear that both of the gents and ladies toilets at the rear of the
stand are not covered by the emergency lighting system, this should be corrected
and lights installed.

The centre section (blue seats) in the upper part of the stand do not appear to
be covered by emergency lighting. Emergency lighting is required to cover that
area, it being agreed on site that further investigation on the situation would
be carried out.


                                                                                                                   contd....




                                                                                                                    ^ 1 1

Dear Graham,
                                   Emergency Lighting of the Ground
                                       Test on 15 March, 1988
            You will have received the report from South Yorkshire
Fire Service on the tests which we carried out jointly with
them on the night of 15 March, 1988.
            By way of background, the emergency lighting was tested
by us and the Fire Service in 1979 at the time of the issue
of the first ground safety certificate.                                                          Some parts of the old
Kop had inadequate emergency lighting levels, and we cured
that by some extra lamps on poles and on the flood light
pylons.                We also put in a completely new system of emergency
lights in the South stand.
            It is normal for emergency lighting systems in public
buildings to have to function for three hours from the time
when the mains failure occurs.                                              We had doubts whether the batteries
at Hillsborough could be relied on to last three hours, and so in
1979 we negotiated an agreement that the test should only be for
one hour (obviously long enough for the ground to be cleared),but
there was an understanding that when the present batteries come tc
the end of their life, the replacement (batteries or generator) will
be tested for the full three hours.

       The Fire Service had apparently forgotten to ask for any
 tests since 1979, but we carried out a test in the autumn of
 1986 on the new Kop, to satisfy ourselves that we had provided
 adequate lighting levels to meet British Standards, and that
 the batteries could take the increased load for one hour.
       The recent test was requested by the Fire Service.
 You   will see from the report that they are completely satisfied
 with the Kop, and apart from one defunct light bulb in a toilet,
 the South stand was also approved.
       In the North stand, the Fire Service were not satisfied
 with the lighting in a strip along the whole of the rear part
 of the stand, from row 43 to the back.    I believe that the
 lighting levels are no worse now than in 1979, but I suspect
 no measurements were taken at the very rear of the stand.      I
 think we can cure the defects by adjusting the level of the lights.
       In the West stand there is a similar dark patch to that in
 the North stand, but much smaller.    The toilets at the back are
 also not fitted with emergency lights.
       I      think you have no alternative but to make up these
 deficiencies in the North and West stands.   Perhaps you will
 let me know whether you would like us to draw up a scheme to
 bring them up to standard at the least possible cost.      This
 could be combined with the necessary work which has come out
 of the recent testing of all the electrical installations.

Dear Graham,
              Very many thanks for sending us a copy of the brochure
received from S.G.S. Inspection Services Ltd. relating to
crush barrier testing.                                             I enclose a copy of a letter sent to
them on 18 April which is self-explanatory.
              I              had a phone call from one of their directors from which
it became quite clear that they do not have any structural expertise,
and did not appreciate that far higher stresses can be set up in
the horizontal rails when two spans are tested together.                                                                                       Nor did
they appreciate that when two spans are tested together, five
eighthsof the total load is carried by the middle post, and the
other two posts only share three eighths of the load between them.
               It is rather worrying that some grounds appear to have had
inadequate test loads applied to their barriers.                                                                         I am proposing
to write to the Football League giving a warning.
              The clubs who have used S.G.S. Inspection Services Ltd. will
probably have saved money, because the very simple equipment which
they use is cheap, and tests can be made quickly.                                                                         But it is possible
that there is a smaller factor of safety than required by the green
guide.


                                                                                            Yours sincerely,

          DESCRIPTION:                          One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                                The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                                measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.


          IDENTIFICATION:                       Pump: D948005
                                                Gauge: BGF 168 SR
                                                Cylinder 1: 04773                   Model RC 53AF9N

          METHOD

          The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                              in
          terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf)â¢ The uncertainty                                            of
          the forces applied during the calibration is +0-5%-

          Three tests were made on each cylinder.

          Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell


Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                                              Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                                                                  Barrier Testing 1988

              Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
              The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds 1.
              In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load.                                                   A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
              Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those tested on the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.

     The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now.   There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144, when tested,and we also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coming season.
     Enclosed are single copies of our record sheets showing the
results of the barrier tests.

          DESCRIPTION:                             One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                                   The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                                   measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.

          METHOD




t
          The calibration iras carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                                         in
          terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                        of
          the forces applied during the calibration is +0.5?*

          Three tests were made on each cylinder.

          Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

Dear Sirs,

             Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic
                 Safety Work 1988 - Barrier Repairs

     Please find enclosed a print of our drawing 1610/64 on which
we have marked two crush barrier rails that need replacing together
with their fixing clips.
     The rail on barrier 130 is approximately 5.2 m long and the rail
on barrier 144 about 2.5 m long, both 60.3 m m diameter,           5 m m thick
wi t h 5 m m capping plates each end.   A new fixing clip is also needed
on barrier 124.
     Would you please give a price for disconnecting the six clips
and two rails and taking them off site and providing and fixing two
new rails and six clips.      The steelwork is to be shotblasted, primed
with a high-build zinc phosphate paint followed by one alkyd undercoat
and one alkyd gloss,     finished colour blue 18 E 53.
     The work is to be completed and the paint dried ready for the first
home game on 27 August.      An early response, b y telephone, w oul d be
appreci ate d.
       A copy of a sketch showing a typical fixing clip is also
enclosed, though the length of the vertical leg m a y need to be
slightly longer on some of the clips so that the bolts will fit.


                                Yours faithfully,

 For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell

 Dear Graham,

                                                                                 I.E.E. Certification

                 Whilst I was away on holiday three tenders for the electrical
 work were returned.                                                 The three completed documents were opened
 by Dr. Eastwood on 23 August.
                 The total tender sums given in the documents are as follows

                 Bradwell Electrical Co. Ltd.                                                                               Â£ 8,863.00
                 Bownes & Co. Ltd.                                                                                          Â£ 8,990.61
                 Barnes       (Electrical)                                             Ltd.                                 Â£11,329.00

                 Each tender includes a contingency sum of Â£500.00 which may
 or may not need to be expended.                                                                       The arithmetic in all three
 tenders has been checked and no errors were found.
                 The tender submitted b y Bradwell did not contain any exclusions
 or qualifications and all items included in the summary of prices,
 copies of which are enclosed,                                                                      are covered.                   Item 12, for new
 installations,                        which also includes the socket outlets for the
 disabled facility,                                          is covered in items 5 and 6 of their summary.
                 The tender from Bownes did not contain any relevant exclusions
 or qualifications.                                              Neither firm give the length of time they
 expect to take to complete the work, but we have been told                                                                                                            by

Bownes & Co. Ltd.    that four to five weeks should be allowed.
     If any additional works are required during the contract,
for which comparable prices do not exist in the summary,      the
cost of the work may have to be based on an hourly "daywork"
basis.     The rates are given by the tenderers and for the two
lowest are as follows

   Bradwell - Â£8. 92/hour for an approved electrician, with a 15%
                  addition on the basic cost of materials used.

   Bownes      - Â£7.38/hour for an approved electrician, with a 10%
                addition on the basic cost of materials used.


     So,    if work needs to be valued on a daywork basis, and we
always resist payment on that basis,      the cost of the work is
likely to be less if done by Bownes rather than Bradwell.
     Under normal circumstances we would recommend that the lowest
tender is accepted, but because the installation is maintained
by Bownes & Co. Ltd., and has for many years now, we believe it
would be in the     Club's   interest to sacrifice the Â£127.61 difference
between the two lowest tender prices and award the Contract to
Bownes & Co. Ltd.     This would avoid any difficulties in the event
of any faults being found at a later date.      Bownes & Co. would
continue to be responsible for the whole installation, whereas
if another contractor were appointed to do the work there could
be arguments about the source of the fault.
     We look forward to receiving your instructions in due course.

                             Yours sincerely,

 Dear Graham,
                                                               i.E.E. certification

                    Thank you for your letter dated 14 September 1988 telling us
 that the Club wish to accept the tender submitted by Bownes and
  Company Limited.                              We have telephoned them to say that their tender
  is to be accepted and written to confirm that conversation.
                     Please find enclosed a copy of a draft of an order to Bownes,
  from the Club, which you may wish to send them.
                     With regard to the quotation from Bownes and Company which
  you have enclosed, this seems to be a perfectly workable
  arrangement, but we have some reservations about the developing
  complexity of the power supplies to the PA and Police cabin.
                     There are already two supplies to these enclosures from the
  South Stand and the new supply direct from the West Stand
  Switchroom will make three.                                                     DP Sound have expressed a preference
  for a separate supply, but notwithstanding this, we believe that
  the ideal solution is the simple one - namely to provide a single
  cable from the West Stand Switchroom to carry all the loads
  within the PA/Police cabin,                                                     including the lighting and heating.
  The supplies from the South Stand could then be removed which
  might reduce the chance of electrical interference from this
   source.


                                                                                                                                                       ^ I"7

         We appreciate that a larger cable and H CB board would add to
    the present cost, but in the long run, the Club would have a
    tidier and more reliable arrangement.   We can look into this
    further if you wish.

For      the attention                    of M r          G H Mackrell

Dear Mr Mackrell,

                          Electrical                     Supplies                 for P A / P o l i c e             Cabin

           Thank y o u for your                           letter            of       22     September                  1988.            We have now
looked          further          into          the e l e c t r i c a l                supplies                   to the P u b l i c A d d r e s s
a n d Pcblice c a b i n a n d w e h a v e h a d d i s c u s s i o n s w i t h                                                   D.P.            Sound      on
their requirements.
           Firstly          it seems we m i s i n t e r p r e t e d B o w n e s ' q u o t a t i o n w h e n we
assumed            that they were                        referring to two existing                                         suppliers.                    In     fact
there           is o n l y       one        at present which                              serves            the t w o consumer                         units.               A
second          supply         to this point would no t be unreasonable.
           Secondly            from our d i s c u s s i o n wi t h Mr A n n i b l e                                           of D.P.             S o u n d it
appears            that     there           is an           intractable problem                                   of    interference                     from the
computer,              which        they believe                         is c h a n n e l l e d t o t h e P . A .                         system via the
common electrical                         supply.                   They believe that                             this       could be eliminated
by providing                a separate                    supply            from the sub-station                                   f o r t h e P.A.               system
and its n e w b ac k - u p batteries.

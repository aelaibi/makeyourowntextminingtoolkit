                    PRIMARY CONSIDERATIONS

                           here are many important matters to be considered In the creation
                    of sports stadia and pre-planning and project management! are essential
                    elements of stadia reconstruction.
                          Current technology is advanced sufficiently to permit the reliable
                    design and construction of new stadia ccincepts provided they are
                    commercially viable.
                          Pre-planning commences with a definition of th : overall concept of
                    the proposal for development,      by identifying . an d researching the
                    potential market for the stadium facilities and by n aking arrangements
                    for financing the reconstruction work.

           must be negotiated fully before commitment to commencement of contracts.

                 Essential penalty clauses for late completion of construction must
           be equitable and design work must be advanced suffic iently to prevent
           delays t 3 construction.

                     Tinely completion is important whatever tfie type of building.                                                                                               For

           Thorburrj Associates were appointed both 4s structural! and civil
           engineers and as project managers, in July 1961* This form! of appoint­
           ment for the management of the construction iwork,    left jthe Scottish
           Rugby Union free to concentrate on its own! daily activities.      Work
           commenced in March 1982 and the new Stand was completed less than 40
           weeks later.                                 !             1

                 The circular,   curved track behind both goal areas Was removed and a
                 completely rectangular,        grassed surface created,           This arrangement

                       The challenge presented by the need to create a new stadium for a
                 famous football club engendered several structural concepts, all of which
                 were dominated by the problems of providing large roof elements.

                         Y became evident during the design of the east arid w e s t stands
                   that no cost advantage would be gained by !a p p l y in i the J philosophy of
                   fire engineering to these p a r tic u la r stands, ! and the general require­
                   ments of the Buildings Regulations were adopted.
                         A study of the fire potential in the la'rge nor tlh stand, however,
                   revealed that cost savings could be effected by adopting fire
                   engineering methods of design.

                           he concourses under the seating deck of the ncrth stand contained
                   refresh ment bars and storerooms.             !
                                                                                  i               ;
                         "he       greatest fire hazard in this stand existed in ; the storeroom
                   adjacent       to the refreshment bars and th<3 potential fire load was
                   calculated      on the assumption that the store yould be1 fully stocked with
                   flammable       items.

                          _al-culations indicated that 'fire resistance* wc s justified only in
                   the stores and refreshment area of the structures,       In other areas the
                   fire load was negligible and hence the level | of fire resistance specified
                   in the Scottish Building Regulation could not ;be justij ied. !

                           he design of this major new stadium coincided                               with        the
                   introdv ction of the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

                          he certification of the work was alsoj rendersd difficult because
                   the ouiluing Regulations made no provision for stadia'.
                          Vhe construction of the new stadium was carried out within the
                   financ ; al budget and within a relatively re stricted environment where
                   the fu iction of the existing facilities had tc be maintained to suit the
                   require:ments of the club.

HAKE:      Ambulanceman

VEHICLE:     S203

SHIFTS     0900 - 1630 hours

DATE AMD TIME OF INTERVIEW: Written Statement 20/04/89



My attendant Ambulanceman f                 ] and I, arrived on scene at the Leppings
Lane end of the Ground at approximately 1500 hours.                I parked the vehicle
above the main gates to avoid the crowd of people who were leaving the
Ground.


My   colleague      quickly   ran    down   towards   the   turnstiles    and   immediately
indicated to me to bring the Ambulance down to him.               This I did and parked
behind another Ambulance.           I removed the ignition keys, grabbed the bag and
mask equipment and left the vehicle.            There was total chaos and bodies were
lying around.       The Police were bringing more casualties out from the stand
area.


Two Police Constables carried a male towards me and we tried CPR straight
away, but he was obviously not going to be revived.                      I observed other
people trying mouth to mouth and I went to assist with the bag and mask
equipment.     A Police Constable asked me for the keys to the Ambulance as I
administered CPR and I gave the keys to him.                I tried CPR on another male
nearer the tunnel which leads to the terrace but again the efforts were in
vain.


I asked a Woman Police Constable if there were many casualties in the
Ground and she informed me that there was.              I made my way down the tunnel
and onto the pitch which was crowded with people, some administering CPR to
casualties.      I saw a group who seemed to be struggling so I used the bag
and mask and was assisted by a doctor for several minutes, but the casualty
did not regain consciousness.
                                                                                 /continued

By this time there were a lot of bodies laying on the pitch covered with
shirts etc so I made my way back to the point where the Ambulance was
originally parked.


My   colleague       with     the   Police   Constable    driving       arrived   back.     We
stretchered a young boy with back and neck injuries into the Ambulance.
There was another older male lying by the side of the vehicle so we removed
the remaining stretcher and were about to load this patient but we found
the stretcher        occupied byanother male with similar back and rib injuries.
We   loaded    this    patient and      transported      them   to   the Northern      General
Hospital with the Police Constable still driving.


On arrival at the Northern General Hospital Casualty Department there was a
lot of confusion and it took several minutes to locate trollies for the
patients.      We quickly arrived back at the Leppings Lane end of the Ground
which seemed to be blocked by Fire Tenders and a large crowd.                      The Police
Constable then left the vehicle.              A call then came across the radio for
mobiles to go the the Gym-side of the Ground, which we did.


There were      several Ambulances which were             either backed up towards          the
Gymnasium or waiting for access.             With the vehicle parked on Penistone Road
I was approached by Station Officer Eason and instructed to drive a West
Yorkshire Ambulance to the Northern General as the crew were not sure where
the hospital was.           I did this immediately.


On   arrival    at    the Northern      General   Casualty      there    seemed   to be more
organisation     and        Porters   were   on   hand    to    assist    with    lifting   and
transportation to the wards.




                                                                                    /continued

After waiting several minutes for one of the crew to return from Ward 60,
where the patient had been taken, we proceeded back to the Penistone Road
side of the ground.          We stood by for a while and then helped to transport
the   bodies    from   the    Ambulances   to   the   Gymnasium via   stretchers.   I
volunteered to stay behind to help, but because I had no vehicle I was
instructed to return to Station and sign off.

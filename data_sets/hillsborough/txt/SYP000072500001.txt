              We     travelled                 in m y      fathers       car,       me    being       the      driver.            I left    my     home

               It w a s        about           1 03 0 a m ^ , h a t     we    left L i v e r p o o l        for       Sheffield.           Intending

              South           of    Manchester              at      about     1300.           We   had    not     had any          hold    up u nt i l

              this           point .           It    took      us    about     30 - 40 minu t e s                to    get    to    the    Island.

                                                                                                                                    S1&76

We    then       decided           to    take       an al te r na t iv e         route.           This        took       the S o u t h e r n

route       into       Sheffield,               arriving          at    about       1425.         There        was       not    time        for

us    to    stop       en     route        to      the     ground.

We    parked        near       Longsett             Rd about           a mile       and     half        away       from       the

ground.           We     got       a taxi          to    the    ground



The    only       drunk        Liverpool                supporter        I saw was              j ust    staggering             around

near       the m a i n L o n g s e t t             Rd.        I did     not    s ee      any     other        supporters,             drunk

or    drinking.

We    did     not      receive           any       Police       directions            on    the w a y         to    the       ground        but

we    did     not      need        a n y as        we    went     in a taxi.               I did        not    see      any     fighting

or    disorder           on    the w a y           to    or    inside      the      ground        u n ti l     it h a d        happened.

I arrived           at      th e    Leppings             Ln    terrace        t u r n s t i l e s at        approximately               1445.

 At    this       time        the       blue       wrought        iron     outer         gates        were     s h u t.        I was

about       2 0 -- 3 0 y a r d s           back         from    these     gate s .          There        was       no    queues       here

just       a mass        of    peo p l e .          It w a s      just     the      hustle        and       bustle        of a n o r m a l

match       day     near       to       kick       off     time.

At    this       time       in the         area         immediatley           outside           the     blue       wrought          i ron

gates       I saw        three          Policemen             on h o r s es.        At     first        two    of       these       were

just       trying        to    keep        people          away    from       the     blue       gates,        then a third                 one

came       and    tried        to       get     people         formed      into       queues          but     then       he    just

disappeared.

There       were       sti l l      two       police          trying     to    keep        people        from       t his       outer

g ate.        The      outer        gates          kept       opening     and       closing           allowing           so m a n y

people        into       the       area       by    th e      turnstiles.             I could           not    see w h o        was

controlling              these          gat e s .

At    this       poi n t      it w a s        just       like     a normal          match        day     crowd.           After       about

five       minutes          maybe        more       after       having        waited        we were           allowed          through

the    wrought           iron       gates,          we     were    not    forced           or    c r u s h e d we        just w a l k e d

i nto    by    the       turnstile            area    and       joined an          oi^fe^ey           queue.           We    were

moving        in our       queue        fairly        quickly          I w a s ^ u ^ ^ ng^folr             the     very          end

turnstile           nearest        to     the River             Don.

There      is a      s m all      barrier           along       side     the      edge     of    our      turnstile

entrance,           w h e n we     were        about       tw o    yards       past      the     end      of    t hi s      barrier          I

w a s n ’t e v e n       being     pushed.            It w a s        just     l ike     standing          at a bus              stop

waiting        to    get     in.        Then        a Policeman             said,       " W e ’ve     opened       the m a i n

gates      there,         j ust    get        yourself          in t h a t     w ay .      I then walked                 freely

three     yards          backwards            to    get    past       the     barrier.           It w a s       between           14.55

              5 7 a n d we        just        strolled          through a          blue      concertina            gate          which

              r i ght     angles        to     the    turnstiles.

The     wrought          i ron    gates        must       have     been       c l o s e d as     this      time        as    I

estimate          there     must        have        been 4000          out     there       and      I w a s n ’t f o r c e d           into

the     g a te.      There        was     no       surge.

I just        walked       through            the    gate       not    having       to     s h ow a n y o n e      my       ticket.              I

was     really       surprised            this       happend          I was       not    getting          pushed wh en             the

gate     was      opened.

I did      not      witness        any        steward        control          outside       the       turnstile.

I would        not       have     had a n y         problem        going       through          the      turnstile.               I saw

between        five       and     ten     people          climbing          over    the     sides         between           the

turnstiles           between           th e    West       stand and           terrace       and       into      the      ground.             I

was     wondering          why     the        Police       w e r e n ’t s t o p p i n g     them.

I walked          through         the     concertina              gate      and    did     not      see a n y      police          or

steward        control           there.        I sti l l        have     my    full      ticket          intact.            It    is    in

my    possession.                Just     inside          the     gate      one    stopped          to    have     a     look      and

see     where       we    ha d    to    go.         There       were     no P o l i c e     or        stewards              directing

us.      The      only     entrance            that       I could        see      was    down       the    centre           tunnel.

There     were       not    many        people        on    the       concourse          area       between        the

turnstiles           and    tunnel.

I did      not      see    th e    opening           of a n y      other       gates       other         than    the        turnstiles

                  and     the      one       I entered           through.

                  We    then went             down     the       centre         tunnel       having          not       seen any           signs

                  directing             us    anywhere           else.          I did       not    see       any Police              or    steward

                  control          at     this       entry       point        to     the    tunnel.

                  We    walked          down     the       first       three         quarters          of    the       tunnel        freely although

                  there       were        a number          of       people        around        us.        The    players           were       on the

                  pitch       now,        and    it m u s t          have     been about           two       minutes          before           the    kick       off.

                  For     th e     last       quarter           of    th e    tunnel        we    had       to    slow       d o w n as        people        were

                  filtering             onto     the       terraces.

                  It w a s       packe d,        but       I had       experienced               this       type       of    crowd        on    the H op.

                  It w a s       quite        tight        and       there was        pushing          and       shoving.

                  It w o u l d        have      took       us    only a minute              to    get       through          the     last       quarter          of

                  the     tunnel.             When     at       the    end      of    the    tunnel          we    s a w we w e r e            behind

                  the     goals         and     decide/f to m a k e                our w a y      towards          the       S o u t h Stand,

                  We    were       in     pen    tpfee          and    tried         to m a k e    our       way       over     to    the       right        but

                  we were          forced a way                 forward.             As we w e r e          doing       this       it m u s t        have     been

                  just     about          kick       off    t i m e,     there        was    a big          s u r y i behind          us.           this

                  forced         us     downwards           to a b o u t        halfway          down       the    terracing.                  We    were     in a

    we    wara       crushed         so       tightly and             could      not     move.           I looked           to    the

    but    not       many       people         could       get     through         because          of    the       intensity             of    the

    still        crushed and              not        in    control         of m y m o v e m e n t s .

    I assumed            t hat     people            had       fallen      down     b e h i n d me        a n d to m y           left,      as I

    heard        t his     noise      and          was    forced       forwards          and     to m y        left     a few yards

    and    I turned             round         so m y      back     was     now     to    the     goal.         I could           then      see

    four       or    five       people         crouched          down appearing                as    if t h e y        were        t r y i n g to

    get    up.        My    f ee t    were           1 ft       to 2 ft       off       the    flo o r , Iwas         frightened                    at

    this       stage       as    I had         no    control          at all.

    I then          forced my         left          leg    out     o nto     a blokes          shoulder             t hat    was       crouched

    down       and     forced myself                 out.        I then        rolled         over       the    heads        of     the

    people          in f r o n t     of       me    to    the    front       perimeter           fen c e .          I must        h ave

    rolled about                10 y a r d s .           I then       climbed       the       fence       and a Policeman

    assisted          me    out.          I then went             and      lay     down       in the        penalty area.                      My

    arms       were      numb and             I was       breathing          heavily.            I had a                                  hand       I

    assume          I cut       it on         the    spikes        on the        perimeter           fence .

    A St       J o h n ’s a m b u l a n c e         woman       later      came     to a s s i s t        me    but     she       was      unable

    to    do    so    as    she w a s          in a s t a t e         of   shock        and    was       cry ing.           The     n ext       day

                It m u s t       have          been about            1530 when          I eventually             got       out    of    the     terrace

                I then          looked          for m y       friends         from whom         I had       been          separated.            I could

                not      find        them       so a f t e r     45 mins          or    so    I left       the       football          ground and

                went      to     look          for    them      at    the H a l l i s h a m H o s p i t a l          n ear    the      centre     of

                Sheffield.                My    friend        f o u n d me     h er e    at a b o u t      6.30       pm a n d      t h e n we    made

                our      way     b ac k        to L i v e r p o o l .

                T he     opening           of     the    gates        was     a factor         in the       deaths.              In m y    opinion       no

                one w o u l d         have        died     outside          the    ground.           The    centre           tunnel       should       have

                been      blocked              off.      Al l    people        should         have    been       filtered           in via       the

                sides.           The       roa d      network         around       the       g round was         inadequate             for     the

                number          of    fans.

                Liverpool             should          have      had     the    larger         allocation             of    tickets        and    been    in

                t he     other        end.

                 I attended               ! ist y e a r       and     had a       ticket       for    the N o r t h          stand      but     I was

                 inside                   ground        for     1440 and          cannot       therefore             draw      comparisons.

                 I think         t hat         after      people        realised what            was       going          on e v e r y o n e    acted    to

                t he     b est       of    their        ability.

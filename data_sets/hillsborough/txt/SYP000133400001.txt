D/S . I AM PHONING CONCERNING DEATH OF YOUR DAUGHTERS, VICTORIA & SARAH AT

         BEEN IN TOUCH RE THE SHOWING TO YOU OF VIDEO/PHOTOGRAPHIC MATERIAL WITH

         A VIEW TO LOCATING YOUR S DAUGHTERS,,

H        YES - CONVERSATION ABOUT D/S McCOMBIE/W/SGT |                        | & GOOD WORK BY THEM

         & WMP, E T C «          EXPLAINED NOT ANTI POLICE & HIGH REGARD FOR POLICE.

D/S      RATHER CONCERNED ABOUT SHOWING YOU MATERIAL FROM POINT OF VIEW OF YOUR

         DISTRESS,.         EXPLAINED NOT VERY PLEASANT BUT WE ALREADY HAVE A

         CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT ON BOTH GIRLS.

H        MR TAYLOR, I D O N ’T THINK YOU COULD CAUSE ANY MORE DISTRESS THAN I HAVE

         ALREADY BEEN THROUGH.               I THINK LIKE IN YOUR JOB & YOU HAVE A TERRIBLE

         MESS TO SORT OUT THAT YOU BECOME DESENSITISED AFTER A TIME,                    I D O N ’T

         KNOW IF DS McCOMBIE HAS TOLD YOU BUT I ALREADY HAVE A COPY OF COMPOSITE

         OF POLICE TAPE PROVIDED BY MY SOLICITOR,                   I LOOK AT THAT EARLY MORNING

         & AT NIGHT BECAUSE MY WIFE CANNOT BEAR TO LOOK AT IT & I'VE TRIED TO I/D

         THE GIRLS BUT WITH NO SUCCESS.                YOU SHOWING ME. THE MATERIAL MIGHT HELP.

         IN SOME WAYS I BLAME MYSELF FOR VICTORIA’S DEATH, IE NOT SEEING HER INTO

         THE AMBULANCE WITH SARAH & THEN THERE’S THE BUSINESS OF THE GUY WHO

         FETCHED HER OUT THE PEN SAYING A SYP OFFICER REFUSED TO GIVE HER CPR <5

         SAID SHE WAS DEAD.                I JUST WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

                                                                                                     22nd.       April        1989

Bear     Mr.        Wright ,

        So       much      has        been       written        and        spoken       about the            Hillsborough

tragedy          during         the       past        week , We       , like           many others           , watched         it

unfold        on       television j words                 cannot         express          our        feelings of          grief

and     compassion .


        Our        teenage        grandson - an                ardent         Liverpool          supporter - was

       Hillsborough              last       Saturday . The              agony        of     waiting          for     news

of      him        was     almost too             much     to        bear     f particularly               for     his

parents . W h e n           at     last          we     received        the      news      that       , although

battered          and      bruised              , our grandson          was      safe      , we       as     a     family

were          overjoyed . We are                 writing        to      tell     you       this       because        it       was

one         of     your     young constables               who        saved         him , by          grabbing          and

heaving          him      out    or        the        tangle     of     supporters            trying - in           vain

for     so       many     - to    reach           safety ,


       We        don* t    know           who    the     constable            is , our          grandson         being        in

       state to ask .             e          would like          to     send a      f a m i l y ’s    heartfelt

gratitude          to     that        young        m an , and         to      all         the other          constables

on     duty       at     Hillsborough , as                well        as      the         St. John's         Ambulance

brigade          and     everyone               else who        did     alx      that      they        could       to     help


       On        behalf     of        a    grateful            family      , sincerely           yourt; ,

                                   REPORT


HAKE:       Station Officer

VEHICLE:    Major Incident Tender Vehcicle

SHIFT:      1530 - 0000 hours

DATE AND TIME OF INTERVIEW:     20 April 1989, 1005 -



I was proceeding in my own car towards work to start duty at 1530 hours,
when I heard on local radio of the problems at Sheffield Wednesday Football
Ground,    The time was approximately 1506 hours.   I immediately proceeded to
Rotherham Station and was turning into the hospital grounds when I observed
a Service Range Rover proceeding along Moorgate Road at speed.


I arrived at the Station and attempted to contact Control by telephone, the
lines were engaged.      I collected the Duty Range Rover and Ambulanceman
             and proceeded to Control


Upon arrival, I entered the Control Room and was immediately instructed by
Superintendent Ray Clarke to commence telephoning staff from a call out
list.     Before I could start this, I was instructed by Superintendent Clarke
to collect the Major Incident Tender Vehicle and take it to Hillsborough
Gymnasium.


I returned to Rotherham Station with Ambulanceman                 and collected
the Major Incident Tender Vehicle.      I then realised that I did not have the
UHF radio sets, so I returned to Control to collect them.


I informed superintendent Clarke that I had called to collect          the UHF
radios - there were none in the charging rack.      I checked the radio case in
the Superintendent's office and it contained two sets one of which was the
VHF set and the other was a UHF set without a battery.            I reported to
Superintendent Clarke that there were no radios and that I was leaving.


                                                                     /continued

I left Headquarters monitoring Channel 2 on the radio.                  I encountered
Police Officers on traffic duty from the junction of Penistone Road and
Rutland Road all the way to the ground.


At Hillsborough Park I encountered a lot of football supporters walking
back    towards    the City Centre.        I had to slow down because they were
spilling into the road.


Traffic was being directed up Herries Road,             I indicated to the Police
Officer that I wanted to go straight through.              Behind the Officer were
ranks of Police Officers, three or four deep, right across Penistone Road
North.    I was directed into the first entrance on my left.


I was    not aware of receiving any radio           transmissions     from the time I
approached the Ground.


I proceeded through the arch past two fire engines until my progress was
stopped by the road being completely blocked by Police vehicles.


I was then re-directed out by the same route and was eventually allowed
through the Police Ranks and gained access to the Ground via Gate '0' at
the Gymnasium.      I was met by Station Officer Higgins and Mr Hopkins.          I was
instructed    to    park   the   vehicle    and   distribute   body   bags,   stretcher
canvasses and poles that were in the vehicle.          These were immediately used.


I was then instructed to lock the vehicle and stay with it.             After repeated
attempts, I was unable to get the radio in the Major Incident Vehicle to
function.    My handset, however, was still functional on channel 2.




                                                                              /continued

Ambulances were being loaded at Gate 'O', immediately behind me.         I went to
the Police room under the North Stand.        It appeared to be full of uniformed
Police Officers.         I attempted to gain access to a telephone - none was
available.     I went to the first aid room.      There were some young St John's
Cadets in tears, being comforted.        I returned to the Major Incident Unit.


The Ambulances were arriving and being loaded.         There were a large number
of distraught fans seeking friends and relatives.


I issued some bundles of brown and grey blankets from the Major Incident
Unit.     A West Yorkshire Emergency Tender Vehicle arrived and another 10
body bags were obtained from this vehicle.


I was aware of Mr Jones1 presence and assisted with the marshalling and
loading of vehicles.        During this, a non SYMAS vehicle broke down but was
eventually re-started.


The number of casualties started to ease off and vehicles started to be
stacked at Herries Road Bus Garage.         British Telecom engineers arrived to
install telephone links for the Police.


I was instructed to attend the Bus depot and stand down all the non-SYMAS
vehicles.


Later in the evening, I liaised with Police regarding the organisation of
the     identification    and eventual   removal of bodies   to   the Medico Legal
Centre after positive identification.




                                                                        /continued

    More trollies were obtained from Longley Ambulance Station to speed up the
    process when large numbers of relatives arrived from Liverpool by coaches.


    At 0500 hours there were only the unidentified bodies remaining at the
    Gymnasium.      These were documented and   transferred to   the Medico Legal
    Centre by 0615 hours.


    Shortly afterwards the staff were stood down.

      were    unable            to move                             them.         So at this time we t r a v e l l e d on foot and

             of    incoming    s upporters       under    the s up e rv i si o n of Police Sergeant 721

             Hill    of the S outh Y orkshire Police Dog Handlers Section.

             These    duties were        carried out until          a p p r o x i m at e ly 2 . 3 0pm   (1430)   that

             day when we were          sent     to West Bar Police S ta ti on for meal.

             At about 2.5 5 p m       (1455)     that day a call was           received by the Dog
                                                                                               PAGE         i
                                                                                               S3841

H a n d l e r s mealing at         that    time to att e nd at     the ground as soon as

possible as          there were dif ficulties at              the Leppi ng s Lane     end of the

g round with supporters.

ye    immediately          left West Eiar Police S ta t io n and a tt ended at

H i l l s b o r o u g h Football     G r o u n d travelling    via P enistone Road.      As     we

reached the gates               on Penistone Roa d giving access           to the Kop     it was

seen that a large               number     of dog vans were      parked at that       location and

it a p p e a r e d that Dog Handlers were             just     coming   from the    ground from a

pair    of    large sliding          doors at that        location,

We    parked our         vehicle and a w ai te d further         instructions.

At about 3 . 2 0 pm         (1520)    that day the Dog Handlers w e r ^ ””l\sked to go               into

the    ground and we took             up position on the         psrim^er     track    in front of

the Kop at the P enistone Road end of the gvr,p<jmd.

We m a i n t a i n e d   this    position then until          it had been a n n o u n ce d to the

crowd that         the game        had been    postponed and a large         proportion of the

crowd had left the               ground.

We then       returned       to our vehicles        but due to the amount          of traffic we

were    unable       to move       them.     So at this     time we t ra velled on foot and

took    up a pos i t i on at P en i st o ne / ^o a d/ H er r ies jK)ad roundabout         to

monitor       the m ov ement        of the fans     back '^n J/f\& direction o f Wads ley

B ridge R a i l w a y Station,

A short       time       later another message was            received that Dog Handlers

having       duties       in the    town    centre a nd    railway station areas were           to

return to vehicles and make                   their way to their        positions as best as

possible and this was                done.

Duties were          then again       carried out     in the M i dl an d S t at io n area

monitoring         the arrival        of fans    back at the station u n 1 11 6 . 0 0 pm <1600)

that     day when we were            stood down and        returned to N i ag ar a for

             After    the event     the    thing    that    remains    in the mind      is what a pp ea re d to

             be the    lack of     communications.           As    in my   case from a rr iving at the

             ground,        through being    deployed       inside    the ground,    through     returning     to

             vehicles and back to town              centre    I was    unaware   of what had h a pp e n e d at



Km
              he Leppings Lane         end of the ground a nd from snatches                of   conversation

             picked up the fact           there might       have   been a    'bit of a crush*     and was

            m y st i f i e d by some   of the      crowds a gg re s si v e a tt itude    towards Police

             officers as they were           leaving       the ground to      return home.

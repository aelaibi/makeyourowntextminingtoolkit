   Dear Sirs,

   Hillsborough Disaster - 15th April 1989.

   I write to you as a Liverpool Football Club Season Ticket Holder and Shareholder,
   who was present in the North Stand at the ill-fated Semi-Final between Nottingham
   Forest and Liverpool.      .

   The first point that I wish to make is regarding the allocation of tickets for
   this match. As you are probably aware, Liverpool Football Club have an average
   attendance of 39,000 whereas Nottingham Forest have an average attendance of
   19,000/20,000. Therefore to give Liverpool Football Club 23,500 tickets and
   Nottingham Forest approximately 29,000 cannot make sense, and quite frankly, shows
   contempt by the Footballing Authorites for the Supporter who attends Liverpool
   matches each and every week and yet, was unable to obtain tickets for this major
   match.

   It has been said that the reason for this discrepancy in the allocation was due to
   traffic control. It was stated that traffic frcm Liverpool would came along the
   M62 and down the Ml leaving at Junction 36 and then travel down the A61 and would
   park on roads off Halifax Road. Although quite a lot of traffic did cane along
   this route; many thousands of vehicles did travel frcm Liverpool along "the snake"
   and "Woodhead Passes" and therefore parked along Penistone Road which is situate
   on the south/east side of the ground, and supporters leaving their cars would have
   to walk through the Nottingham Forest section to reach Leppings Lane. I
   respectfully submit that it is therefore nonsense to say that by allocating
   Liverpool the north and vest sides of the ground, it would avoid meeting
   Nottingham Forest supporters.

    It is interesting to note, that prior to the match the atmosphere outside the
    ground was highly good natured and that there were no reports of any trouble
    between the various sets of fans.

                                                   cont

   I would therefore like to add, that if the Football Association were insistent
   upon Hillsborough being a suitable venue for this match, there would not have
   taken much imagination/re-routing of traffic, to enable Liverpool Football Club to
   have the kop end (east end) terracing and Nottingham Forest to have the other
   side of the ground.

  Secondly, there is the matter of control inside and outside the ground. We
  arrived in our seats, North Stand (Row 11 seats 68/71) at approximately 1.40 p.m.
  during which time the ground was quite empty. As kick off approached, it was
  noticeable that the two centre sections of Lepping Lane terracing were becaning
  very full, but the two wing sections vere in places sparsely populated. Frcm
  newspaper and press reports, it appears that the computer informed the Police
  outside the stadium that there vere still 3000 places available on the terracing
  and, I understand, that it is for this reason that the additional gate was opend.
  One can only assume that the Police outside the stadium vere not informed of the
  whereabouts of those 3000 spaces as, it appears that the gate which was opened,
  led directly into the centre terracing and it was not even possible for supporters
  who came through these gates to enter the wing sections. Obviously, being in my
  seat since 1.40 p.m. I cannot comment on exactly what happened outside the
  stadium, I can only make observation frcm what I saw frcm my seat and fron what I
  have seen and read since the event.

  Having watched football matches for many years, I have noticed Police procedure in
  controlling crowds and, in Merseyside and Greater Manchester crowds, when queues
  are about to form, the Police (usually on horseback) usually insist upon
  supporters standing in orderly queues to enter into the turnstiles Frcm
  television pictures, it appears that there vere only two police horses at the
  Lepping Lane turnstiles and this is always going to be inadequate to control
  approximately 4000 supporters waiting to enter the ground just prior to kick off.

  Notwithstanding all the above, I feel that there is one matter which has not been
  stated by the media since the event and, which I believe to be totally fundamental
  to the disaster — namely the arrangements made for Liverpool supporters entering
  the Stadium. I have attended Sheffield Wednesday -v- Liverpool league matches at
  Hillsborough over a period of many years and until recently, have watched these
  games frcm the North Stand, (this area is now an area reserved for Sheffield
  Wednesday members only). These matches vere always well attended, but to my
  knowledge, there has never been a full house of 54,000 for a league match between
  these two sides. When entering the North Stand for these matches, one enters the
  turnstiles especially designated for the North Stand which are at the east side of

  the North Stand (near to the Kop entrance) and not at the Leppings Lane             ji
  turnstiles. Thjgse.turnstiles were not ^)en for this match and it has been the       rj /
  policy not to open these turnstiles for semi-finars'notwithstanding the fact that / /
  a capacity attendance is expected. In other words, 23,400 Liverpool supporters / /      k
  had to walk down Leppings Lane and all enter the Leppings Lane turnstiles.       /-
  Approximately 10,000 of these supporters would then walk into the North Stand.    '(

   If one looks at the entrance to the Leppings Lane turnstiles, one will notice that
   it refers specifically to Leppings Lane seating and standing accommodation and no
   mention is made above these turnstiles regarding entrance to the North Stand. In
   other words, during normal matches, supporters who wish to sit in the North Stand,
   do not enter through these turnstiles. If the North Stand turnstiles had been
   opened, approximately 10,000 supporters would not have been required to enter
   through the Leppings Lane turnstiles and therefore, only approximately
   13,000/14,000 supporters would have entered the fifteen turnstiles in Leppings
   Lane and, queues would not have formed so quickly and it is therefore quite
   conceivable that at 2.45 p.m. there would have been under 2000 people waiting
   outside Leppings Lane and not the reported 4000 people.

   It will be stated that the reason for not opening the turnstiles in the North
   Stand was that these turnstiles vere near the Forest supporters. Quite frankly,
   if the Police feared that therewould be trouble between rival supporters, then it
   would not be too difficult , to have a small cordon of Police Officers outsidethe
   North Stand turnstiles to avoid any trouble which, the writer believes was not
   likely to happen because of the good natured humour of the crowd outside the
   stadium.

   I have attended semi-finals at Hillsborough in 1980 and 1987. In 1980 I was
   sitting in the West Stand and left the ground at the Leppings Lane turnstile.
   Approximately 23,000 Liverpool supporters had to leave using the same turnstiles
   and the crush leaving the ground was frightening. In view of this experience, in
   1987 when I was sitting in the North Stand, at the end of the match I tried to
   leave the stadium using the North Stand turnstiles but, upon reaching the exit, I
   noted that the gates vere locked and it was quite impossible for any supporters to
   leave through this exit and therefore, I had to leave along the back of the North
   Stand and out through Leppings Lane and again, the crush was unbearable.

   I can only assume that in semi-finals at Hillsborough when Liverpool were not
   involved, supporters using the Leppings Lane end of the ground had to endure
   similar difficulties. In view of these difficulties encountered over many semi
   finals, one would believe that the relevant authorities would open as many
   turnstiles as possible, to avoid crushing at the beginning and end of the match,
   but it appears that is has taken a disaster like this for the lesson to be learnt.

   Finally, I would like to make a point regarding the wider issue of ticket
   allocation/overcrowding during Cup Finals at Wembley. As you are probably aware,
   until this season, 98,000 tickets are issued for the F.A. Cup Final at Wembley and
   25,000 tickets go to each of the competing finalists. In other words 48,000
   tickets are distributed throughout other clubs affiliated to the Football
   Association. During recent years, it has appeared increasingly evident that the
   issue of 25,000 tickets to the Clubs with large followings is far frcm sufficient.
   Many fans without tickets have been approaching the Wembley Stadium and this has
   been partly responsible for the crushing outside certain entrances prior to kick
   off. The scenes have turned ugly due to the desparation of supporters wishing to
   see the game and being unable to enter the Stadium.

   I feel that is merely good luck, and' not good management that there has not been
   major disaster outside Wembley Stadium in the last few years.

   Clubs have stated that this problem can be avoided by giving the two competing
   clubs increased allocations - particularly to those clubs like Liverpool who have
   a very large following. The Football Association, in their wisdom,     havesaid this
   is not possible;that the F.A. Cup Final   is "football's day" and not   justa day for
   the supporters of the competing clubs. The F.A. state that people who spend many
   countless hours keeping local football clubs up and down the Country afloat should
   be entitled to be given an opportunity to see a major showpiece of the season. I
   submit that in principal this sounds admirable but, in practice, many of the
   people to whom these tickets are issued do not utilise them themselves but sell
   them at a vastly inflated price, through Agencies or otherwise to supporters who
   are desparate to see the match.

   This obviously causes resentment and at   last years F.A. Cup Final -             for example,
   the sight of touts with wads of tickets   in their possession was too             muchfor some
   supporters and the odd fracas ensued.

   Prior to the Hillsborough Disaster, it was announced that the capacity at Wembley
   Stadium for this years F.A. Cup Final would be reduced to 88,000 and that the
   competing clubs would only receive 22,500 tickets each. However, since the
   disaster, I understand the Football Association have announced that if the final
   takes place, then the competing clubs will be given a minimum of 35,000 tickets
   each. This obviously shows a complete change of heart by the Football Association
   w h o have now (post Hillsborough) decided the supporters of the competing finalists

   should be given the vast majority of the tickets. I respectfully submit that this
   once again shows for many years the Football Association have treated supporters
   with contempt.

   I trust that you find the above to be of assistance and if you wish to contact me,
   I will be delighted to give any further evidence should you so require.

 Dear Sirs,

 Hillsborough Disaster - 15th April 1989.

 I write to you as a Liverpool Football Club Season Ticket Holder and Shareholder
                        * * » * * - * « » ^-a>tea


Sl?ofifSKPOl?t that 1 wishut° ITHke is regarding the allocation of tickets for
tius match. As you are probably avare, Liverpool Football Club have an average
IQ n n n ^ n S n      whereas Nottingham Forest have an average attendance of
        ?        lherefor? to ^ive Liverpool Football Club 23,500 tickets and
                                   '000 cannot      sense, and quite frankly, shows
contempt by the Footballing Authontes for the Supporter who attends Liverpool
match6*5 63       every week and yet, was unable to obtain tickets for this major


It has been said that the reason for this discrepancy in the allocation was due to
M62 f S             *t w a s . s t a t e d that traffic frcm Liverpool would ccme along the
    3X1(3 down th® m leaving at Junction 36 and then travel down the A6l and would
park on reads off Halifax toad. Although quite a lot of t r S S c
^                  thousands of vehicles did travel fran Liverpool along "the snake"
andWbodhead Passes and therefore parked along Penistone Road which is situate
f the saath/east side of the ground, and supporters leaving their cars would have
to walk through the Nottingham Forest section to reach Leppings Lane. I
respectfully submit that it is therefore nonsense to say that by allocating
Liverpool the north and west sides of the ground, it would avoid meeting
Nottingham Forest supporters.

It is interesting to note, that prior to the match the atmosphere outside the
ground was highly good natured and that there were no reports of any trouble
between the various sets of fans.

supporters standing in orderly queues to enter into the turnstiles Frcm

Iepping Lane turnstiles and this is always going to be inadequate to control
approximately 4000 supporters waiting to enter the ground just prior to kick off.

   the North Stand (near to the Kop entrance) and not at the lappings Lane
   turnstiles. These turnstiles were not open for this natch and it has been the
   policy not to open these turnstiles for semi-finals notwithstanding the fact that
   a capacity attendance is expected. In other words, 23,400 Liverpool supporters
   had to walk down Leppings Lane and all enter the Leppings Lane turnstiles.
   Approximately 10,000 of these supporters would then walk into the North Stand.

   If one looks at the entrance to the Leppings Lane turnstiles, one will notice that
   it refers specifically to Leppings Lane seating and'standing accomodation and no
   mention is made above these turnstiles regarding entrance to the North Stand. In
   other words, during normal matches, supporters who wish to sit in the North Stand,
   do not enter through these turnstiles. If the North Stand turnstiles had been
   opened, approximately 10,000 supporters would not have been required to enter
   through the Leppings Lane turnstiles and therefore, only approximately
   13,000/14,000 supporters would have entered the fifteen turnstiles in Leppings
   Lane and, queues would not have formed so quickly and it is therefore quite
   conceivable that at 2.45 p.m. there would have been under 2000 people waiting
   outside Leppings Lane and not the reported 4000 people.

    It will be stated that the reason for not opening the turnstiles in the North
    Stand was that these turnstiles were near the Barest supporters. Quite frankly,
    if the Police feared that there would be trouble between rival supporters, then it
    would not be too difficult , to have a small cordon of Police- Officers outside the
    North Stand turnstiles to avoid any trouble which, the writer believes was not
    likely to happen because of the good natured humour of the crcwd outside the
    stadium.
    I have attended semi-finals at Hillsborough in 1980 and 1987. In 1980 1 was
    sitting in the West Stand and left the ground at the Leppings Lane turnstile.
    Approximately 23,000 Liverpool supporters had to leave using the same turnstiles
    and the crush leaving the ground was frightening. In view of this experience, in
    1987 when I was sitting in the North Stand, at the end of the match I tried to
    leave the stadium using the North Stand turnstiles but, upon reaching the exit, I
    noted that the gates were locked and it was quite impossible for any supporters to
    leave through this exit and therefore, I had to leave along the back of the North
    Stand and out through Leppings Lane and again, the crush vras unbearable.

     I can only assume that in semi-finals at Hillsborough vfcen Liverpool were not
     involved, supporters using the Leppings Lane end of the ground had to endure
     similar difficulties. In view of these difficulties encountered over many semi
     finals, one would believe that the relevant authorities would open as many
     turnstiles as possible, to avoid crushing at the beginning and end of the match,
     but it appears that is has taken a disaster like this for the lesson to be learnt.

  Finally, I would like to make a point regarding the wider issue of ticket
  allocation/overcrowding during Cup Finals at Wembley. As you are probably aware,
  until this season, 98,000 tickets are issued for the F.A. Cup Final at Wembley and
  25,000 tickets go to each of the carpeting finalists. In other words 48,000
  tickets are distributed throughout other clubs affiliated to the Football
  Association. During recent years, it has appeared increasingly evident that the
  issue of 25,000 tickets to the Clubs with large followings is far fran sufficient.
  Many fans without tickets have been approaching the Wembley Stadium and this has
  been partly responsible for the crushing outside certain entrances prior to kick
  off. The scenes have turned ugly due to the desparation of supporters wishing to
  see the game and being unable to enter the Stadium.

  I feel that is merely good luck, and not good management that there has not been
  irajor disaster outside Wembley Stadium in the last few years.

  Clubs have stated that this problem can be avoided by giving the two carpeting
  clubs increased allocations - particularly to those clubs like Liverpool who have
  a very large following. The Football Association, in their wisdom, have said this
  is not possible;that the F.A. Cup Final is "football's day" and not just a day for
  the supporters of the carpeting clubs. Hie F.A. state that people who spend many
  countless hours keeping local football clubs up and down the Country afloat should
  be entitled to be given an opportunity to see a major showpiece of the season. I
  submit that in principal this sounds admirable but, in practice, many of the
  people to whan these tickets are issued do not utilise than themselves but sell
  than at\ a vastly inflated price, through Agencies or otherwise to supporters who
  are desparate to see the natch.

  This obviously causes resentment and at last years F.A. Cup Final - for example,
  the sight of touts with wads of tickets in their possession was too much for seme
  supporters and the odd fracas ensued.

  Prior to the Hillsborough Disaster, it was announced that the capacity at Wembley
  Stadium for this years F.A. Cup Final would be reduced to 88,000 and that the
  carpeting clubs would only receive 22,500 tickets each. However, since the
  disaster, I understand the Football Association have announced that if the final
  takes place, then the carpeting clubs will be given a minimum of 35,000 tickets
  each. This obviously shows a complete change of heart by the Football Association
  who have now (post Hillsborough) decided the supporters of the carpeting finalists

   Dear Sirs,

   Hillsborough Disaster - 15th April 1989.

   I write to you as a Liverpool Football Club Season Ticket Holder and Shareholder,
   who was present in the North Stand at the ill-fated Semi-Final between Nottingham
   Forest and Liverpool.

   The first point that I wish to make is regarding the allocation of tickets for
   this match. As you are probably aware, Liverpool Football Club have an average
   attendance of 39,000 whereas Nottingham Forest have an average attendance of
   19,000/20,000. Therefore to give Liverpool Football Club 23,500 tickets and
   Nottingham Forest approximately 29,000 cannot make sense, and quite frankly, shows
   contempt by the Footballing Authorites for the Supporter who attends Liverpool
   matches each and every week and yet, was unable to obtain tickets for this major
   match.

   It has been said that the reason for this discrepancy in the allocation was due to
   traffic control. It was stated that traffic frcm Liverpool WDuld came along the
   M62 and down the Ml leaving at Junction 36 and then travel down the A61 and WDuld
   park on roads off Halifax Road. Although quite a lot of traffic did cone along
   this route; many thousands of vehicles did travel frcm Liverpool along "the snake"
   and "Woodhead Passes" and therefore parked along Penistone Road which is situate
   on the south/east side of the ground, and supporters leaving their cars WDuld have
   to walk through the Nottingham Forest section to reach Leppings Lane. I
   respectfully submit that it is therefore nonsense to say that by allocating
   Liverpool the north and west sides of the ground, it would avoid meeting
   Nottingham Forest supporters.

   It is interesting to note, that prior to the match the atmosphere outside the
   ground was highly good natured and that there vere no reports of any trouble
   between the various sets of fans.

   I would therefore like to add, that if the Football Association were insistent
   upon Hillsborough being a suitable venue for this natch, there would not have
   taken much imagination/re-routing of traffic, to enable Liverpool Football Club to
   have the kop end (east end) terracing and Nottingham Forest to have the other
   side of the ground.

  Secondly, there is the natter of control inside and outside the ground. We
  arrived in our seats, North Stand (Row 11 seats 68/71) at approximately 1.40 p.m.
  during v^ich time the ground'was quite empty. As kick off approached, it was
  noticeable that the two centre sections of lapping Lane terracing vere becoming
  very full, but the two wing sections vere in places sparsely populated. Fran
  newspaper and press reports, it appears that the computer informed the Police
  outside the stadium that there vere still 3000 places available on the terracing
  and, I understand, that it is for this reason that the additional gate was opend.
  One can only assume that the Police outside the stadium vere not informed of the
  hereabouts of those 3000 spaces as, it appears that the gate which was opened,
  led directly into the centre terracing and it was not even possible for supporters
  who came through these gates to enter the wing sections. Obviously, being in my
  seat since 1.40 p.m. I cannot cannent on exactly what happened outside the
  stadium, I can only make observation fran what I saw fran my seat and fron what I
  have seen and read since the event.

  Having watched football matches for many years, I have noticed Police procedure in
  controlling crowds and, in Merseyside and Greater Manchester crowds, when queues
  are about to form, the Police (usually on horseback) usually insist upon
  supporters standing in orderly queues to enter into the turnstiles Fran
  television pictures, it appears that there vere only two police horses at the
  lapping Lane turnstiles and this is always going to be inadequate to control
  approximately 4000 supporters waiting to enter the ground just prior to kick off.

 Notwithstanding all the above, I feel that there is one matter which has not been
 stated by the media since the event and, which I believe to be totally fundamental
 to the disaster - namely the arrangements made for Liverpool supporters entering
 the Stadium. I have attended Sheffield Wednesday -v- Liverpool league matches at
 Hillsborough over a period of many years and until recently, have watched these
 games fran the North Stand, (this area is now an area resewed for Sheffield
 Wednesday members only). These matches vere always veil attended, but to my
 knowledge, there has never been a full house of 54,000 for a league match between
 these two sides. When entering the North Stand for these matches, one enters the
 turnstiles especially designated for the North Stand which are at the east side of
                                                            SOLICITORS

  the North Stand (near to the Kop entrance) and not at the Leppings Lane
  turnstiles. These turnstiles vere not open for this match and it has been the
  policy not to open these turnstiles for semi-Tln^s'notwithstanding the fact that
  a capacity attendance is expected. In other words, 23,400 Liverpool supporters
  had to walk down Leppings Lane and all enter the Leppings Lane turnstiles.       j
  Approximately 10,000 of these supporters would then walk into the North Stand.   ’

  If one looks at the entrance to the Leppings Lane turnstiles, one will notice that
  it refers specifically to Leppings Lane seating and standing acconmodation and no
  mention is made above these turnstiles regarding entrance to the North Stand. In
  other words, during normal matches, supporters who wish to sit in the North Stand,
  do not enter through these turnstiles. If the North Stand turnstiles had been
  opened, approximately 10,000 supporters would not have been required to enter
  through the Leppings Lane turnstiles and therefore, only approximately
  13,000/14,000 supporters would have entered the fifteen turnstiles in Leppings
  Lane and, queues would not have formed so quickly and it is therefore quite
  conceivable that at 2.45 p.m. there would have been under 2000 people waiting
  outside Leppings Lane and not the reported 4000 people.

  It will be stated that the reason for not opening the turnstiles in the North
  Stand was that these turnstiles vere near the Forest supporters. Quite frankly,
  if the Police feared that there would be trouble between rival supporters, then it
  would not be too difficult , to have a small cordon of Police Officers outside the
  North Stand turnstiles to avoid any trouble which, the writer believes was not
  likely to happen because of the good natured humour of the crowd outside the
  stadium.

  I have attended semi-finals at Hillsborough in 1980 and 1987. In 1980 I was
  sitting in the West Stand and left the ground at the Leppings Lane turnstile.
  Approximately 23,000 Liverpool supporters had to leave using the same turnstiles
  and the crush leaving the ground was frightening. In view of this experience, in
  1987 when I was sitting in the North Stand, at the end of the match I tried to
  leave the stadium using the North Stand turnstiles but, upon reaching the exit, I
  noted that the gates vere locked and it was quite impossible for any supporters to
  leave through this exit and therefore, I had to leave along the back of the North
  Stand and out through Leppings Lane and again, the crush was unbearable.

  I can only assume that in semi-finals at Hillsborough when Liverpool were not
  involved, supporters using the Leppings Lane end of the ground had to endure
  similar difficulties. In view of these difficulties encountered over many semi
  finals, one would believe that the relevant authorities would open as many
  turnstiles as possible, to avoid crushing at the beginning and end of the match,
  but it appears that is has taken a disaster like this for the lesson to be learnt.

  Finally, I would like to make a point regarding the wider issue of ticket
  allocation/overcrowding during Cup Finals at Wembley. As you are probably aware,
  until this season, 98,000 tickets are issued for the F.A. Cup Final at Wembley and
  25,000 tickets go to each of the canpeting finalists. In other words 48,000
  tickets are distributed throughout other clubs affiliated to the Football
  Association. During recent years, it has appeared increasingly evident that the
  issue of 25,000 tickets to the Clubs with large followings is far fran sufficient.
  Many fans without tickets have been approaching the Wembley Stadium and this has
  been partly responsible for the crushing outside certain entrances prior to kick
  off. The scenes have turned ugly due to the desparation of supporters wishing to
  see the game and being unable to enter the Stadium.

  I feel that is merely good luck, and not good management that there has not been
  major disaster outside Wembley Stadium in the last few years.

  Clubs have stated that this problem can be avoided by giving the two canpeting
  clubs increased allocations - particularly to those clubs like Liverpool who have
  a very large following. The Football Association, in their wisdan, have said this
  is not possible;that the F.A. Cup Final is "football's day" and not just a day for
  the supporters of the carpeting clubs. The F.A. state that people who spend many
  countless hours keeping local football clubs up and down the Country afloat should
  be entitled to be given an opportunity to see a major showpiece of the season. I
  submit that in principal this sounds admirable but, in practice, many of the
  people to whcm these tickets are issued do not utilise them themselves but sell
  them at a vastly inflated price, through Agencies or otherwise to supporters who
  are desparate to see the match.

  This obviously causes resentment and at last years F.A. Cup Final - for example,
  the sight of touts with wads of tickets in their possession was too much for sane
  supporters and the odd fracas ensued.

  Prior to the Hillsborough Disaster, it was announced that the capacity at Wembley
  Stadium for this years F.A. Cup Final would be reduced to 88,000 and that the
  carpeting clubs would only receive 22,500 tickets each. However, since the
  disaster, I understand the Football Association have announced that if the final
  takes place, then the canpeting clubs will be given a minimum of 35,000 tickets
  each. This obviously shows a complete change of heart by the Football Association
  who have now (post Hillsborough) decided the supporters of the canpeting finalists

   should be given the vast majority of the tickets. I respectfully submit that this
   once again shows for many years the Football Association have treated supporters
   with contempt.

   I trust that you find the above to be of assistance and if you wish to contact me,

    Ir j   At     a b o u t 2.55/pm            (1455)       in    company          with    other           officers            I attended                at

           the     Gate     public        hou/e       after       receiving          a    report           of       trouble       ^yi'side.               I

           made      my    way     to    the    fire       door    at    the       side    of    the        premises.               A group              of

           men     some     with        bloodstained             faces       were    stood       outside.

           The     men     were     protesting             about       being       ejected       from           the       premises           and     it

           was     clear         from    their       accents       that       the    men    were           from Liverpool.                         Entry

           to     th e    premises        was    eventually             effected          and    th e       house          was      cleared          and

At    about    3.20       pm       (1320)        I attended            at    t he       Hillsboro/gh               football

ground.        At       this       t ime    I was       in    company            with     P C 'f O S / G Q S S .        On    entering

the    ground       two       bodies        were       carried         towards           us.         They w e r e        layed       at       the

side    of a n      ambulance              and    attempts            were       made      to    screen         the      bodies          from

the    view    of       the    supporters.                 However          th e      mood      of     the    supporters             wa s

becoming       more       aggressive              towards         us w i t h          taunts         that     t h e / P o l ice      were

to    blame    f/o r     the       deaths.          I then        helped           to    carry         the    t/io b o d i e s       to       the

gymnasium          complex          at     the    ground,

We    la y   the    bodies          at     the    far      end    of       the     gymnasium and                attempted            to

screen       them       from       general        v iew.         At    that        time      I oelieved             that          this    was

the    total       of    dead.           In a     very       short         time       bodies         were     brought             into    the

gymnasium          in a       constant           f l ow.      They         were       carried          in m a i n l y        by    other

supporters          who       simply        laid       them      on    the       floor       and       left.

The    first       bodies          brought        in all         seemed          to     be y o u n g      people         of       between

14 a n d     18 y e a r s      of a g e.          The      bodies          were       still      warm        and    initially             I

attempted          resuscitation                 but    this      became           impossible             due      to    the       scale       of

the    incident.              It    became        a matter            of    simply         laying         the      bodies          in s o m e

semblance          of    order.

I remained          at    the       gymnasium           until         2 am       (0200)         th e    following             morning

when     I returned            to     Doncaster            and    retired             from      dut y .

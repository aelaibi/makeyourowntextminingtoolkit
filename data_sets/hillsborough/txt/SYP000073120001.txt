no d i st u rb ances        or fights,       at all.      At about 2.30          pm I began to feel

was   o bvious        to me then that         to man y people          had entered the         pen.

I m a n a g e d to     climb up on to a lower             rail       on the fencing         just    to the

a bout      cL.50    pm I could not move any             part of my body and               I was    finding

it e x t r e me l y difficult          to breathe all          the w ay through these              times    I

did not wi tn ess any            crowd surge.           At 2.50       pm I knew      I had to get out              I

lifted m yself          up on the fencing and             began to move          down to the front of

the   pen b a la ncing on the fence                  because    of the height         of the fencing.              I

people as           the Police        kept       stopping    people then keeping               others    in the

pen 3 as well               but    I did not see whether                or not      this gate was       opened.

I did not           see the barrier              back    in pen 3 and was            not by it when        it

broke.          I m a n a g e d to get       to the front of the                  pen and was     posit io ne d        in

the    left hand            corner    just       below the fences w h i c h           lead out onto the

pitch.          I was       just    pushed forward and             I remember a man had             p ositioned

himself         on the front          fencing and he was helping                     people out.        W he n    I

was    pushed forward               I m a n a g e d to get over          the      top of the front       fencing

and    I fell         down,       on my back       landing on the           perimeter      edge of the

running         track during          the    times       I was    in the       pen s truggling      to get

out.       I did not witness                anyone       in the    pen     (3)     die.   After    I had     landed

on my back            I was       picked up by someone             else     I turned back and           looked

into the            pen where       I saw that                    was    still      positioned on the            side

him by the            car    it was       obvious at this          time     that     the game w o u l d n ’t go

on the         pitch by the          corner       flag    I saw numerous            people wit h    injuries

                  I left    the ground              really    late as       I was     one of the         last    to go.

I had to          c^Limb t h r ou gh the fencing               that       had been       cut    in pen 3 and go

back      out     through the          tunnel.         The gro un d had v i r t ua ll y             cleared     it was

w he n    I saw                       I witnessed           nothing       that    I consider          to be a

criminal          offence.           The   things      I consider          caused the deaths and

injuries          to    people a l l o w e d to enter              pens 3 and 4 creating                the    crowd

crush a nd also            the       police a nd stewards             seemed very slow                in reacting         to

the s i t u at io n w h ic h was              o b v i ou sl y serious.           After    the m atch was

s t o p p ed the        police       did not seem to grasp the                    s ituation quick            enough

not      e nough officers were a s s i st in g at                    the    front     of the

t erraces         compared to the number                    of officers          that a pp e a r e d from no

w he/e      to stand on the                half way        line,    some of these officers                 should

but      they did not seem to know how to                           react    to the situation.                 I also

cannot       see how the s i t u at io n was a l l o w e d to get so bad                             in relat io n to

 as      taking        place.      I feel      the    lateness       of    people     to the t urnstiles was

         ibly due        to the street              signs w h i c h had been direc te d on certain

      p-posts          on streets          leading     to the ground the signs                      did not

said 20           minu te s from the sign to the                       ground       ittook us 40 minutes.

W h e n we        e nte re d the turn st il es              there      were      only two or three            policemen

         turn st il es and so get                 people    through the t urnstiles            quicker       the mass

         of   people was          due       to   people     panicking about         getting    into the ground

         because       they were            late,    there was     no   i ndication once          in the ground

         that yo u could go                 left or right a ro u n d the           back of the West Stand to

         the outer         terracing areas,               signs w o u l d   have    informed      people of this,

         then       people might            not have      rushed down the tunnel.

         As   they did,          from the          police    control    point      the   police   should have

         m o n i t o r e d the    p os it io n better         so that w hen the          crowds got too

         Dear Lionel

                                          Fences at Football Grounds

        Thank you for letting me have a copy of the letter from the Football Task Force to
        the Secretary of State dated 10 June in which Government suupport is sought for
        the removal of the remaining fences in this country.

        You are well aware of the FLAâ€™s views on this issue. Over the last 8 years we have
        always encouraged the removal of fences but recognise this can only be achieved
        where the certifying authority, club and members of the safety advisory group are
        satisfied that adequate safety management systems are in place.

        In your reply to the Task Force you may wish to make the following points

                    *   The number of grounds with perimeter fences has decreased from 57 in
                        March '93 to 10 in March '98.
                    *   At the start of next season there will be just 8 grounds with fences.
                    *   The UEFA guidelines were heavily influenced by the British.
                    *   The FLA played an important role in persuading the French there was a
                        better alternative to fences at the majority of the World Cup venues.

        If you require more detailed information on either of the last two points John would
        be happy to provide it, although you would have to wait until next week.

        Yours sincerely




        Keith Sears

Dear Mr Pyne

I refer to your facsimile letter of 12 and 22 May 1998.

I can confirm that I have forwarded to you copies of the statements as requested and
responded to the queries raised by Ms Adlington in your letter of 12 May 1998.

I can advise you that all the officers reports including R1 to R93 were forwarded to Lord
Justice Stuart-Smith as part of his scrutiny and authority was given for copies of the same
to be placed in the House of Commons Library.

The abbreviations QOR and FIO refer to Questionnaire Officers Report and Force
Intelligence Officer respectively.

Yours sincerely

              At      that     time       hundreds    of L i v e r p o o l     supporters             were     walking        down

              Middlewood             Rd    towards    the     football         ground.

,At a b o u t      1 .45     pm    (1345          h r s ) th e      same       day    I went         into

Newsagents              in M i d d l e w o o d       Rd.         The     owners       Mr     and     Mrs                      are

friends         of m i n e        and       I stayed            in t h e i r     shop      talking         until    about          3pm

(1500     h r s ).         Quite        a    large         number        of L i v e r p o o l      supporters           came       into

t he   shop        to    b uy     sweets          etc,      however         at a b o u t      2pm       (1400     hrs)     a f ew

supporters              came      in a n d        asked         where      the    nearest          pu b was.




I left        the       s h o p at      2.55        pm     (1455        h r s ) to 3 . 0 0      pm      (1500     h r s ) and       walked

home.         As    I came         out       of     the     shop        there     were       s t il l    some     supporters

(stragglers)               walking           in M i d d l e w o o d       Rd,     towards          the     ground       the     majority

of     them     were       carrying           cans         of    beer      and    were       shouting          (football

chants).            I c o u l d n ’t t e l l             if t h e y      were     drunk       but       they     were     walking

along     drinking              from        the     cans.



I d id    not       witness          any      violence             or    really       b ad     conduct         by a n y    of      the

supporters.                They      were         j us t    high        spirited.




I ar r i v e d      ho m e      about        3 pm    (1500         h r s ) but       before        3.05     pm    (1505       hrs).




I had     only          been      home       about         five     minutes          when     I saw        some    Liverpool

supporters              getting         into        their        cars      which      were      parked         outside        my    hous e .

I realised              that      something              was     wrong      at    that       stage.

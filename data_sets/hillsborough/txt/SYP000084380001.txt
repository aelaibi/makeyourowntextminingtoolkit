there was more            trouble at the other                 side of the             tunnel.          In a t t e m p t i n g

I p r e s um ed that        it was      fighting.

On pushing my way t h r o u g h the tunnel                       and on e n t e r i n g the             terracing

All    persons        in the       pile a p p e a r e d      to me to be dead.

As the bodies were                 being     removed,          the s u p p o r t e r s were          s c r e a m i n g and

I was     struck       twice,        as    I remember,          by u n kn o w n a s s a i l a n t s          as    I was

I was     not     br ui se d or          i njured as a result,                 however,        they were

d e f i n i t e l y d el i b e r a t e    blows.        As a t t e m p t s were made             to remove            the

bodies      on the terracing,                other        o ffic er s    on the         pitch side            of     the

fencing,        ripped the           f encing        off the s e c u r i n g         posts.         The m a j o r i t y of

it took       to clear         the       bodies a w a y from the terracing.

As the bodies were                 cl eared,         the s u p p o r t e r s    in the W es t S t a n d              started

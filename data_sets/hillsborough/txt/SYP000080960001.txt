t i cket                                 a    club        organiser                 got    us     our       tickets         and      handed          them

out    on    the        Y
                        coach,          my    ticket            cost       me £ 1 2 . 0 0 p.

We w e r e     dropped             off       about        a mile           f r o m the L e p p i n g s            Lane          e n d of       the

ground       everyone              rushed           to    the        ground           so as       t i me      was    g e t t i n g on,          I

cannot        be    s ur e w h a t           t ime       we     were       let       off     the       coach        taut I t h i n k           it w as

about       1 . 3 0 p m , we m a d e           our        way        to    the       ground.

I saw a        fe w P o l i c e          Officers               on      the     streets           from        the    coach         park        to    the

ground       but        there       didn't           seem          to     be    very man y             I knew where                my    entry

p o i n t w a s as           I ’d b e e n       to       the       ground           three        or    f o ur     times         b ef o r e .

We all       separated              as we           had       left        the       coach,        the       two H e w i t t        brothers

passed        us as we             got        off    the        coach and made                   their        way     to         the g r o u n d ,       I

didn't       speak           to    t h e m at        all,          indeed           I d i d n ’t k n o w / t h e i r n a m e s          only

their       faces.           I a r r i v e d at           the L e p p i n g s             Lane        tu/nstiles            at a b o u t        1.45pm

there       w e r e n ’t a n y          queues        at all,              j u s t at                  of     people        at     the

turnstiles.

I saw many              people          a s k ing        for       ticks^fs          to    the        g a m e,    I also         saw     one        or

two    people           drinking             from        cans        o f b eer         and       l ager       however           I d i d n ’t see

anyone       drunk           and    causing              trouble.

We    decided           to    go    straight              into          the     gr o u n d ,      I located my                  turnstile

easily,        I had          to    push my w ay                   through           the     crowd          to    get      to m y       turnstile

I went       through              the    turnstiles                  with                                                                           , and

                         and                              , as we w e n t                 through           the     turnstiles             we       were

searched           by the p o l i c e ,              beyond             the     turnstiles                 we w e n t      our     separate

seats      at     about       2 . 0 0 p m , everything                 seemed           quite       norm^

The      first     t im e     I realised            anything               w as    wrondf w o u l d          be at       about        3 or 4

minutes         after        ki ck    off.       I d i d n ’t see a n y                 surges       in the         crowd and              I

didn't      see        a barrier           break       inyT de a n y              of    the    pens

At a b o u t      3 or 4 m i n u t e s           pasJr t h r e e           I saw        peopLfr c l i m b i n g          over     the

front      fences         o n to     the    p it/h ,       from my            position            I could        see      that        the

centre      pens        were       o v e r ctypwded„ I saw P o l i c e                     officers           pushing          fans        back

on t o    the     terraces,           \Jj(£n as        the       game        was       stopped       I realised            that

something          wa s      seriously           wrong.          I saw        people          climbing          onto      the     pitch

and      collapsing.            I c o u l d n ’t see             individuals               die      and      I d i d n ’t a s s i s t

with      anyone        who     was    dead       or      i n ju re d.        All       the    f an s     in m y a r e a        were           just

standing          up    looking        at    what         wa s    going           oi

I feel      th at       there        was    different             polici/g              policy       thi s y e a r        compared                 to

last      year?        last     year       the    police          and R e w a r d s            s t o p p e d all         the    f ans          s o me

distance          from       the     turnstiles h a               c h ec k        t i c k e ts?     t his     year       there        was          no

such      control         and      people        j us t    grmlped            up to gel^/Cnto                 the    ground.           The

only      other        thing       I saw     th at        may     have        contributed               to    the    disaster              was

th a t   as P e t e r        Beardsley           hit      the     bar        the/crowd            in the        pens      did move

f o r war d.

We     stopped         in our        seats       and      watch what               was     going        on,^/There         seemed              to

be a      complete           lack     of    organisation                   between         the P o L t c e       officers ; a                  lot

'just     stood about              doing     nothing             in    particular,                t/here      appeared           to    be a

large      number         of P o l i c e     Officers             there           who    di/fin’t k n o w w h a t          to do?              I

feel      that     if the          numbers        of a vai l a b l V y p o ^ u r e             had      been sent          to     the

Leppings          Lane       end     turnstiles            before            kick       off    time       then      they       could           have

controlled             the    crowd and            possibly            prevented              the    disaster            from

occurring.

             The    game        was    officially abandoned                        and      we    left     the      ground       after        the

             announcement              at    about         4 . 1 5 pm a n d      returned           to    our    coach,        eventually

             at    about        5.15    pm we         all       got    onto      the     coach,          a Police       officers           came

             round and           approached             the      party        organiser                                 he a s k e d       if we

             We    all     drove       h om e    on     the      coach,        only      then       did    I realise           t h at    the     two

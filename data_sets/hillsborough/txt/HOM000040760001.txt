Issue


What response should be given to further correspondence from Mr
Joe Benton MP which is in response to the Home Secretary's reply
of   25    July   to    his    earlier    letter    of    27    June.      (A copy      of Mr
Benton's     letter      is    attached   at A nne x A         for convenience.)             Mr
Benton once again asks for a meeting with the Home Secretary (or
failing     that    a    junior    Minister)       to    discuss         the   case    of   his
constituents,          Mr and Mrs Church,      who lost their son during the
Hillsborough        disaster.        (Copies       of    the     earlier        papers      are
attached at An n e x B for Miss Gooch's benefit.)


Timing


2.      No deadline as such.


Summary


3.   Mr Benton's earlier correspondence requested a meeting with
the Home Secretary to discuss the difficulties his constituents
have faced in seeking answers to questions about their son G a r y 's
death      during      the    Hillsborough   Disaster.              Mr    Benton      did   not
indicate what these difficulties were.                    In his reply of 25 July,
the   Home     Secretary        advised,      amongst   other       things,        that   there
would be no useful purpose in having such a meeting since there
is no action which he could properly take in this matter.


4.      In    his    latest      correspondence,        Mr    Benton        asks    the    Home
Secretary      to reconsider his decision and suggests                        that in the
absence of a meeting with the Home Secretary, he should agree to
such a m e e t in g taking place with a junior minister.                            Mr Benton
states that he has asked the Home Secretary for a meeting because
he believes that it is for the Home Office to consider the main
injustices suffered by his constituents.                        However,       none of the
areas    m entioned       are    ones    in    which    the    Home      Secretary        could
properly i n t e r v e n e .


Recommendation


5.    That the Home Secretary should not agree to meet Mr Benton
and Mr and Mrs Church for the reason given in the attached draft
reply    and    that      he    should   not    offer    a    meeting       with     a    junior
minister.


Consideration


6.    In asking the Home Secretary to reconsider his request for
a meeting,           Mr   Benton   once    again     does     not   go    into      any   great
detail about the difficulties his constituents have faced - he
states that the issues are too long and complicated and need to
be related          first hand rather than through correspondence.                           Mr
Benton       does,    however,     state      that   his     constituents          have    been
poorly       served by a variety of legal representatives                           and since
some of this representation has been met from the Legal Aid Fund
this has involved a waste of public money.                     Should Mr Benton wish
to pursue this matter he should do so with the Lord Chancellor's
Department.


7.      Mr    Benton      also   complains       that   he    has     not    yet     received
information in response to correspondence he has had with Mr Iain
Sproat MP (Department of National Heritage) in wh ic h he requested
details of those who comprise the Hillsborough Steering Group.
We understand that this group consists of    legal representatives
of those families who lost relatives at Hillsborough.      This is
a matter for Mr Benton to pursue with the Department of National
Heritage.


Handling


8.   There are no special handling issues.

Thank you for your letter of 1 August in which you asked me to
reconsider my decision, conveyed in my letter of 25 July, not to
agree to your request for a meeting to discuss the difficulties
which have been faced by your constituents, Mr and Mrs Church in
relation to their son's death during the Hillsborough disaster.
I am sorry that you should feel that in coming to my decision I
did not consider the matter properly.                         I can only assure you that
this is not the case and I think that my earlier reply reflects
this.


Having       considered          the      points         contained         in     your    recent
correspondence,            I have to say that I remain of the view that it
would not       serve      any useful purpose                for me    to agree      to such a
meeting - either with me or with one of the                                junior ministers.
To do so would only raise the hopes of Mr and Mrs Church when,
ultimately,         there is no action I can properly take.


You mention         that    your     constituents            have   been     badly     served by
those legally representing them.                        You will appreciate that this
is not a matter for the Home Office and should Mr and Mrs Church
wish to make a formal complaint about this,                            they should contact
the Lord C h a n c e l l o r 's D e p a r t m e n t .


You say that you have not yet received a reply to correspondence
to Iain Sproat at the Department of National Heritage, concerning
the names of those comprising the Hillsborough Steering Group.
I   can      only    suggest       that     you     raise       this       matter    with     that
Department once more.                  In the meantime,             I have arranged for a
copy    of    this,      and     your    correspondence,              to   be   sent     to   Iain
Sproat's Private Office for his information.

     1 August 1994.

     Dear Home Secretary,
                                                                                       ^>U
     Mr           Mrs        Church


     I wrote to you on 27 June 1994 in respect of the
     above named constituents of mine and you replied to
     me dated 25 July.     I was extremely disappointed
     with your response and I do feel obliged to write
     to you again in order to retaliate on several
     points.

     1. I do not accept that you individually considered
        all   aspects   of   this   case  and   I   seek
        reconsideration of my request to meet with you.

     2. My constituents are not associated with other
        bereaved families in the legal sense as they are
        acting   independently   outside  the   pressure
        groups.

     3. I referred to the manner in which they have been
        so   badly    served  by   a  variety   of legal
        representatives and I give the example of £6/000
        of public money to one firm of solicitors alone,
        by way of Legal Aid/ has been paid and nothing
        but nothing shown for by way of return.       My
        constituents have paid out of their own pockets
        well over £5/000 in pursuance of the justice I
        referred to in my earlier letter and there will
        be other amounts of Legal Aid involved.


RECEIVED BY
                                                         Continued Over /.
   - 3 AUG 1994
                                              Representing:
PRIVATE SEOfliTARY^        Ford, Linacre, Litherland, Netherton, Orrell and St. O swald’s Wards.
Continued /



4. I specifically did not go into detail in my
   letter about the serious difficulties faced by
   my constituents    (your 1st paragraph    in your
   response refers) because as I explained/ they
   are long and complicated and need to be related
   first   hand   rather   than   hand  written    to
   appreciate the poignancy and full effect of
   their   difficulties.      Furthermore/    despite
   numerous requests by Mr. & Mrs.      Church/   and
   myself   of  their behalf/   to   a  variety    of
   individuals and organisations (I have contacted
   our colleague Ian Sproat M.P. as Minister of
   Heritage) we still cannot obtain the names of
0 the individuals comprising the Hillsborough
 » Steering Group.   This is fundamental information
   required by my constituents.

5.    I have not made this request to you in the sense
     of trying to   find any Minister likely to react
     to my constituents'     plight.   Rather/  it is
     because I believe your office is the appropriate
     one to consider the main injustices in the whole
     sequence of events and/ I am appealing to you
     once more to    grant my request.    If you still
     feel unable to do s o , would you please consider
     requesting one of your junior Ministers to meet
     me and my constituents ?.

1 hope    consistent   with   all  the  notions   of
compassion and justice which I trust we both share/
you  will   consider my   request  not  only  for  a
meeting/ but for a Judicial Review as referred to
in my Early Day Motion No. 1372 (attached) and
which is supported at the last count by 50 of our
colleagues across the political parties.

My constituents feel they are being denied their
civil and legal rights and I have to say I fully
and totally support them .

I look forward to what I hope will be a favourable
response to this letter.


Yours sincerely

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1,    BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION, THE SUPPORTERS AND

       BETTER GROUNDS,   THEY SHOULD NOT TREAT THE FANS AS ANIMALS BY FENCING                THEM

 INTO CAGES.     THERE HAS TO BE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE         CLUBS, THE FA

 AND THE FANS.

 SHOULD BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY

 TOO MANY     PEOPLE OF AUTHORITY    (I.E. P O L I C E & STEWARDS) WERE JUST STANDING

 AROUND NOT DOING A N Y T H I N G . THE SUPPORTERS WERE THE FIRST TO REACT AND STARTED
                 --------
 USING THE ADVERTISING HOARDTfltiS AS MAKESHIFT S T R E T C H E R S . AT FIRST THE POLICE

 TRIED TO STOP THE SUPPORTERS DOING THIS         (BREAKING UP THE HOARDINGS FOR

 STRETCHERS) BUT LET THEM CARRY ON WHEN THEY REALISED WJaA3L THE SUPPORTERS WERE

 DOING.     THE NOTTINGHAM FOREST FANS STARTED TO BA/fi'Ht LIVERPOOL. SUPPORTERS M S
                                                                      C   a t t
 THEY OBVIOUSLY HAD NO IDEA OF WHAT' WAS GGING/DN,         A FEW LIVERPOOL. SUPPORTERS

 REACTED BY RUNNING TOWARDS THE NOTTINGHAM FOREST END.             THE POLICE PUT A CORDON

 ACROSS THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH* BUT T H E R E WAS NO NEED TO KEEP           IT THERE WHEN THE

 FOREST SUPPORTERS REALISED WHAT IM rS HAPPENING.          IN MY VIEW THERE WERE A LARGE

 i^tSER OF POLICE OFFICERS IN THAT CORDON WHO COULD HAVE BEEN USED MORE

 EFFECTIVELY.     THERE WAS A WPC AND A PC WHO GOT STUCK         IN GOING FROM ONE BODY TO

 THE NEXT TRYING TO REVIVE FANS WHO WERE LAID OUT ON THE PITCH BY THE GOAL.

 A FAN TRIED TO RIP THE GOAL NET DOWN AND THEN GOT HIM OUT THE WAY THEN TWO

 FANS ONE ON THE OTHERS SHOULDERS REMOVED THE NET AND THIS GAVE RESCUERS MORE

 ELBOW ROOM.

 THERE WERE ALSO A LARGE NUMBER OF DOG HANDLERS BROUGHT ONTO THE PITCH AREA

 WHICH SERVED NO PURPOSE AT A l l . OTHER THAN HAMPER FANS wHG WERE TRYING TO AID

 OTHER FANS WHO WERE INJURED.

 THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE INFORMATION GIVEN TO THE CROWD S O O N E R , THIS WOULD

      PREVENTED A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

 TURNSTILES AT THE LEPPINGS LANE END.         A FAILURE TO LISTEN TO ME TRYING TO

 GIVE ADVICE    (I AM NOT A Y O B , I AM AN ORDINARY MEMBER OF P U B L I C ) .    AT 2.30PM

 OFFICERS BEING USED TO ORGANISE THE QUEUES WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE PROBLEM.

 BEFORE THE QUEUING GOT OUT OF HAND THE HATTER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ORGANISED.                          IF

 THERE IS ALREADY A QUEUE FORMED FANS JOIN THE END I T ’S JUST A NATURAL

 PROGRESSION.

 IT WAS QUITE     E V ID E N T   THAT ALL THE FANS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET IN THE GROUND

 BEFORE THE KICK OFF TIME - THE KICK OFF SHOULIV'HAVE BEEN PUT BACK TO ENABLE

 PEOPLE TO GET IN.

JUST THAT LIVERPOOL FANS SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN 3 LEPPINGS LN END IN THE FIRST

FOREST FANS WERE SHOUTING AND TAUNTING.                      ONE DEAD FAT MAN WAS BEING CARRIED

NOTTS FOREST FANS IN THE KOP, AFTER THEY HAD LAYED THE BODIES DOWN THE NOTTS

FANS WERE CLIMBING ONTO THE PITCH TO FIGHT BACK.                        THE POLICE THEN FORMED A

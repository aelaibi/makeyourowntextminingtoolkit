Liverpool           supporters                 tp     that    end       of     the      ground.            My       impression              was

that     this       was        a    crowd       control,           public          order        situation.                    The

atmosphere              W l t h i n the. s t a d i u m            at    that       'time was           volatile.

As     I lookedi t o w r d s                the      Leppings           Lane       en d    of       the    ground             I saw        a

my way        to    the        youths        and       climbed          onto       the     fencing.                 As    I l o o k e d at

th e    c r o w d at       that        p o in t       I saw       that       although           the       terrace             was     packed

with     people           it       looked       to    be     nothing          more        than       that       people          did       not

appear        to    be     in d a n g e r .           At m y       request           the       two     youths            on    the       fencing

got     down,       dropping               back       into the         crowd       on the           terrace          s ide.              I got

down     off       the         fencing          at that p o i nt          to      see     a     number          of       youths          who     had

climbed        over        the       fencing          staggering              around.               I approached                one       of     the

youths        and       spoke         to    him.        It wa s         obvious           he wa s         injured             in s om e        way,

I formed           the         i m p r e s s i o n t ha t he        was       winded,           and       I therefore                 sat      him

down against                   b i l l b o a r d s n e a r to       the       goal       in     order          t h at     he       could       get

his     breath          back.

At     that    stage           I turned             round     to       see    that        the       cordon          of    officers             had

held     its       position            and     a     large        empty       space        created             on    the       pitch        behind

the     officers.                  I then       saw     the       accu sed !                        Irun       past       the       officers

and     into       the     penalty           area       in    front          of    the     Kop,           I saw          that       the

attention           of m a n y         in the         stadium           was       drawn       to     this       youth          as    he w a v e d

his     arms       at    opposing            spectators                within        the      Kop     who       were          obviously

becoming           excited           by     his      actions.            I then           focussed             my    attention              on

               standing              just      behind         the       cordon        of      officers.                  As    I did        so

               turned              a n d ran    towards           the     corner          of    the       Leppings             Lane         and

He     therefore           turned          and       ran     in m y      direction              and       I was          able       to    knock

then     saw        officers           enter          the    gymnasium             carrying        a body.          They were

another.              I was         then      aware         of a w o m a n ’s b o d y          being       carried           into       the

believe           I felt         a    pulse.         I then        remained               with        the    body w hi ch        seemed

(working             in u n i f o r m )       we    attempted            to    organise               seating       for    relatives

outside           the       gymnasium.              The    next      thing          I clearly               remember       is    being

seated         in the           N o r t h Stand,          together            with        large        numbers       of    o t her

officers.

RICHARD JOHN BROUGHAM, P.C. 1783
WOODSEATS POLICE STATION, SHEFFIELD.


I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police.


At 8 a.m. on Saturday,    15th April, 1989, I coirmenced a tour of duty at

Woodseats Police Station,    together with ten other officers from that Sub-

Division.   Our duty being to assist Road Traffic officers in the control

of traffic problems caused by the F.A. Cup Semi-Final to be played at

Hillsborough football ground that same day between Liverpool Football

Club and Nottingham Forest Football Club.


At 9.30 a.m. I attended a briefing of officers detailed to traffic control

held at Brightside Lane, Sheffield.     I was detailed a duty to monitor and

if necessary control traffic at Penistone Road at its junction with

Herries Road.


At 10 a.m. I conmenced the above mentioned duty in Penistone Road, the

flow of traffic at that time was moderate and the automatic traffic

lights were left to control the junction.     At 12.30 p.m. that same day, I

turned the automatic traffic lights off and together with two members of

the Special Constabulary took manual control of the junction.      Traffic

flow at this junction from this time onwards was moderate to heavy.


At 2.48 p.m. I was relieved for a short time from traffic control duty by

a Special Constable.     At this time I made my way along Penistone Road

near to the turnstiles, as I did so I saw a man who I know to be the

defendant         stood in a queue of people waiting to enter the Spion

Kop via a turnstile entrance in Penistone Road.     A s m a d e     his way

to the front of the queue I saw that he was unsteady on his feet.        As he

presented his ticket for collection at the turnstile I approached him and

the following conversation took place:




                                                                Cont'd
P.C. BROUGHAM:             "How much have you had to drink?"

                           "I've had quite a bit thanks, but I'm alright."


As I spoke to         I noticed that he was unsteady on his feet, his eyes

were glazed, his speech was slurred.       He was in fact drunk.


                           If
P.C. BROUGHAM:                  I am arresting you for trying to get into the

                                football ground whilst drunk.    You do not have to

                                say anything unless you wish to do so but what you

                                say may be given in evidence."

                           "Oh no, I've had a nightmare, I don't believe it."


       was then conveyed to the Police Room within the football ground where

following documentation he was detained.               was a Nottingham Forest

supporter and was in possession of a ticket for the fixture.          I then went to

the gymnasium area and conmenced clerical.


A short time later,   although I do not        know exactly what time,another

officer who I don't   know, ran into the gym shouting to myself and the other

officers doing clerical,   'Get out onto the track all of you'.        I iirmediately

made my way out into the stadium.        As I entered the playing area the players

were near to the tunnel and walking off the pitch.        I looked towards the

Leppings Lane end of the ground and saw that a large number of Liverpool

supporters had climbed over the perimeter fencing of that enclosure.          A line

of officers had formed across the pitch some 10 yards from the goal in order

to hold the Liverpool supporters to that end of the ground.         My impression

was that this was a crowd control, public order situation.          The atmosphere

within the stadium at that time was volatile.


As I looked towards   the Leppings Lane        end of the ground I saw a number of

youths stood on the   perimeter fencing        of the Leppings Lane endsome 15yards

to the right of the goal as I looked at it.         I made my way to the youths and



                                                                    Cont'd
                                                                           £S4%
                                     - 3 -


climbed onto the fencing.    As I looked at the crowd at that point I saw that

although the terrace was packed with people it looked to be nothing more

than that people did not appear to be in danger.     At my request the two

youths on the fencing got down, dropping back into the crowd on the terrace

side.     I got down off the fencing at that point to see a number of youths

#10   had climbed over the fencing staggering around.   I approached one of the

youths and spoke to him.     It was obvious he was injured in some way, I formed

the impression that he was winded, and I therefore sat him down against

billboards near to the goal in order that he could get his breath back.


At that stage I turned round to see that the cordon of officers had held its

position and a large empty space created on the pitch behind the officers.

I then saw the a c c u s e d p u n    past the officers and into the penalty

area in front of the Kop.     I saw that the attention of many in the stadium

was drawn to this youth as he waved his arms at opposing spectators within

the Kop who were obviously becoming excited by his actions.      I then focussed

my attention on            standing just behind the cordon of officers.    As I

did so            turned and ran towards the corner of the Leppings Lane and

the Old Stand.    As he did so I saw P.C. Welch (E2) approach              He

therefore turned and ran in my direction and I was able to knock him to the

floor.     I was assisted in detaining the youth by P.C. Pearson (E2).    The

following conversation took place:

P.C. BROUGHAM:              "I am arresting you for threatening behaviour."


Together with P.C. Pearson, I then escorted the youth off the pitch via the

players tunnel.    As we got near to the tunnel I was hit by an object thrown

from the crowd somewhere near to the tunnel, although I do not know what was

thrown.

I made my way out of the ground via the players tunnel.       We then made our

way to the Police Room.     As we did so the prisoner           appeared to be

nearly hysterical shouting that he was trying to tell the Nottingham

supporters not to jeer as he had seen people badly hurt at the Leppings Lane

end of the ground.    He kept saying something about 'his mate's arm being

broken'.              w as taken to the Police Room where he was documented.


I again made my way to the gymnasium where I again commenced clerical duty,

still believing that the whole incident revolved around public disorder.

After only a couple of minutes someone came running into the gym shouting

'Move these tables, move the tables'.         Together with other officers I

assisted to clear the gymnasium not knowing why.        I then saw officers enter

the gymnasium carrying a body.     They were inmediately followed by others

carrying another body, and then another.        I was then aware of a woman's body

being carried into the gymnasium.     Two young children, aged approximately

9 years of age, appeared to be following the body screaming 'Munmy, Mummy' .

The body of the woman was put onto the floor, obviously dead.        Together with

someone else I approached the two children shepherding them away from the

body.   We were then joined by a female police officer who took the two

children away.


After a few moments I saw a man in the gym who was going wild,       trying to get

near to a body shouting,    'It's my brother, help him'.     Quite obviously all

bodies laid in the gym area were dead.        Together with another officer I

approached the man.     We physically had to restrain the man and pull him out

of the gymnasium.     On getting out of the gym I do not know where the man

went.   As I looked around I saw teams of officers and spectators carrying

bodies and badly injured towards the gymnasium area.        I saw the situation

was so desperate and so many bodies were being brought out that about six

bodies had been laid outside the gymnasium on the floor.




                                                                   Cont’d

A youth who I do not know called me over to the bodies, pointing to one

youth saying,   'Look at him, I don't know if he's dead.     I don't think he is'.

I looked at the body and would describe it as follows:-       White, male, aged

approximately 20 years, ginger hair cut into a modern style above the hair

line at the back.    I looked at the body and saw that he had stopped

breathing.   I was of the opinion that he was dead, however together with

D.C. Walshaw I then performed the kiss of life.    After doing this I again

checked the body and believe I felt a pulse.    I then remained with the body

which seemed to go into some sort of spasm.    After a time, I have no idea

how long, a doctor ran over and looked at the youth saying,         'He's doing

alright, he's hyper-ventilating'.    By this time ambulances had arrived at

the scene and were being loaded with injured people.       Together with others

I carried the youth to the front of the queue of injured and he was taken

away by ambulance.


From this stage on my recollections are vague, I remember there seemed to be

people everywhere and I was aware that by that time a number of doctors and

medical staff had arrived at the scene.


My other main recollection is that together with a C.I.D. Sergeant (working

in uniform) we attempted to organise seating for relatives outside the

gymnasium.   The next thing I clearly remember is being seated in        the North

Stand, together with large numbers of other officers.


At approximately 7 p.m. we returned to Claywheels Lane where we were         stood

down.   We then returned to Woodseats Police Station.


At 10 a.m. on Tuesday, 18th April, 1989, I attended at the Royal Hallamshire

Hospital where I saw a man who I know to be                   . 1    can identify

this man as the person I gave artificial respiration to on 15th April, 1989,

in the area near to the gymnasium.

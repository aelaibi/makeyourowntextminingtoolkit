to put things right for the future.

    The Inquiry was e x p e c t e d to produce an i n t e r i m report                   in
August/September.

        The Inquiry w o u l d be looking to football to put forward
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s and to to be seen to lead i n g the way.

Insurance

    The F.L. were issuing              'holding'     letters     to all enqu iries
received.

    W i n d s o r Insurance had instr u c t e d the same soli c i t o r s that had
acted for th e m after the B r a d f o r d Fire.

        Pat Smith r e p orted that a Mr. King was r e p r e s e n t i n g She f f i e l d
W e d n e s d a y and had stated that he w o u l d be u l t i m a t e l y r e p r e s e n t i n g
the F.L.            It was ag r e e d that Mr. King must be r e f e r r i n g to the
i ns ura nce side of m a t t e r s as the F.L. and F.A. were to be
r e p r e s e n t e d le gal ly by Freshfields.
Seats

    F.L. had put t o g e t h e r a b r e akdown of c apacities be tween seats
and s t a n d i n g areas at First and Second Division grounds.

       Figures wer e also being put together as to the p e r c e n t a g e of
c a pa ci ti es taken up at gr ounds on m a t c h days.

    This was an area to be looked at,   A lobby for a red u c t i o n to
be us ed for ground improvements was being considered.

        It was felt that urgent r e s earch into fence des i g n and
c o n s t ru ct io n sh ou ld be instigated. The quest i o n of the r e m o v a l of
lateral fences was also an issue.

    It was felt that clubs sh ould have d i s a s t e r evacu a t i o n
procedures.      The p o s s i b i l i t y of talks w i t h a u t h o rities with reg a r d
to the b u i ld in g of new grou n d s was considered.

    The recent Act was felt to have an ad verse effect.                        Fans wer e
now a r r i v i n g later and later.

Travel Ar ra n g e m e n t s

    The p o s s i b i l i t y of sett i n g up a travel in f o r m a t i o n se rvice
should be consid ered.

liaising w i t h v i s i t i n g clubs and also when c h o o s i n g neutral
venues. Could ro adw ork s be remo v e d for a match?

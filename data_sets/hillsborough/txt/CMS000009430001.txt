Dea r

Thank you for your letter   of 17 D e ce m b e r 1990 concerning Lord
Justive   Taylor's  inquiry   into     the Hillsborough       Stadium
disaster.

£he Secretary   of State  for the Home D e p a r t m e n t , who was  at
P^iat time  the Rt  Hon  Douglas  Hurd, appointed Lord           Justice
Taylor   on  17 April 1989   to carry  out     an inquiry       with the
following terms of references

" To inquire into   the events  at Sheffield Wednesday Football
Ground on 15 April 1989  and to make recommendations        about the
needs of crowd control and safety at sports e v e n t s . "

Two A s s e s or s were   appointed to assist him.- M r Brian     Johnson,
Chief Constable         of Lancashire and Prof e ss o r Leonard Maunder,
Prof e s s o r   of Mechanical    E n gineering at     the  University  of
Newcastle upon Tyne.

As you m a y be aware L ord Justice Taylor,                    in his Final Report,
made 76          recommendations concerning            safety at sports         grounds.
The           government           has    supported     Lor d    Justice        Taylor's
recommendations                 in principle and      continues     to      urge      both
sport's clubs               and local     authorities to      implement them         where
appropiate.               In     addition   The Football Spectators           Act      1989
pr o vides        for       the    establishment    of   the    Football      Licensing
A u t h o r i t y (FLA)         which has   responsibility for       the issuing           of
licenses to             grounds at      which matches     which are      'designated'
under         the 1989 Act are played.           The FLA will examine the plans
which         clubs       have     made   and  advise    the    government       on       the
progr e s s which is being made towards all seated                     a c c o mo d a t i o n.
In those cases where progress                  is slo w it m a y be    necessary for
the Home          S e c r e t a ry to make a formal direction          to require           a
p a r t i cu l a r ground to provide seated accomodation only.

I hope     this Information is of use to you.

                                                     Yours sincerely

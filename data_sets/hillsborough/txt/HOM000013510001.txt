           Dear Mr A d dison

           HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
           T h a n k y o u for y o u r letter of 9 August. The Police A u t h o r i t y considered the
           m a t t e r again at its m e e t i n g held on Friday, 18 August, and wish me to reiterate
           the view that the costs incurred by the Chief C o n s table of West Midlands Police
           at the service of the Inquiry by Lord J u s tice T a y l o r are p r o perly chargeable to
           the Home Office. This view is emphasised by the remarks of Lord J u stice Taylor
           in paragraph 5 of his interim report.

           However, y o u r clarif i c a t i o n of the w o r k undertaken by West Midlands Police, and
           which is subject to the special payment, has proved helpful - by way of
           c larif i c a t i o n it is assumed this w o r k includes the r e c ently announced criminal
           investigation.

           In these circumstances, the A u t h o r i t y is now p r e pared to agree that as a matter
           of practical expediency, it will reimburse West Midlands Police A u t h o r i t y the
           total costs of the Inquiry by their Chief Constable, subject to confirmation
           from the Home Office that the grant arrangements set out in Lord Ferrers letter
           of 27 June will apply to all such e x penditure including any interest charged by
           that A u t h o r i t y and any interest incurred by South Yorks h i r e Police Authority
           arising from any d e l a y between the rendering of accounts by it and receipt of
           payment from the Home Office.

           C l early the amounts involved will be large, t h e r efore it seems to me to be
           a pprop r i a t e that we agree a m e c h a n i s m for ensuring prompt reimbu r s e m e n t of
           monies to the Authority. When replying perhaps y o u will let me have y o u r views
           on this also.

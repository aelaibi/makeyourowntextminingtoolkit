Dear Mr Hind


You wrote to the Home Secretary on 11 May 1989
enclosing one from Mr         about the
Hillsborough Stadium Disaster. Miss Bannister,
in her letter of 18 May 1989, mentioned that
your letter and your constituent's had been
forwarded to me as the Secretary to the
Inquiry.

I have shown the correspondence to Lord Justice
Taylpr who has noted it.

                                Yours sincerely

I enclose a letter from Mr.             of
Lancs.,  who was   one of   the  spectators at the Liverpool          vs.    Nottingham
Forrest game at Hillsborough which ended so tragically.

I would be grateful if his letter could be forwarded to the police                      or
Lord Justice Taylor as they may wish to pursue their enquiries with Mr j                     |
as a witness to these events.

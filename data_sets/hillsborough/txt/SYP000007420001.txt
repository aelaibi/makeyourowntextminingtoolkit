Our       duties       were      to    receive           the       Nottingham              forest          supporters           coaches          at

the       nearby       Sheffield Wednesday                         football           ground,,

Boon       at ter      k i ck    off     with       my       s er i a l ,     and     serial          52,    along        with

Detective           Inspector            C H A R L E S we          left       Hsrn.es        RD       on    route     to C l a y w h e e l s

Before       we     were        able     to     arrive          at      Cl a y w h e e l s L.N we           were    all     re d i r e c t e d

to L a p p i n g s       LN - both            serials           arrived          there       around          3.10     pm    (1500),,

The       gates     of    the     football              ground were              open       and       there       seemed        to    be

general          confusion.

Mr    CHARLES          received an              instruction                 o ve r    the    r a d io       for    both     serials             to

enter       the     Leppings           LN     end       of    the       ground        to    give       assistance.               T he

message          was     unclear         and       did       not     define          the    assistance             required.,

As    a    res ult,       together            we    entered             the    football           ground          through        a    tunnel

towards          the     ter r a c e d area,             t h er e       were    masses           of L i v e r p o o l      supporters

who       soon    split         our    u n it      up    thereby            losing         contact          wxtn    each        other.

The       whole     area was           in t ot a l           chaos,         people         were       pushing       and     shoving             and

g e n era ll y worse             for     drink,          abuse          was    shouted           at    us    by    the     supporters

as    they       pushed and            shoved,,

It w a s     apparent            t hat      there        was       a major           disaster          taking        place       as       I came

across       injured            persons         pushed          up a g a i n s t       the       boundary          f en c e ,    I could

see       police       officers          and       football             supporters,              squeezing          through           a    gap

in the       mesh        netting,           injured           persons          were        passed          through        this       gap    as

others       were        carried         towards             Leppings          LN.

Our       duties       were      to    receive              the N o t t i n g h a m      Forest         supporters              coaches           at

the       Herries        Road      bus      garage,             c h ec k    the    supporters               and    direct        them       to

the       nearby       Sheffield            Wednesday                football         ground.

Soon       after       k i ck    off       wi                         al,    and      serial          52,    along       with

Detective           Inspector              CHARLES           we      left    Herries          Road      on    r o u te    to

Claywheels             Lane      for       refreshments.

Before       we    were         able       to a r r i v e         At C l a y w h e e l s      Lane      we    were       all     re­

directed          to L e p p i n g s        Lane          - both       serials         arrived          there          around        3 . 1 0 pm

<1510).          The     gates        of    the       football             ground       were      open and             there     seemed           to

be    general          confusion,

Mr    CHARLES          received an               instruction                over      the     radio         for    both       serials        to

enter       the L e p p i n g s        Lane          end     of      the    ground       to      give       assistance.              T he

message          was     unclear           and       di d    not      define       the       assistance            required.

As    a    result,          together            we    entered          the       football         ground          through        a tunnel

towards          the     terraced           a r ea ,        there      were       masses         of    Liverpool          supporters

who       soon    split         our    unit          up     thereby         losing       contact            with       each     other.       The

whole       area       was      in t o t al          chaos,          people       were       pushing         and

shoving          and     generally              worse        for      drink,       abuse         was    shouted          at     us    by    the

supporters             as    they      pushed             and     s ho v e d .

It was       apparent            t h at     there           was      a major       disaster            taking          place     as     I came

across       injured            persons pushed                    up a g a i n s t      the      boundary          f e n c e,    I

could       see    police          officers               and     football         supporters,               squeezing           through           a

gap       in the       mesh      netting,             injured          persons          were      passed          through        t his      gap

as    others       were         carried          towards             Leppings         L a ne .

I wa s      jostled          towards            the       football          pitch and            managed          to    get     on     to   the

playing          area       I had      now       lost        contact         with      my     serial.         It was          then      that

I saw       numerous            persons          lying          on    the    e d ge     of    the      pitch       injured           and

apparently             dead,       police            officers          and       supporters            were       giving        assistance

                    Together         with    supporters             I smas^ci            a boundary          fence         and     carried         one

                    I then      returned          to    the      ground        leaving         the    police       officer           with        the

 clearly        remember           carrying        the    body      of C h r i s t o p h e r        Byry         DEVONSIDE             into

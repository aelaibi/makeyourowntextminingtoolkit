Telephone           no,                        The firm had a d v e r t i s e d         in the Liverpool

E C H O and we bought           four seats       giving        us transport        to and from the

ground.        My ticket       for the football             ground at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y was

for    the Leppirtgs Lane             end of the ground.              We all    caught        the   coach from

W o o d s i d e a pick up point          in B i r k e n h e a d by the B i r k e n h e a d Ferry.           I do

not    know the dir e c t i o n we took,              either      the    roads or the type.           We went

on the m o t o r w a y though because we stopped at a service                                 station to use

the    toilet        facilities       and to stretch our              legs.    The only other          delay we

had was when the Police                 s t o p u s         outside S h e f f i e l d    by a layby to

check        the    bus for alcohol           o e r     coach-

You will           have to    check, w i th the       coach driver         for any details about               the

route.

We    parked        in Clay Wheels         Lane opposite a brewery                 it seemed to        be a

r oadway kept for             coaches to      park.   I think         there was         a Police      presence

but    J. could not          pin point where.          1 did not notice any Police                    or

stewards           directing    us at all       and there         certainly was          no Police         escort

from the           coaches    to the ground.          The    time was about         1.45pm at

this     stage.       We did not have any trouble                   reaching      this area and there

were     no    large       groups   of fans ar o u n d at         this    time.    Ihere were         other

coaches a r r iving at this              time.        All    of us,                                          and

my s e l f    kept together we got             off the        coach stretched our              legs and

f o l l o w e d all       the other    people     getting       off     coaches and walking along

C l a y Wheels Lrt towards P en is t o n e Road.                  I was    not aware          of any Police

offic e r s        in the area,       I was    not d i r ected by anyone.               I think      there were

Policemen           but    I ’m not sure.

We w a l k e d to the ground and saw where we had to get                                in,    there was      no

crowds,        the area was         clear.     It was       the L e p pings Lane         end ABC      entrance.

I d o n ’t know the           names    of the     roads we w a l k e d along to get to                 the

L e p pings        Lane   entrances.         Once we knew how to get              in and where,            we all

walked        to some       shops   nearby and got a pie.                 We ate    our       pies and went

           the    turnstiles,         our    tickets were       taken from us and there were                 no

           crowds

           I saw     lots of        people w i t h   can         beer or    lager     in their       hands

           drinking        in an area        by some   shops     it might     have been M i d d l e w o o d Road

           but    I'm not sure         I think       it was a mixture       of Liverpool and N o t t i n g h a m

           Fo r e s t Fans.         I had not      seen anyone     else drinking           on my travels.          I

           think all         the    pubs were      shut.

           I had not seen a n y fighting                or drunkeness       on my trip to the ground.

           I did not witness any P o l i c e m e n or stewards                  outside      the turnstiles

           giving directions. There were Pji^jbiTce o f f icers outside the turnstiles.

           I remember seeing two Po 3.iV^r of f i ce r s on horses. There was also some

           stewards        outside      the t u rn stiles    possibly about 4 I remember                one of

           them because            it was    the   father   of the    lad I know who c M s — t.n— A n field

           I did not see anyo                 ga i n i n g any u n a u t h o r i s e d entry to the    ground.

           W h e n we went         through     the turnstiles my ticket was                for B entrance.             I

           stewards        inside the        turnstiles.     There was      no other        gates    open other

           than     the    turnstiles.

           I saw the A + B sign               in the    tunnel,    I had always        gone through the

           tunnel        whe n    I had been to the matches           h e rf ore.

             At about 2.15pm             I commented to                   that    ’It's       like a d e r b y 1

             (Everton V Liverpool)               the    packing of the         crowd        it was just about

             c omfortable         then   in my opinion there was               sufficient           people   in the area

             then.     After      this    I found the        pressure     increasing and             I had to      really

             h old on to the fencing               for dear      life,    there was         still a lot of

             people      coming thro u g h the tunnel.

             About     ten to three         the a tm o s p h e r e    in the   pert area was          getting      panicky

             there was a girl             in front      of me screaming at her                boyfriend      "Get me

             the    fence       to get a better a n c horage            the    pain    in their       faces as

             they had to hang             on tighter,        I saw one man        pulled off the fence                by the

             S l i g h t l y to the      right    of me    I saw a male         teenager       being    passed along

             the    crowd at head height               to the    front,       I thought       he had    passed out.         I

             was    used to seeing           this at A nf i e l d whe n        people       faint    the same      thing

             seeing      if the gate wasT shut.

             There were other             people     being    pulled up into the stands                 behind me       I

             think,      it was the West Stand.                 I was aware       of a         lot     of people      still

             inside      the tunnel         trying     to get    into the ground,             there must       have    been

             more    people        coming    in because         the    pressure       did      not     let up even though

             all    those        people were      getting       out of the area.

                to                  and saying,          "my god      I hope     no one scores"           because    the surge

                w h i c h always         follows a goal           would have       pushed down further              on the

                people at the front and                       injured them.

                I was      not aware          of anyone         being    injured      or the barrier         breaking        even

                though        I was a short            distance away from             it all the time.

                The    pressure          seemed to stop or              reduce    from     the back of me.          Id o n ’t

                know for what              reasons,      me and                                  got split    up from the

                away      from the         fence.      I noticed the Police               come    into the    pen a rea then

                from the       backof         me and      I    was told to        leave you could then walk                  out    it

                people        lying on the floor and others milling around.                                Inside    the     ground

                there were            people      dead or injured.            There were         people    shoujting to         push

coach,        I saw some P o l i c e me n drinking           coffee at           the Police        transport

building,            S ou th Y o rk sh ir e   d i v ision - transport            it was     obvious       they did

not    know what           had been going         on.

On my        past     visits     to Hillsborough,          I had noticed a stronger Police

presence         outside       the   ground also that P o l i c e m a n and stewards                     had been

present         at the entrance and exit to the tunnel                           leading      to pens 3 and 4.

W h e n ev er    I had been to H i l l s b o r o u g h      previ o u s l y      if you went without a

ticket        you     could always        get one       because    there were          plenty of tickets

touts and            people    calling        to sell    ti^ckets.

as k i n g      for tickets whe n we stopped off at the motorway.                              In my opinion

there were a lot of                  people     the/e without           tickets     that    is at

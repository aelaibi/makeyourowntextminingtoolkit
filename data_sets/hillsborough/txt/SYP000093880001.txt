               I have previously completed a questionnai re in connection with my

               visit to the Hillsborough Football Ground on 15th April                           1989 (150489)

               to see                       \ Final      between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.

               I c11m be                          4 into pen no 5 and yito^^he pi                    t would be

               at ab                         ■.     On the pitch I rrsei                              the rland.

               uver                tether we decided to try to he(u(S t(ie^J>arf>s we cdyld see

               just lying on the pitch,             I tmink we were about the first to get one

               of the advertising b o a r d s . / Me took the from in front of the North

               Stand where the Liverpool            -f ins jto f re .    hen with others we picked up a

               fan from the pitch.          He waw. -'about haJ         way out between the goal and

               edge of the penalty area to the North Stand side.                       We just ran to the

               other end of the pitch with him on the board we went towards the
                                                                                                     PAGE      2

                   ambulance men we could see.          I would describe this casualty as white

            r^|^ m a l e ,   19 yrs old, 5*9, med bu il d? short dark hair.               He was wearing

                   jeans and ^//yue denim shirt.     1 remember he was not moving his arms
                    "=n> \ /     7
        f           ere j h a n g i n g off the board but I d o n ’t know if he was dead or not,

                   We just put the casualty down by X pe cor/S^/flag and I think the

                   ambulance men treated him there, / w e j f u s l f went back with the

                   advertising board to the other ifm d //            Wsyf took another    couple of fans w;

                   picked up in the same area,         \ o j Jhe otp e r   end of the pitch but I c a n ’t

                   say anymore about them other J/ri-m th/at they were teenage boys.

                   Then at about 3.30 pm (1530) - 45 p i (1545) me and                              together

                   picked up another      casualty.     We did Tfot use a board as ha was small

                   enough for us to carry between us.             We picked him up between the edge

                   of the penalty area and the centre line on the Liverpool                    side of the

                   pitch, almost in the middle of the pitch.                 1 wouljt describe this

^)<LV              casualty as ^      yrs white male,       small of med t u j / f d .    He had brown/

4-'D u \ 2 t 0 ‘ auburn hai r just down to his ears.              He had red and white stripe track­

                   suit bottoms but that *s all        I remember about him.             As we got to the

                   central     line with this boy a man who h/s a small cut by his eye came

                   to us and said he was a d oc to r.         We /put tha^ lad d#C5n/on the ground

                   and the man started to do mouth tsy mouth/re^JBfscitati(pn on him.                 We

                   stood watchi n g , he treatment t h p t h e         doctor just stopped stood up and

                   said,     "It’s no good h e ’s deaHj/!     I ’m not sure about the exact words

                   but it was something      like that.

                   We then went off to see if we could help anyone else,                    I did help some

                   others off the pitch and that but other than the two                    I have mentioned

                   none of them were dead.

                   I eventually left the ground at about 4.45 pm (1645).

                   I am 6 ’2 tall,    slim build,     short light brown hair,            pale complexion on

                   the day I was wearing jeans,         fawn long sleeve shirt with small

 A                 collar, and brown suede trainers.              _                            V"

As I expect you know, I have been appointed by the Home Secretary to conduct a scrutiny o f
possible fresh evidence relating to the Hillsborough Stadium disaster. I understand from
Hillsborough Family Support Group that your family was affected by this terrible event and I would
first like to express to you my deep sympathy for the loss which you suffered.

It might be helpful if I explain that the objective of my scrutiny is to establish whether there is any
significant new evidence which was not previously available to Lord Taylor’s Inquiry, to the
Inquests, or to the prosecuting or police disciplinary authorities. If there is significant evidence, it
will be my aim to see if it would have affected the outcome of any of the proceedings. I hope to
report my findings to the Home Secretary by the end of the year.

I have written to Mr Hicks and Mr Hammond at the Family Support Group, and to the Group’s
solicitor Ms Adlington with some detailed questions which I hope will help me at this early stage of
my scrutiny and you may prefer to leave the matter to them. But I would o f course be happy to
receive information about possible new evidence from you direct if you choose. If you wish to
write to me I would be grateful if you could do so by
1 September.

As my scrutiny of the evidence proceeds I may wish to interview some witnesses directly. I am also
willing to consider interviewing individual witnesses at their request. These interviews will be
private and I am sure that it will be possible to arrange for them to take place at a convenient
location.

The Secretariat to my scrutiny will be happy to discuss possible arrangements with you if you wish.

              I am a m a r r ie d man and                  I live at the above address with my wife.

              I have       been a supporter                       Liverpool       football      club for most          of my    life,



              On S a t u r d a y    15 April             1989    <15041989)       I went     to the semi      final       between

              Liverpool           and N o t ti n gh a m Forest              football      club at Hillsborough .            I

              bought my ticket                 from A n fi el d for £6.              I am a season ticket              holder.

              The     ticket was             for L ep ping s Lane standing area,                   ticket    number       150489,

         cousin of

         A man        c a l is k^              All   I know    is that    he    is a steward at

         Anf i e 1 d ,



T ra v e l l i n g   down to the ground we only had one stop and that was at a

pub w hich was            near      to the junction at the end of the M63 motorway.                            We

stopped        for about 5 minutes               to use the toilets.



we were       delayed at            the end of t>fe M63 for at           least 30 minutes,          thi

was    due     to     road works and >ffe volume               of the/'t raf f i c



Driv in g      in towards           the gr ound we      c^rffle down the A61.        Most    of the way

down this            road just       prior     to tjifi island     I saw people drinking           out    of

bottles and            I think       1 saw           pub open,     it was      clear that    they were

s uppo rt e r s      because        of          they were wear in g and          I saw them with

litre      bottles        of beer



I would, say that we a r ri ve d                 in S he f fi e ld between       1400 and    1405 and we

parked       in a side         road w hi ch      is near      to Grove Av and walked down to the

ground.         We walked along Mar 1c 1 i f f e Rd,               down Wads ley Ln,        over   the

j un ction       into Leppings Ln.               When we got       to the junction of M id dl e wo o d

Rd and L e p pings Ln we saw a number                      of Police        officers who were more             or

less     spaced out along                the   route.



As we got to the ground there were                         qui£e a few more officers.

Generally            I would describe           it as a    ha'avy police        presence.     But I

received         no directions            or escort     onr the way down to the ground.



I saw a man carrying a pint of jpeer making his way to the ground and 1

                 Not    long after      I saw the        same man   ixpfh 1 ved    in a fight.       I was still

                 walking    down to the gnound at I m s                time.



                 The man was white,          I would say he was           between 20 and 23 and he was

                 de fi ni t el y drunk.      He    had very dark hair and            I think he may have            had -

                 leather    bomber     jacket      on.



                 I arri ve d at the        entrance      to the ground between          1415 and      1420.        At

                 this    time    I was still       with my three mates and            it was   our   intention to

                 stay together.

i-| L _          We w al k ed through the          iron gates and made our way towards                the

                 t urnstiles      on the far       right side of the entrance.             There were         no

                 queues at the turnstiles.                Just a mass      of     people all   heading      towards

                 the turnstiles.           I saw one Police         officer       on horseback who was         trying

                 to keep the       crowd over       towards     the turnstiles.         As you   look at       the
  AT
                 turnstiles       leading    up to them from the           iron gates,     there     is a metal
 M       u .
                 bar w hich      is on the    right      side of the      turnstiles.      The officer         on

                 horseback was keeping             the   crowd between the turnstile a rea and the

                 bar,    preventing     them spreading          over    past the bar.      He seemed to be

                 causing    the    crowd to be packed tight and he was using the horse to

                 keep    people    over.     People      were   trying    to a vo id the horse        causing       them

                 to    crush against       other    people.



                 I w ou ld say that there w ould be between 200 :< 300                    people      in that area

                 I also    saw Police       officers       on foot.      I would     say about 20 or so,                 ^
Pouo£;
     a t         moving aro un d and more           by the gates.         I did not see any stewards                in

             I had been to the H i l l s b o ro u gh ground^-fast year so                     I knew where         to go

             but    I remember         last year        I            ve d if fi cu lt y finding my entry           point

             because        there were       no signs



             The    crowd of        people were         trying      to force      their way forward to get

             through the turnstiles and together with my 3 friends                                  I joined this

             crowd.         There was a crush,              people were        screaming    to the    people at the

             back     to stop pushing           forward.         I saw a small          boy about    10 ;< 11 years

             old being           passed from near           the far        right turnstile    over the metal            bar.

             He    looked pretty frightened.                   He wa^, passed over          the bar,      I d i d n ’t see
                                                                       /
             who    to but       there were          supporters yon the other            side of the      bar    by now

             and    I also       saw the Police          offLcer       on horseback at this          point.       I heard

             at    least     four     police fffessag/s come over the                  tannoy asking      supporters

    'T/W n tff outside      the Leppim a s      l.n     ntrance to move           back as there were        problems

             at the front           of tne qusme.           From the messages            people knew there were

             problems at the l u r n y t i 1e s .              It stated that          it was a police message.



             People        did not move        back.        I did not enter         through a turnstile.            I

             m a n a g e d to move      over    to the       right     of the     bar and I stood by the           side

             of the        riverbank.        by this time           I had     lost my three     friends.



             I was     standing        on a wall,        the    r iverbank side         of the fence.       I met up

             w i t h a f r i e nd :                              who       I d i d n ’t kno$/i£as going    to the

                                                                                    right of the turnstile*
CAT          when     I noticed the          cor certina gates

             open.         The   gates were          opened from              inside    of the ground.          There wa;

             no-one        standing      by th«' gates wm>           could have        opened them.       I saw the

             gates     open.        P o li ce me n           red.      At first     the gates w e r e n ’t opened

             fully.         I w ould say a b W t . 8         foot wide.          I would say there was

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 5 or 6 officers       appear at the gate opening                  then other

supporters who were milling around away                         from the actual            crowd by the

turnstiles,        must    have    noticed      it as w e l j / f e c a u s e    they started        runriing

towards     the gates.        B ot h             and    L^oined         them and        ran towards         the

gate.      I took my ticket            out of mjjF pocket         to give        up and    I was     told by

a Police     officer       thajf it didn^Ft matter about                 the ticket,        but     not     to

run.      i heard other/offi cars              telling     other     people       not to     run.



I had earlier        seen at       least 30 people           climbing       over       the metal    wall

w hich    is to the       left of the turnstiles.                 I saw them climb over and

drop down the other           side.



As    I said earlier        I did not hand rny ticket                in.        Once    inside    the     ground

there was     plenty of       room to move and because                   I had been there           before           I

went     left through anot he r          gate and headed           towards        the N orth West

terrace.      On my way       round      I did not       notice any         police       control    or

steward     control       at the    tunnel.        I did not see any disorder                    or other

incidents     on my way       round to my viewing               point.          I did not see anyone

d rinking    inside       the grounds.



I made my way to the N ort h Wej^C terrace w hich                          is elevated and

and    I stood at the very b--;                  We had an excellent               view of the West

tnd    terraces.



I got     to rny viewing      position at about              1430 — 1453.              I w ou ld say      I ’d

been standing        there    for      some time,      and Well         after     the game had been

stopped.      1 would say about               half a n Jnaur      I saw a barrier           being

handed down the terra&e                (pen              over     the    railings.         I didn't        see

this     barrier    break.

Where    I was    I had    plenty of       room and I was       still with                  I think

Fro m where I was standing            1 could see that there was an excessive

number    of    people    in pens 3 and 4,       both sides       behind the goal.



I saw at       least 6 people       being    lifted up a n d     passed towards       the    front

of the    pens    before    kick off.        They wj/re coming      from ma i nl y    towards       the

front    of the    pens.       Both adults     arfd children were         being    passed

down.     They were       he/lped j|ver yf\& fence and onto          the    pitch side.        There

were Police       officers      helfe^ ro them over,      again this was          before kick

off.    I saw a steady stream of             people    coming    out of the tunnel,          there

must    have    been hundreds.        They just had nowhere to go except                forward.

The    pens were a l re ad y full.



It was a constant          surge    forward,     I w a s n ’t able to see         if anyone

collapsed or died          in the    pens    because    of the amount       of people       in it.



I did see       people    climbing    over the     railings,      being    passed over,       peopb

being    dragged onto       the    pitch because       they'd    collapsed.



I saw at       least   10 people     be/ang given heart         to heart or m o ut h to m outh

resus c i t a t i o n on the    pitch.



I think    that    the fact       that the    sheer amount       of people    coming out of

the    tunnel    and having       no where    to go was a factor          in the deaths and

injuries       caused,



I left the football            ground at about        1640 - 1650.        I left of rny own

accord.        Whe n the match was stopped            it took a while       before there was
                                                                                                            PAGE
                                                                                                            S239&

         v   any announcement.              Then there was a Police            tannoy saying       there

   'f        was an        incident    in the Leppings Ln end of the ground.                  I c a n ’t

             remember what else it said.        Then there was another tannoy from Kenny
                   t^<o 1 3 0                                  -----------------------------
             D a l g le i s h saying to stay calm and co-operate wit h the police and

             esTie r g e n cy s ervice s .



             The   police message also a sked the                 crowd to     clear the    pitch.     I saw a

             scuffle       near the     corner       post under me between a police           officer and a

             supporter.         The supporter           was trying    to get    into    the gate    of pen 6.

             The man was        not arrested.            He was white and ar ou nd 25 years           old.



             It seems       to me that        there was a lack of d irections             given on the       loud

             speaker.        At one     point a lot of officers            came      onto the ground       in two's

             and stopped        near    the       north s t a n d # 7 They formed a     line on or near       the

             centre    line of the           pitch.      Tha#e were    other    officers at the L ep pings

o r r        Ln end but only half                 of thej|e were a c t u al l y trying    to he 1 p people        the

             other    half     looked as          if tpey were just     standing around talking amongst

C-©M*'t£K/”j~t hernse 1ves



             I feel    that t      s    h     0   u 1 d be a cordon outside       the ground area for         the

             police    to see tickets,              this would slow the        crowd down.     There should

             be orderly queues outside                  the turnstiles     instead of just a mass            of

             people.



             It should have           been a nn o un c ed over     the tannoy that        the game w ould be

             delayed until        everyone was           seated safely.        The    tannoys were working

             and    if they were aware              of the   crowd they should^Tf a n n ou n ce d a delay,

             Also      when the       pens were      full   thek a/ sh ou ld have    been someone    blocking

             turnstiles and act accordi ngly.                    I agree   that     if the gate had not        been

             opened      people would        have     been killed outside         the turnstiles.

HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER I NQ UI R Y :         FOOTBALL I N PORTUGAL

1.       PORTUGUESE PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALL I S ORGANISED ON A LEAGUE BASIS
WITH A F I RS T D I V I S I O N OF 18 TEAMS AND THREE REGIONAL SECOND
D I V I S I O N S (NORTH CENTRAL AND SOUTH) ALSO OF 18 TEAMS (THERE
I S CURRENTLY A PROPOSAL TO CREATE A SINGLE SECOND D I V I S I O N WITH THE
S I X BEST TEAMS FROM EACH REGIONAL D I V I S I O N BUT THI S I S YET TO BE
VOTED O N ) .       AT THE END OF EACH SEASON THE THREE BOTTOM TEAMS FROM
THE FI RST D I V I S I O N ARE RELEGATED ANDTHE TOP TEAM IN EACH OF THE
SECOND D I V I S I O N S I S PROMOTED TO REPLACE THEM.      THERE I S ALSO A
DOMESTIC KNOCK-OUT CUP COMPETITION WITH THE FI NAL PLAYED IN MAY IN
THE NATIONAL STADIUM.             THE SPORT'S GOVERNING BODY I S THE PORTUGUESE
FOOTBALL FEDERATION.            I T S PRESIDENT I S ELECTED ANNUALLY BY THE CLUBS
FROM THE F I RS T AND SECOND D I V I S I O N S .

2.      UNLIKE B R I T I S H CLUBS, PORTUGUESE     FOOTBALL CLUBS DO NOT OPERATE
AS PROFIT MAKING ORGANISATIONS, BUT MORE AS MUTUAL S O CI ET I ES ( THE I R
O F F I C I A L STATUS I S TERMED QUOTE PESSOAS COLLECTIVAS DE UT I LI DADE
PUBLICA UNQUOTE).            THEY ARE NOT OWNED BY A SINGLE CHAIRMAN OR BY
SHAREHOLDERS AS THEY WOULD BE IN THE UK, BUT BY THE QUOTE SOCIOS
UNQUOTE.         A QUOTE SOCIO UNQUOTE I S NOT A CONCEPT THAT EXISTS IN
ENGLISH FOOTBALL: HE OR SHE I S A SEASON TI CKET HOLDER, SHAREHOLDER
AND MEMBER OF THE SUPPORTERS CLUB.               FOR A SMALL MONTHLY SUM (BENFICA
CHARGES 5DD ESCUDOS - ABOUT POUNDS 2 PER MONTH) A SOCIO I S ENTITLED
TO SEE A NUMBER OF GAMES PER SEASON FREE (ON AVERAGE BETWEEN 1 0 - 1 2 )
AND CAN VOTE I N THE ELECTIONS FOR THE CLUB PRESIDENT (BENFI CA ELECT
THEI R PRESIDENT EVERY FOUR YEARS) .            THE NUMBER OF VOTES A QUOTE
SOCIO UNQUOTE CAN CAST DEPENDS ON THE LENGTH OF TIME HE HAS BEEN A
MEMBER OF THE CLUB.                                                          , ,
                               SPORTING LI SB ON , WITH APPROXIMATELY 1 00 000
HAVE THE LARGEST NUMBER OF QUOTE SOCIOS UNQUOTE OF ANY CLUB IN
PORTUGAL.

3.  PORTUGUESE CLUBS HAVE A NUMBER OF SOURCES OF REVENUE: THE
SUBSCRIPTIONS FROM SOCIOS SEMI-COLON TI CKET SALES SEMI-COLON
TOTOBOLLO (A SORT OF LOTTERY) SEMI-COLON SPONSORSHIP SEMI-COLON HELP
FROM LOCAL AUTHORI TI ES SEMI-COLON TRANSFER FEES. I T I S HARD TO GIVE

A GENERAL PICTURE OF THE IMPORTANCE THAT EACH OF THESE SOURCES OF
INCOME HAS FOR EACH CLUB AS THE PROFILE OF A TOP LISBON TEAM WILL BE
VERY DI FFERENT FROM THOSE OF A MINOR SECOND D I V I S I O N TEAM I N THE
NORTH OF PORTUGAL.    ALL FI RS T D I V I S I O N TEAMS HAVE SOME SORT OF
SPONSORSHIP DEAL WITH A COMPANY WHICH NORMALLY INVOLVES ADVERTISING
ON SHIRTS (EG SPORTING HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH NISSON) .             FOR A TOP
CLUB T H IS CAN BE VERY LUCRATI VE.       BENFICA HAVE TEAMS INVOLVED NOT
ONLY I N FOOTBALL BUT IN 23 DIFFERENT SPORTS.             THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
NEGOTIATE DEALS WITH DIFFERENT COMPANIES FOR EACH I N D I V I D U A L TEAM.
THE MONEY RECEIVED FROM TOTOBOLLO I S D I V I D E D BETWEEN ALL TEAMS BUT
THE RATIO I S WEIGHTED I N A WAY WHICH ENSURES THAT SECOND D I V I S I O N
TEAMS RECEIVE PROPORTIONALLY MORE.             ATTENDANCES AT MOST GAMES ARE
RELATIVELY GOOD AND THE TOP LEAGUE MATCH OF THE SEASON - BENFICA V
FC PORTO - CAN ATTRACT 1 2 0 , 0 0 0 PEOPLE.       TI CKET PRICES FOR NON SOCIOS
ARE COMPARITIVELY H I G H , BEING ON THE WHOLE JUST ABOVE ENGLISH LEVELS
IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE COST OF L I V I N G I S NOTICEABLY-LOWER.

4.      THE RELATIONSHI P BETWEEN THE CLUBS AND LOCAL AND CENTRAL
GOVERNMENT I S A COMPLICATED ONE.           THE CLUBS RECEIVE VIRTUALLY NO
MONEY FROM CENTRAL GOVERNMENT (BENFICA HAVE JUST RECEIVED THEIR
F I R S T GRANT TO BUILD A SET OF SQUASH COURTS BUT T H I S MONEY TOOK TWO
YEARS TO N E G O T I A T E ) . THEY DO HOWEVER RECEIVE SUBSTANTIAL HELP FROM
LOCAL GOVERNMENT. T H I S CAN EITHER TAKE THE FORM OF THE LEASE OF THE
TOWNS F A C I L I T I E S (EG SQUASH COURTS) WHICH CAN THEN BE TURNED INTO
MONEY, OR DIRECT GRANTS THEMSELVES. BENFICA WERE QUITE KEEN TO
EMPHASISE THAT THEY DID NOT RECEIVE MONEY - ONLY F A C I L I T I E S - FROM
THE LISBON TOWN HALL. IN SMALLER TOWNS THE SI TUATI ON I S DI FFERENT.
ALTHOUGH COUNCILS RARELY SUPPORT FOOTBALL CLUBS AS SUCH, THEY OFTEN
PAY THE CLUB A SUM OF MONEY FOR THE USE OF I T S NON-FOOTBALLING
F A C I L I T I E S BY THE PUBLIC (MANY FOOTBALL CLUBS DOUBLE AS ATHLETICS
CLUBS AND HAVE ATHLETICS TRACKS). THE SI TUATI ON I S COMPLICATED BY
THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOCAL FOOTBALL CLUB I S QUITE
OFTEN ALSO A MEMBER OF THE TOWN COUNCIL ( I F NOT INDEED MAYOR). CLUBS
DO NOT RECEIVE MONEY SPECI FI CALLY FOR SAFETY I N GROUNDS.

5 . CLUBS ALSO RECEIVE MONEY FROM TRANSFER FEES. PLAYERS CONTRACTS IN
PORTUGAL ARE SHORT - USUALLY THREE YEARS. I F A PLAYER I S SOLD TO
ANOTHER PORTUGUESE TEAM BEFORE HIS CONTRACT HAS ENDED HI S ORIGINAL
CLUB ARE ENTI TLED TO A FEE. AT THE END OF HIS CONTRACT A PLAYER I S A
FREE AGENT AND CAN MOVE TO ANY PORTUGUESE CLUB WITHOUT A FEE BEING
INVOLVED ( I F HE GOES OVERSEAS HOWEVER HIS CLUB ARE S T I L L ENTITLED TO
COMPENSATION). FEES BETWEEN PORTUGUESE CLUBS ARE BY B R I T I S H
STANDARDS RELATIVELY LOW WITH A GOOD FI RST D I V I S I O N PLAYER GOING FOR
BETWEEN POUNDS 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 AND POUNDS 4 5 0 , 0 0 0 . WAGES ARE BY CONTRAST

HIGH.   AN AVERAGE F I R S T D I V I S I O N PLAYER WOULD EARN POUNDS 6 0 , 0 0 0   PER
YEAR,   A SMALL FORTUNE BY PORTUGUESE STANDARDS.

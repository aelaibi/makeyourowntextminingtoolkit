  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re

     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or

         Dear S i r s ,
                                              !

         Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


          If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
          on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
          due course.

          I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
          inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

          Subject to the Coro n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
          under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
          witnesses who wish to give evidence.       I am at present engaged in considering
          this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

          Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
          to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
          appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
          consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
          attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
          names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
          to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

          I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          heard from you by the end of Septegtfier I will assume you have no names to
          s u bmit.

          Yours faithfully,

Dear Dr Popper,

RE:   Carl William Rjmmpr*

I have recently seen Mr Rimmer and been through Carl's Summary.

He has no questions to raise.

Mr and Mrs Rimmer wish to be in Court when Carl's Summary is presented,
they have arranged a short holiday covering the period 14th to 21st April
inclusive, could their Inquest be scheduled for Hearing not before Monday
23rd April?

I trust this information is of assistance.                                                                     y              °

          Jsira,

Rei     CiBL M H S S R                                 Ifo.IS.

As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
on the 15th of January 1990*

I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not' to resume the
Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action (if any)
he may wish to undertake.

I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
matter will take. I anticipate however that there will be
a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
on this matter further.

I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest(s).

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

RE:   HILLSBOROUGH


Many thanks for your letter of the 27th July enclosing copies of the Post-Mortem
R e p or t s.

I will certainly make clear to my clients the conditions under which these
Reports have been released.

A cheque for £26.95 to cover your copying charges is attached, might I trouble
you for a receipt for accounting purposes.

Since I gave you my list of deceased a further one has been added, he is
John McBrien The Old Vicarage, Well Street, Holywell, Clwyd, might I please
have a copy of his Report to complete the set.

Yours faithfully

          Dear Sirs,

          You will be aware that I do not normally release post mortem
          reports until the resumption of the Inquest, when they are
          in fact put in as evidence.

          However, in view of the numerous requests which I have received,
          end the obvious distress which delay is causing to your clients,
          I have decided that subject to certain conditions set out below,
          I am. prepared to release to you upon request, the post mortem
          report of your client(s).

           The release of these post mortem reports are on the basis that:-

                      a.     They have to be treated as provisional, and therefore
                             subject to amendment or alteration until such time as
                             they are given or produced in evidence at the Inquest.

                      b.     They are to be used only for the purpose of bereavement
                             consalling of the deceasedfs relatives or for proper
                             legitimate purposes in connection with any legal, proceedings
                             in which solicitors may be engaged.

                      c.     Subject to the/:ab§v§7 they are to be kept confidential until
                             they come into the public domain at the resumed Inquests.

          I have your request for the post mortem report to hand in respect
          of each of the persons listed on the attached sheet, and on the
          assumption that you will confirm that the report in respect of
          each of your respective clients is accepted on the terms set out
          above, and in order to save further delay and upset to your client,
          I enclose a copy of the relevant post mortem report. If for any
          reason you cannot agree to the contents of this letter, please return
          the post mortem report to me, without of course making any use of it.

          The cost for the copy post mortem report(s) is        per sheet (total
          Please make your cheques payable to the City of Sheffield.

 Dear Mr Popper


 I write following my very helpful conversation this afternoon with Mr Thompson
 from your office to confirm a number of points.                       mompson

Firstly, I understand that you are favourably inclined towards the requests
that you have recieved from a number of Solicitors to release copies of
the Post Mortem Reports on the victims of the Hillsborough Disaster in advance
of resumed Inquest Hearings and in this regard might I ask you to let me
have copies of the Reports on the deceased named in the attached list the
families of whom I respresent.


      iD M S3 r°ng feelinS from many of the families that early receipt of copies
of the P.M. Reports would be beneficial both in terms of answering some
hiterto unanswered questions and also in' perhaps reducing the anguish which
public h e a r i n ^ n if ^ ^ detailS °f the cause of dea*h become known at a
P      hearing perhaps some weeks or months hence.


Tf            re^Uired f°r c°Pies of any of the Reports then needless to say
I will be happy to deal with this.                                         y

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

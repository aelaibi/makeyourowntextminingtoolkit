I would          s a y al l       the       roadworks                were       corden           off    but       there          didn't          seem       to

be a n y o n e        working          on    them.              Eventually              we       got    to    the H a l i x f a x            Rd

where       they       parked          the       coaches.              W h e n we           parked          the    coach           I saw         that

there       were       not       many       coaches             th e r e .

We    all      got     off       the    coach           and walk ed               to    the L e p p i n g          Lane          end    of       the

ground.             Going        down       to       the    ground           we      did     not       receive         aj*y d i r e c t i o n s

at    all,       we    just       followed              the      flow        of      people

We    arrived          outside          the          g r o u n d at        twenty           five             three          (1435)

O u t s i de     the       g round      I saw a few P olice                            Offerers             and    a fe w          fans.          There

wasn't         many        people       around.                 I saw        people          climbing             onto       the       wall

between          turnstiles             *C * a n d          ’B ' .         Tbcse        people          were       then          sitting          on

the    wall         above        turnstile              *B * » j f         sa w      that        there       were      a     lot m o r e

people         around           turnstile              *B y^Than           ours.            We    walked          straight             up    to       the

* C * t u r n s t iles           and        went       straight              in.       My        ticket       wa s     taken           from       me.

Just     before            we    went       igfo        the      turnstile              a Policeman                said,           "Take         it

e asy,      they'll             hold    the          game       if    necessary."

When     I got         into       the       g r o u n d we           went       to     the       ’Z * g a n g w a y         to    get       my

seat.          To     do    t h is     we    walked             behi nd         the     *B * t u r n s t i l e s            and     I noticed
                                                                                                                       "x
several          Policemen             by    these          turnstiles.                     In    this       area      it was           busy          but

not    p a cked.

At m y      entrance             to    the       stand,          3    stewards              closed          the    gate across.                       A

Policeman             told      me     it w a s         full         and     I couldn't                go    in.       I showed              him my

 about        half       full.             In    pens       3 and          4 you            could       only          see     a mass            of

 I cannot           remember               seeing          any    stewards                  at    the       front          perimeter                fencing

       R e t ur ne d    to traffic          island,      H i l l s b o r o u g h Park.

       During         the morn i n g and early a f t e r n o o n as              the flow of spect a t o r s

       became         very heavy,         1 noticed m a n y were             carry i n g    cans of       lager

       and beer a n d d r i nking                f r om same.

       PC V A L L A N C E and        I refused to           let   them pass our            point without

       d i scarding          the    cans as       they were       only seventy yards                  from the

       ground.

       Because         of    the great       numbers        involved       it was    the only

       practical            s o l u ti on a l t h o u g h not very satisfactory.

       V is it ed several            times       by Inspector        B U R D I S and PS |

       Neither PC V AL L A N C E nor               I had a radio           to moni t o r     other

       i nci d e n t s .

       R e ma in ed     in p o s ition until            1500 hours,          whe n the traffic            island

       and nearby            park walls were            littered w ith hundreds                  of    cans    of

       beer and         lager.

       Some     s p ectators         were    still a r r i v i n g    from both teams,                man y

       were worse            for drink.

1505   Wit h   Inspector           B U R D I S orde r e d   to a t t e n d   inside        the   ground.

       P a s s e d scores          of Notts       Forest    s upporters        outside S p i o n Ho p

       some     not ma k i n g       any atte m p t      to get      in,     pres u m a b l y without

       tickets.

       E n t e re d    the    ground and          i n i tially we were         held at the             side of

       the N orth Stand.

       There was a            lot of a c t i v i t y of Police O f f i c e r s             but at       this

       time the         p o s ition was          not   clear,     in fact      it was       very

       confused.

1510   W ith a large           number       of    c olleagues      ente r e d the        playing area

       where     I could see what                 I thought was a ground                 invasion        from

       the L e p p i ng s Ln end.                 Some O f f i c e r s were      directed         to that
                                                                                                      PAGE

end.       Wit h others         I was o r d e r e d by a Senior Offi c e r                     to

stand      in front         of the S p i o n Kop and face                 the Notts Forest

supporters.

As we did this              stretcher       ca s es began a r r iving             from the

L e p pings Ln end,           to    reach the a m b u l a n c e s at the              rear of

the N or th Stand,            but    because       of the sheer             numbers      the

a l le yw ay door          became    bloc k e d and       people were            put on the

ground       in front of the k o p .

C iv i l i a n s    were    tearing      up a d v e r t i s i n g    boards      to make        even

more     stretchers.

In the meantime,              the N o t t i n g h a m Forest           suppo r t e r s   became

restless and a volatile a t m o s p h e r e                   built       up.     There was

no i nf or m a t i o n forthc o m i n g and             I believe N o t t i n g h a m Forest

s u pporters         b e l i ev e d as   I had that         it was a ground

invasion           caused by the Li v e r p o o l         supporters.

I nitally N o t t i n g h a m Forest             were    cheering and            clapping           the

s t r etcher        cases.

I was o rd e r e d on two            separate        o c casions        by a uniform

Superintendent              to keep facing           the K o p and w a t c h the

N o t t i n g h a m Forest      fans.       As    bodies a m a s s e d       by us this

became more and more                 difficult.

At one stage,              about    twenty L i v erpool             f a n s a n n o y e d at

N o t t i n g h a m Forest      f a n s ’ attitude        made a charge             towards          the

Kop.

Several       O f f i ce rs   including my s e l f m a n a g e d            to cont a i n them

a nd direct          them back       towards       L e p p i n g s Ln.

At this       stage,        I was    orde r e d by a u n i f o r m          Inspector          to

fprm     part       of a cordon across             one half w a y         line    to prevent

a further           charge    from Liverpool             fans.

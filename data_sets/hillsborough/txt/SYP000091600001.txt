        behind        the       goal,      and      we      only       thought         the    tunnel        was    the     only way

        onto        the    terrace.             X had        intended           to m o v e       tq/my      left     once       on the

                The     situation           wa s    a    constant           surge.           The       pressure          just       did     not    ease       up

                at all.           People       all       a r o u n d me         were       in g r e a t       distress.             I had        lost    all

                interest           in the      game.            I do       not       remember          the       game    stopping.




                I remember           the     gate        on the           perimeter          fence          at    p en 3 w as         open.        I

                don't       know who         had        opened        it,        I thought             to m y s e l f        that     if    I could       get

                a    l i tt l e   further          forward           I would          be at        the      perimeter          fen ce ,      and       once

                there       I could         t ry    to m o v e        towards          my     right         side       and    the     open       gate.        I

                believed          t ha t    this        w as    my    best       way       out     of / h e       terrace          crush.

                Other       people         were     trying           to    qer, to         the     front         and were          c l a m b e r i n g over

                the     heads       of     others        to     reachr the            fr o n t .       I remember             someone        standing

                At    last        I reached         close        to       the    perimeter             fence.           It wa s       now    q u it e    easy

                for me       to m o v e      across            to m y /'ight,              in the        direction            of    the     open

                At    the     gate       I saw      two        young       lads       trapped          by     the      legs at        the    gate.        A

shouting           at    the     crowd     to     keep       back,                 as w e l l        as at      the     policeman,              for

him    to    get me           out.      The P o l i c e m a n                pulled            these      two    lads        out     of      the

terrace.            They were           both      conscious                     and         crying.         I only        remember            one

had    on a t s h i r t              and a Liverpool                    sc a r f .             The    two    were       in t h e i r         early

20" s.




Once     t h es e       two    lads     were      removed                I then              saw     other      p e op l e     underneath

where       the     lads w e re .          I c a n ’t s a y                 h o w m a ny.             I c a n ’t d e s c r i b e          these

p e ople.




T he P o l i c e m a n        w as    shouting         at me            to          keep       holding       people          back,        but m y

arms     were       giving           way and      I w as         shouting                    b a c k at     him,      that      I c o u l d n ’t

hold     on.




The    next        thing       was     that     I fell           fo r w ar d wi t h my                    head,       arms      and       u p pe r

my    legs.




The    Policeman              outside      the      g at e       took                      1 d of m y a r m s      to     try      to     pull       me

  On     the    pitch       I saw       bodies       on the          pitch.       People       were       carrying            people

  on     stretchers,                      and    I p u l l e d at a h o a r d i n g            in f r o n t        of    the N o r t h

  daze,        due    to    the    events       of    the       afternoon.




           and       I were       wandering          around          the    pitch,       I ca n ' t       remember            any    of

  the     victims,          most    were       covered          up    by no w w i t h        coats       o ve r    their       faces.




           asked a Policewoman                   n ea r     the       half    way     line w h a t        was      going       on,       she

  could        not a n s w e r     but    just       burst       into       tears.

 People         were       saying       the    game       was    off,       others      were    insisting               the    match

 would         re-start.           I had       lost       interest          in the m a t c h        by    now a n y w a y .          I

  wa s    by no w      in a bit          of a daze.




           and       I left       the    ground about                4.10    pm   (161Q)       out       the      side    of    the

 MISS RICKARD                                18 April 1989




 FA/HILLSBOROUGH




 Telephoning Julian Gibson-Watt and discussing with him the
 question of Leaders.    I asked him if he had any problem
working with                     Julian said that he did not.
 In fact he thought that          would be a very good choice
for the job that had to be done.     He suggested that we
should get the FA to dig out from their files anything
relating to the Bolston disaster in 1946 as well as
information going back over the last 10 years ot so
concerning the playing of semi-finals at neutral ground.        He
mentioned the question of publicity in the newspapers and
that we should start getting a file in order.      He agreed to
think further about any silks that might be suitable in the
event that          was not able to do it.


Telephoning                     clerk to enquire as to his
availability.     I was told that he was not terribly well
placed over the next few months.     He is in the Cayman
Islands at the present, he will then be back and has a 4 week
case starting beginning of June and has another trip to the
Cayman Islands planned.          Iwas reluctant to take on the
case in view of            lack of availability.     I explained
to him that in fact           would not have to necessarily do
that much as we had Julian involved so it should make
          role much easier.    It was left that I would speak
to        again tomorrow once I had spoken to the clients
about i t .
Attending Julian on his telephoning when he suggested some
further names of silks that could be used namely
______________ who was a landlord and tenant silk,
            who did planning work,
and                    Julian thought that perhaps
        was too junior a silk as he had only taken silk last
year.     I suggested to him                    and he felt that
perhaps he was not the right person to get on with the
Judge.     It was left that I would make some enquiries at
Freshfields and speak to Counsel's clerk.


Telephoning                    clerk to find out about his
availability.    He has a three week case starting next week
but apart from that is very well placed.        His clerk said
that this had mainly happened because of the Rolls Royce
case which had resulted in him turning away a lot of other
work.    It was left that I would come back to his clerk
either later today or tomorrow.


Telephoning                        clerk and being told that the
Head Clerk was away.    I explained that I wanted to know
                    movements over the next three months.            I
was told that one of the clerks would phone me back.


Attending \                      clerk on his telephoning.   He
said that                      had some case where he was sitting
in May for two weeks and had another case starting on 5 June
for a few weeks.    Apart from that he was fairly clear.         I
did not give any names and said that I would come back to
the clerk on the matter.
 I was then put on to              and it was agreed that we
 would meet at the FA tomorrow morning at 10.00am.        She then
passed me on                He told me that he had received a
 letter from Herbert Smith who had been appointed by the
public liability insurers which were Commercial Union and
Royal.      Herbert Smith said they are only acting for
Commercial Union at the present time.        The chap dealing with
it there was                  and the partner was
Jardines were the brokers.     When             had spoken to the
brokers there was a suggestion that the public liability
cover may not cover the matches that the FA merely
organised.     Apparently until the beginning of this year the
cover was £2.5m.     This year there was a £2.5m excess with
Royal.    I asked       if he had a copy of the insurance
policy and he said he was not sure that he did.        It was
agreed that he would hand me whatever he had at the meeting
tomorrow.     He would also get on to Jardines about the
policy.     I said that I would speak to Herbert Smith as that
had been agreed between the FA and Herbert Smith.


Telephoning              at Herbert Smith.    I explained that I
did not have many papers myself.      I was going to a meeting
tomorrow and I would make sure Herbert Smith had whatever we
obtained.             ;onfirmed that the Commercial Union were
really concerned about claims against the FA and they would
carry out a close monitoring role particularly of the
enquiry.     From what he said it was not planned at the
present time that Herbert Smith would do more that have a
watching brief.     I stressed that if they did not get
anything for the time being it    was not for want of
willingness but merely that we    did not have the material
ourselves.    He said that Herbert Smith had only been
instructed that morning and he    did not know the terms   of the
insurance policy.

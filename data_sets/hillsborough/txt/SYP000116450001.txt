 SOUTH Y O R K S H I R E POLICE,        E C C L E S F I E L D POLIC E STATION



 In Apr il    1988,    as Det ec ti ve       Su per in ten de nt at     'F' Division,    I att end ed a

 fo otball m a t c h b ein g playe d at the home ground of Sh eff ie ld W e d n e s d a y Fo otball

 Club,   Hillsborough.          The game was a Cup S e mi -F ina l and was pl ayed between

 L i v e r poo l FC and N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC.        There w as a c a p ac ity crowd and

 a d m i s sio n was by ticket only.




M y remit on that day w as to organise and supervise all elements of crime

pr ev e n t i o n and crime detection.




At about 2.40 p m that day I found m ys elf outside the ground in the L eppings

Lane tu rnstile area.            The c ro wd using those turnst ile s w er e m o s t l y good

nat ure d but,      about 2.50 pm,           there was a b u i l d - u p in the numbers of people

using the turnsti les and a sizeable queue developed.                           There w as incre as ing

evidence of d ru nk e n n e s s amongst           the s upporters who wer e all L i v e r po ol fans.

There w as a good deal of p u sh in g and shoving and polic e of ficers on horses

were n e c e s s a r y to c o ntr ol the crowd.            A n ideal o p p o r t u n i t y for p ick-pocket

activity.       It took this b u i ld- up of supporters                 several minutes to clear

throug h the turnsti le s but w i t h o u t problem.




On F r id ay 14 A p r i l   1989,       I to ok part in a        'phone-in p ro gramme w i t h Radio

Merseyside,      w h e n I spoke w i t h the p r e s ent er of that programme in rela ti on to

the Semi-F in al to take place on the fo llowing d ay and pass ed on variou s pieces

of advice for fans w ho we re               travel li ng to Sheffield.          One of the areas w h i c h I

stressed was that it w a s an all-ti ck et m a t c h and that fans who did not have a

ticket should not come.                 At 3.00 p m that same a f t e r n o o n I gave similar advice,

by telephone,       w h i c h was r e c or de d by a m e m b e r of staff at R adio Nottingham.
 On S a t ur day 15 A p r i l   1989,   I w a s respo nsi bl e for all m a tt er s in r e l at ion to

 crime at the Cup- Tie S e mi- Fi nal betwe en L i v e r p o o l FC and N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC.

As it was a ca rbon co py of the m a t c h w h i c h had been p la ye d before it made

 sense to use what had p r e v i o u s l y been successful a r ra nge me nts as the bul k of

 the support ers w o u l d have a tt en d e d the p revious m a t c h and w o u l d be aware of

the locations of the vari ou s f acilities and the various                        systems ope rat in g at

the ground.




On the day m y staff w e r e split into two teams.                     A team of 12 officers,          under

the c o mm and of D e t e ct iv e In sp ect or Towell,           w h o w e r e to operate in and around

the ground.        Eight of those o fficers w er e to be e n ga ge d on observations,

looking out for p i c k - p o c k e t s .




Outs id e the ground De tec t i v e Inspector Scaife had charge of a tea m of 14

of ficers w h o w e r e to be r es pon si ble for the p rev en t i o n and d e t e c t i o n of street

crime.     Two of these off ic er s w e r e in plain clothes on n o n-d es cri pt motor

cycles and it had be en e n v i s a g e d that, w h il st           the game was in progress,          these

officers w o u l d patrol the quiet            streets lined w i t h p a rk ed cars in an effort to

prevent and detect theft            fr om cars.




I a t t e nde d the b ri ef i n g at S hef f i e l d W e d n e s d a y FC at   10.00 am and f ol lowing

this b r ief ed m y own detectives.             I was ac co mp a n i e d t h r o ugh the first part of

the day by Police C o n s t a b l e 2439 Bocking,            who was in c i v i l i a n clothes.




At 10.50 am,      t ogether w i t h PC Bocking,          I went    to a m obi le police radio

control,    w h o were m o n i t o r i n g all C I D t r a n s mis si ons on c h an nel   19.   This

c a r av an was pl aced on land at the side of H i l lfo ot bridge and only a few yards

from the f rontage of a public house called                    'The Owl*.       E v e n at that stage

supporters wer e queu ing outside,             w a i ti ng for    'The Owl'     to be opened,     and at

11.00 am the bars opened.
 I rem ain ed in and a r o und that l oc at i o n for some 40 minut es and d u ri ng that

 period,    trade at the public house in cr eas ed as fo otball fans g athered there.




 The loc at io n of this public house w o u l d lead me to bel iev e that the majority,

 if not all,     of these fans w e r e N o t t i n g h a m Forest supporters.         I had nothi ng to

 do w i t h t h e m and cannot   say for certain.         I patr ol le d in m y own v e hi cl e wi th

 PC Bocki ng and at about        1.00 p m had a m e e t i n g w i t h Det ective     I ns pector Scaife

 and some of his staff in the p a r k i n g area for W a d s l e y B ridge Sect io n Station.

 This lasted a few m i n u t e s and after the de par tu re of D e t e cti ve Inspector

 Scaife and his staff I was join ed by the two mo to r cyc lis ts and I gave them

 further instructions.




At about     1.30 p m I we nt    to the S ou th Yor ks hi re Police Sports and Social Club

at N i a g a r a as traffic wa s b u i ldi ng up and it was m y i n t e n t i o n to leave m y car

in the car par k there and spend the time b e tw ee n then and the start of the

match,     on foot.    W hi lst at that loc at ion I went into the Cl ub w i t h PC Bocking

and sought out the D e p u t y He ad of Mer se y s i d e CID,        a D ete ct ive Superin te nde nt

Baxter - a m a n who      I k n e w w o u l d be lunching at the Clu b w i t h some of his

family and for w h o m I had arr an ged n e a rb y parking.            I had not met Mr Baxter

before and,      h avi ng i n tr od uce d m ys elf as a matt er of courtesy,         PC Bock in g and I

left the Club.




Whilst    I was in the Club I n o t i c e d that there was a large number of supporters

of bot h f ootball clubs who,        I assumed,      we re all police officers.            It was

apparent    that most wer e dining or w a iti ng         for meals they had orde re d or having

a casual drink.




About    1.50 p m PC B o ck in g and I w e n t   to the g y m n asi um at She ff ie ld W e d n e s d a y FC

wher e w e had a m ea l and,     at about 2.15 pm, we left and I d e c id ed to spend the

remaining time u ntil kick-off outside the ground in the v i c i n i t y of the
 L e p pi ng s Lane turnstiles,    as X c on sid er ed this to be the most likely place for

 pick-p oc ket activity.




 W i t h PC Bockin g I w a l k e d out onto the p e r i me te r track sur ro u n d i n g the ground

 and w a l k e d across the front of the Spion Kop,            wh er e the N o t t i n g h a m Forest

 suppo rte rs were gathered.        There was still p le nt y of r o o m in the Spi on Kop

 but,   nevertheless,     there was a large number of s pectators present and there

were v e r y few b ar re n places.




 In contrast,    looking over to Le ppi n g s         Lane end of the ground there ap pea r e d to

 be v e r y few spectat or s in evi den ce in the terraces or the stand at                   the ba ck of

the goal.      Equally,    the seating in the N o r t h Stand was          sparsely occupied.           I

went do wn the play er s tunnel and throug h onto the service road and car parking

area st the rear of the S out h Stand.              We made our w a y t h r oug h a sterile area

up to a light por ta ble b a rr ie r w h i c h w as near to a pair of m et al c oncertina

type gates,     marked    'C' at the Lep pi ng s Lane t u rns ti les area.




This t ur nstile serves the N o r t h Stand           and the West Stand and terr ac ed areas

behind the goal.         There are three lots of turnst il es and it i m m e d i a t e l y became

apparent    that the seven turnstiles,           serving the terraced area and betw ee n the

co nc ert in a type gates m a r k e d    'B' and the ones p rev io u s l y r e f e rr ed to m arked

'C ', w e r e in h ea vy demand.        A large crowd was backed up right out onto

Leppings Lane and there was a n g r y pushing and shoving taking place.                         There

were several police offi ce rs in evidence and in p ar ti cul ar two m o un te d

of ficers who    I b e li eve wer e from Merseyside.         The o f fi ce r in c harge of a

serial o f m e n was I ns pec to r Purdy,      a m a n I have known for a n u mb er of years

and r ec og nis ed immediately.         Inspector P ur dy and his serial w er e h aving a

great deal of d i f f i c u l t y in co ntr o l l i n g the crowd at this point.          The

turnstiles    'A' to   'G' w e r e a r r a ng ed on the left by the gates m a r k e d        'B' set

into a high w a l l and on the right by a m et al barri er some 20 yards long and at
                                                      -   5   -




 chest height,       the crowd was c ont a i n e d b ehind this barrier.




 It w as ap parent that the tu rn sti le s we re not coping e f f i c i e n t l y w i t h the

 crowd,    w h i c h was sw ell in g by the minute.




 Th ro ugh ou t the next 30 m i nut es or so I rem ai ned m o s t l y at that l ocation but,

 on two occasions,        w a l k e d bac k thro ugh the sterile area to w her e a serial was

 em pl o y e d at another barri er at the N o t t i n g h a m Forest          turnstiles into the South

 Stand.     T h e y w e r e h a vi ng no d i f f i c u l t y w i t h the people in that area and I

 spoke to a m a n I k n o w as Sergeant Hodgett and told h i m that I antic ip ate d

 that,    as the crowd i n c r eas ed at the Lep pin gs Lane turnstiles,                 more police

 o fficers w o u l d be r e q ui red and I asked him to post an off ic er from his serial

 ne arer to the tu rn st i l e s at Lep pi ngs Lane and in v i e w of the turnst il es in

order that he could resp on d should the o c c asi on demand.




At Leppi ng s Lane the b u i l d- up of crowd increased,                 tempers became fraye d and

e v idence of d ru nk enn es s became more and more pronounced.                     I remember at one

time,     Inspector P u r d y s tanding on the bar ri er w i t h his b ack to the turnstiles,

while in the m a nn er of a tight-rope walker,                    v a i n l y trying to address the

crowd.      He was b e g i n n i n g to look frightened and,            frankly,    I was not surprised.




A young b o y of some        10 or 12 years climb ed to the top of the wal l near to gate

 B     but a p p a r e n t l y what he saw on the other side d e t e r r e d h i m from dropping

over and he r eturned to the crowd on this side.                        I w a s d i s m aye d to realise

that in this      swelling mass of pe ople there w e r e such young children.                      There

were m a n y people stan di ng about not att em pt ing to join the queue                    (if it can be

desc ri bed as such)      and I w o n d e r e d at that time w h e t h e r the y had arra nge d to

meet   friends; w h e t h e r they we re w a i t i n g for the ru sh to die down or whether,

in fact,    they w e r e o p p o r t u n i s t s w i t ho ut tickets.   The gates m a rke d    'C' were

opened and clos ed on a n umber of occasions by stewards on the other side
 either to a l l o w o f f i c ial s and police o fficers to e nter or leave the ground,                       or

 to admit p eople who w e r e in distress.              I remember on at least three occasions

 these gates w e r e opened at the request of police off ice rs outside to admit

 people w i t h injuries.        One of these was a child who wa s c a rr ie d b o d i l y in and

 w ho had b e e n remov ed fro m the c ru sh at the turnstiles.




At some stage,        I w o u l d guess at about 2.40 pm,          I saw S upe ri nte nd ent Mars ha ll

 di re cti ng poli ce op er at ion s in this crush.           He was h a v in g to shout       to make

himself he ard on the radio and I heard a shouted request                        from Inspector Purdy

 for the gates to be op ened to relieve the press ur e on the turnstiles.                           Eve n at

that stage      I c oul d u nd ers t a n d the reason for this request.              I did not see

 S u pe rintendent M a r s h a l l again.     I was later to learn,         in fact,     that he

r e mained there c o n t i n u i n g to direct op er ati on s in the area of the Leppings

Lane turnst il es but such was the thr onging mass of people that I did not see

him even thou gh he must have be en a m at te r of yards from me.                      Not long

afterwards      I spoke to Inspector Pu rd y and said I thought the gates should be

opened.




At some stage it was d e c id ed that some large wrought ir on gates w h i c h lead out

into Lep pin gs Lane should be c l o s e d in order to prevent                 the n o w seething mass

of people in Lep pi ngs Lane from c on tin ui ng to a pp ly p ressure to the queue to

the turnstiles.         This was done s ucc e s s f u l l y but it seemed to be on ly minutes

before the gates wer e forced o pen again and the pressure resumed.                           At one

stage,    still p r e - o c c u p i e d w i t h the p i c k - p o c k e t s , I mo ve d nearer to these blue

gates but i m m e d i a t e l y became engul fe d in the crowd and I had to push and

struggle to get bac k into a r e l a t i v e l y clear space near to the light portable

barriers.




During these few brief moments I was fright ene d for m y own safe ty and it made

me realise what c on dit i o n s must have been like in the more                  seve rel y packed
 area behin d the b a r ri er leading to the turnstiles.                  I w as gettin g quite

 concerned and r e m e mb er rem ar kin g to PC Bocking that they w er e going to have to

 open the gates.




 PC Bock in g was car ryi ng m y radio at this time w h i c h was tuned to the channel '

 de si gn a t e d to CID,   nu mber    19.    U n i f o r m e d officers w ere being d i r ec te d from

 control on c h a nne l 25.




Condi tio ns d eteriorated,           m i s s ile s wer e thrown,   a beer can w i t h a d ri nk

sp illing from it s triking a police off ic er on horseback.                     T here was another

surge fro m the crowd w h i c h app ear ed to be a c o n c ert ed attempt to unseat this

same offic er and the horse started danc in g about in fright.                       T hro ug ho ut   I

could hear dema nds over a loud speaker syste m ple ad ing w i t h the crowd to stop

pushing,     to be patient.           I could r ecognise the speaker as PC 1035 Ryan.




As it got ne arer to 3 o ' c l o c k it became apparent               to everyone that it was

impos sib le for this vast crowd, w h i c h n o w st retched out of m y sight in both

directions of L epp i n g s Lane,         to gain access to the ground before k ick-off and

I he ar d some u n i f o r m e d o f fic er r em ar k that k ick-off had been delay ed for 15

minutes.




The c row d became more and mor e u n ru ly and nasty and I co ul d hear officers,                        who

were caught in the press,             shouting l ou dl y into their personal radios.




I b e g a n to have grave fears that the s it uation could only end in disaster.

The crowd w e r e b e g i n ni ng to s war m over the wal ls into the ground.               People in

the crowd w e r e sh ou tin g and screaming for a ssi st anc e and yet the thrust from

Leppings Lane continued.
 At vari ous times du ring this p er io d the m o u n t e d police of ficers had been

 su pp lem en ted by a n umber of others and I w o u l d est im ate there being in the

 re gion of eight to 10 m o u n t e d of ficers in that small area.                 T h e y were,   for the

 most part,      e n g ul fe d in the crowd and unable to c o n t a i n it.




 A few m i n ute s be fore 3 o'clock,           perhaps three or four,        I heard the message

 given over a u n i f o r m e d o f f i cer 's radio "Open the gate" and almost im me d i a t e l y

 the co nce rt ina doors of gate            'C' w e r e opened.       I w as standing on ly a few yards

 from the gate.         I should say at this point                that these gates had never been

under severe press ur e as the crowd had rec og ni sed that there was no

p r o b a b i l i t y of e n t e r i n g t h r oug h that gate.   The people in the immediate

v i c i n i t y of the gate b e g a n to go thr oug h it and it seemed to take the bu lk of

the crowd 30 seconds or so to realise what had occurred.




The trickle of p e op le going into the gr ound thr oug h this gate inc re as ed and

for a short p eriod there was contai na bl e e n t r y throu gh the gate.                  It was a

relief to me to see the gate o pened and,                    at this point,    I re ma rk ed to PC

Bock in g   "That gate should have been o pened earlier".




Over the next two or three m i n u t e s the f l o w through this gate in creased and it

was apparent       to me that the s i t u a tio n at the turnst il es w ou ld soon be eased.

It was about this time that              I heard a roar from the crowd inside the ground

and a s sum ed that either the players were out or that the m a t c h had commenced.

This   su rprised me,      havi ng thought that the game was going to be delayed.                     This

roar i n c r e a s e d the u r g e n c y of the people entering the ground.            I turned to

w a l k back w i t h PC Bock in g do wn the service road and made b y w a y to the south

east co rner of the ground,            where     I w a l k e d onto the p e r i met er track of the

pitch,   be hind the Spion Kop goal.
 The game was in progress and as I looked up towards the Leppi ng s Lane end I

 could see the crowd s pilling out f rom the terraces onto the pitch.                           I could

 not u n d e r s t a n d this but,     as there w e r e large numbers of un if orm ed officers

 m a kin g their w a y along the p er im e t e r path in front of the N o r t h Stand towards

 that area,      I assum ed that the m a t t e r wo uld be co nta i n e d and I left the pitch '

 at the n or th east c o r n e r .       I w a l k e d back to the g y m n a s i u m w h i c h was being used

 as a di ning room, w he re          I spoke to Detective I nsp ector Towell,            and a few

 minute s    later someone ca lled to me that play had been stopped and that there

w e r e injuries.




U n i f o r m e d of fic er s were hur ry i n g out of the g y m n a s i u m and I ret ur ned to the

 no rt h east c o r n e r of the pi tc h to see what was happening.                The scene wa s one

 of c o n f us io n at the Lepp ing s L ane end w i t h some people c l i m bin g from the

 terraces into the seated stand above and people co nti nu in g to spill out onto

 the pi tch t h r ou gh gates in the fencing w h i c h we re n o w open.              It a p p e a r e d to be

an i n v a sio n of the pi tch w h i c h should be c o n t ai ne d by u n i f o r m o fficers but,

after a m i nu te or so,         I d e c i d e d to w a l k over.   I had gone only about 40 yards

w h e n I met D etective Sergeant            72 7 L i n d le y comin g the other w a y and he called

to me "There's about 20 dead in there boss".




I went i m m e d i a t e l y to the Police R o o m under the N o r t h Stand,         from w h er e   I

c o n t a c t e d De tec ti ve Chief   Superin te nd ent Addis b y telephone.          I w o u l d estimate

the time to be somewhere in the r egi on of 3.15 pm.                      I i nformed Mr Addis that I

beli ev ed there wer e deaths and we di scussed that we w o u l d need to be thinking

in terms of setting up an Incident R o o m and a cti va tin g a C a s u a l t y Bureau.




I have to say that fro m that time I have no clear re co ll e c t i o n of the sequence

of events or of any timescale.                    I returned to the g y m n a s i u m and m y return

co incided w i t h that of Chi ef I ns pector Beal w ho shouted "We are going to set

up a t e m p o r a r y m o r t u a r y in here,    clear these tables".
 One half of the 'gymnasium had been set up as a d ining area and there was a

 t e m p o rar y p a r t i t i o n down the centre of the gymnasium.         It was this area that

 was cleared and there w a s a rush by polic e of ficers to put tables to one side.

 I beli ev e that D e t e cti ve Ins pe cto r Towell was in the g y m n a si um at that time

 and I am c e rta in that I was the senior o f f i cer present.




 People started arr ivi ng into the g y m n a s i u m c arrying victims.               The first v i c t i m

 to arrive was a y o un g m a n and I believe he was carrie d in by two police

 of ficers and a civilian.           He was taken to the wall o p p os it e the door and laid

 down.    Other p e op le we re n o w flooding into the g y m n a s i u m c a r r y i n g victims.

 The first m a n was a p p a r e n t l y dead and I tou che d one of the officers,

 intr od u c e d myself,   and e x p l a i n e d to h i m that that b o d y was his r e s p o ns ib ili ty

 and that u n d e r no ci rc um s t a n c e s was he to leave that body.            He w as to ensure

 that no-one else had a ny deal ing s w i t h the p r o p e r t y or clot hi ng or

id e n t i f i c a t i o n of that body.   These w e r e ins tr uctions that I w a s to repeat

dozens of times on that afternoon.




Brought in w i t h the dead w e r e the injured and these w e r e d i r e c t e d to the far

end of the g y m n a s i u m at the other side of the partition.                 The dead were

arriving in such numbers that it was i mp oss ib le to try to e s t a b l i s h whether,

in fact,    the y we re dead,      but I have to say that e ve ry body that I saw bore

what I re cog ni se to be classic          signs of asphyxia and I am sa tisfied that every

body that    I s a w and di rec te d into the area d es ign at ed as a t e m p or ar y m o r t u a r y

was,   in fact,    dead.     A l t h o u g h I saw most of the b odies I have to say that I

did not see th em all.          Indeed they wer e arri vi ng in such numbers and w i t h such

fr eq uen cy that on m a n y oc ca sio ns it was impos sib le to give inst ru cti on s before

the o fficers who had brought the bod y in had departed.




Some of the bo dies w e r e c a r ri ed in by m e mb er s of the crowd.             Some of these

people we re distressed,         w e e p i n g openly,   screaming,   a g g r e s s i v e and I saw
                                                    -   11    -




     several fights and scuffles b r e a k out in the area around,                   b e tw een and over the

    bodies that were being deposited.




    M a n y fans w er e giving assista nc e    to bring the dead and i n j ur ed persons into

    the g y m n a s i u m and it has to be said that w hil st           some w e r e ap pa re n t l y drunk

    they we re not caus in g trouble.         Offi ce rs and civilians w e r e attemp tin g to

    resusc it ate some of the victims and I saw at least two su ch groups attempting

    to revive,    what we re quite o b v i o u s l y to me,        dead bodies.




^   Of the people arri vin g in the g y m n a s i u m m a n y wer e s tanding around,             remaining

    there.    Police of fi ce rs were      going ba ck out to fetch mor e ca sua lt ies and the

    scene was one of g e n er al c o n f u s i o n w i t h bodies being put dow n haphazardly.




    At some stage     I saw De tec ti ve    Inspector Charles,           a p p a r e n t l y having come into

    the gym w i t h a body,    about to leave the gymnasium.                M r C h a rle s had attended

    the m a t c h on duty in full police uniform.                 I shouted to Mr C h a rle s and w h e n he

    came to me I told h i m that this public order si tu at ion in the g y m n a s i u m had to

    be control le d and told h i m to get some m e n and get on w i t h it.                  He im med i a t e l y

    started g at hering police offic er s to h i m and giving th em i n s tr uc tio ns and I

^   noted that he gave p r i o r i t y to the g y m n a s i u m floor.        It w a s impos sib le to

    count the bodie s as th ey arrived,         but w h e n there wer e about 20 I r emember

    thinking that there could not be m a n y more dead.                  As the bo dies w e r e     laid

    nearer and nearer to the g y m n a s i u m door someone,            I bel ie ve it was Detective

    Sergeant McSloy,     said to me "If we don't             start    laying the bodi es out n eat ly we

    will never get t h e m all in".        I told him to grab some m e n and get on w i t h it.




    Two off ic ers in u n i f o r m fr om the U n d e r w a t e r Sear ch Unit came to me at some

    time.    They w e r e c a r ry ing a han d- hel d video unit.          The y told me that they had

    been re co rding the scene in and around the area of the L e p p in gs Lane g o a l m ou th

    but that they had b een a ss aulted on two oc cas io ns by f ootball ,supporters and
  they had had to retreat for their safety.                   I re co gni se d need for evidence

 ga th ering and told them to start             filming the scene in the gym.              I do not

 remember seeing the m again.




 I find it ver y di fficult         to re call the events in the gymnasium.                 M y overall

 pe r c e p t i o n is one of dead bodi es arriving and being c a rri ed by shocked and

 pe rs pir in g police officers;          by d i str es se d people who w e r e o b v i ous ly friends

 and re latives and by d r u n k e n people,         some of w h o m were     shouting and w a n tin g to

 fight.     Injured people were         arriving and being d i r ect ed to the far end of the

 hall and the scene was one of in cre as ing confusion.




 Some degree of r e g u l a t i o n be gan to take place as Inspector C h a rle s and his

 team r e g u l ate d the people in the g y m and ejecte d the u n r u l y ones.               It wo uld

 have been folly to try and separate the g rieving re latives and friends from

 the bodies and many,         m a n y peopl e we re left standing around in the g y m n a si um

 helplessly,     in all stages of distress.             On several oc ca sions        I went t h rou gh to

the Police R o o m to ma ke use of the telephone w h i c h w as in there,                  but the

Police R o o m w a s busy,     the te lep ho ne was in use and w h e n I bull ied m y w a y to

the t elephone the number s I t ried to get wer e engaged or unobtainable.




At some stage       I recall having seen a police officer sat on a chair b y the

telephone in the Police Room.              He had a big tear in his trousers.                 He was

we e p i n g openly.    He was quite ob vio u s l y shocked.          I had a few w o r d s w i t h him

w h i c h seemed to me to be t o t al ly inadequate and left him.




At a very e arl y stage        I had d e p u t e d someone to arrange for the m a jo r incident

boxes to come from H a m m e r t o n Road and Ecc le s f i e l d and I asked Detective

Inspector Scaife,        at some stage,       to contact the Medico Legal Centre,               assess

their av ailable c a p a c i t y for bodie s and to ring round the various hospitals

and m o r t u a r i e s in the district w i t h a v i e w to e s t a b l i shing the a v a i l a ble
 capaciti es   for dead bodies.          I had also asked for the C o ro ner to be i nformed -

w h i c h seemed at the time to be an abs ol u t e l y incon gr uou s        request.




At some stage,         I th in k after half an hour,       I needed to make contact w i t h the

control b o x inside the gr ound to i n fo rm them of the si tu ati on in the gy mna si um

and as I w a s unable to contac t          the m by telephone and I k n e w that any radio

messa ge p a sse d w o u l d be relay ed over ev ery of fi cer's radio in the ground,                 I

went on foot.          I am n o w i n f o r m e d by Detective Inspector Towe ll that he

a c com pa nie d me,    but m y r e c o l l e c t i o n of events is so blur re d and dis tor te d that

I cannot r e m em be r him d oing so,       a l t h o u g h I have no r ea so n to doubt that he

did.




At the Police C o n tr ol Box I spoke to Mr Addis and, whil st                I cannot r emember

what   I said to him,        I must   have told him the situ at ion in the gymnasium.                 I do

rem emb er spea ki ng to the ACC Operations,            Mr Jackson,    and m e n t i o n i n g that

amongst other pr obl em s we w o u l d have w e r e the press,         who were present in

numbers.     Mr Ad di s asked me to take him b a c k to the g y m n a s i u m and as we left

the area of the Police Box I re mem be r hearing the L i v e rpo ol Manager,                  Kenny

Dalglish,    a dd res si ng the crowd and a ripple of applause went round the ground.

Other than that        I have no idea of what time it was.




On my r etu rn to the g y m n a s i u m w i t h Mr Addis    I saw senior ambulance officials,

in pa rt icu la r Al an Hopk in s w h o    I introd uce d to Mr Addis and we di sc uss ed the

eventual r e m ov al of bodies f r o m the g ym na s i u m and w h o w o u l d be responsible.




Mr Addis the n t o o k charge in the g y m n a s i u m and after a few m i n u t e s of

assessing the s i t u a tio n he stood on a chair,           c alled for order in the hall,           and

told p olice of ficers w hat he i n t en de d to do.          The g y m n a s i u m floor was littered

w i t h rows of bodies and I r e m e m b e r someone telling me w h e n I asked h o w m a n y

"Sev en ty odd and more        at the N o r t h e r n General".
                                                -   14    -




 Most of the bodies by this time had been dr aped w i t h what appeared to be white

 shrouds and I r eme m b e r w o n d e r i n g where on ea rth they had come from.              I was

 later to learn that they were,            in fact,      the paper table cl oth s w h i c h had been

 removed fro m the w o o d e n tressle tables,           n o w piled up at the side of the

 gymnasium.




 It was about this time that I remem be re d that m y youn ges t                  son was somewhere in

 the crowd and almost all of the bodies,                 the feet of w h i c h w er e pro tr udi ng from

 under these tablecloths,        seemed to have trainers on ide nt ica l to his.                     I had

 to resist the urge to go and look at ea ch of the bodies.




 It was d e c ide d that I should r et ur n to H a m m e r t o n Road,        assist in setting up a

Ma jo r Incident R o o m there and also arrange for the friends and relatives to be

bussed to H a m m e r t o n Roa d Police   Station.           I a rranged to be taken to H a m m e r t o n

Road by a m a r k e d police car and D etective               Inspector T ow ell t rav el le d in what       I

believe was the p ri son bus, w i t h anxious re la tiv es and friends.




On arrival at H a m m e r t o n Road I found the place under v i r tu al siege.                Li verpool

supporters we re w a n t i n g to make urgent enquiries,               m a n y were standing around

not knowing what      to do and someone had put out a call for all o f f - d u t y social

w o r k e r s to report to H a m m e r t o n Ro ad and there were m a n y social workers.             My

first re ac tio n w a s one of d ism ay at the thought of so m a n y social w o r ker s

being direc te d to this area but,          in a ver y short time,           it became apparent that

they w e r e to be invalu ab le    and prov id ed a b uffer b e t w e e n d is tre s s e d relatives

and fans, w h o had lost contact w i t h rel at iv es and friends in the crowd,                      and

the police.




I c al le d together the Incident R o o m staff, w h o had arr iv ed at the Stati on to

set up the Incident Room,         and b r i efe d the m as to wha t had oc cu rre d at the

ground and the s i t u a tio n there.       I should say here t h at. I was aware             that
  arran gem en ts had bee n made for the C a s u a l t y Bu reau to be activated.               I was

 shor tl y to be i n f or med howe ve r that all numbers to the C a s u a l t y Bure au had

 a l r ea dy gone out over the radio,          jamming all of the lines,         and as a result

 there was to be no police contact by telephone w i t h the Bureau for m a n y hours.




 H a vi ng told the Incident R o o m staff what had o c c u rr ed they we nt           about the

 busi ne ss of setting up the Incident R o o m at H a m m e r t o n Road.           I tried to make        a

 t e lephone call to m y home but could not get an outside                  line.    I later went to

 an adjacent bui ld ing w h e r e      I kn ew there was a direct outside line.             I

 telep hon ed home and es ta bl i s h e d that m y son was safe.           I t hi nk the time was

 then about 6.30 p m but all I can say for c e r t ai n is that it w a s still

 daylight.




 I w as   surprised to see Su pe rin te nde nt       S l ea th at H a m m e r t o n Road Police Statio n

 in ci vi l i a n clot he s and he told me that he had resp on ded to a call for all

 o f f -d uty police off ic ers to go either to H i l l s b o r o u g h or the closest police

 station.     Mr S l e a t h had assu med re sp on s i b i l i t y for relatives;    l i ai son with

Social Services and w i t h the t em porary mortuary.




During the course of the eveni ng there- we re three other events uncon ne cte d

w i t h this incident,       w h i c h req ui red m y attention.    One w as a po tential firearms

s i tuation in     FI     Sub-Division;       another was a p otential firearms situation in

'F 2 ' Sub-Division;        and,   the third inv ol ved the body of an old lady w h i c h had

been found in a fire at her home under suspicious circumstances.                         I asked

Detective Chief         I nsp ector A d d i s o n to go to E c c l e s f i e l d Police Station and deal

w i t h the bo dy and d e p ute d D et ective Inspector Scaife to deal w i t h the firearms

i ncident there.




I n ee ded to speak to De tec ti ve Chief Sup eri nt end en t Add is on m a n y occasions

during    the eveni ng but contact w i t h him w a s on ly possible by c o n t a c t i n g people
 w i t h him on channel 25 of the polic e radio and then r eq ue st ing h im to return

 to chann el     19, in the hope that our c o n v e r s a t i o n w o u l d be more secure.




 At some time du ring the evening,           but not long after Mr A d d i s o n had left for

 Ecclesfield,       I retur ne d to the g y m n a s i u m for a confere nc e w i t h Mr Addis and

 found that the Coroner,          Mr Potter,    and the Home Office Pathologist,             Professor

 Usher,    w e r e in attendance.      Pro fes so r Usher said that there w as little he

 could do at the scene and agreed to go over to E c c l e s f i e l d to lo ok at the

 scene and the bo dy there.           I arr an ge d transport for him.




 The scene at the g y m n a s i u m w a s n o w m u c h more orderly.    The bodies had all been

 c e r t i fie d dead.   There w e r e a n umb er of doctors in attendance;            there were

 social workers;         m a n y grie vin g re la tives and m a n y m a n y police officers,      all of

w h o m looked shocked,       d r a w n and tired.   I b e li eve that it w as at this stage I

 saw a m a n I re co g n i s e d as Dr Duckworth,     psychologist,     who lectures at police

es ta bl i s h m e n t s on trauma c o n n ec te d w i t h major incidents and,    in particular,         in

his involve me nt w i t h police o f f ice rs fo ll owing the B r a df ord Fire.




Mr Addis d i s c us se d w i t h me his plans to photograph,        w i t h a po lar oi d camera,

ea ch of the bodies;         to d i s p l a y these on a w a l l at a dif ferent part of the

g y m n a s i u m and to have rela ti ves brought,    one lot at a time,          to the gym na s i u m

to be shown the p h o t o g r a p h and,   if a pho to g r a p h w as picked out,      to have    the

body rela tin g     to that p h o t o g r a p h remove d from the hall into a tem po r a r y

viewin g ro om and identified.




We also d i s c u s s e d at that time our p r ior it ies and d e cid ed that no police

e n q ui ry could com me nce that night and it was i mp era ti ve that all police

efforts    should be d i r ec ted towards the sit ua tio n at the gymnasium;

i d e n t i f i c a t i o n of the bodies and prov id ing what a ssistance was p o s s ib le to the

relatives.
 I r eturned to H a m m e r t o n R o a d Police S t a ti on and cl osed do wn the Incident Room,

 w h i c h had a l r e a d y comm en ce d feeding the basic i n f o r m a t i o n into the system.

 For example,      a copy of the Op era t i o n a l Order of the football match.




 During the even ing the re la tives had b e e n removed first to H i l l s b o r o u g h Boys ■

 Club pr em ise s across the road fro m H a m m e r t o n Road Police Station,               and then to

 the C h u r c h Ha ll on Forbes Road.




 The only o c c a s i o n I can d e f i n i t e l y set a time for is 9.00 p m w h e n I had a

 c o n v e r s a t i o n b y telephone w i t h the D ep ut y Chief Constable,       Mr Hayes,     to update

 him of the operation.




 He re qu e s t e d that a c o nf ere nc e be set up of all senior off ic ers in vo lve d w i t h

 a v i e w to b eing able to s u pp ly the Chief Co ns tab le w i t h a factual account of

 events in order that he could be p r o per ly p repared to meet                    the i nevitable

barrage for i n f o r m a t i o n f r o m the press.     Mr Hayes asked me to arrange for all

senior of fic e r s conc er ned to be at the Con fe r e n c e R o o m at H e a d q u a r t e r s for

11.00    pm.    I rem em ber looking at m y w a t c h at that stage to assess h ow m u c h

time I had.        I had at least two other conversations,               during the evening, w i t h

ACC,    Mr J a cks on to updat e him,         but I cannot remem be r the content of the

conversation.




I returned to the gy mn as ium at Hillsborough,               spoke to Mr A d di s and told hi m of

the conference.




I decided that       I ought then to have a l ook at the stand and ter ra ces whe re the

disa st er had o c c u rr ed   (even though it wa s in darkness)           in order that I could

be p r o p e r l y i n f or med for the co nf er enc e w h i c h w a s to follow.     A l t h o u g h the

light w as not good it w as light e n oug h to give me some i n d i c a t i o n of the

de va s t a t i o n w h i c h had occurred.    I was a c co mp ani ed by De tec ti ve    Inspector
Towell.      We went fr om there t h r ou gh the tunnel and round to the turnstile area

and on our w a y ba ck to the g y m n a s i u m saw the Chief C o n s ta bl e w i t h a group of

people at the scene.




I in fo rme d the Chief C o n s t abl e of the m e e t i n g being set up at 11.00 pm.                I

retu rn ed to the gymnasium.               I had a further c o n v e r s a t i o n w i t h Mr A ddi s and the

Chief Co nst ab le     then visi ted the gymnasium.              He was o b v i o u s l y looking at the

scene c a r e f u l l y and w as   speaking to as m a n y o fficers as he pos si bly could,

o ffering w o r d s of encouragement.             I belie ve shor tly after this I returned w i t h

Chief Superi nte nd ent A dd is who had not had the o p p o r t u n i t y to visit              the area

of the dis as ter and t o g et her we went            from there into the service road at the

b a c k of the S out h Stand w h e r e we dis cu ss ed the prospect of a p pr oac hi ng the

m a n y t e l e v i s i o n crews n o w in atten da nce w i t h a vi ew to o bta ining video

recordi ngs taken by them.                Mr A d d i s decided against it.




Af te r I had retu rne d to the g y m n a s i u m I we nt to H a m m e r t o n Road Police Station

w i t h D ete ctive In sp ect or Towell.          I made arr ang em en ts for video record ing s to

be available at the C o n f e r e n c e R o o m at Police Headquarters.               I t r a v el led to

Head qu a r t e r s w i t h Dete ct ive    Ins pector Towell only to find that the conference

had bee n c a n c e lle d for that night          and w a s r e - a r r a n g e d for 9.00 am the

fo ll owing morning.         I ret urn ed to H a m m er ton Road Police        Station and went off

duty at around 2.15 am.




On arrival home        at about 2.30 am I di sc ov ere d that m y youngest               boy had picked

up two di st re s s e d L i v e r p o o l fans,   one of w h o m had been parted from his

For the attention o f ;-
The Hillsborough Disaster Appeal Co Ordinator


Dear Sir,

Please find enclosed a cheque -for  160 for the Hillsborough
Disaster Appeal. Although we are a pub in Hull, Three of our
regulars are Liverpool supporters and were at Hillsborough
on that terrible day. They were three of the lucky ones who
escaped with their lives, but the sights they saw has scarrd
them for life. They felt the had to do something for those
who weren't as lucky as them.


We staged a pub games night, knockout darts, dominoes,and
pool. Tetleys put up the prizes and all the entry fees went
to the appeal. On Cup Final day we brought in a big screen
and televised the match, for every pint sold during that
session Tetleys donated lOp to the appeal.We also took a
collection r e g u l a r l v as well. As you can see with a bit of
help we raised


We would be obliged if you could send us a receipt so we can
put it up on our notice board.




Yours faithfully

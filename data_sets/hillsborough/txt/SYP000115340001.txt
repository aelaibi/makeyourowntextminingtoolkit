               Outside        a    public            house         called      the P a r k        Hotel      I saw a        l arge      crowd        of

               Liverpool           supporters                 drinking.

from     the .ground,

At a bou t       1345       hours                  together         with Constable Stanbridge,                                m o v e d my

horse     to w i t h i n         the       confined area             of    the      terrace         turnstiles,                to

encourage         people             to m o v e     into      the    ground and             use all           the       turnstiles.

At    this     time        the       crowd were         orderly.

About     1410        hours          I noticed         that     the       crowd       had      begun       to      increase          and

spread        out a r o u n d         the     turnstiles.                This    wa s     due      in     part       to    the      fact

that     supporters              were        being     searched           p r ior     to g o i n g        into       the      ground,

but     mainly        due    to       the     slowness         of    them       going       into        the     ground.

Constable         Stanbridge                 and my self        t o ok     our      h o r ses      into       the       crowd

immediately            i         t      h      e        turnstiles              and      began      to w o r k          our    way.

through        the     crowd,          towards         the     turnstiles,               asking         supporters             to e a s e

b ack    and     release             the     pressure         on the       people         at, the         turnstiles,               many

of w h o m w e r e         being        crushed against                  the wa!               *Je b e g a n       to     succeed,           in

part     due     to    the       fact        that    s o me    supporters             recognised              us     from working

o n the H o p at            Liverpool,              but m a i n l y       due    to      the     steadfastness                 of    the

two     Police        horses          wh o    were    withstanding               increasing               pressure            and

tension.          After          about        5 minutes,            there       was      a m a s s i v e s u r g e from              the

back     of    the                     iBnmii rayi~-~ ^ ~ w a s          pushed       even       nearer         to      the wall.

He    became      agitated             and     I wa s      able      to    turn him and a ll ow                      him      to    face

the     bulk    of     the       crowd,        which       helped         to    calm      him.          Despite           loud

appeals to the cro

ease     back.         iiany p e o p l e           in the      crowd were             appealing           for        help      but     the

crush was         now       so       intense        that      it w a s     be comi

horse     to mo ve.              1 f el t      the    horse         become       agitated           again and              realised

that     the     pressure             of     the    crowd was            forcing         his     f ee t   from          the    g r ou n d.

1 decided         for       the       sake     of    safety         to    these       supporters              to     remove my

horse     from        the    crush,           which     I di d w i t h          s om e    difficulty.                   I took my

horse     to    s id e      of       the     crowd,     near        to    the    back       to    t r y to         ease       the

pressure.             I could          see     children         being          passed       out     of    the        crush         over

success,              I moved          my    horse         over     towards              him and was                able    to m o v e          some

the    turnstiles,                 which        we    did,         I cannot              recall         hearing        t he      customary

noise*       from          inside         the     g r o un d ,     which          greets          the     start       of    the         game,

             and    it w a s    only w he n        I heard a          loud-speaker                appeal       to    fans   to      ease

             the    crushing,         that       I realised         that     there       was       a   problem        inside        the

             ground.

             We* w e r e    then    instructed           to    patrol       the    surrounds             of    the    g r o u n d a n d at

             about      "1810 h o u r s   we     were     stood       down       and     returned         to    the    horse        boxes..

                                     SATURDAY 1$th APRIL 1989


       -             On Saturday 1$th April 19^9 I was amongst a parly
                                                                                      l39,v
   of Merseyside Police Officers giving Mutual Aid to the Soutli _
   Yorkshire Police on the occassion of an F.A.Cup Semi-Final, being
   played at Hillsborough Football Ground, between Liverpool F.C. an?
   Nottingham Forest F.C.                                                      ____ ^
                      At 1130hr8 that day I commenced my deployment in
   LEPPINGS LANE in company with Constable 1696 Stanbrid^e
   Merseyside Police. Other officers in LEPPB GS LANE were Sgt 1761*
   Thomas of the South Yorkshire Police, Sgt 1952 Smith of the
   Merseyside Police and Woman Constable 387 Henwood of the South
   Yorkshire Police. °ur main responsibility was the turnstiles at
   the LEPrlNGS LANE end of the ground, which at this time were quiet.
   Together vith Constable Stanbridge I went for a Patwl aroundthe
    surrounding area of the ground to aquaint myself withthe
    of the location. Outside a public house called the PARK HOTEL I saw
    a large crowd of Liverpool s u p p o r t e r s , d r i n k i n g .
                       From approximately 12U5hrs to 13i|$hrs I was engaged
    in keeping clear the entrance to the turnstile area, encouraging ;
    people with tickets to go into the ground, and those without —
    tickets to go away from the ground.                         ,... „ '! V1
                       About 13l*$hrs I, together with Constable
    moved my horse to within the confined area of the
    to encourage people to move into the ground and use all the turxw
    stiles. At this time the crowd were orderly.                       .. ; -y.
                       About iMOhrs I noticed that the crowd had begu
    increase and spread out around the turnstiles, >Ibis m *
    to the fact that supporters were being
    the ground, but mainly due to the slowness ofthea going i n t ^ t ^ ^
    ground. Constable Stanbridge and myself took
     crowd immediately in front of the turnstiles and began ^
     way through the crowd, towards the turnstiles, a s k ^ supporter* to
     ease back and relaese the pressure on th«
     many of whom were being crushed against the
     succeed, in part due to the
     us from working on the KOP at Liverpool, but                              *>
     steadfastness of the two T o l l *
     increasing pressure and tension.                             J}
     a massive surge from the back of the
     even nearer to the wall. He became ^ ^ t e d ^
     him and allow him to face the bulk of
     calm him. Despite loud appeals to the
     the crowd refused to ease back. Many people in
     appealing for help but the crush was now so
      becoming impossible for the horse to move. I
      agitated again and realised that the pressure of the crowd waj
      his feet from the ground. I decided for the sake °f
      these supporters to remove my horse from the crush, which I did
      wlthsome^ilfficulty. I took V b o » . to .16. of th. o r ^ d , ^ .
      the back to try to ease the pressure. I could see children
      passed out of the crush over tf e heads of the crowd and otheri^
   n.384                                                ^ .l|b (   r « » I0 4 A



being pulled gut of the crowd up onto the top of the metal wall
dividing the Terrace turnstile area^from the Stand turnstile area.
1 also saw that people were crawling underneath my horse, which in
his agitated state was a very dangerous thing to do. I could see
a foot Constable trying to close the iron gates ate the entrance to
the Tearrce turnstile area, but without success. A-moved my horse over
towards him and was able to move some of the corwd sufficiently for
him to close the gates.    uonstable Stanbridge and I then moved
back into the contained turnstile area and attempted to move the
crowd back into the gap which now existed at the back of the crowd
at the turnstiles, between them and the iron gates. Some people
did move back, but most chose to ignore us and continued to push
forward. At this point there was a sudden large influx of people,
the crushing intensified and I was forced to the side of the crowd.
I again asked my horse to go into the crowd, but he becaae stubborn
and apprehensive about doing so. I have never known him to behave
like that in the sixteen years he has been a police horse. I did
eventually manage to get him to go back into the crowd. At this
point I noticed people moving away from the back of the crowd and
moving to the right of the Terrace turnstiles, in the direction of
 the side passage leading to the club car park. The immediate effect
of thsi was to ease the pressure on the crowd. Afetr a while people
began to make their way back into the crowd and at this point I saw
 the exit gate for patrons of the WEST STAND open and people were
 being allowed in. It was open for a short time only, and then
 closed. The remaining supporters, of which there were not now many,
 passed thriugh the turnstiles in an orderly fashion. Some time later,
 I cannot be sure how long, we were ordered to close the turnstiles,
 which we did. I cannot recall hearing the customary noise,from
 inside the ground, which greets the start of the game, and it was only
 when I heard a loud-speaker appeal to fans to ease the crushing, that
 I realised that there was a problem inside the ground.
                  We were then instructed to patrol the surrounds of
 the ground, and at about IfilOhrs we were stood down and returned     , ^
 to the horse-boxes.                    .
                  I have been a Mounted wffioer for 31 7 9 *** «*»d in j ^
 that time have only once been confronted by a orovd of people so
 un-cooperative and unwilling to listen to reasson, and Jfaat was on
 the owassion of a football natch between Scotland and Wales, played
 at Anfield in 1977. My horse is a very stable and brare horse and 5f
  I have neber before known him to show apprehension as he did on
 this occassion.

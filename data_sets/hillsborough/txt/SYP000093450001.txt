j. t h e n       made       my    way       to    Insp        SYKES        as    other       fans

came       surging              out    of    Leppings           Lane.            Many       of       these

fans       were        shouting             abuse        and    many        were       the       worse

for       drink.




1' l i a i s e d       with       Supt       M A R S H A L L / Insp         SYKES          who       were

organising                 manpower          and        priorities              were       soon

ascertained                 to    be    preservation                  of    bodies,          which

were       laid        out       near       the       River     Don        fence,          and

organising                 first       aid       to    the     injured.




However,              it    soon       be c a m s      apparent            that       we    had       a

potentially                 serious          problem           with        irate       fans          now

       injured             ui               ioval       could          be    arranged;

c)     Keep       a                         tr f o r     ambulances                in

                                  for th#i« arrival



After    organising                   initial          cordon,          no       ambulance          had

arrived       and          the    need       was       obviously             critical.               ,

Therefore,             I visited             the       shop       on    Leppings             corner

(Garretts             Newsagents) and                   made       a    59 9 9 5 ca!           to

Ambulance             Control          at        informed          them          that    we    had

a    major    incident                and    our       urcrgrvev— in             the    need    for

ambulances.                 Ambulance             Cantroi Jjaformed                     me    they

were    aware          and       would       look       for       re-enforcements                   for

Leppings          Lane,




Returned          to       cordon          where       the    departing                fans    were

beginning             to    build-up,             many       of    whom          continued          with

their    abuse             towards          the    police.              I    continued

organising             and       re-enforcing                the       cordons          to    he1p

control       Liverpool                fans       as    they       left          the    ground.




Continued             abuse       by       the    fans       and       increasing             numbers

gave    further             cause          for    concern.              In       view    of    this,

I searched             and       found       further          re-enforcements                   in       a

serial       of       Specials             traced       nearby.              I    instructed

their    commander                to       re-enforce             the       cordon       to    control

the    large          number          of    fans       now    leaving             the    ground.

still      a     fairly            large       number       of     fans        on    the

One     irate         fan         (the    worse       for       drink)         was       being

controlled              by        his    mates       whilst        his      opposite             number

walked         away       from          them,       mumbling           something            like,

“D r u n k e n      bastards.“

I then         stayed             with    the       cordon       to      ensure          th e

Liverpool             fans         were    kept       well       away       from         the

sterile          area         and       took    over       the     task        of    aivina

advice         to     tha         large    number          of    fans       looking             fo r

The     abuse         continued            throughout              from        a    minority            of

conti n g e n t , who               were       particularly               abusive,              were

the     fans        who       were       claiming          that        they        had    got      in

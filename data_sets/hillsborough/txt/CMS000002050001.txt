Personnel Overheads : Travel and Subsistence


The first quarter figure has been revised to reflect more
accurately the money advanced to Home Office staff by way of
imprest (approx. £13,000) and that paid to the Judge, his clerk
and the Inquiry Assessors (approx. £6,500).    The second quarter
figure has been reduced in the absence of further imprest claims
by Home Office staff, and incorporates only payment to the Judge,
clerk and Assessors.


2.   The third quarter figure reflects forthcoming visits to
stadia in a number of European countries (including Italy,
Holland and France) and within the UK.   Travel and subsistence
costs will also be incurred by a six member technical working
group which has recently been established.

INTRODUCTION
The Barclays League Soccer Visa Card is intended to satisy
the disparate needs of supporter, club and government,
providing identification w ithout stigma, w hilst offering
benefits to the cardholder.
The card will be a benefit card first and an ID card second,
deflecting current criticism.
Specifically the cardholder is provided w ith access to an
electronic ticket purchasing facility which will in itself
revolutionise the ticketing industry.
PROPOSAL
This document proposes a joint venture between The
Challenge Group and Barclays to introduce a cash dispenser
ticket system and subsequent licensing of its application to
the Football League and member clubs via the Barclays
League Soccer Visa scheme.
It is further proposed that The Challenge Group, together
w ith Barclays, following the initial application of the scheme
in soccer, proceeds to license the scheme for application in
other commercial areas - entertainment and travel, both in
the United Kingdom and abroad.
THE MANAGEMENT TEAM
A m anagement team will be established comprising
executives and technicians of Barclays and The Challenge
Group.
The team will work, as its first priority, towards the
application of the cash dispenser ticket system in soccer, but
will allow for its adaptation into other areas.
Representatives of the Football League and Government
will be invited to participate in the implementation of the
Barclays League Soccer Visa card as appropriate.

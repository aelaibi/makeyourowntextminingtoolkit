 WERE YOU INVOLVED IN ANY CROWD CRUSH,          IF SO, CAN YOU SAY WHAT TIME THIS

 HAPPENED?

        AT THE SAME TIME, PEOPLE WERE CONTINUALLY FLOWING FROM THE TUNNEL.               IT

 WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO TURN AGAINST IT THE SPACES WERE FILLING RAPIDLY AND THE

 PRESSURE WAS UNBEARABLE I WAS BEING PUSHED TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE PEN.

 I THEN SAW A LAD, WHO HAD HIS ARM WRAPPED UPRIGHT AROUND A BARRIER,              IT

 WAS FLOPPY AND HIS ARM BROKE.

 I TRIED TO ATTRACT^tFf&v^TTENTION OF A POLICE SERGEANT WHO WAS IN THE FRONT

 OF THE      W     STAND, SITUATEENON TOP OF THE TUNNEL.          I EVENTUALLY CAUGHT

 HIS ATTENTION HE LOOKED AT ME WAVING HIS HAND AND SHAKING HIS HEAD.

 THERE WAS STILL A CONTINUAL FLOW OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE PENS.                THE MAN

 WITH THE BROKEN ARM ESCAPED TO PEN 2.             AT THIS TIME PEOPLE WERE BEING

 P U L L E D <UP INTO THE    W STAND.           ALL ALONG THE BACK OF PENS 3 AND 4 PEOPLE

 WERE BEING PULLED UP          BECAUSE. OF THE P R ES S U R E , PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING ON TO

 THE FENCED OUT OF THE WAY.             THE POLICE WERE SHOUTING AT PEOPLE TO GET BACK

 AND OFF THE F E N C E , IN MY OPINION THEY FEARED A PITCH INVASION.

 THEN THEY REALISED THE SERIOUSNESS OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING.                      I SAW A POLICE

 OFFICE     CLIMB   INTO THE PE^S,*IN MY OPINION HE DESERVES A COMMENDATION.

 THE CROWD CRUSH AND SURGE WERRE ALSO TWO FACTORS.

 352

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO



 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE INJURED COULD HAVE BEEN HELPED MORE.         BODIES WERE BEING PULLED OUT OF THE

 CROWD AND LEFT THEY APPEARED SHOCKED OR UNCONSCIOUS.                      ONLY THEN DID

 OFFICERS RETUPWy WHEN IT WAS PROBABLY TOO LATE. THE AMBULANCES SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 GIVEN MORE ROOM Tb\GE'T TO THE DEAD AND INJURED,                INSTEAD OF PEOPLE CLUTTERING

 UP THE PITCH.       THERE\SE|EM£D A LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND LEADERSHIP AMONG

 IS     THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 LIVERPOOL WERE GIVEN THE WRONG END.        THE REASON GIVEN WAS FOR TRAVEL

 ARRANGEMENTS.   I FOLLOWEDNfHE ROUTE PUBLISHED BUT ENDED UP BEHIND THE

 LIVERPOOL'S GATE IS 38,000, F O R R E S T *S IS 20,000.              LIVERPOOL SHOULD HAVE

 HAD A BIGGER GROUND TICKET AVAILABILITY AND SPION KOP END.                      ALSO WHY

 WAS IT PLAYED AT HILLSBOROUGH AND NOT TRAFFORD.                     THE FENCES SHOULD BE

 REMOVED AND RAILINGS SHOULD BE REMOVED TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO SPREAD SIDEWAYS.

 THEY SHOULD LEARN FROM THIS DISASTER AND SCRAP THE ID SYSTEM.

 NOTHING AT ALL.

 (353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE WERE VERY SLOW TO REACT EVEN       A   F   ^   E   R   THEY APPARENTLY KNEW THE

 SEVERITY OF IT.     THE POLICE THAT WERE FORMED ON THE HALF WAY LINE SHOULD

 HAVE OBVIOUSLY BEEN UTILISED AT THE INCIDENT,                      THE AMBULANCE,       THE ST J O H N ’S

ONE ? WAS STATIONARY AFTER    IT HAD ENTERED THE GROUND AND WAS VERY SLOW TO HAKE

 PROGRESS.     THERE DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE ENOUGH OF THE ST JOHN'S AMBULANCE PEOPLE

 OR ENOUGH MEDICAL FACILITIES,             ^   . ___                  A    .    ^


                                                                               O O   M         m   T
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YobvWISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 NOT ENOUGH POLICE OUTSIDE LEPPINGtlNlJftNE E N D .                NOT ENOUGH TURNSTILES O P E N . THE

 GATES OUTSIDE COULD BE USED AS A NATURAL FILTER TO SLOW PEOPLE DOWN AND

 CONTROL THEM.    THE POLICE SEEMED MORE INTENT ON SEARCHING FANS THAN IN CROWD

CONTROL. MORE POLICE HORSES USED OUTSIDE TO FORM THE Q U E U E S .

 I THINK   IT NEEDS TO BE POINTED OUT THAT THE SEARCHING OF PERSONS BY POLICE

WAS A FACTOR     IN SLOWING THE CROWD DOWN AND THE EVENTUAL BUILD-UP AT THE

 TURNSTILES.

 iftsi AN INSPECTOR TURNED UP TO CONTROL THE C R O W D , SHORTLY AFTER HALF PAST-

 TWO (1430),    IT WAS TOO LATE.   HIS USE OF THE MEGAPHONE WAS HAVING NO EFFECT,.

 EVEN WHEN HE MENTIONED THAT THE MATCH WOULD BE D E L A Y E D .

 I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT THE GATES HAD TO BE OPENED                      IN ANY EVENT OTHERWISE

 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FATALITIES OUTSIDE.

 I THINK THESE POINTS NEED TO BE HADE KNOWN.

 RECOGNISE SERIOUSNESS OF SITUATION.

                                                                                      PAGE      9

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAITS^GUIRY?

 2)    I AM A MEDICAL PRACTITIONER AfoQ HAD AN ANNOUNCEMENT BEEN MADE

 REQUESTING MEDICAL ASSISTANCE I WOULtS'OBVIOUSLY HAVE HELPED.               ^   o^rtn^o*

 3)    I HAD HEARD THAT IT IS POLICE POLICY       TO OPEN GATES IN A CRUSH

 EQUATION     IF THAT IS THE CASE,     IT WOULD   BE IN PEOPLES INTERESTS

 TO CREATE A SITUATION OUTSIDE TO INEVITABLY GAIN ENTRY.

 4) WHY, WHEN THE GATES WERE OPENED WASN'T THE TUNNEL CLOSED OFF

 ENABLING A FLOW OF PEOPLE TO OUTER PENS.

 5) ENTRANCE TO LEPPINGS LANE APPALLING.

 6) OBVIOUSLY TOO MANY PEOPLE ALLOWED INTO CENTRAL TERRACES.           THERE

 SHOULD BE MORE DIRECTION TO OUTER TERRACES FROM AN EARLY STAGE.

 7) LOTS OF POLICE OUTSIDE TURNSTILES AT 3.40PM          (1540) AND NONE

 INSIDE TURNSTILE AREA.

 Q49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN THE DEATHS,    OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 THE MAIN POINT I REGARD WAS A FACTOR,     WAS THE LACK OF STEWARDS

 INSIDE THE GROUND AT THE TUNNEL HEAD, PLUS AN^ACk OF POLICE

 CONTROL OUTSIDE,    THE CROWD SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT

 THE KICK OFF WOULD BE DELAYED UNTIL EVERYONE WAS IN         CJYT~

 STEWARD, A LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A

 CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 MO.



 DO YOU HAVE 1     / VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS H A N D E D , AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?-
                          sU o - l ' V r              cj£z
 POLICE OFFICERS WERE PUSHING PEOPLE OFF THE TOP OF THE

 RAILINGS BACK INTO THE CR&Sfti, THEY WERE ONLY TRYING TO

 ESCAPE THE SURGE.     MORE EMERGENCY SERVICES RESPONSE.

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) SITUATION OUTSIDE GROUND WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL.

 2) BETTER POLICE AND STEWARDS ORGANISATION.

 3) AS SITUATION EASED AND LESS VOLATILE RESPONSE FROM SUPPORTERS

 WAS L I K E L Y , POLICE IN CORDON COULD HAVE BETTER USED IN HELPING

 THE DYING AND INJURED.

 4) POLICE SHOULD HAVE HELPED IN CARRYING THE DEAD AND INJURED,

 IT WAS ALL DONE BY FANS.

 5)

 I THINK THE OPENING OF THE GATE OUTSIDE, WAS CORRECT TO SAVE LIFE

 OUTSIDE.

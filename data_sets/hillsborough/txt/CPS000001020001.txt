Dear Mr Croston

HILLSBOROUGH : ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

I believe that some time on the afternoon of 2 October, you received a fax of 11 pages
of further submissions by HFSG. These were seen by me at 5.00pm on 2 October. I
had in fact left Counsel’s Chambers some time after 4.30pm having just finalised the
submission on behalf of Mr Murray which I intended to submit on Monday by fax.

This letter is being dictated on Saturday evening and I am just about to deliver a copy
of your fax to Simon Myerson who is Junior Counsel in the case. He is going to try to
look at the papers on Sunday. He is not in Chambers on Monday and Tuesday.

Mr Michael Harrison QC is at a Bar Conference and not due back to Leeds until
Monday.

It will be Monday night at the earliest before we can possibly have on paper, any further
representations to these supplementary representations. It may in fact be Tuesday.

Can I ask whether you would prefer that I fax on Monday, a submission that we had
completed and then separately provide you with die supplemental representations or
would you prefer no later than say close of business on Tuesday but earlier is possible
that we send you the complete submission.

Yours sincerely




R B Manning

Dear Lord Justice Taylor
THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - FINAL REPORT
I am writing to express our general support for the conclusions you have reached and the
main thrust of your recommendations.
However, without wishing to detract from the Report, there are a few detailed technical points
on the proposed Membership Scheme where we either do not completely concur or where
further options are available:
Para 389
A receipt will need to be given where a membership card is retained under failure type (2).
However, this could be given by a steward at the entry point rather than by the turnstile
operator. There would of course still need to be sufficient stewards to cope with such
problems.
Para 403
A referral list would have to be simulated,as a real list would not exist. We planned to allow
for up to 200,000 names on a referral file when the tests took place. Technically this is not
difficult to achieve. It would not necessarily cause a major delay in reading times due to the
speed of computers and file search techniques now available.
Para 404
The referral file would have been kept within manageable limits by a complete renewal of the
cards, probably every two years. The expiry date of the cards, which is machine readable,
would be checked first and if the card was current the referral file would then be checked.
All names and numbers on the previous referral file would continue to be held by the Scheme
Operator Company and the FMA but the load on the computer system would be kept within
the 200,000 limit assuming our estimates of lost, stolen, forged and banned cards are correct.

February 1 1990                                                                              2



Para 405
The figure of 3% allowed for likely reader problems which would tend to increase over the
two year membership period. Special arrangements would have been made during the tests to
deal with problem card holders but your assertion that this aspect would need to be
thoroughly tested is quite correct
Para 406/407
We agree with your conclusions that the live tests would have risks and that the responses
both from well behaved fans and any potential hooligans are not completely predictable.
However such live tests would have been a far less risky approach than proceeding directly
with full implementation. To proceed without live tests, would, in our view, have been an
unacceptable risk.
The above comments are not meant to detract from your overall conclusion on the
technology, that given the potential human reactions you describe it would be a tall order for
the Scheme to work under all match conditions, particularly those involving crowds of around
50,000 people.
I hope you find the above comments helpful in clarifying the strategy which has been the
foundation of our approach.
Yours sincerely




Keith P. S. Stein

                Initially             the      turnstile         afea     was      quiet      so    I with Const

                outside          a    loc al      public        house.

For      a short          time       we    appeared            to    have    the       situation             under          c o nt rol ,        but

at    t his     t im e     both       myself          and Constable               Grunnill             were       facing          the

turnstiles               and    unaware          of w h a t         was    behind        us.

me    they      all       appeared          to       be    shouting         and       pushing          their         way     towards            the

tin^risj^ij^e^.            I shouted             a warning            to^ffiove bac k             as      those        at    the       f r o nt

were      being          crushed          but    they        took jfo       notice.

Children            and    adults          were       s e r e <yffi n g t h a t       they were             being       crushed and                  I

feared         for       their       safety.              I^saw      children          being         passed          over        heads         to

safety away               from       the    chaos.

At    t his     point          my    horse       began        to     panic       so    I moved            out     of    the       crowd         to

avoid      an a c c i d e n t .            I saw young               people       being         lifted          to     the       top      of    the

barrier         between             the    terracing               turnstiles          and      the       West       stand        turnstiles

I continued               to    appeal          to    oeople         to   stop        pushing          but      all     requests

seemed         to    be    ignored.              7 me a r e a s o u t s i d e the               compound             had     become            full

 hysterical,,          screaming         fans.

 At    t his   point        I noticed         a    conc/nina             gate       to   the    right       of t h e   terrace

                    During my patrol I saw a large crowd of what I preswed to be
                    Liverpool supporters drinking outside a local public house.

             I made my way with Constable Grunnill through the
crowd and attempted to ease the situation by advising those
who were pushing to ease back.      I could see persons at the front
beinr squashed against the stiles.        These requests even at this
stage were ignored.

             For a short time we appeared to        have thesituation
under~control, but at this time both myself         and Constable
Grunnill were facing the turnstiles and unaware of what was behind
us.
             I suddenly felt a massive push from the rear causing my
horse to be pushed forward.       I looked back and saw a massive
crowd of fans.   To me they all appeared to be shouting and pushing
their way towards the turnstiles.      I shouted a warning to move
back as those at the front were being crushed, but they took
no notice.
             Children and adults were screaming that they were          being
crushed   ->ndI feared for theirsafety.     I saw    children being passed
over heads to safety away from the chaos.

             At this point my horse began to panic go I moved out
of the crowd to avoid an accident.        I saw young people being
lifted to the top of the barrier between the terracing turnstiles
and the Vest Stand turnstiles.

             I continued to appeal to people to stop pushing but
all requests seemed to be ignored.        The areas outside the
compound had become full and persons in those areas appeared to
be in a state of agitation.

             I remember seeing Constable Grunnill and a foot
officers attempting to close the blue perimeter gates.          Both
 gates were eventually closed.                                            .k

             A short time later    there appeared to be a massive          ^
 push from outside, the gates were pushed over, and the confined
 area became a mass of hystericalt screaming fans*

             At this point I noticed a concertina gate to the
                                                 *

 right of the terrace turnstiles was open and fans were allowed
 through*      This appeared to be a great relief as some fans
 moved away from the back and relieved the pressure on those at
 the front.
             I also remember a concertina gate between the West Stand
 and the terrace turnstiles open and some fans entered that
 way.      The remainder passed through the stiles in an
 orderly fashion.      A short time later the turnstiles were
 closed.
             I remained outside the ground at the Lepping Lane
 end and then patrolled generally until I was stood down to
 Niagra at about 1820 hours*                         _____________

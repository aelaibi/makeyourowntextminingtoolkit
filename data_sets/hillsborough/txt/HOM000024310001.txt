HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - INTERIM REPORT

Further to the above subject you will now no doubt be in
possession of a copy of the TAYLOR Report and I am sure that you
will agree with me that there are substantial implications for
all involved in the staging and conduct of football matches.
Many of the recommendations contained within the report are
required to be implemented by the start of the season, i.e.
Saturday, 19th August 1989.

Clearly such a tight time frame does not give me, and indeed
anyone affected by the report, the opportunity for any indepth
study and consideration of the recommendations. Certainly to
draft a full written agreement, as required by Recommendation 4
of the Report, will take longer than the time available if it is
to meet the satisfaction of our respective organisations, their
solicitors,  insurers etc.    What I would therefore propose is
that this letter be treated as a Letter of Intent setting
out the position which the Avon and Somerset Constabulary will
be working from in negotiations with the Club, Safety Officers
and other affected parties.

1.     We do not see ourselves as being responsible for any
      process relating to the counting, marshalling or packing
      of spectators in any section of the ground. We see this
      as a responsibility of the Club.

2.     We see the Club as being responsible for the provision of
      information   relating to numbers entering, or in any
      particular section of the ground.
In relation to general responsibilities within the ground
the Avon and Somerset Constabulary will start from the
position.   that  primary   responsibility for the safe
management of people within the ground will rest with the
Club.    The Police will, however, retain an overriding
responsibility for the preservation of life and safety of
this within the ground and the coordination of their
evacuation if considered appropriate.

We would see it as a club responsibility to nominate.
persons to identify crowd stress in any area occupied by
supporters.
Any recommendations relating to the structure of the
ground, painting of gates and the provision and use of
cutting equipment etc. will be seen as resting with the
Club.
We agree that, in keeping with the report, the perimeter
gates will be kept open during the period that there are
supporters in any part of the ground.
A Police Officer will be nominated to man each gate in any
perimeter fence other than low boundary wall gates. They
will be in possession of a radio.
In accordance with the requirement of the recommendations
a separate number of officers will be designated solely
for the purpose of reserves. This will be at the level
of:-
     Normal match -       IP.S. & 5-P.C's.
     Intermediate match - 2 P.S's & 10 P.C's.
     High risk match    - 1 Inspector, 2 P.S's & 20 P.C's.


Police will of course play a full role in the Advisory
Group which is to be established.

The operation of turnstiles and other actions relating
thereto will be a clear responsibility of the Club as well
as enhanced signposting and information to be contained on
tickets.
The issue of Close Circuit TV enhancements and other
communications   will be subject of discussion between
ourselves to bring them up to the required standard.

The nominated Chief Officer for liaison on police planning
within this Force area will be Assistant Chief Constable
(Ops) , currently Mr. Pau,l MANNING.
 It is the view of Avon and Somerset Constabulary, in
 keeping with advice received from the Home Office, that
 any additional manpower costs incurred as a result of
 implementing the recommendations will be met by the Club
 and this will of course be subject of discussion between
 ourselves.
It   is accepted that there are many other recommendations
contained   within    the    report  which are not referred to
specifically ■ within     this letter.    These .are seen laying
primarily with other organisations.        I would emphasise again
that   the   above statements relate to my position at the
commencement of discussions with the respective football clubs
within this Force area.

         Cardiff City Football Club Limited,
         Ninian Park,
         Cardiff.


         For the attention of Mr. T. Clemo


         Dear Sirs,
                                        Re: Ninian Park, Cardiff.

              Further to the Interim Report of the Enquiry by the Right
         Honourable Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster
         and the recent discussions which you have had with the police,
         I now write to set out the arrangements in relation to football
         matches at the above Ground.

                  1.   The Police will:-

                       (a)    Provide officers at the Ground to enable them
                              to monitor and control spectators as follows

                                  (i)      One Police Constable will be positioned at
                                           each of the perimeter gates leading to the
                                           field of play numbered 1 to 11 inclusive,
                                           as shown on the attached plan of the
                                           Ground.

                                (ii)       One Police Inspector and two Police
                                           Sergeants will be positioned on the field
                                           of play at the following locations as
                                           shown on the attached plan:-

                                           Tunnel           -   Inspector
                                           popular Bank     -   Sergeant
                                           Grange Terrace   -   Sergeant


                                                                             Cont
                                 - 2 -


                       These officers will be responsible for
                       checking crowd conditions in those areas
                       for possible overcrowding or distress
                       throughout the period that those areas a^.e
                       occupied by spectators.      They will also be
                       authorised to decide whether or not to
                       allow spectators to pass through any of
                       the perimeter gates listed in 2(c) below
                       to relieve overcrowding. Each of these
                       officers will wear a y e l l o w tabard over

         (b)   Provide for each match a senior officer (to be ^

               of the policing operation in relation to each
               match and will (so far as possible) position
               himself in the Police Control Room at the Ground
               throughout the duration of a match.

               In particular:-
                 (i)   The decision whether or not to postpone
                       the kick off at any match shall be in the
                       sole discretion of the Senior Police ^
                       Officer and in exercising such discretion
                       the paramount consideration shall be the
                       safety of spectators present at the match.

                (ii)   The decision to close turnstiles when the

               recording the number of spectators^entering
               Ground and shall ensure that this information is
                accurate and is made known at regular intervals
                to nominated police officers who should ensure

                Control Room.

          (b)   Employ a sufficient number of stewards who shall
                be properly and fully trained in their duties by
                the Club. Such stewards shall be clearly
                identifiable as such and shall be directed and
                controlled by a chief steward and deputy chief
                steward who shall liaise with the Senior Police
                Officer at each match.  In particular, the Club

                as shown on the attached plan are kept fully open
                during any period whilst spectators are on
                the terraced areas concerned.

          (d)   Provide (and maintain in a good and workmanlike
                condition) an adequate public address system
                which can be controlled and over-ridden by the
                Senior Police Officer.

          (e)   Provide suitable and sufficient cutting equipment
                to enable enough perimeter fencing to be
                immediately removed to release numbers of
                spectators in the event of that being necessary.
                The Police will not themselves use such equipment
                but the decision whether to use it shall be
                within the absolute discretion of the Senior
                Police Officer.


    3.    These arrangements will apply to all matches held at
          the Ground under the auspices of the Football League,
          the Football Association and the Football Association
          of Wales and to such other matches as we may agree
          with you in writing.

          in any way the discretion of the Police to take such
          measures at the ’Ground as the Senior Police Officer
          or any other police officer may consider necessary to
          deal with the control of spectators, the prevention
          and detection of crime and the maintenance of
          public order.

     5.   Any variation or amendment of these arrangements shall

          the Club.

Dear

      I write further to the meeting of the Safety at Sports
Grounds Working Party in relation to the Cardiff Arms Park
which I attended on 9th October 1989.

      We discussed in particular the question of the fencing
which runs around the perimeter of the pitch at the National
Stadium and I made it known to the Working Party that the
police view is that this is a perimeter fence within the
meaning of recommendation 8 of the Interim Report of the
Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster
and that all the gates in the fence (where they lead on to
terraced areas) should remain open throughout the period there
are spectators on the relevant terraces.

      The view expressed by the representatives of the Fire
Service and the Local Authority was that 'to allow the gates to
remain open would create a danger in itself because of the
difference in level between the terraces and the pitch.

      The police view is that, notwithstanding these points,
because the fence is a perimeter fence the recommendation of
the Taylor Report should be implemented. The matter could be
further reviewed when the final report is published.




                                    continued/
                             - 2 -




      Nevertheless, on behalf of the police I have to accept
that the view which I expressed at the meeting was a minority
view and that the decision of the Working Party as a whole is
that the gates should remain closed. In acceding to this view
I must make it clear that the police will not accept any
responsibility for any consequences which may arise from that
decision.

                             Yours

                                                          11th October 1989


The Secretary,
Welsh Rugby Union,
Cardiff Arms Park,
Cardiff.


Dear Sir,

            Re: The National Stadium, Cardiff Arms Park

     Further to the Interim Report of the Enquiry by the Right
Honourable Lord justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Disaster
and the recent discussions which you have had with the police,
I now write to set out the arrangements in relation to rugby
football matches at the above Ground.

     1.     The Police will:-

            (a)      provide officers at the Ground to enable them
                     to monitor and control spectators. Their
                     objectives will bes-

                         (i)     To work in conjunction with the stewards
                                 of the Welsh Rugby union to ensure the
                                 control and safety of spectators within
                                 the Ground.

                       (ii)      To monitor the density of spectators on
                                 the terraces.

                     (iii)       To seal off the rear entrances to the
                                 terraces, when the capacity is about to be
                                 reached.

                       (iv)      To prevent spectators entering the Ground
                                 without tickets.

                         (v)     To be alert to the possibility of
                                 forgeries and identify same.
                (vi)    To be alert to the possibility of
                         spectators entering the Ground by means of
                         illegal payment to turnstile operators.

               (vii)    To prevent public disorder.


         In relation to officers positioned on the field of
         play they will be deployed as follows

         South Side     of East   Terrace: 3 officers
         North Side     of East   Terrace: 3 officers
         South Side     of west   Terrace: 3 officers
         North Side     of West   Terrace: 3 officers
         West Side     of North   Lower Stand: 1 officer
         East Side     of North   Lower Stand: 1 officer
         East Side     of South   Lower Stand: 1 officer
         West Side     of South   Lower Stand: 1 officer

         These officers will be responsible for checking crowd
         conditions in those areas for possible overcrowding or
         distress throughout the period that those areas are
         occupied by spectators. They will also be authorised
         to decide whether or not to allow spectators to pass
         through any of the gates in the perimeter fence of
         the Ground to relieve overcrowding. Each of these
         officers will wear a yellow tabard over his police
         uniform to identify him and will be in radio contact
         with the Police Control Room at the Ground either
         himself or via another police officer close at hand.

         (b)   provide for each match a senior officer (to be
               known as the "Senior Police Officer") who will be
               the Divisional Chief Superintendent or his
               nominated deputy. He will be in overall charge
               of the policing operation in relation to each
               match and will (so far as possible) position
               himself in the Police Control Room at the Ground
               throughout the duration of a match.

               In particular:-

                 (i)    The decision whether or not to postpone
                         the kick off at any match shall be in the
                         sole discretion of the Senior police
                         Officer and in exercising such discretion
                         the paramount consideration shall be the
                         safety of spectators present at the match.

                (ii)    The decision to close turnstiles when the
                        permitted capacities of the areas served
                        by them is about to be reached will be
                        made by the Senior Police Officer who will
                        ensure that his decision is communicated
                        to the turnstile operators and police
                        officers manning the main gates.


SOLABN
The Welsh Rugby Union will:-

(a)   Ensure that the only persons attending each match
      as spectators shall be those in possession of a
      valid ticket for such match and shall ensure that
      the ticket system will provide an adequate means
      of recording the numbers of persons attending
      each match.

(b)   Employ a sufficient number of stewards who shall
      be properly and fully trained in their duties by
      the welsh Rugby union. Such stewards shall be
      clearly identifiable as such and shall be
      directed and controlled by a chief steward who
      shall liaise with the Senior police Officer at
      each match,  in particular, the Welsh Rugby Union
      shall ensure that stewards are positioned at each
      of the following locations:-

         (i)   Main gates.
        (ii)   Turnstiles.
       (iii)   Approaches to turnstiles.
        (iv)   All internal gates.
         (v)   The concourses.
        (vi)   The vomitories leading to all terraces
               and seated areas.
       (vii)   The terraces.
      (viii)   The field of play.

      It shall be the duty of all stewards to monitor
      and to control spectators in their respective
      areas of the Ground and the responsibility for
      the distribution of spectators on terraced areas
      shall be that of stewards assigned to such duties
      by the Welsh Rugby union.

      in relation to stewards positioned on concourses
      and terraces they will:-

        (i)    Direct spectators to the area that their
               tickets indicate.

       (ii)    Supervise spectators through correct
               vomitories, as directed by their ticket.

      (iii)    Disperse spectators, in standing areas,
               throughout terraces in correct packing
               densities.

       (iv)    Take steps to reduce overcrowding or
               distress in any area, either by reducing
               the number of persons in that area by
               redistribution or by contacting police
                        officers who are authorised to release
                        spectators on to the pitch or concourse if
                        necessary.

                 (v)    Keep all vomitories clear of spectators.


               Furthermore, it shall be the duty of the
               supervisory stewards in their respective parts of
               the Ground to inform the Chief Steward as to when
               the capacities of those areas is about to be
               reached and the Chief Steward in turn shall pass
               this information to the Senior Police Officer.

         (c)   Provide (and maintain in a good and workmanlike
               condition) an adequate public address system
               which can be controlled and over-ridden by the
               Senior Police Officer.


    3.   These arrangements will apply to all matches held at
         the Ground save for those matches which may be
         excluded by agreement in writing between us.


    4.   None of these arrangements shall be taken as limiting
         in any way the discretion of the Police to take such
         measures at the Ground as the Senior Police Officer
         or any other police officer may consider necessary to
         deal with the control of spectators, the prevention
         and detection of crime and the maintenance of
         public order.


    5.   Any variation or amendment of these arrangements shall
         be in writing and signed on behalf of the Police and
         the Welsh Rugby union.


     in order to confirm your agreement to these arrangements,
I would be obliged if the attached copy of this letter could be
signed and dated and returned to me as soon as possible.

                          Yours faithfully,

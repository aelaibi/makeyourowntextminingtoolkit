THE POLICE THOUGHT' THAT DISASTER,               WAS FOOTBALL VIOLE.NCE, THEY DlDN' S’

REAL.ISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING,            AND PUT A LINE OF POLICEMAN ACROSS 1HE HALH WAY

LINE.     I THINK THEY THOUGHT THERE WAS GOING TO TROUBLE BETWEEN NOTTS FOREST

NOT ENOUGH MEDICAL ASE31S1ANCE, SiREICHERS ElC AVAILABLE.                  I WOULD ALSO L.J.KL

TO MAKE THE POINT,         THAT AS I LEFT THE GROUND WITH MY MATES,           I SAW A GROUP OF

POLICE OFFICERS STANDING AT THE TOP OF LEPPINGS LANE THERE WERE ABOUT FIVE OF

THEM.     I SAID TO ONE,        "CAN'T YOU HELP, THERE'S A DISASTER GOING ON IN THE

G R O U N D , ” AND HE R E P L I E D , " I 'M MADE UP 11.

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS,                BUT IT MEANS "I ’M G L A D ” .

I WAS ENRAGED AT WHAT HE S A I D , I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY             INSENSITIVE OF HIM TO SAY

THAT.     ONE OF HIS COLLEAGUES CAME OVER TO ME, AND SAID,               "I HEARD WHAT HE

S *     AND I'LL DEAL WITH IT, CAN YOU GET THESE PEOPLE A W A Y ” .            SO I WALKED OFF,

WITH THE GROUP I WAS WITH.               I'M NOT ABLE TO IDENTIFY THIS OFFICER       I ONLY SAW

HIS FIRST TWO NUMBERS]               HE SAID HE WAS FROM 20 MILES AWAY.         I DON'T WANT TO

TAKE THIS MATTER FURTHER,             I JUST FEEL HE WAS NOT VERY DIPLOMATIC,        IN WHAT HE

SAID,    AFTER THE DISASTER          BECAUSE THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE UPSET BY WHAT            Jjt

THEY HAD SEEN.

(SI7



 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR      IN THE DEATHS,     OR THE

I A N D    IN THE END I WAS THROWN OUT OF THE GROUND IN A VERY ROUGH MANNER

EVEN THOUGH I HAD EXPLAINED I WAS LOOKING FOR STUART 'THOMPSON WHO HAD GONE

MISSING,

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL. IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL   INQUIRY?

 I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE OTHER END OF 'THE GROUND WHICH WAS BIGGER AS

WE HAVE MORE SUPPORTERS ALSO THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE HAD BETTER COMMUNICATIONS

THE POLICE OR STEWARDS SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT THE CENTRE PENS WERE FULL WHEN

"j^p:Y OPENED THE GATE TO LET THE PEOPLE IN WHO WERE CRUSHED OUTSIDE

AND CLOSED OFF THE TUNNEL AND DIRECTED PEOPLE TO THE TWO END PENS WHERE

THERE WAS R O O M „

QT

 Q4V

       YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR

 IN    THE DEATHS OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 •1> THE LACK OF TURNSTILES LED TO THE BUILD UP OF FANS OUTSIDE THE GROUND.

 2)    THE LATERAL FENCES PREVENTED THE BUILD UP OF FANS SPREADING OUT    ACROSS

 TERRACING RELIEVING THE CRUSH IN THE CENTRE.

 3) THE KICK-OFF TIME WAS NOT DELAYED,      RESULTING IN THE FANS OUTSIDE THE GlROUND

 BEING IN A BLIND PANIC TO GET INTO THE GROUND TO SEE THE GAME.

 4) FILLING UP THE TERRACING FROM THE BACK       IS BOUND TO LEAD TO SURGES &

 PROBLEMS WITH CRUSHING.

    DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE                      WAY    THE

    INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D r AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

    THE POLICE WERE VERY SLOW             IN    REALISING THE EXTENT QF THE PROBLEM & REAC TING TO

    IT.     THERE WAS NO APPARENT ORGANISATION QF THE POLICE WITH INDIVIDUALS ACTING

    ON THEIR OWN INITIATIVE.             I THINK SOME OF THE POLICE TACTICS WERE TOTALLY

    INAPPROPRIATE.       I SAW POLICEMEN WITH DOGS COMING ONTO THE PITCH.                             I WOULD THINK

    THEY BELIEVED THAT THE CROWD WERE                  M ISBEHAVING.


    THE     OVERALL IMPRESSION       I   GOT    WAS   THAT   THERE   WAS    NO   INFORMATION BEING GIVEN TO

    I^IV ID U A L    POLICEMEN FROM       A    CENTRAL    CONTROL    PO IN T.

 Q52

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 <353

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR CJ&SgR VAT IONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D :

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY ORGANISATION AMONGST THE POLICE OR OTHER

PERSONNEL THERE.     EVERYONE WAS RUNNING AROUND LIKE HEADLESS CHICKENS WITHOUT
 «i    ...
ANY CO-ORDINATION OR DIRECTION.       A FEW WERE DOING THEIR BEST WITH WHAT WAS

T ® M a ND BUT THE R E S T , NOTABLY THE LARGE NUMBER OF POLICE WHO WERE DEPLOYED

ACROSS THE PITCH, JUST STOOD THERE SPECTATING RATHER THAN PARTICIPATING.

 I KNOW THERE WAS SOME JEERING FROM THE NOTTS FOREST FANS AT FIRST BECAUSE

THEY OBVIOUSLY THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION BUT AFTER THE INITIAL

JEERING IT ALL DIED DOWN BECAUSE THEY OBVIOUSLY REALISED WHAT WAS GOING ON.

THERE WAS NO DANGER OF THEM COMING ONTO THE PITCH AND I WAS HORRIFIED TO SEE

THOSE POLICE OFFICERS STANDING ACROSS THE PITCH DOING NOTHING.           THEY DIDN'T

EVEN REDEPLOY THEM TO ASSIST,     THEY REMAINED THERE UNTIL AFTER EVERYTHING WAS

OVER AND THEN THEY JUST HELPED TO TIDY UP BY MOVING OTHER OFFICERS HELMETS AND

P E K I N G UP THE ADVERTISING HOARDINGS THAT HAD BEEN USED AS MAKE-SHIFT

S T R E T CHERS.

 I FEEL THAT IF "TN£Y HAD BEEN REDEPLOYED TO ASSIST THE HANDFUL OF OFFICERS

WHO WERE ASSISTING T H E N ^ N S AT THE FENCE,               AVE TORN THE WHOLE
                                                 THEY COULD HAVE

 FENCE DOWN AND PEOPLES LIVESKj^OULB HAVE BEEN SAVED.

ALSO THE TANNOY SYSTEM WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE AT FIRST AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN

 USED TO GOOD EFFECT TO NOTIFY EVERYONE IN THE EARLY STAGES OF WHAT WAS

 GOING ON.

 ALSO THE LINE OF OFFICERS ACROSS THE PITCH WERE HAMPERING THE REMOVAL OF

 INJURED PERSONS OFF THE PITCH.      THEY COULD HAVE CLEARED AN ACCESS ROUTE

 ACROSS THE PITCH FOR AMBULANCES AND OTHER EMERGENCY SERVICES WHICH WOULD
                                                                             PAGE 10
      ^                                                                      Qb'LISS'1

HAVE ASSISTED.

THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SEEIMElTSjT) KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING WERE THE FIREMEN W HO

WORKED IN TEAMS OF 6 , WERE ORGffl^ISED\AND GOT ON WITH WHAT THEY HAD TO DO.

THE POLICE    INITIALLY SEEMED TO FOLL&W THE LEAD OF THE FANS RATHER THAN VISA

VERSA«

THE POLICE DOGS WERE! ALSO TOTALLY UNNECESSARY AND i WAS H0RR1F 1ED   lO StE   SHE

MANPOWER WASTED BY BRINGING THEM ONTO THE PITCH WITH THEIR DOGS RATHER THAN

DIRECTING THEM TO ASSIST THE INJURED PEOPLE.

034

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

Jf^CIAL   INQUIRY?

 I FEEL THAT EVERYONE WAS DELAYED EN ROUfSyJO THE GAME AND THERE SEEMED TO BI

A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARRIVING EN MASSE. THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN

ABOUT THE ROADWORKS AND MADE SUITABLE ARRANGEMENTS OR EVEN CHANGED THE VENUE

OF THE GAME OR ALTERED THE KICK-OFF TIME.     ALSO THE SjGNfe TO THE GROUND WERE

POOR OR NON EXISTENT AND THIS LED TO PEOPLE PANICKING ABOUT MISSING THE GAME.

THIS LED TO THE CRUSH OUTSIDE WITH EVERYONE TRYING TO GET IN AT THE SAME TIME.

ALSO THE POLICE BARRIERS IN THE STREETS SURROUNDING THE GROUND SEEMED TO

COMPACT EVERYONE TOGETHER RATHER THAN SORTING THEM OUT.

PITCH.          EVERYBODY APPEARED TO BE CONFUSED AND THERE SEEMED          TO BE NOBODY IN

CONTROL.          WHEN THE FIRE SERVICE A R R IV E D , THEY PLACED A MAN    ON THE STEPS BY       THE

POLICE CONTROL BOX AND HE SEEMED TO BE INFORMING HIS MEN WHERE THE TROUBLE

SPOTS WERE FROM HIS VANTAGE. POINT , IT SEEMED THEN 1HA f SOMETHING W Ay BEING

DONE INSTEAD OF JUST INDIVIDUAL EFFORTS.

q9
 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MANNED AND IF

NECESSARY THE GATE AT THE TUNNEL ENTRANCE SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED.

 I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SAY THAT BETTER FILTRATION OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES WOULD

 HAVE HELPED THE SITUATION.           I THINK THAT THE BARRIERS ON THE TERRACES WERE TOO

 LOW AND ALSO THEY SEEMED FLIMSY AND NOT STRONG ENOUGH EVEN TO HOLD A NORMAL

 CROWD.

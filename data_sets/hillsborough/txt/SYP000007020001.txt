to see        if we       had t ic k e t s a n d also                to see         if we       had any         beer.     During

the    j ou r n e y we all              had our        dinner i n c l u d i n g M A T H E R who                 I believe         ate

two    saus a g e       rolls.             We also      had 3 or 4              cans      of    lager      each,      exc e p t

D a v id MATHER.             At    the     police           point         we w ere         i n f o r m e d to   leave our         beer

in the        car and not              to take         it    into     the     ground.

We a r r i v e d       in S h e f f i e l d    s o m e t i m e a r o u n d m i d d a y a nd parked the                     car       in

a n e a r by     road.         We were        only     five          m in u t e s    walk       from the         ground.

A fter      parking the            car,       we d ec i d e d that              it was         too    early      to enter         the

football         ground an d so went                    into a bett i n g              sho p w h i c h was           only about

a m i n u te a way from the                   ground.           After       staying            in the b e t t i n g      s hop for

a bo u t    20 minutes            or    so,    we      then went          to the H i l l s b o r o u g h          ground.            We

all    had West S ta n d               ticket s        for    the t e r r a c e s         an d w h e n we a r r i v e d at

the    t u r n s ti le s at a bo u t           -1230 h r s there                were      no    crowd queues

wh a t s o e v e r .      At the        t ur ns t i l e s      I could see             that      there were a b o u t             10-

15 police          officers            s t a n di ng    together,           w i t h a f e w s t e wards              on the

other       side       of the      t u r n s tiles.          Be f o r e    entering            the    ground,        I was

s e a rc he d and our             tick e t s were            collected.              At     this      stage      I am able           to

say that         the      large        gates     next        to the        t ur ns t i l e s     w h i c h we     entered

 (Leppings L..N) were                  not open.             On e n t e r i n g      the       tur n s t i l e we all          headed

for     the     tunnel        d i re ct ly     infront          of        us.       A l t h o u g h we did not          see any

 other       signs       dir e c t i n g    us to any other                 standing            are a      I was     of the

 im p r e ss io n that          the     only     entry         point was            via the          tunnel.         A fter we

w a l k e d thro u g h the             tunnel,         w h i c h brought            us out        onto      the West Stand,

we     could see that               there were              only about           10 or so            people      in each        of

 the mi d d l e        pens.        I w ou l d also            say at        this      stage,         that      there were           not

m a ny     people       in the        other         pens       either™         Due    to all        the a v a i l a b l e

space,          we went        into Pe n 3 and                 lay on the         steps       in the       sun.

At a b o u t 2 pm             (1400)       - 2.15         pm    (1415)        the Wes t       S t a n d an d     in

particular             P e n 3 w h i c h we were                in,    started         to    fill     u p and     therefore

we had to s tand on our                       feet.            The    stadium         in general          was    starting          to

fill       at    this        time.      Up until           about       2.4 5     pm    (1445)       that a f t e r n o o n      I

w o u ld    say we were              quite     co m f o r t a b l e      in the        pen,     although         it s t a r t e d

to get          f ai r l y    packed.         It was           shortly after            this       time    that       things

s t a r t e d to become              uneasy.          We,       including David,                all    s tood     in a       line

a lo n g     one     of the        b a r r i er s    in Pen 3 .           I am        not    sure     exactly which             one

it was,          but    I believe            it was        in the m i d d l e          of    pen 3 and          second       from

the      back of the wall.                    At     this       stage     I could           say that D a v i d M A T H E R

was      on the        end of the            barrier w hi c h we were                   lined up on an d on my

right        facing          the   pitch.           The    reason why we               stood       infront       of    the

barrier,           is that         from      past e x p e r i e n c e we            understood         that      if there was

to be a surge                 in the       crowd,         we w o u l d    be     protected          from the          push    by

the      barrier.

When       the      players        came      out onto           the    p i t c h we had just              started       to    lose

our      positions            agai n s t     the     barrier and              I my s e l f    was about          two    people

down       front the          barrier.          1 can also             say that D a v i d M A T H E R was               infront

of me        (one      person)        an d to my           left.         He    lo o k e d as       if he was          being

 taken       by the          crowd and a l t h o u g h moving                  s l o w l y was      heading       for     the

 front       3.eft hand side            of    the     pen.           That was         the    last     1 saw of D a v i d

M A T H ER      a lthough          I d i d n ’t take any more                  notice        due    to my own

 d i s c o mf or t     caused        by the         crowd surge.               W h e n D a v i d MA T H E R was         infront

 of me,         I said        to him s o me thing               like     'Come        back MATHER * but               I d o n ’t

 believe          he heard me.               I could also              say that M A T H E R           d i d n ’t seem        in any

 pain and he was                   still     looking           towards        the     pitch.

 Although           I was       in vo lv ed     in all          the    crowd        surge,      I did not         see a n y b o d y

 die a r o un d me.                I was     pushed         near      to the        front of        the    t e r r a c e , just
                                                                                                                            P AGE
                                                                                                                            S606

infront          of the      last     bar,    bat     s o me ho w m a n a g e d       to wor k my way                 back       up

to the         top     of the    terrace,

I did not see a lot more                      h a p p en after          this       stage       but    there          was    a    lot

of   people          on the     pitch.        I s om e h o w m a n a g e d         to make          my wa y      to the          back

of the         terrace       a n d the n made my way out                     of    the    terraces             via    the

tunnel.           Whilst       I had been w a it in g at                the       rear    of    the       terraces          I had

seen       one    person       being     car ried          out from       the      front       of    the       t e r races

t hr o u g h     the    tunnel.        O ther        than this         the     tunnel       was      empty.           Once

outside          the    tunnel      on the t ur ns t i l e           side,        I saw a number                of    bod i e s

lying       on the gro u n d          be a t t e n d e d        to by the         services          and    other

s upporte rs.            I d o n ’t know        if these            casualties           had o c c u r r e d         in the

tunnel         a rea    itself.

A fter      this       I tried      to make my way up to the                         seating area               in the West

S ta n d    but was          unable    to do this               because      of the       number          of    people

coming         out.      I t h er ef or e      left        the g r o u n d and w a i t e d           outside          and met

u p w i t h my fjiends , except MATHER.

Throughout             the    incident       I never            saw any v i o l e n c e        used or          persons

d r i nking alcohol,             or any        criminal           offe n c e      take    place.           I w o u l d also

say that          I was       quite     a m a z ed    to    find out         the     seriousness               of the

incident          because       in my o pi ni on            it didn't          seem      to be that b a d ,

although          it was       o v e r crowded.            At    no time       did    I fear         for my          life       or

suffer         any d if fi c u l t y      in breathing.

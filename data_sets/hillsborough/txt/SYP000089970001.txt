           because         I have          been       before.              1 did         not      see    any       signs       directing          me

           where      to       go.

           My    s e at    in the           N o r t h S t a n d was              on      the      front       no w a b o u t     level       with       the

           People         were       still       climbing             over       the      front         fence       and also          the    side

          hoardings.               Some       of    them       had     t h e ir     shirts         over      their       heads         and     I knew

          tha^vthey were                 dead.

          t'hiar e .      I was         shouting          at    them.          The       three      of     us    got     on      to

          the    pitch       to     help.           We    carried an              empty        hoarding          down       to    the       other

         .think      he    had a         beard       but       he    had      stubble          on his        face.          He    had a.dark

          top and         b lu e    jeans.           I don't           think        he    had     shoes         on.      He w a s       already          on

          a board when              X helped             to    pick      him      up a l t h o u g h       1 had a l r e a d y          seen

          him when         he w a s       lying          on the        gr a s s .        The     board       b en t as we             carried          him

          away     from      the        goal       area where            we    t o ok     him      from,        I thought             that     the

          board might              b r e a k r out        it di d        not.

          a   drink       of w a t e r .           I wa s      saying         that       people         were     dead       out       there a nd         he

          just     talked          to me       and       c a l m e d me       down.           I had a        cut      on m y      hand

          probably         from         carrying          the       hoardings.                A first       aider        cleared            the    cut

          up.

          I went       b ac k      on    to    the       pitch and            t o o k my w a t c h         back       to m y      coat w h i c h

          was    when      I helped            carry          out    the      large       man      I have        described.             I did

          notice       that                                                                                                   Ibefore

              After      this      i was       just     walking           around aimlessly                not        knowing       what      I was

              doi ng .        I eventually            went       b a ck    to m y      seat    and       then event u a l l y            left      the

              g r o u n d at      about       1640    hrs.

              I got      back      to    the    coach and           the     other       3 arrived.              Everyone           on our

              c o a c h was       alright.

              The    coach        stopped       on    the    way        back     so we       c o u l d all       p h on e      home.

              I did      not      see a n y t h i n g      I consider            to    be a     criminal             offence.

 Poi-         I think         that      the    Police       d id    not     do      enough.         Obviously              when    they      first

                      in t h e i r       first       priority was              crowd       control.            But        I think       that     they

              could      h av e    helped       a    lot m o r e        than they          did.         They     could         obviously         see

              that    fans        were    giving        mouth       to m o u t h a n d        carrying          out        the    dead and

              injured.            Most    of    them       should         have      been     helping.

              There      should         have    been a n n o u ncements                about       what       was     happening.

              The    other        emergency          services           should        be a b l e    to    get        to    the    ground

              quicker.

              Liverpool           should       have     been       given       the     larger       Hop       en d    of    the    g r ou n d.

              The    Police        and FA       have       been argui ng              with    each       other        o v er     whos    decision

              it was      for      Liverpool          to    be     given       the     smaller          end    of     the      ground.         There

              should      be      someone       who     knows       about        football          to    decided           these    things         if

              there      was      then Liverpool             would         h av e     been    given       the        larger       end.

              At     the a bove m e n t i o n e d                  fixture       I was         d e p u t e d to work w i t h a serial

      C        the ground on the L e p p i n g s                          Lane     terraces.

               on their way                    into     the       ground.        The      conduct of the suppo r t e r s              in the
t/W
              m a i n was               good humoured,               the flow towards                 the turnstiles was             steady

               a n d seemed to                  cause        no     problems.            A p r o p o r t i o n of suppo r t e r s     searched

               did    in fact                 have    cans        of a l c o h o l i c    drink       in their    possession,          which

               they gave up on the                           t u rnstiles        with o u t       question.       Dut y on the

               to m o n i t o r           the L i v e r p o o l        supporters.               A position was         taken up       in the

               tunnel         at the            entrance           to Pe n 4.            The     pen was almost         full    at    this

               time,     although                there was             room to       let further suppo r t e r s           in as they

              arrived.                   Again       the st r e a m of s u p p o r t e r s            entering    the enc l o s u r e was

              steady.                   The    serial        as a whole          became aware            that    the    pen was      filling

               up and we then s t a r t e d                        to turn s u p p o r t e r s         away to find an a l t e r n a t i v e

               position                 in the ground.                The     numbers          were    so small     that   ente r e d that

                   we were able          to    control      them as such,         the advice was        t aken without

        k          question          by a large      p ercentage       of   the supporters.           The    conduct   of the

             S3MI FINAL 1988. LIVERPOOL V NOTTS F023ST




At the above mentioned fixture I was deputed to work with a serial that firstly
patrolled the leppings Lane turnstiles and then inside the ground on the
Leppings ^ane terraces.

Duties on turnstiles 1-16, Gate B, involved searching Liverpool ^ans on their way into the
ground. The conduct of the -supporters in the main was good humoured, the flow
towards the turnstiles was steady and seemed to cause no problems. A proportion
 of supporters seached did infact have cans of alcoholic drink in their
possession, which they gave up on the turnstiles without question. Duty on
the turnstile commenced at approx 12noon and at appro;: 3pR1 the serial was transferred
 inside the ground to moniter the Liverpool supporters. A position was taken up
in the tunnel bc£ at the entrance to pen     The tHrnstiissx pen v/as almost full
at this time, although there was room to let further suppamters in b h k s c o e e x
xxxxsx as they arrived. Again the stream of supporters enterring the enclosure
was steady. The serial as a whole became aware that the pen was filing up and
we "hen started to turn supportes away to find an alternative positon in the
ground. The numbers were so small that enterred that we were able to control
them as such, the advice v/as taken without question by a large percentage of
the supporters. The conduct of the fans during the game v/as very good however
at tines of excitement they did serge forward in large numbers, this did cause
concern but as far as T. ara aware did not 1 result in any injuries.

At the end of the game the serial as a whale then supervised the Liverpool
Supporters 12xit from the ground, this led us onto Leppings Lane where we
walked in anongst the crowd onto Halifax Rd, towards thier transport. Again
the crowd acted in an orderly manner and I am not aware of any Public Order
 situations arrising.

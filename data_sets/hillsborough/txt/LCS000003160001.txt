   Dear Editor,

        As Workers at the Hillsborough Advice Centre we read Mrs. Williams'
   letter and sympathise with her views. We felt we wanted to reply as
   not all she says reflects what is happening.

        The Hillsborough Centre became operational in August of this year.
   It was set up because the City Council and the Social Sei'vices Department
   recognised at a very early stage that there were a large number of people
   affected by the Disaster who needed help.

        The Staff at the Centre are aware that there have been a number
   of other tragedies and that people affected by such events do not always
   get a good service. However, Social Work Staff particularly in the hospitals
   do try and help those affected.

        We would want to emphasise that the work of the Centre is not
   exclusive and that we are already helping others. Such work and tragedies
   for whatever reasons do not attract the same amount of media attention
   and publicity.

        The staff at the Centre would welcome people to contact them
   either for help to hear of their work.

                                     Yours sincerely,




                              HILLSBOROUGH CENTRE STAFF

Dear Editor»

      1 was saddened to read that Mrs. S. Williams (letters, 8 November)
is ’’disgusted11 that Liverpool City Council is spending money on the
Hillsborough Centre, Mrs. Williams appears to misunderstand the role
which the Centre is playing®

     The Hillsborough disaster' did not only affect those families who
lost loved ones. Literally thousands of people in the city were affected
including those who were injured, others who saw what happened at close
hand, and relatives of people who suffered in many ways.

      The Hillsborough Centre offers specialist help to all of these
people. That does not mean that other people in the city who suffer
equally devastating individual tragedies cannot receive social work help.
The Social Services Department will offer that kind of help to anyone who
appi’oaches it.

     I am sure that everyone would agree that the Disaster Fund itself
should be used to give direct financial help to the families concerned
and should not be asked to pay for something like the Hillsborough Centre
which is appropriately funded by the City Council




                                     Yours sincerely,




                                     Councillor Dawn Booth,
                                     Chair, Social Services Committee.

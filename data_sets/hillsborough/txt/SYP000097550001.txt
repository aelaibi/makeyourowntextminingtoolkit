    CONFERENCE WITH SOLICITOR - MR. METCALFE - 10.45AM, 22.5.89



Present:

DCC Mr. Hayes

ACC Mr. Anderson

Mr. Metcalfe

DCI Brooke




Discussed the meeting of Friday 19-5.89 when Mr. Woodward addressed

the Chief Constable and other senior officers on matters relating

to the tribunal.   Particularly, reference was made to the type

of questions which could reasonably be anticipated with timing

of events or incident being an important consideration.




Communications were discussed and Mr. Metcalfe was informed that

the radio communications technician had diagnosed the radio prob­

lems as over-heating of the base pack; this had been rectified

by use of the reserve system.   The whole question of radio communi­

cations was to be examined in detail with expert advice from the

Home Office Telecommunications Officers.




The formation of queues outside of the turnstiles was then dis­

cussed and the deployment of mounted officers to assist in crowd

control was a key factor in that control.     Mr. HAYES asked Mr.

METCALFE if all of the mounted officers - South Yorkshire and

Merseyside - should be seen as a group.     Mr. METCALFE said that

he would consider this matter and speak further on the subject

later.
Appointments were arranged for 2.00pm, to enable Mr. METCALFE

to speak with ACC Mr. JACKSON, Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD,

Superintendent MURRAY, Superintendent MARSHALL and Superintendent

GREENWOOD.   (Mr. MARSHALL and Mr. GREENWOOD not available - on

leave)   All other officers warned.

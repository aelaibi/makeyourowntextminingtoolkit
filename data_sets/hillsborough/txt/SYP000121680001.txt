                Last year               I was on duty at the Semi-Final at, Hillsborough when

                Liverpool               played Nottingham Forest.                 At this game I was posted to

                work the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the ground where the

                Liverpool               fans were to enter            the ground.

                As far as my recollections of the day go I remember that the flow of

                fans to the ground was                      in an orderly manner up until around 2 . 3 0 pin

                (1430).                It was at this time that a large mass of supporters arrived

                at t he g round and s tar t ed to back up f roin the tur ns t i 1 es back ont o

                L e p p i n g s L a n e ..       T h is crow d b e ca m e b ig g e r a n d t h e q u & u © s m e r g e d i n t o

                one.        At one stage               pressure built up to such an extent that at one

                point a h o r se was needed to break the crowd up into sorne semfa 1ance of

                o rder.

                It was during this stage that                          pressure at the turnstiles was such

                that      I was          pressed up with my back against                      the wall of the ground and

               Ai/ w               f a b l e t o mo v e .   After    the   horse       had b r o k e n up t h e   crowd t h e

           '£>'p r e s s t i r /       s*uffisided and t h e    c rowd e n t e r e d    the   ground.

                As far as supporters trying to enter t h e                               ground without tickets              1 can

                remember 3 youths                    in their mid teens who tried to jump over the

                t u r iis t i 1e s «

                After the crowd had entered the ground I was direct e d/to the                                         c   en1 ra1

  pen at the Leppings Lane end and,          after   literally having to force my

 way into the crowd,        I became pinned up against the rear wall of the

  stand and unable to move.           1 then left the stand and spent the rest

  of the match at the back of the stand between the turnstiles and the

  tunnel   into the g r o u n d .

  Throughout the day 1 was accompanied by PC 2328 Hughes.

             F urther t o my report date d 5.6.89               <050689>   I would 1i k & t o ad d th e

              foilowing a m e n d m e n t s .

              1.            Up until the use of a horse to break up the crowd it

              appeared that a l l       that was happening was that the f a n s were pushing

              to get at any t u r n s t i l e .        The effect of the horse was to channel them

              so that they were heading                in a more    positive direction towards one or

              two turnstiles only.              This    in my opinion eased the crush consi d e r a h l y ,

              2.            I would say that the horse had the effect of easing the

              crush which,       I would say,          lasted a total    of around 5-10 minutes.

             3.             I have,     I must also add,           seen a short clip on national

              television showing the differences between 88 and 89 and,                      from that

              few seconds      I could see that the problems of 88 were nothing or

              nowhere as bad as, 89,

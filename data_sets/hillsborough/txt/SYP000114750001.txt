             fe ll ow     colleagues            about    the           crush of fans          outside.        I looked

             /through the            conc er ti na gate A and saw that                         there was

             tho us an ds       of fans         outside and a                lot was     being       crushed dig^inst

             the    turnstil es.               At one    stage           the fans       outside       star te d to

             rock      gate A from side                to side           in d es p er a ti o n to open the

             gates       that       the gates         sh ou ld be opened.                PS    1066 Higgins a s k e d

             twice       for    the      gate     to be op en ed and on the second o cc asion

             p e r mi s si o n was        given by Supt.                 Marshall       for    the gate       to be

             opened.           We    then formed         two           lines    one at    one side          of the

             gate and          the other          line o pp osite              making a funnel          line of

             officers          to stop a surge               into         the     ground. The        gate was        then

             gate was          e ve nt u al l y      opened and fans              came    in.        T ickets    could

             not    be    checked due             to the      vast        amount       of s upporters         entering

             the    cordon          I could see Liv er po ol                   fans spilling          out    of the

        by other           fans      into        the West Stand.             At    this       stage    I thought

        it was a pitch                 i nv as io n by L iv erpool               fans.        It was    then

        that       bodies         star te d to be ferr ie d across                    the      pitch by

        s upporters.               It was at this                time    looking at the           bodies

        being        ferr ie d that              there was a major               problem.        3 Liverpool

        fans were           s t r ug gl in g wit h a body                I grabbed hold           of a corner

        and    ran across              the       pitch wit h       it.     The     person on the             boarding

        was    o b v i o us l y dead.              The     body was       taken to the           rear of the

        g y m n a s i u m and        left.          I the n g ra b be d hold of a stretcher and

        went       back     to the         pitch.          In front       of the Kop           there was a

        do ct or      trying         to    r es us citate a male             person,          after as^htfrt

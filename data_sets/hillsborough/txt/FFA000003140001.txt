April 17th, 1989


Dear S i r ,

It was with h e a r t f e l t r e l i e f t h a t I saw my law abiding, fan a tic al Liverpool
supporting, 19 year old son a r r iv e home a short time ago.             This was a f t e r an
agonising th re e or four hours for myself and my w ife.            I grieve for those whose
loved ones did not come home.
I, th e re fo re , write to complain b i t t e r l y about the organisation and control of t h i s
match;
1.     i t was the wrong venue.

2.     even i f i t was the rig h t venue the t i c k e t a llo c a tio n was rid icu lu o us.

3.     my son t e l l s me t h a t th e police allowed people in to the ground who did not have
      t i c k e t s , in f a c t , one of his f r ie n d s , whose t i c k e t had been stolen in the post
      and hoped to buy one a t th e ground, was allowed in a t 2.50 p.m. by the police
      t o , “avoid trouble outside the ground".

4.    why was the gate which was opened or broken down not supervised when within a
      few minutes of the horror staKJng some 250 police o f f ic e r s were on the p itc h ,
      “to prevent fans g ettin g to each o th er”? Inevitably t h i s meant th a t Liverpool
      fans were having to care fo r t h e i r own injured and dead.

5.    my son t e l l s me t h a t people who were drunk were allowed in to the ground and I
      can only shudder a t t h e i r reactions in the panic s i t u a t i o n .

6.    a fireman who was on duty said to my son and his f r ie n d , “ Id o n 't            knowwho's in
      charge here, i t ' s a God awful mess".

The above words were scribbled on Saturday evening, sho rtly a f t e r my son arrived
home.
I have now had time to r e f l e c t and to stand with my son, his frie n d and countless
other grieving persons on the Kop. I, th e r e f o r e , w rite with g re a t sadness, much
b it te r n e s s and deep anger and commend to a l l who have anything to do with the
organisation o r control of t h i s match, Dr. Ashton's comments on te le v is io n
concerning re s p o n s ib ility and a cc o u n ta b ility and also the words of Simon Barnes in
“The Times" t h i s morning. This should not tfave been allowed to happen.

Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,


                                                                                                     L**

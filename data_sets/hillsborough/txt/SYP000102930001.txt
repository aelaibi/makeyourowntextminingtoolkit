  detective Constable 1917. Steven Alan COOK. Main Street Police Station* Rotjherham.




  I am a Detective Constable in the South Yorkshire Police presently stationed at
  Main Street Police Station, Rotherham,
  At 8.30am on Saturday 15th April 1989, I reported for duty in full police uniform
  at Main Street Police Station. Duties were given for policing the FA Cup semi-final
  football match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Football
  Ground Sheffield.
  I was on seria.1   38   which consisted of Detective Sergeant 182 TISSINGTON who was
  in charge of the serial and Police Constables 3HSH3UN, NIDS3IT, BUTLER, WILLIAMSON,
  and Detective Constables YAH30'.', HILL and DAY, All the officers I was working with
  were in uniform and were all from Main Street Police 'tation.
  ;.’e were transported to Hillsborough Football Ground where v/e were briefed by senior
  officers, we then went in our serials to our first phase which was before the football
  match.
^^/e walked to our points which, were on ,/ardsend Road off Halifax Hoad were our duties
  were to park up mini buses of fans which had come down from the motorway, I would
  say that the time, .would be around 11.00am.
  Je were there for some time before any mini buses started to arrive and when they did
  so they were in dribs and drabs and I would say that the majority of people in the
  mini buses v/ere young men from late teenagers to early twenties. They were liverpool
  supporters and     they v/ere in good spirits.
  The mini buses     v/ere parked up on the left hand side of the road half on the pavement   as
  v/e expected to    have to line iardsend Road on both sides. The supporters were in good
  burnout and I spoke with large numbers of them about the match and the prospects of their
  team.
  Our duties also included checking the mini buses and. vans for drink and also checking
Q jc h e tickets of the fans.
  The mini buses arrived, steadily throughout the morning and into the afternoon and
  in the early part of the afternoon v/e began to use a car park about half way up
   vardsend 3osd to fill that up. At this stage I would estimate that we had only parke'
  up around twenty vehicles or so. Some of the mini buses ’
                                                          were small type coached
  vehicles and these had -drivers who stayed with the vehicles. Again I talked to the
  driver of one vehicle who stated he would stay with the vehicle throughout the whole
  time.
   Then we started to parke the vehicles in the car park because of the snail nunbers
  a few private cars came into the car park and v/e allowed them to park there although
  strictly we v/ere told mini buses only. There v/ere arouad four cars at this stage
  mainly consisting of men with their sons, some of these stayed and had sandwiches
             ;y made their way to the ground.
                                                                                                                                                  if / '


    It wns now around two o clock and more nini buses began to arrive again nu.^- o. *-*e,..
    containing youths and youns men. The majority of these nad been d r m k m b ^nd o^ere
    v?er£ empty cans in the backs of the vehicles, the youths left the vehicles and just
    sauntered down towards the ground not appearing to oe in any rush. ,^c.in bec^Uoe of
    f!-P z m W number of mini buses private cars v/ere b e m " let tnrough to                                                        par.-c     eveu
    though this happened the car park only got full just oefore v/e left.
    Cur brief was to remain at /ardsend hoed until the kick off or shortly oe.ore --.nd t*ien
    -.e were to make our way towards Clayv/heels .uane to ..eal.
    V.'e all assembled around three o clock at the ned of .^rdsend i\oad and u0 oeth_r v.it.*
    Detective Sergeant TISSINSTOi; we made our way down Halifax Hoad. This was the first
    time that morning that I had been to that end because I was up at the top of ./ardsend
    Poad parking the vehicles up. There were still people running down the road towards
    the ground, only a few people on both sides of the road.
    Halifax Road all the way down was littered both sides with cans and oottles of
#   alcohol they were lines of cans and bottles on the walls outside the few house and
    shops on the road and also outside the t*o public houses at the bottoir. the Travellers

     and the 3ate.
     -<e made our way onto Claywheels Lane intending to go for our meal as we were on there
     we met up with other officers and I remember seeing our Detective Inspector CHA2L3S
     v*v. 0 V/-5.S in cl_B.r;~'c of ctn^r           on ^n.9 ."fc d.3 .^-•
     There was- -a radio message asking for officers to attend at Leppings Lane end of the

     ground.
      Je stopped '-here ye were and Inspector CHARLES asked over the radio if we were
     required to attend. There was a lot of traffic on the radio but we were asked to
     attend,we made our wsy do’-n to the area and we lined up in our aerials st the junction

     of 7 ere Hoad.

  the .vest Stand. More police officers came in and the crowds were pushed away and
  held back to give the officers working on xhe oodies more soo.ce.
  The tunnel mouth was still crowded with fans and Police Officers trying to get into
   the '.lest Stand. I then saw officers and fans coming out of the tunnel carrying bodies
   again these bodies were grey in colour and my thoughts immediately were that the
   bodies were dead.
^ T h e r e were shouts from inside the tunnel for more officers to help, I ran through
   the tunnel again having to push passed fans who by now were travelling bo*,n in and
   out of the stadium. It was total chaos in the tunnel and I remember seeing more bodies
   being brought out and was thinking that I couldn't beleive what was happening.
   Cnee inside the /est Stand area it was absolutely packed full of fans and police,
   there were seme police officers trying to clear a path tnrough tne fans and I could see
   both police officers and fans trying to pull down the barriers at th e front of the.

   •hoa   got bac* into the stand the fence had beer: pulled down and both police and fans
  had formed a chain and bodies were bein- pulled out of the crush and passed through
  and onto the paten. I assisted in this and would estimate that I handled around
  f-Lve or six bodies. I could not recognise the,-': because the prime concern m e to g.^t th^m
  °Uu as quickly as possible to an are- vUero they could "be treated which was on
  wie pitch, i'ans from the parapet above the stand were ripping hoardings off the wall
  to enable people to carry the bodies away on.
  j-Lere v/ere some violent scenes with fans fighting amongst themselves some trying
  to calm the others down.
  Sventually the bodies were cleared out of the ’.eat St-nd and I made my way onto the
  football pitch and rejoined Sergeant TI33IMC-TON and Constables YARROW and DAY.
  “e were stood facing the crowd at this time there were large numbers of police officers
  on the pitcn and tne Nottingham Forest fans had been chanting at the Liverpool fans,
^^.hey in turn were incensed and there were veroal exchanges.
  j.»i6 cxotaospuere was electric and all the bodies had been removed, I had the feeling
  i,nat ohe .Liverpool fans v/ere about to start attacking the police and they outnumbered
  the police greatly.

  xhe mood was somewhat calmed when tiie liverpool manager made an announcement over
  the tannoy.

  -.gc^in though there were two scenes of crime men who entered into the crowd and bes\an
  to oake pnotograpns one went into the Vest Stand where there was items of clothing
 and personal effects strewn all over. Some of the fans attacked these two men and
  they had to oe calmed down and the photographers were ted away by the police.
 Chief Superintendent N&S3IT was then on the pitch andhe was asking the Police officers
  co move the few supporters that v/ere still on the pitch away from the ground.
^iiais we did we just walked the length of the pitch and the fans seemed to disappear
" w a y without any trouble at all,
 it Wo.s some t,ime later that v/e were ail told to reassemble at the   stand where the
 oriefing had earlier taken place When \^e -were de briefed and I left the football
 ground and went off duty.

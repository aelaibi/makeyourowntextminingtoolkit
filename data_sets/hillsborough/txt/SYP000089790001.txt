I travailed               to    the       game w i t h        the       following            peoples~




                               Z
We     travelled           to S h e f f i e l d         in                                    private         car.




I c an't        remember             what       w a y we w e n t         to S h e f f i e l d ,        but    we    did       get       very

lost     to     start          with.            At    some     stage        we w e r e        following            Everton

supporters             w h o we re         travelling              to B i r m i n g h a m      for      the     othe r semi-final.

We m a d e      two       stops       on the w a y            to S h e f f i e l d ,         both      times       at    service

stations,            somewhere along                    the m o t o r w a y .            The      first       stop       t ha t     we m a d e

wa s    for     something             to    eat.             The    second          t im e    t ha t    we    stopped          was       to    try

and     get     a map          so    t h a t we       could        find     our      way      to S h e f f i e l d .           I do          not

remember          there         being       any       traffic           hold    ups      on the way.




We     eventually arrived                       in S h e f f i e l d at         s ome        time      between          one    o ’clock

and     one     thirty,             (1300)        and      (1330),        I c a n ’t be m o r e              exact       than       that.

We     parked        the       car    in a s i d e           street       off       a main        road.            I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r

the     na me     of      the       street,          but     it wa s      only a five minute                       walk       to    the

ground.              We    walked          straight           towards          the     ground,          hoping          to    find a          pub

th at    w as     open.              We    ha d      not     seen any          pubs      t h at     were      open       by    the       time

There         were    a     lot    of    other       supporters             in the ar ea,                they were           all       happy

told      us    to    either           drink       up or       leave       the     cans    behind.               We all           drank          up

Gary     CHURCH          had     come      from.             I remember         Gary       saying        something            like,

"What        are y o u      lot     doing          here” .




After        that     there       was      general           conversation            between        us all.              Somebody,

I c a n't       remember          w h o , had a sk ed G a r y was                 he    on his         own.         G ar y had

Because         he w a s        on his        own,     Gary       decided       to     stay with            us.         At    this

             I waited      outside         the      ground      for    the    others       for a b o u t       fifteen       or    twenty

            minutes.             We all       then walk ed         b a ck    to   the     car at a b o u t          five    to    four

            following        c 1othi ng




            Throughout           the    course       of   the     afternoon,           I did      not w i t n e s s     anything

            that     I would       consider          to   be a     criminal         offence,             I produce          the

            As a     re su l t    of m y      experiences          at H i l l s b o r o u g h     I s                   exlenslve

             I now    believe          that    I was      pinned       up ag a i n s t     the        crush    barrier       on the

                                                                                                                                            S3403

             sa m e    level    as     the     crush      barrier          th at    bro ke.              I realise          t h at     where      I

             was,      pinned       up a g a i n s t     the    r i gh t    hand     s id e     of       the    crush       barrier, I

             must      ha ve   been      only a few feet              away         from where             the     barrier

             collapsed.              However,          I was      not a w a r e      at      the     time,        t ha t    a    barrier        ha d

             broken.           I first         became      aware      that         a barrier             had    collapsed when                I was

             making my way             b ack    up the         ter r a c es    in the a f t e r m a t h            of      the       tragedy.




             I f e lt    that       in g e n e r a l ,    the w h o l e       thing       was      badly        organised,             both

             outside and            inside      the      ground.            There      should            have     been more            stewards

             on the      inside        of    the   ground        di r e c t i n g    people          to a ll       p a r ts      of    the

             terracing.              I also        thought        t ha t    the     game      should           h ave    been         delayed

             under      the    circumstances              as    it s h o u l d      h a ve    been        obvious          what       was    taking

             place      in si d e    the     pens.




             I had      known Gary CHURCH                 for a b o u t       eight       year       f         We w e n t       to    the    s am e

             school      together,                                                     ve/ p o o 1.             G a r y was          in the     year

             b e l o w me at        school.            1 played        football           with Gary most                   Sundays          during

             the      clos e   season.

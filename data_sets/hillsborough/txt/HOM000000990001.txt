arose.

On        the     day         of      this            event,             S a t u r d a y 15th             April                 1989,        togetherwith

                                   , we           left             our Pol yte chnic address                                        in S h e f f i e l d                at a b o u t

12.30pm.

We        caught        a     public              bus        from          our        residence                   into S h e f f i e l d C i t y C e n t r e ,

and        then       got         on a n o t h e r                 bus     in the            city,               to     the         g r o u n d at             Hillsborough*

Unknown                to us,              if we          had         stayed             on the           first           bus,          it w o u l d            have          taken

us        near         to the              ground            in a n y           case.

The        bus      drove          us to a p o i n t                       in M i d d l e w o o d R o a d ,                         next          to H i l l s b o r o u g h

We a l i g h t e d            from the                  bus         at     this          location,                    and        I believe                    the       time           was

about           1 . 15pm.

Together,               we        then walked along                               Catchbar                   Lane           crossroads                       and       into

Leppings             Lane,            arriving                     directly              outside                 the m a i n L e p p i ng s                        Lane

Whilst           walking                  f r o m ou r a l i g h t i n g                    point            to t h e            ground which                          is a

witnessed               numerous                  supporters                     drinking                 intoxicants                        (be e r a n d              lager)

from          glasses,              bottles                and        cans        up        to 2          litres                in v ol u m e ,               in the           street

We      had        already                    decided             that              we    would        not    pay a n y m o r e                than            fifteen          to

decided                to w a l k              around             the          ground           to see w h a t              other         tickets               were

entrance,                  was          still             about            the           same       numbers           in v o l u m e as              the        ten

minutes                previous.

We wa lke d                along               Leppings                Lane              in a n o r t h e r n          direction               towards               Herries

were          going              towards                 the      ground.

The         volume               of     supporters                     was           not       great,        but       it w a s       a      continual                flow,:';:

At      this       time,     which       I believe was              about       2.00pm,         about       three mounted

Police            Officers,        entered       through a heavy                   c r o w d of      supporters          who       had

gathered            around         the p l a y e r s    entrance.              I c o u l d see        that     immediately

behind            t h e m was      the L i v e r p o o l     team        coach.

The         Liverpool        players       and    staff           alighted         from    the       coach,       and    entered

the         ground.

 Immediately              after     the    players           entered         the    ground,          myself       and

 left        this     area and          continued walking                 b a ck    into P e n i s t o n e        R o a d.        On

 reaching            Penistone          Road,    the        Nottingham          team      c o a c h a r r i v e d at         the

 ground,           and-went        to    the    rear        of    the S o u t h     stand.

 We         continued       to w a l k    around with              our    objective, still, to .try a n d                         obtain

 a ticket.

 We w a l k e d       into      a side     road        at    the .South side              of    the    ground which                gave

 us     access        into P a r k s i d s      Road,        and     then      into C a t c h b a r L a n e .           At    a    C’Qint

attemotir;g            to    evade          Police          who    were       trying          to    eaten         him.      The       b o y was

eventually             caught          by P o l i c e        and       he was        put      into     an area           behind           the

S o u t h St a n d      but       out s i de          the    perimeter             of   t he       ground *

We    continued             along       Catchbar             Lane       to     its      junction with Leppings                            Lane.

On    reaching          t h is        location,             we    sat       d o w n on a       p erimeter wall                 to a        flower

bed    and       remained             there       for       about       fifteen minutes*

v-nilst w a i t i n g            at    this       point,          I witnessed              hundreds          of L i v e r p o o l

supoorters             walking          towards             the    grounds.             Although            they were               quite       well

behaved,          they were             rowdy,           chanting            football          s o ng s ,    and      the

majority          were       in       possession             of    some       sort       of    intoxicant,               and        they were

consuming          it as          they walked along                         the    street.

We    also       heard       a    lot       of    people          asking          for    tickets         and       t i c k e t .touts w e r e

being      pointed           out       to    different             ticket          seekers.

The    one       ticket          tout       was       asking           40    (forty        pounds)          for a s t a n d i n g

i.vni 1 st 'W 8          ood    by    the         riv er             and        he was           followed             by a s e c o n d y o u t h w h o

stated        t ha t     the                                                         had    tickets            to sell*

T o ’2 s t h e r w i t h                       I tried                to        see        this                                    but      he

disappeared              in the       crowd which                         by t h i s            time      had       started       to    increase

very     quickly,           which made                 it      difficult                    to w a l k         freely.

After      losing          this      youth            in the              crowd,            we     decided            to    go   finally         back      to

the    Lepoings            Lane      end      of       the           ground*                This       was a b o u t         2.30pm       to 2 . 3 5 p m *

Leppings          Lane.

Once     we       arrived       at    the m o u t h                  of      the          main     gate        at     the L e p p i n g s     Lane

entrance,           the     volume         of         people              in this               a r e a was         extremely          de n s e ,   to

such     a degree           that      it was            virtually                          impossible           to m o v e       of y o u r      ow n

Together           with i                      I stood                on th e               corner        of    the        bridge,      marked          <X>

minutes           just     observing              the        crowd.

During        this       period       of       time,            people                   were     entering            the    ground through

time      I witnessed             supporters                    climbing                    onto      the      to p    of the       turnstiles             '

  My     initial                  thought                to     the           gate         being              opened was                     that     the      supporters

  the          i n side.

The        supporters             started          to    strike          ou t   at     the    Officer          when they were

told         to m o v e     back        and       stop       pushing        forwards.              They      retaliated         by

punching             the     horses          body and             head and also              punching          the      Officer.

Although             I d i d n ’t see             the    Officer          draw        his    staff,         I di'-t in f a c t       see

The        atmosphere             at    this        time      was       obviously           getting         very     tense     with

 supporters               swearing           at     the m o u n t e d O f f i c e r          and     he     too w a s     shouting

 The        physical         confrontation                    took       place       for     about     30      seconds        but   the

 verbal            confrontation                  took       place       for    some minutes.

 After            this,     myself          and                     managed          to m o v e     towards        the     right       side

 of       the       crowd    next       to t he          river          fencing.

 At       this       time,       I   did      in f a c t          see    three        people       leaning against              this

  fence an d              they appeared                 to    be    in a d i s t r e s s e d        condition.

  One        of     the    people        was       a lady who             appeared           to    be h y s t e r i c a l ,    crying      and

  I h ea rd her             say       something              to    the    effect        ’s o m e o n e ’s g o i n g      to d i e      in’

  The            other    member        of    the       group       of    three,        was       a boy aged about              ten years

The        r e a s o n we                e n t e r e d was                because                 no-one          was           checking                 tick e t s,

although                   stewards and Police Officers                                                    were         obvserving                      the     people

come         in,         which             still            amounted                  to     thousands,                        in my view*

We        entered                through                 th e     gate          and         immediately walked towards                                               the t u n n e l

The        time          at        this         point,                was       b e t w e e n £ . 5 0 p m a n d S . 5 5 pm.

We        walked             into          the           tunnel           and         into            the       rear of P e n 3 w h i c h was                           to       th e

Although                  the            tunnel           was          full      of        p e o pl e ,          they moved                       continuously and

 I was            still             in        immediate                  contact             with                                    when        I entered Pen               3 and

 we       were         immediately                         pushed              towards                the       f r o n t of                   the Pen*

 We       never            actually                       stopped               from         the           time         we      entered                the P e n       untilwe V

 W h e n we            entered                 the Pen,                  we w e r e           continually moving                                     backwards           and              ;

 forwards                 and            I found                it v e r y        humid*

 P e o p l e a r o u n d me                      were            behaving              in a w a y                that            they            panicked,            became

  distraught                     and          some         were          pleading                 for        help.

 The        s i t u a t i o n was                        very         ch a o t i c ,       tense,              and        generally                     the     spectators

  were         panic             stricken                  du e        to      the         crush*

 Almost           at       the    same     time        I moved       my     upper      body        forward,         I felt         p e o p l e ;|

 when        this          happened           I felt     that       if    I was       to     fall       to    the   floor        I would

  be   unable              to    get     back    up,        I 'felt t h a t       I was       going          to die,       so -I

This    did     not     have       any       effect        and       I turned around                   and    tried       to   push

back    the     people        w i t h my          back     to    them        and      push       by    u s i n g ray legs        as     a

wedge     to    th e    floor          and     leant       backwards *

I was     in e f f e c t      pushing             against         the     people           and    the        barrier.

Although        1 r e ali s e n o w            it was         a sit uat ion               I could       not     help,        I felt         it

was    the     only     thing          I could        h a ve      done       at      the     time.

All    the     time     1 was          doing       this,         people         in g e n e r a l       were        in a d e s p e r a t e

situation         crying          ou t       in f r i g h t      and      panic>          for    assistance.

I believe         it was          at     t h is    time         I caused an               injury       to m y •back          which

amounted        to     slight          cuts       and abrasions                 to m y        lower      spine        area     of m y

back.         I believe           this        occurred when                I was          pushing        against         the    barrier.

Although         I believe              it f e l t     like m i n u t e s            pushing           the    people       back      it wa s

 probably        only about              fifteen           to    twenty         seconds,           at w h i c h       time     I felt

 helpess       because            I was        obviously          not      going           or g e t t i n g a n y w h e r e     w it h my

 actions.

 I stopped         pushing             and     I could          see       that       there was           s t il l     aslight gap           in

 front       of me,         and    the       boy who        was       forced         to t h e      f l o o r was s t i l l        t h er e .

 H e wa s      trying        desperately              to    grab          the       trouser        legs       of    people      by      him, .

 but    he a p p e a r e d        to    be     desperately                tired.

 When     I saw        the    boy        still       lying        th e r e ,        I then       leant        forward and tried

 to    grab     him     again,           but      unfortunately                 I    was p u s h e d         forward from behind

 which       c a u s e d me       to     go     in f r o n t      of      him.

  I can      remember         forcing             myself        to     the      r i g n t of the             boy     in o r d e r to

  avoid      trampling            on     him.        The        force     of        the     push f ro m b eh i nd            caused my

    Unfortunately                       the         supporters                   were          only       getting            out     very            slowly*

       floor,          may       I say         that        I believe              I was          eventually                          pushed                  past                the       boy :

       at a b o u t          the     same       time          that       Peter            Beardsley                  hit          the           crossbar,                          causing ;

       I can o n l y             assume         this          was     the      time,            due         to       the           fact            I could                       not       se e

       an y     of     the       p l a y at         this           time.

       I feel          a contributory                         factor       in the            number                 of      deaths                 and            injuries                    was

                                                                                                                                S2610

            caused    b y the s h s i               urns of        people      m     tns k s s t   Stand- -area and              the

            obviously        includes       myself.

            However        there was        no   apparent          checking         of   tickets       mad e *     If      it. h a d       of

            Keen    done,     then     perhaps          not    so m a n y     people     would     have      -gone into          the

            ground,

            I also     felt     that      the s t a r t       of   the      game    could have      been         d e l a y e d to

            assist     the    entry       of     spectators           in th e      ground.

            I also     feel     that      the l o u d s p e a k e r      should      have    been used           more

            effectively,          b e c a u s e to m y        knowledge,           people    did   not     know what            was

            going     on

            Finally        I felt     the    ambulances            should      have      gone    directly         to the        injured

            rather     than around           the    playing area.

                       MONDAY, 4th FEBRUARY, 1991

B           THE CORONER:     Good morning.       Mark Dickenson.

                      MARK ANDREW DICKENSON Sworn

                             By THE CORONER:

       You are Mark Andrew Dickenson? - A. Yes.

    0. Is it still                                - A. Yes.

    Q. That is                  Sheffield? -A.

       You are, amongst other things, an apprentice footballer?
       - A. Yes.

       Still doing it, are you? - A. Yes.

       On the 15th April, 1989 you were going to be one of the
D      ball boys? - A. Yes.

      Had you done that job before? - A. Yes.

       Did you usually take up the same position on the field? -
       A. Yes.

      You joined the club in 1988, so presumably that's when
      you started doing it? - A. Yes.

      Was one of the people you were with a Mr. Lysatt? - A.
      Yes.

      Another youngster who played football? -A. Yes.

      Did you take up position behind the Leppings Lane goal
      end? - A. Yes.

      Is that where you were located? - A. Yes,          I was sat
      between pens 4 and 5.

      Who were you sat with on this particular occasion, the
      15th of April, 1989? - A. David Lysatt.

      Was there a regular Police Officer who did a job at those
      gates? - A. Yes.

      You recognised him? - A. I think it is the same one who
      is always sat in that position.

                                                                      2
A
                                                      M. A. DICKENSON


    Q.   Where would he be sat on this occasion the 15th April,
         1989? - A. I think he was sat to the left, just right
         next to us.

B   Q. Were you sitting on the little wall, a ledge, chairs, or
       what? - A. We were sat in front of the gate way.

    Q.   Which gate was that, can you remember?    - A. There is a
         little part...

    Q.   Is it a very narrow... - A. Yes.

    Q.   Outside that gate? - A. Yes.

    Q.   We call that gate 5.   All three of you   were sat in that
         area? - A. Yes.

    0. I assume from what you say you don't know the name of the
       Police Officer, is that right? - A. No.

    0.   What time did you take up your position there? - A. About
         a minute before kick-off.
D
    Q. How did you get there?   Did you come out of the players'
       tunnel? - A. Yes, came out of the players' tunnel.

    Q. Which way did you walk round to the position? - A. We
       walked along the front of the South Stand and along
       Leppings Lane.

    Q. Along the South Stand and Leppings Lane.       Not past the
       Kop and... - A. No.

    Q.   Did you go with your friend? - A. Yes.

    Q.   You are sure about the way you walked, are you? -       A. Yes.

    Q.    I think I remember your friend said you went the other
         way.    That is why I am asking, but you are quite_
         certain? - A. I thought we went the other way.     1 am not
         quite sure.     It might have been the other way, I don't
         know, but we usually walk round that way because it is
         the shortest.

    Q. Presumably the players were already on the pitch getting
       ready for kick-off at that point? - A.  Yes.

    Q.    When you took up your position did you sit down straight
         away? - A. No, we stood up for a bit.

    Q.   Which way were you looking, field or terrace?    - A.    Both,
         really.




H
                                           M. A. DICKENSON


What did you see in the terraces?    This was just before
kick-off, is that right? - A. Yes.

What did you see? - A. It just looked like singing and
shouting and it looked perfectly all right, like it
usually is.

You didn't notice anything unusual? -A. No.

Which pen were you looking into can you remember? - A. We
were looking across to 3 and 4 and straight behind us -
5.

Was anybody in 5, as far you remember?   I am talking
about the narrow ones, so that we get it right. - A. No,
there was no-one in.

Was anybody in 6, which is the other side? - A. Yes,
quite a few, but it wasn't full.

At that point, just before kick-off, did you hear any
calls from that pen which alarmed you in any way? - A.
No.

Did you see - again just before kick-off - did you see
any of the gates open? - A. No, they were all closed.

I am talking about the little tiny gates in the... - A.
No, they were all closed.

The match kicked-off? - A. Yes.

Was your attention focused on the match or were you still
looking around? - A. Still looking around because that is
when some people started climbing over and they were
stood in front of us and we couldn't see.

I couldn't hear you. - A. They were stood in front of us
and around us so we weren't taking any notice of the
game.  We were looking to see what was going on.

Can you describe to me what you saw?   Before kick-off
you hadn't noticed anything, is that right? - A. Yes.

Match kick-off, you are sure you saw that? - A. Yes.

Then within what sort of period did you begin to notice
people around you? - A. It was one or two minutes.

Describe to be where they appeared from and what
happened? - A. Over the fences and from behind us because
we had to stand up, stand on the track, and we couldn't
see the game so we were looking round behind us and there
were still people coming over.
                                                              4

                                               M. A. DICKENSON


Q. At that point you looked behind you.   Were people coming
   out of the gate in front of which you had been sitting? -
   A. No, it was still shut.

Q. Did you see any of those gates - 4, 5, 6 or 7 - open? -
   A. I think it was 5, that opened at one point and then it
   was shut again.

Q. Is that the one which you said the pen wasn't that full?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see gate 4 open at any point? - A. No.    We
   couldn't see.   There were to many people.

Q. Apart from this Officer whom you have already mentioned,
   the regular shall we call him, did you see any other
   Officers around the fence or gates at about this time
   just as the match was kicking off? - A. Yes, there was
   one other,Officer sat at the side of the goal further
   along.

Q.   You mean by another gate? -A. Yes.

Q.   Was he sat or stood? - A. I can't remember.

Q.   Did you see any Officers near your gates?   In particular
     did you see any lady Officers? - A. I can't remember.

Q.   Did you see any Officer who had a very bald head? - A.
     No.   I don't know.   I can't remember.

Q. You don't recollect that either? - A. No.

Q. When did you begin to appreciate people were hurt, as
   opposed to being outside? -A. About six or seven minutes
   into the game.

Q. Was that when the game was still in play or had it
   finished? - A. It was still in play.

Q. Can you remember Beardsley hitting the crossbar? - A.
   Yes, I heard the Kop roar.

Q. Did you see it? -A. No.

Q. You just heard a big roar and you took it that that was
   it? - A. Yes.

Q. Was that when you realised things weren't quite right or
   was it after that? - A. It was just before.

Q. I think you and your friend then walked off towards the
   North Stand? - A. Yes.
                                            M. A. DICKENSON


I think you did help with some of the fans who were hurt,
subsequently? - A. Yes.

Just one more question.   Did you   see any of the fans
being taken from the centre pens,   be it 3 or 4, towards
the North West terrace pens, pens   5 and 6 and so on,
being taken in there, did you see   any of that?   You may
not have done. - A. No.

We will get you to mark the plan.   Can you show me where
you were sat?   (The witness marked the plan)

     MRS. PERKINS:   That will be C.428.

             Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

What other occasions are you comparing this with when
you say that just before kick-off it looked like
singing and shouting, nothing unusual? What other
occasions? - A. Every first team game that I have ball-
boyed on, sat there, and all the crowd looked always
the same as it usually was.  I didn't notice anything
different.

How long have you been doing that? - A. Since I joined
the club in '88.

You joined in *88 and this was spring       '89? - A. Yes.

So is that one season? - A.   Yes.

Had you been a ball boy all   during that     season? - A.
Yes.

At all home matches?   A. Yes.

Had this been your usual place? - A. Yes.

Let's just spend a moment on getting from the tunnel,
the players' tunnel, down to your duty position,
because you are obviously not quite sure how you got
there.  Now, there are two ways round the ground.  I am
not going to press you about which way because it is
clear, you have given both versions now - I am not
criticising you for it - so it was one way or the
other, but whichever way it was, as you walked to your
position you must have had in front of you a view of
the Leppings Lane terrace, and the people on it? - A.
Yes.

Now, the evidence, some of the evidence is that at
about that time when you arrived, just before kick-off,
it was very crowded indeed in pens 3 and 4, and very
uncomfortable, and more distressing than people have
experienced before.      This is just before the kick-off,
some of the evidence is like that.      Can you explain why
this was not obvious to you? - A. It just looked as
though it was normal to me, from what I saw.      I was not
exactly looking and taking a lot of notice because I
was more interested in looking on the pitch at what was
going o n w i t h the players, and so I didn't really take
much notice, but from what I saw when I glanced it just
looked as though it was like any other match.

You certainly did not see anybody in distress? - A. No.

Nothing gave you a hint of the disaster which was just
about to take place? - A. No.
                                          M. A. DICKENSON

You did not hear anything, anybody shouting out? - A.
No.

Calling out for help? - A. No.

There is some evidence that people were calling out for
help at that time, not far away from where you were.   I
am not criticising you - nobody will be criticising you
here at this Inquest, they just want your evidence.
Can you explain why it is that you could not hear that?
- A. No.  I wasn't taking any notice and all the, like
Forest fans were shouting, and tnen there was, sat in
the seats where the Liverpool fans were, they must have
been singing, so from what I heard, I didn't hear
anything.

Do you mean because of the other noise? - A. Yes.

We have heard the tape.   Thank you.

             Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Mr. Dickenson, when you said that you were more
interested in looking at the pitch, what did you mean
by that? - A. Well, looking at the players, noticing
who was playing and what they were doing.

Do I take it from that answer that you were not really
concerned with what was going on behind you? - A. No, I
wasn't looking.

Was it part of your job, had you been given any
responsibility for looking at, checking the state of
the crowd? - A. No.

Had you been given any responsibility for monitoring
the crowd for overcrowding or signs of distress? - A.
No.

Tell me this, pens 3 and 4 are the two centre pens? -
A. Yes.

And there is gate 5 you have described, and then there
is a pen to the right of gate 5, if you are looking at
gate 5, which is pen 6? - A. Yes.

You say you had a glance at the centre pens.  Did you
have a glance at pen 6 by any chance? - A. Yes.

What was the state of pen 6? - A. It didn't look as
full as what the centre two did.

Did it strike you as odd? - A. Not really no.
A                                                                8

                                                 M. A. DICKENSON

    Q. Can I show you a photograph, C326.

              MR. KING:   Sir, I have a very good photograph of
         that because it is ripped out from the Taylor Report.
B        I don t know whether the one on the bundle is like the
         one on the screen because that is a pretty awful
         photograph for looking at.

              THE CORONER:   It is a little bit better than the
         one^on the screen but it is not as good as yours.
         Let s use yours because it is easier for the witness to
         distinguish.

    Q.        MR. KING:   First of all, fir. Dickenson, if you
         look at that photograph you can see the electronic
         scoreboard, can't you? - A. Yes.

    o. Do you see that that photograph was taken apparently at
       about 14.59, just about 1-minute-to-3? - A. Yes.
    0. We know that the game kicked off at 14.59.30 seconds? -
       A. Yes.
D   0. So that photograph was taken either just before or just
       at kick-off, and you told us that up to kick-off you
       had not noticed anything particular about the pens
       behind you, that is right, isn't it? - A. Yes.
    0 . Look at that photograph.  Do you ever remember seeing a
        scene like that? - A. Not as full but the centre two
        pens always get fuller than the rest of them.

    Q. Do you remember seeing a scene as on that photograph? -
         A • No*

    Q- You don't, so you don't remember seeing people on the
         track at just about kick-off, or perhaps iust before? -
         A. Pardon?

    Q. You don't remember seeing people on the perimeter track
         just before kick-off or at kick-off? - A. No.

    Q- You don't remember seeing people climbing over at about
         that time? - A. No.

    Q- Have a look at the photograph and make sure you
         understand it.  Do you see the two centre pens in the
         middle of the photograph? - A. Yes.

    0. And to the right as you are looking at the photograph,
       that is pen 6 just beyond pen 5? - A. Yes.

    Q. You can see that that is pretty well half empty, on the
         photograph? - A. Yes.




H
                                           M. A. DICKENSON


Do you remember seeing it like that? - A. Yes.

You do.     You didn't find that odd yourself? - A. No.

So be it.     Thank you.

     MR. PAYNE:   I wonder if it might be possible to
get a better copy of that photograph?  The machine has
worked extremely well with other copying and this is
quite an important photograph.

     MR. KING:    Sir, I will donate from another copy
ofthe Taylor Report,   during the course of the morning
if   Ican, one from it if that is of any use.

      MR. PAYNE:   No, I have got one myself. It is the
Jury I am trying to help, and in particular for the
acetate.

      THE CORONER:   It might be worth putting the print
from the Taylor Report into the exhibit bundle, because
it saves swapping around, and maybe we will enquire
whether we could get this one photographically printed,
l.e will have a look and see whether we can.  It is an
important photograph, you are quite right.   Don't tear
any more Reports up though!

     Thank you very much indeed for being here this
morning, Mr. Dickenson.

    Q.   You were travelling by car? - A. Yes.

    Q.   You left I think at about noon, would that be
         correct? - A. Yes, that is correct.

    Q.   Did you come here in 1988, to the Semi Final? - A.
D        No.

    Q.   Having set off by car at noon what time did you
         actually get to the outskirts of Sheffield? - A.
         Around two o'clock.

    Q.   Then I think you popped into a pub for a drink? - A.
         That was slightly before, on the way.

    Q.   On the way? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Before you got the Sheffield? - A. Yes, that is
         right.

    Q.   How many miles from Sheffield was that about? - A.
         About 15, 10 or 15.

    Q.   What timedid you get to that place?     - A. It must
         have been aroundquarter past one.

    Q.   So you really did quite well, did you not, to get to
         that place in one and a quarter hours? - A. It took
         us longer than usual.

    Q.   You would expect to do it even faster? - A. Yes.

    Q.   I think it was called the Windsor Castle, was it not?
         - A. We passed that on the way down and it is
         actually called the Norfolk Arms.

    Q.   I am just trying to learn all the names, that is all.
         You stayed there for a little while, is that right? -
         A. Yes.

Then you came into Sheffield and you said you got
here at about two? - A. Yes.

I take it you then parked the car up somewhere? - A.
Yes, we parked on the outskirts.

Did you walk in or did you come by bus? - A. We
walked in.

What time did you arrive at the Leppings Lane
turnstiles? - A. Around quarter past two, twenty past
two.

I think when you arrived everything was in order at
the turnstiles? - A. Yes.

There were queues and you were able to get in quite
easily, is that right? - A. Yes. It was fairly busy
but there was no problem.

Busy but no problems? - A. No problems.

It would be right at that time that you also saw a
Police Officer more or less on each turnstile , is
that right? - A. Yes, more or less.

On the outside I mean? - A. On the outside.

Were you searched as a matter of interest? - A. No, I
don't think so.

Your friends? - A. My other friend actually didn't
have a ticket and so I went in on my own.
Pardon? - A. I was on my own.

They had left you? - A. Yes.

Having got in how did you get on to the terracing? -
A. Walked through the gates, went to the toilet on
the left before the tunnel and just walked straight
through the tunnel.

No difficulty through the tunnel? - A. It was fairly
but no real problems.

Which way did you go, left or right? - A. As I came
out of the tunnel I turned right.

What time would you say you got on to the terracing
itself? - A. Around half past two, twenty five to
three.
                                                   P. J. SMITH

Q. What was it like? - A. Full.

Q. Was it so full that you said, "I have got to go back.
   I am not staying here"? - A. It was fuller than
   usual, than I had expected it to be, but I was
   looking forward and having a good time.

Q. Sorry? - A. I was looking forward to the match and so
   I stayed there.

Q. At that time you felt it was fuller than usual? - A.
   Yes.

     MR. ISAACS:     I think he said, sir, "than I would
expect it to be".

Q.        THE CORONER:   Fuller than usual, fuller than
     what you had expected? - A. Yes.

Q. One of the things that drew your attention to this
   was because you were trying to read your programme? -
   A. Yes. I tried to but I couldn't.

Q. Why could you not, tell me? - A. Surges just forwards
   and backwards, too crowded. I just couldn't.

Q. So there was a bit of movement? - A. Yes.

Q. The atmosphere at that change was good or bad? - A.
   Good.

Q. People were happy? - A. Yes.

Q. At this stage did you notice anything on the pitch?
   Was anything happening on the pitch at this stage? -
   A. No.

Q. How     far downdid yougoby the way I forgot to ask
   you that question? - A. As I first went in Istood
   fairly near the back but as time went on, for a
   period of 10 or 15 minutes, I was pushed forward and
   I tried to move back but I couldn't because of the
   volume of people. So I was fairly near the front.

Q. Were you in an area where a beach ball was being
   knocked about? - A. Yes, I recall a beach ball.
Q. Pardon? - A.   I think so,yes.
Q. Youdo? - A.    Yes.

Q. You recollect the beach ball? - A. Yes.
                                                   P. J. SMITH

At that point where were you? Were you still at the
back or were you already in a position fairly near
the front? - A. Middle-ish.

So you were halfway and you were in the process of
moving forwards? - A. Yes.

How was it like at that point in time? - A. Very,
very full.

Are you an experienced football goer? - A. Yes.
You are? - A. Yes.

Do you usually go behind the goal? - A. More often
than not, yes.

Did you participate in knocking the beach ball
about?- A. No.

Not everybody got a touch,   so tospeak? -A. No.

Did you eventually come up   against abarrier? -    A.
Yes.

Was this after the beach ball incident or before? -
A. After.

I think you actually did not quite touch the barrier?
- A . No, I was against it.

Pardon? - A. I was against   it.

You were actually against it. When you first got to
the barrier can you remember whether the teams had
yet been announced? - A. Yes, I think so. It was
after that, yes.

I ought to have asked you whether you heard the teams
announced? - A. It was after that.

Pardon? - A. It was after that.

You did hear the teams being announced? - A. Yes.        I
couldn't see the pitch at that time though.

You heard the names being called? - A. Yes.

How long after the teams were announced did you get
on to the barrier? I do not mean on to the barrier
but against the barrier? - A. I couldn't actually
say.

                                                                 14
                                                        P. J. SMITH

    Q. Did you see the players come out on to the pitch? -
       A. No.

B   Q*   Did you see them on the pitch? - A. No, not really.

    Q. Does that mean you did not see the kick-off? - A. No.
       I heard the kick-off.

    Q. You mean you heard the big roar? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you see any play at all? - A. No.

    Q. None at all? - A. No.

    Q. Assuming for a minute that the roar you heard was the
       kick-off, were you against the barrier by then? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. I think you were left-ways on to the barrier? - A.
       Yes.

D   Q. So you were looking in which direction? - A. Towards
       the South Stand.

    Q. Describe to me then what happened with regard to the
       barrier as far as you can remember it? - A. I came up
       against it. I was vomiting and I was sideways on and
       the barrier seemed lower than it would have been.

    Q. It seemed lower? - A. It seemed lower because it was
       against my thigh. Normally it would have been
       higher. First of all, it slowly gave way and then it
       gave way altogether and just collapsed and everyone
       fell forward.

    Q. Sit forward would you? - A. Everyone just fell
       forward, a domino effect.

                               /Q. So what you are saying.
                                                P. J. SMITH

 So what you are saying is when you first came against
 the barrier, the thing you noticed was that it was
 touching your thigh? - A. Yes.

 Which surprised you because you had expected it to be
 higher than that? - A. Yes.

 Then are you saying it gave slowly? - A. Yes.

 Then it fell? - A. It just collapsed.

I think you said that you heard the roar of kick-off
after you came up against the barrier, is that right?
Have I remembered that correctly, or was it b e f o r e 7 -
A. It was during it, during this period.

So the roar of what you took to be      the kick-off was as
you touched the barrier? - A. Yes.

Was it already lower when you first touched it,or are
you unable to say that? - A. It is   hard to say. I
would say just as I came to the barrier, and not
whilst I was on it.

You have misunderstood me.  You have described three
things about the barrier.  One is that you noticed
that it was touching you on your thigh, which
surprised you? - A. Yes.

The second thing is that it gave? - A. Yes.

And the third thing that it collapsed,     that is right,
is it not? - A. Yes.

What I am trying to find out is when you first touched
it, when you first felt it, did it start up here and
move to your thigh, or was it on your thigh from the
word  g o ” as far as you were able to remember? - A. It
was on my thigh from the beginning, I think.

Right from the beginning? - A. Yes.

Tell me again when that was in relation to the roar? -
A. As I was on the barrier.

How long did it take - it is very difficult I know -
before you began to feel it move? - A. A minute. I
would say.

A minute you said? - A. Yes.

After that it broke, you said, or it fell? - A.
Collapsed.
                                            P. J. SMITH

 What was the interval there? Was it one continuous
 movement, or did it yield? - A. Slowly and then as it
 collapsed it collapsed just totally.

 Did you fall forward? - A. Yes.

 Did you notice other people fall forward? - A. Yes.

 Can you give an estimate of how many people might have
 gone forward? - A. 20, 30 because there were people in
 front as well.

In relation to that big roar, which you had heard,
which you took to be the kick-off, how many minutes
would you say it was by the time that barrier
collapsed? - A. A minute or two.

Not long? - A. No, not long.

In your statement y.ou thought it might be four of five
minutes after the kick-off.   I do not actually mind,
but thinking about it which do you think is more
accurate, one or two minutes, or four or five? — A.
Possibly four.

You think it might have been a bit longer than what
you have told me, yes, because you weren't looking at
your watch? - A. No.

You did not see anything on the field? - A. No.

Did you hear a further loud roar after the kick-off7 -
A. No.

You did not? - A. No.

At some point or other you heard people calling out
and screaming and they were in obvious pain, that is
right, is it not? - A. Yes.

Was that after the barrier had collapsed or before7 -
A. Before.

Was it when you approached the barrier or when you
were on the barrier? - A. It was way before.  It was
around quarter-to 3 that people were starting to get
in difficulties.

Are you saying that it was at the time when the beach
ball was being knocked about? - A. Just after that.

Are you saying it was before or after the announcement
of the teams? - A. Before.
                                               P . J . SMITH

 Where were you at that position, not on this barrier7
 “ A. No, to the right.

 Tell me how far you were from the front fence at that
 point? - A. About 15 foot.

Could you see a little gate in the front? - A. No.

At what point did you see people on the pitch? - A. I
remember seeing people climbing over the fence, about
5-to 3, people climbing over the fence.

Be careful with times because you did not have a watch
and you did not see what was going on on the pitch,
and I do not want you to say something which you
cannot substantiate.  How do you know it was 5-to 3? -
A. It was before the team names were called out.

Before the team names were called out you say     you saw
people climb over the    front fence? -A. Yes.

At this time, let us take it at 5-to 3 for the sake of
the argument, how many people were going over? Were
there people on the pitch at that time? - A. I would
say so.

Do you know how many?    Obviously not how many in the
sense of exactly, but   was it ones or twos, or was it a
substantial crowd? - A. I would say two dozen, three
dozen.

Did you see any cross or get onto the pitch after you
came onto the barrier? - A. I am sorry, sir?

Did you see people on the pitch, or an increased
number on the pitch, after you first came onto the
barrier? - A. Yes.

What did you see? - A. Just people climbing over the
fence, people trying to rip the gates open and just a
mass of people really.

I thought you said you had not seen the gate? - A.
There were gates, wire fencing, all along and people
were trying to rip it open to get out.

I see.  People were pulling on the fencing is what you
are saying? - A. Yes.

But you did   not see any specific gates? -   A. No.

Did you see   the fencing being pulled open at all? - A.
Not so that   people could get out, but it was being
ripped.
                                                                  18

                                                      P. J. SMITH

     Q.    You saw that happening? - A. Yes.

B    Q.        they succeed, that is what I am trying to say? -
           A. Of getting people out.

           No, of ripping the fencing open? - A. I don't think
           so.

     Q.    You did not see that? - A. No.

     Q.   You were obviously in a very dreadful state, and so
          were the people immediately around you, but
          fortunately in due course you were rescued.  How did
          you get rescued? - A. Someone just dragged me out by
          my hair and my shoulder, just pulled me out.

          Fortunately.  Go and show us on a plan where you were
          when you were in the beach ball area, if I can put it
          like that, and where you say you heard the people
          screaming before you got onto the barrier. Mark that
D         with a '1' and then show me where you were on the
          barrier. (Witness marks plan )

               MRS. PERKINS:   C429.

               THE CORONER:  Which side of that barrier were
          you, the top side or the pitch side? - A. Top side.

    Q.    The first one I am talking about? - A. Just below.

    Q.    So you had got underneath it? - A. Yes.

    Q.    So it was behind you? - A. Yes.

    Q.    You do not know, I suppose, how you got from position
          1 to position 2? - A. Just with the movement from the
          crowd.

                     Cross-Examined by MR. KI N G :

    Q.    Can I just check with you, Mr. Smith, that I have your
          observations correct in terms of sequence of events.
          You say you got into Pen 3 at about half-past 2,
          something like that? - A. Yes.

    Q.    At that time you regarded it as fuller than usual, or
          perhaps what you expected for a semi-final?  What did
          you mean by that answer, I am interested? - A. I
          considered it fuller than usual.  It was more crowded
          than it would be normally.

    Q.    At the time you remember seeing the beach ball, your
          observation was, and my note was, that it was very,
          very full at that stage? - A. Yes.

H
                                                                 19

                                                        P. J. SMITH

     Q.   The impression might be gained that because a beach
          ball was being knocked about people had plenty of room
B         to work in and play in.  Was that right? - A. No, not
          really no.

     Q.   Tell us,    when that beach ball was being knocked about,
          how much    room was there between you and the next man?
          How close   were you to the next man?   .... That is a
          wonderful   description.   I wish I could put it on the
          shorthand   note. - A. Shoulder to shoulder.

    Q.    For the shorthand note, I think you pulled yourself
          up, pulled your shoulders together almost to your body
          tight, is that right? - A. Yes.

    Q.    That is at the time when the beach ball was happening?
          - A. What was happening, there were surges in the
          crowd, so you were getting pushed down, and I was
          trying to work my way back up, but the volume of
          people, you couldn't move back up.
D
    Q.    We know what time the teams were announced and we
          actually   know that. We know that the Liverpool team,
          which was   the first team to be announced, was
          announced at 14.51.07, so that is just about 9 minutes
          to 3. - A. Yes.

    Q.    You told us that before that time, just before that
          time, you observed and were conscious of people
          calling out, obviously in some sort of distress? - A.
          Yes.

    Q.    Around you? - A. Yes.

    Q.    Then you give your description thereafter.  So it
          follows from that that the people around you were in
          distress before 9 minutes to 3? - A. Yes.

                      Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN;

          Mr. Smith, you did say that you did not have a watch
          on, did you not? - A. I did have a watch on but I
          didn't check the time.

    Q.    You did not check the time? - A. No.

    Q.    So although your account is a very, very good account
          of the events, just the odd minute could be out, could
          it not? - A. Quite easily, yes.

that b P h i i J w posit*o n » the overhang of the stand, was
that behind you or m front of you still? - A. How do
you mean, the second tier?

Yes. - A. It was behind me.

Did you notice whether people were going up into the
stands at that time? - A.. Not at that pSint, no.

They were not going, or you did not see them? - A. I
didn't see them.

Of course,   it was behind you, was it not? - A. Yes.

One last question.  I think you said, quite rightly,
that you were carried forward and you wanted to ®o
back and you could not? - A. Yes, I tried to get°my
old position back.                                 y

Are you meaning that you could not go back at all, or
that you could not retrieve the whole of the lost
ground?  Can you understand what I am asking you? - A.
Yes.  First of all, I lost my shoes, and I tried to
push my way back up but I just couldn't.  I just
couldn't go back.                           J

    Q. Did you retrieve your shoe? - A. No, somebody passed it
       to me.

    Q. That was when you were moving from 1 to 2, somebody
B      passed the shoe to you but you couldn't get it back on?
       I think you had to hold it? - A. Yes, that's right.

                     Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

    o. Can I ask a question?   It may have to be two or three!
       Mr. Smith, did you go in 1988? - A. To the semi-final?

       Yes.   It was just when you said to Mr. King and, indeed,
       to the Coroner, that it was more crowded than usual, did
       you mean "usual" at Hillsborough or "usual" at Anfield or
        usual" for cup semi-finals? - A. Usual than any match.

       But you hadn't been to the semi-final the year before? -
       A. No, but I have been to a lot of other matches and
       stood up all the time.

    Q- I appreciate that.    A lot of league matches? - A. And
D      cup matches.

    Q. A cup semi-final at Hillsborough? - A. Not at
       Hillsborough.

    0. So you hadn't been on the Leppings Lane end before? - A.
       No.

                  Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

       I just wanted to clarify that last answer.       You have
       been to semi-finals? - A. Yes.

    Q. You have   been to full houses? - A. Yes.

    Q. You have   been to full capacity grounds? - A.   Yes.

    Q. You have   been to league matches? - A. Yes.

    Q. You follow Liverpool? - A. Yes.

    Q. Does Liverpool more often than not when they have a game
       have a full capacity game? - A. More often than not.

    Q. So you have experience of full capacity crowds? - A. Yes.
    o. It is on that basis you have been giving your evidence
       today? - A. Yes.

    Q. Of                                          Cheshire? - A.
       Yes^

       You, amongst other things, had a friend called Eric
       Hughes? - A. That is correct.

    Q< Unfortunately he lost his life? - A. Yes.

    Q. Is the Hughes family here? - A. No.

    Q. I think you and Eric decided to come to the match on      the
       15th of April, 1989? - A. That is correct.

    Q. You were coming by car? - A.   Yes.

    Q. In fact there were more than you? - A. Yes, there were
D      seven in all.   There were two vehicles used.

    Q- I assume you all had tickets? - A. Yes.
    0. Did you come to the 1988 semi-final as well? - A. Yes, I
       did.

    0. Were you on the terraces that year? - A. No, we were in
       the North Stand.   Having said that, Eric was still on
       the terrace that year, but I went in the North Stand.

      Did he recount anything to you about 1988 that you can
      remember? - A. Yes.   One thing that stood out in my
      mind.   He went with another friend on the terrace who
      was an Evertonian incidentally, and this lad was a bit
      frightened of crowds.  Eric was all right because he was
      quite used to it.   He had stood on the Kop for years.
      He was telling me afterwards that they had to move away
      from the tunnel area because it was crowded then in 1988
      and it was very frightening at one stage.

    Q. Eric didn't tell you what time he entered in 1988? -A.
       No.

    Q. But he did give   you to understand it had been   a   bit scary
       that year? - A.   Yes.

    Q. He was OK.   It was his friend... - A. He got a bit
       nervous and moved nearer to the tunnel, away from the
       centre.

Let's move to 1989 because that is what you know about.
You left home at about 11.00 am? - A. That's correct.

You stopped at Huddersfield? - A. Yes, we stopped for
toilets more than anything else, but we had a glass of
shandy at this pub.   I can't remember the name.

Yes, in Huddersfield? - A. Yes.

Quite a way   from Sheffield, about another three-quarters
of an hour?   - A. I would say so.

Then you made your way on towards Sheffield and parked
somewhere? - A. That's right.

Do you know  what time you parked   - approximately? - A. I
would say in the region of about    2.15.

Did you go straight to Leppings Lane from there? - A.
Yes, we did.

Can you recollect what time you got to Leppings Lane? -
A. Approximately 2.25.

What was it like at Leppings Lane at 2.25, as far as you
were concerned? - A. It was very disorganised, very
crowded.   I had experienced a similar thing at Derby
County's ground.   It was a bit frightening on that
night.   I wasn't with Eric that time but I remember
thinking, "Never again."   When I saw the crowd at
Leppings Lane turnstiles, even though I was with Eric, we
made our way in but I got a bit concerned.   I was split
up from Eric in that initial queue and I pulled away from
the crowd and forced my way back around and away from the
crush.   I thought to myself, "I don't care how long it
takes me to get in, I'll wait until this crowd clears."

Do you mean you came right out again? - A. I came away
from the turnstiles and made my way around the side by
where that little river is and thought, "I'll have a
cigarette and just wait."

Sergeant Griffiths, could you just show the roadway.
There is a model behind you.   Is  thatthe area where     you
went? - A. That's correct.

You took shelter there, so to speak? -A. I did.

There is a big concertina gate.    Just show the
concertina gate. - A. I stood right by that gate, maybe
three yards from that gate.

Nearer the river? - A. That's correct.
                                               S. W. MULLIN


You saw a number of mounted Officers in that area?    Not
in the area where you were standing but in the area near
the perimeter gates? - A. Where the crush was.   Yes,
there were two or three mounted...

Was Eric with you or had he stayed in the... - A. As I
say, we got split up on the approach to the turnstiles.
Eric was maybe three or four yards ahead of me.   I tried
to let him know I was going to hang back but he couldn't
hear me shouting.   I just assumed he would be OK and I
would catch up with him inside.

That means it was pretty noisy, I take it, outside that
area? - A. Yes, it was.   There were people screaming and
shouting.

You had had a bad experience from what you say in Derby?
- A. Yes.

And you weren't going to have that again at any price? -
A. That's right.

You then entered through the big concertina gate? - A.
That's right.

The one you were standing opposite? - A. That's right.

Do you remember how often it opened?      Had it opened and
shut and then re-opened or do you not recollect? - A. I
vaguely remember it opened about a foot or two.      Whether
it was to let somebody in or or, a bobby or a steward, I
wasn't certain.      Then it closed.Then maybe a minute
later it opened fully.    There was a steward there and
two bobbies.    They weren't checking tickets and with me
being very near to the gate there was no crush there and
I just walked in - literally walked in.

Having got in in   fact you found Eric on the inside? - A.
That's correct.    Eric was standing with his back to where
I was, looking towards the turnstiles from the inside.

He was looking for you to come through presumably? - A.
Yes.

When you were inside you could see Eric standing, looking
towards the turnstiles and you mentioned you saw two
Police Officers and a steward near the gate which opened.
Did you see any other Officers as a matter of interest? -
A. No.

Not that you recollect? -A. No.

You and he then went off to the toilets? - A. That is
correct.
                                              S. W. MULLIN


You then entered via the tunnel? - A. Yes.

You hadn't been to this part of the ground before? - A.
That is correct.

You could see the sign.   Was   that what induced you to go
down the tunnel?   Was it the   sign or was it the number
of people going down, or are you unable to say now? - A.
It was the only entrance on to the terracing that I could
see.

You weren't intending to stand behind the goal, were you?
- A. No.   It is something Eric and I never practised due
to previous experiences.   We always stood to one side.

You preferred to be in the corners? - A. That is correct.

Having entered the tunnel - when you first enter the
tunnel we know it is possible to see the pitch. -A. Yes.

Did you see it by any chance?   - A. I don't think so
because there was a wall of people at the end of the
tunnel on to the terracing.   I remember saying to Eric,
"We have got to get over to the right hand side", to
stand where we would normally stand in the Kop.    It was
our favourite spec and I don't remember looking on to the
pitch at all.

From you have said the exit to the tunnel appeared to you
to be blocked? - A. Yes.

By people.  The rest of the tunnel, was that relatively
clear or not? - A. Yes, it was.

You were able to make progress up to what you have
described as a wall of people? - A. Correct.

How deep into the tunnel did this wall stretch, could you
say? - A. It didn't stretch into the tunnel.   It was
flush with the end of the tunnel.

You had already said to him you had got to go to the
right? -A. Yes.

When you got to the exit, did you have any difficulty
getting through these people? - A. Initially we had to
jostle our way through but once you got past the initial
crowd of people we were just in like a normal crowd, able
to push - not so much move easily but push ourselves into
a further position forward.

What you are saying is that in your experience you had a
bit of a job getting through those people at the exit,
but once you were through it appeared to you at that
                                             S. W. MULLIN


stage that this was a normal crowd? - A. Slightly more
than normal.   It crossed my mind, thinking, "My word,
there is more in here than anticipated."

Do you know what was happening on the pitch at that
point? - A. Yes, I remember vividly because I was looking
at the players as they were kicking in, before the kick-
off, and Alan Hanson, the centre half, he hadn't played
for several months beforehand.   I said to Eric, "Hanson
is playing."

So the players were there and you were able to pick
Hanson out because it was an interesting event, so to
speak? - A. That's correct.

Tell me what happened after that?    You are on the
terracing.   You had moved a little way in and you were
over towards the right? - A. Very slightly towards the
right.   It was at that point - I think Eric was stood to
my left, slightly behind, and I turned to him and I
motioned with my arms and shouted, "We have got to get
over there."   He acknowledged that.    It was roundabout
then there was a terrific surge from behind that pushed
me maybe ten or fifteen yards forward.    At one stage I
saw a young kid with his back on a barrier with his back
to the pitch and he was screaming.    He was in agony.
He was getting pushed over backwards.    Then it really
struck me then there was something wrong.    I couldn't
even turn round to see Eric at that stage.    I just had
to concentrate on keeping my feet as I was being pushed
forward.   That surge took me to within two or three feet
of the perimeter fence and I was actually squashing a
young kid in front of me against the wall.




               Q. At the perimeter fence
                                           S. W. HULLIN

At the perimeter fence? - A. Yes, and I think he, from
what I could make out of him, I was trying to stop
myself being pressed on him, but he was facing with his
back to the pitch but his legs seemed to be facing the
pitch.  Do you understand?

Yes, I understand what you mean. - A. I was trying to
help him with my legs to turn round, and that was when
we started shouting, people all around me were shouting
at the Police to open the gate.

Can you tell me, we know the players were on the pitch
because you have already told us that. - A. Yes.

Do you recollect whether kick-off had yet taken place,
or do you not know? - A. I don't know because at that
stage I was more concerned in my own safety.

Of course.  You say at that stage you and others were
beginning to shout to the Police? - A. That is right.

How many Officers can you remember seeing at that
stage? - A. Initially I remember seeing a Policewoman
at that gate and we were all shouting to her, and she
was looking round as if to ask advice from somebody.
Then a Police Constable came up, I don't know what rank
he was or anything, but he approached and when he saw
this young kid screaming in front of me, and we were
saying, "Get the kids out", either he or the
Policewoman, I can't recollect now, opened the gate and
started trying to pull the kid, but the young kid's
legs, I was trapping the young kid's legs against the
wa 11.

This is the very child that you have just mentioned? -
A. Yes.  He was struggling to get out, he was crying
and screaming.  As the bobby and the Policewoman were
pulling him out, and as he eventually wriggled free, I
half fell out onto the running track and with the aid
of my left hand on the gate pulled myself, the rest of
myself out of the enclosure.

So you were actually very close to this gate with this
child? - A. Yes, I was.

I will come back to the inside in a moment, but once
you got out can you remember whether the game was still
in play or not? - A. I think it was in play at that
stage.

So what you are saying is that you got out before the
match finished, you yourself? - A. Yes.
                                           S. W. MULLIN


We have heard from other witnesses that the gate burst
open, wasn't opened by Police Officers, and that
several people went out, were put back in, it opened
again and then they went out.  Can you remember
anything like that, as far as you can recollect? - A.
No.

You don't remember? - A. Ho, sir.

Your recollection is that it was an Officer who opened
the gate? - A. An Officer and either/or a Policewoman.
There were two there, definitely.

Yes, when I said Officer I meant of either sex, but in
fact that was my next question, you can't say whether
it was a lady or gentleman? - A. Who actually opened
it?

Yes. - A. I can't say.

I don't want a detailed description of the lady but I
am just interested to know whether you noticed anything
about her, because there were fewer Policewomen than
men. - A. Yes, I understand.  No specific details, no,
sir, just the uniform and a lady in it.

You can't say anything about her hair or anything like
that? - A. No, sir.

If you can't, don't.  Having come out did this
Policeman or woman ask you to go down the perimeter
track? - A. Yes, the Police lady pointed down the
perimeter track and said, "Make your way along there to
that enclosure", and I made my way along.  There was
another Police lady there who opened up the gate into
the relatively quiet enclosure, and I climbed in there
and made my way up towards where the Police Control Box
is, I think, near to the scoreboard.  I stood there and
there was plenty of room.

I think you and others were calling towards the Police
Control Box about the situation? - A. Yes, to do
something about it.

Just describe to me how many people were there who were
calling towards the Police.  This was, of course, after
you had got out? - A. That is correct, yes.

Just so that we get this completely clear.  Match, when
you got out, was still in progress? - A. Yes, the match
had started.

Was it still in progress when you were shouting at the
Police Control Box or had it stopped? - A. Yes.
                                                          29

                                                S. W. MULLIN


   Strangely enougn, you mentioned earlier on about
   Beardsley hitting the crossbar.  It was at that point I
   was stood there.  Even though I wasn't watching the
   match, I heard the roar and looked towards the far end
   and I heard the guy next to me saying, "Beardsley's
   just hit the crossbar".

Q. Is that when you were already in the .... - A. This was
   when I was in the fresh enclosure.

0. Near the Police Control Box? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. Tell me then were you by yourself or were there people
   who were in that area, already there resident, so to
   speak, who were shouting and calling towards the Box? -
   A. Yes, there were.

Q. The Police Box we know is just a box, literally, with a
   staircase going up.  Did you see anybody on the
   staircase when you were calling? - A. Yes, I saw what I
   believed to be a Chief Inspector or something like
   that, the chap with the gold braid round the hat, is
   it?  I saw him with Graham Kelly of the FA.  I saw them
   going up the steps into the Control Box and people near
   me were shouting, "This is your fault, Kelly, this is
   your fault".

0. I want to try and get the timings right, okay?  Are you
   saying tnat when you were calling, together with the
   other people, towards the Control Box, it was at a time
   when Graham Kelly plus or minus whoever it might nave
   been, was going up, or had you been calling at an
   earlier time? - A. I hadn't personally because I didn't
   realise the extent of what was going on, but people
   around me were shouting.  I was more concerned in
   looking for Eric.  He was wearing a bright red top and
   I was watching the enclosure where I had last seen him.

Q. Yes, I quite understand that, and I do not in any sense
   want you to think that I am criticising you.  What I am
   trying to establish is who you saw on the steps and in
   what order, and as near as possible at what time in
   relation to the match, because as you very rightly said
   your mind was not looking at your watch, your mind was
   on Eric. - A. Yes.

Q. Quite right too, but you did hear this comment about
   Beardsley hitting the crossbar? - A. Yes.

Q. There is no doubt in your mind that you were already in
   - we call it pen 1, I had better tell you that - in pen
   1. - A. No doubt at all.

Q. There is no doubt whatever? - A. No doubt.
                                             S. W. MULLIN


At that point was there anybody on the steps? - A. I
could not say.  I was aware of people on the steps but
I don't know whether it was before the Beardsley
crossbar incident or after.  It is a bit confused at
that stage.  There were one or two bobbies there
virtually all the time watching the incident.  I think
I saw one with binoculars at one stage, but as to what
relationship to the Beardsley crossbar incident, I
can't think.

You don't know? - A. No.

I think you did see an Officer go onto the pitch to
stop the match as well, didn't you? - A. Yes.

And were you in this pen at that time? - A. Pen 1 at
tnat stage, yes.

You didn't see where that Officer came from? - A. No,
sir.

It wasn't the same Officer who was with Graham Kelly
later on? - A. I have no idea.

You couldn't say, okay.   Your most vivid recollection
is of a man with cap.   You mentioned gold braid - did
you actually see it? - A. Well no, but it was a man of
high rank I am sure.

But you would not want me to hold you to gold braid? -
A. No.

Your recollection of that man is associated with Graham
Kelly? - A. Yes, sir.

Tnen I think you went back onto the pitch, I believe,
didn't you? - A. That is correct, yes.

And very sadly you found your friend, didn't you? - A.
It was at that point I saw Eric being carried out.    As
I say, he had bright colours on, white trousers and a
red ’Adidas" top, and I saw him being carried out at
head height by some fans, and then a couple of
Policemen helped him through the gate onto the playing
surface.   Then I ran down to the gate where I had got
into pen 1 and I ran down to that gate and actually I
told a lie, I said to the girl, "My brother's being
pulled out there", because I didn't for a minute think
slie would let me out so I said, "I'll have to go and
see to him".

And you went out? - A. Yes, she opened it.
                                            S. W. MULLIN


I think the Officers were trying to resuscitate him? -
A. That is right.  A young Policeman and a Police lady
were trying to bring Eric round.  They tried for
several minutes and unfortunately could not do
anything.  They were both in tears at the end of it.   I
thanked them for what they had tried to do, and they
were just apologising.

Yes, shame. - A. A great shame, great waste.

Could you snow us on a plan your positioning, Diease? -
A. Yes.

I want you to position yourself where you and Eric were
before this big surge came and took you away, so to
speak, and then position yourself near the gate, where
you were.  (The witness marked Exhibit C430) So you
were carried quite a long way, weren't you? - A. Yes.

You don't, I suppose, remember how you got round the
barriers, do you? - A. I don't.  I was looking earlier
on at the diagram when one of the earlier witnesses was
on, and I recalled the first barrier which was where
the boy was bent over backwards, but then I got a bit
worried because I couldn't remember the second barrier.

Yes, strange, isn't it? - A. Yes, I was beginning to
think maybe I had been pushed through the gap.

You might have been. - A. Possibly.   I just couldn't
remember a second barrier.

            Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

The places where you have marked that chart, when you
first came into the pen did I understand you to say
tnat you tried to move to the right? - A. That is
correct.

Is that the position to which you moved, which you have
marked on the chart? - A. The first position, yes.

That is immediately in front of the tunnel, where you
nave marked it? - A. That is correct, yes.

Did you actually move any further to the right? - A. We
tried to but unfortunately couldn't, so my first
reaction was maybe to get - at a lot of football
grounds you go into there is usually a track, not so
much a track, a space at the front of the terracing
where you can walk along the terracing, and this is
usually kept separate from the standing area.  With
never being in the Leppings Lane end before, I assumed,
wrongly, that it would be similar there but it wasn't.
                                           S. W. MULLIN


Where were you expecting to find this track or gangway?
- A. At the front near the perimeter fence.  They have
one at Anfield where people are free to walk up and
down, or they did do before the alterations.  I haven't
been in since.  At most grounds I had been in I had
experienced that type of layout.

Were you intending to go down there, to be able to move
along that gangway down by the perimeter fence? - A.
When we realised we couldn't immediately turn right on
entering the terracing, I motioned to Eric, over there.
In my mind I remember thinking, "We must get to tKe
front and walk along", but it proved to be impossible.




               /Q. I am going
                                              S. W. MULLIN

I am going to just try and fix your evidence on to
our timetable of events. If you look at the black
folder in front of you at page 277, just look down
the column of numbers and you will come to 1454 when
the Liverpool team came out on to the pitch. You
entered Pen 3 after six minutes to three? - A. Yes, I
would say so.

After you managed to move a little way away from the
entrance your impression at that stage was that the
crowding in the pen was slightly more than? - A. Yes.
Then a terrific surge from behind came, is that
right? - A. Yes, correct.

Which I expect you describe as more than normal? - A.
Considerably.

Down you went to position 2?- A. Yes.

Just run your eye down these columns ofnumbers  and
you will come to 1504, Peter Beardsley's shothits
the crossbar? - A. Yes.

By that time you had gone through the gate? - A. Yes.

Along the perimeter track, into Pen 1 and up to the
new position near the Control Box? - A. Correct, yes.

This means then that you were in the pen from some
time after six minutes to three until some time
before four minutes after three? - A. That appears to
be so, yes.

That is a space of time at the very most of ten
minutes. It is less than ten minutes? - A. Yes.

Your evidence is, from your point of view, it was
during that period that the emergency occurred? - A.
Yes.

             Cross-Examined bv MR. KlNGs

Could we see the plan of the ground, C.274? Mr.
Mullin, this is the plan of the ground and I do not
suppose you have seen it before but if I can just
help you, do you see that it shows the West Stand and
in front of the West Stand what is the Leppings Lane
terrace which is where the standing room was? - A.
Yes.

Could you point out to us where on that terrace you
were hoping to get to when you went down the tunnel?
Where was your ultimate destination? Where would you
                                                              34
                                                    S. W. MULLIN

   have liked to have got to? - A. Our ultimate
   destination where I ended up, right by the Police
   Control Room.

Q. So you would be looking, if one was coming out of the
   West Stand tunnel, to your far right? - A. Yes.

Q. To what we know is probably Pen 1? - A. Correct.
Q. You told us that when you saw the wall of people
   flush with the exit of the tunnel, that of itself I
   assume did not make you think you could not get over
   to Pen 1? - A. That is correct.

Q. What did you expect, notwithstanding that wall of
   people, you would be able to do when you got on to
   the terrace? - A. Make our way across to the right
   hand side.

Q. In order to do that you had to push your way in? - A.
   Correct, yes.

Q. Again you did not regard that of itself as something
   which was foolish because you hoped to get across? -
   A. That is correct but many grounds we have been in
   you always get a crowd of people stood at the exit
   purely because they want to get away early at the end
   or whatever.

Q. To get across to the far right c o m e r you were making
   your way downwards towards the front? - A. Yes.
Q. Then wanting to go over to the right? - A. Yes.

Q. If one just looks at the plan as you come out of the
   tunnel and one moves downwards and then moves across
   to the right, are you able to get right across to the
   pen, just looking at that plan? - A. No, you can't.
Q. What do you hit? - A. A fence.

Q. You were not aware, I assume, of thatradial    fence? -
   A. No, sir.

Q. This manoeuvre of going down towards the front and
   then moving across to the right is something you were
   expecting to be able to achieve? - A. That is
   correct.

Q. Let me go back to where you were about to enter the
   tunnel. Were you intent on going down that tunnel at
   all costs by which I mean if you had been given a
   choice would you have necessarily gone down the
   tunnel? - A. No, because given the choice I would
                                                S. W. MULLIN


have gone to the entrance nearest to the position we
ultimately wanted to stand.

Do I take it from that, that if that tunnel where you
entered it had been manned in some way and you were
being directed away from the tunnel to the side, you
would have followed those directions? - A. I would.

           Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN:

Mr. Mullin, when you got out of the pen you obviously
did not realise the seriousness of the situation, did
you? - A. That is correct.

Because you made your way along the track and you
went to Pen 1? - A. That is right.

That would take you a little while to do that? - A.
Several seconds, yes.

If you had thought it was a desperate situation when
you got out, would you have remained near Pen 3? - A.
Yes, I think I would. It is easy to say that now but
I think I would purely in the hope of trying to see
if Eric was going to be all right or find out where
he was or anybody for that matter, to try and help
anybody.

You thought the situation would just ease itself
about kick-off time? - A. Yes, that is correct. In
all my years of going to football games you always
get situations where you think, "It is a bit naughty
here" but then they level out. You see even at this
stage I was still unaware of the fences stopping
people moving either side and I just thought that
they would sort themselves out which supporters
usually do in situations like that.

It was only after you had left that things became
desperate? - A. Yes.

            Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL:

You have described   being entangled with the young lad
who was pulled out   ahead of you? - A. Yes.

The effect of your evidence I have received was that
it was not straightforward pulling that young lad
out. It took a little time, is that right? - A. It
did, yes.

A minute or so? - A. Probably, yes.   I couldn't be
precise on that.
                                                 S. W. MULLIN


You have marked on the plan, which is Exhibit C.430,
a cross right beside the gate, just to the right hand
side of the gate? - A. Yes.

Below the level of the steps that lead up to the
threshold of that gate on to the perimeter track? -
A. Yes.

After the young lad was taken out in the way that you
have described and after the time that you have
agreed with me, was it your turn to be pulled out or
were other people pulled out in between the young lad
and yourself? - A. I can't remember, I am sorry.

When you had been pulled out and you found yourself
on the perimeter track you were redirected down to
what we know as Pen 1 by first one and then a second
woman Police Officer who was standing by Gate 1? - A.
There was only one Policewoman directing me, not two.

There was a further Policewoman I think you said at
Gate 1? - A. At Gate 1, sorry.

At this stage, as I understand your evidence, the
game was in progress? - A. Yes.

You made your way into Pen 1. How far from the gate
did you move, the entrance to Pen 1? - A. Nearly to
the back, nearly to the back wall. In fact, I can't
remember anybody being stood behind me.

You made your way through the people in Pen 1 to the
back? - A. Yes.

To a position near, you recall, the Police Control
Box? - A. Yes, that is correct. The Police Control
Box would have been on my right hand side.

At that stage you were not shouting at the Police
Control Box? - A. Not initially, no. I was more
concerned trying to see if Eric was going to get out.

You were looking towards the position where you
believed Eric to be, is that right? - A. Correct.

After a period you then joined in the shouting
towards the Police Control Box? - A. Yes, very
briefly. I had other things on my mind.

Was that when you saw Mr. Kelly, when you joined in
the shouting? - A. I didn't shout at Graham Kelly. I
think it was probably a few seconds before I actually
saw him.
                                                S. W. MULLIN

You shouted before you saw him? - A. Yes, possibly.
It is a bit vague.

When you saw Mr. Kelly at the same time you saw
someone whom you believed to be a senior Police
Officer? - A. A senior Officer, yes.

            Cross-Examined bv MR. ISAACS:

When you came down the tunnel, you having gone
through what we know to be Gate C, you were with
Eric? - A. Yes.

How busy was the tunnel at that stage? - A. There
were several people walking down the tunnel with us
but nothing out of the ordinary.

You walked down the tunnel? - A. Walked.

You were not part of any crowd? - A. No, sir.

That took you along? - A. No, sir.

Involuntarily? - A. No, sir.

There were people who were virtually right up to the
exit of the tunnel when you got there? - A. Yes.

How did you enter the tunnel? - A. Just by separating
- enter the tunnel?

I am sorry, I do apologise, enter the terrace? - A.
Just by coming up behind and saying, "Excuse me,
mate" and two of them would sort of stand sideways
and you would just squeeze between them.
Carefully? - A. Yes.

Nudging your way forwards and sideways? - A. Yes.

Nothing that you did would have caused a surge down
the terrace through you coming in and pushing people
in front of you? - A. No.

That is clearly right from what you are telling us.
Then you moved over to your right? - A. Yes.

Did I understand you to say this, that you were still
making your way to the right when the big surge came
or had you actually stopped before the surge came? -
A. I think we had briefly stopped really to survey
the situation.
                                                 S. W. MULLIN

It was not as if that was your final place before you
moved down? - A. Oh no, no.

You had nudged your way through a few people? - A.
Yes.

Then the big surge came? - A. That is correct, yes.

You had initially entered the terrace and you had
entered it carefully, seeing the people in front of
you? - A. That is correct.

               Further bv THE CORONER:

I just want to ask you one other question. When you
got out of the gate at Pen 3 and you were going
towards Pen 1, there are two things to ask; first of
all, can you remember whether the gate of Pen 1 was
opened for you by the lady Police Officer or was it
already open? - A. No, it was opened by the lady
Police Officer.

Do you recollect whether you were one of the first to
go in of the people or were you at the middle or at
the end? - A. I believe I was the only one at that
stage. I didn't have to queue to get into that
particular pen. I just walked straight in.

The reason why I ask is that I notice on the
schedule, No. 277, could you turn to it? - A. Yes.

Oddly enough, I noticed this over the weekend, can
you see where it says kick-off 1459.30? - A. Yes.




                          /Q. Then it has got.
                                                    s. W. MULLIN

 Q.    Then it has got, "14.59.51 - Gate 1 opened to allow
       supporters into Enclosure".  Can you see that’ - A
       Yes, I can.

 Q.    Then later on you have got Beardsley hitting the
       cross-bar, have you not? - A. Yes, that is true.

 Q.    You think that you might have been one of the first
       ones into that Pen 1? - A. Yes, I do.

Q.    Can you put a plan up of the ground as a whole, not
      the terracing, and put a little cross where you took
      your position in Pen 1.  I have got it pretty clear in
      my mind, but in a year's time I will not remember, nor
      will anybody else.  Show Mr. Mullin where the Police
      Control Box is, because it will assist him. - A. Is
      that where you want me to show you, where I was stood
      when I got into Pen 1?

Q.    Yes, that is right.    (Witness marks plan)

            MRS. PERKINS:   C431.

           THE CORONER: Anybody else want to ask anything
      arising out of that?

            Further Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Q.    I believe you said at one point that the tunnel
      appeared to be blocked, is that right? - A. The exit
      onto the terracing, there were bodies flush with the
      exit, yes.

           MRS. McBRIEN:    Thank you.

           THE CORONER: Mr. Mullin, I am most grateful to
      you, thank you very much indeed, and as I have already
      indicated to you obviously I am very, very sorry that
      you lost your friend and, of course, that the family
      have lost somebody whom they loved as well.  Thank you
      very much for your help.

 What was the closest to the ground that you were
 checked in 1988? We are still on 1988. - A. Actually
 as we were right up to the turnstile, just as we were
 going through the turnstile.

 Flush with the turnstile more or less, there was a
 Policeman right outside? - A. Yes.

 The next one further away, where was that? - A. I
 can t remember.

 The furthest, can you remember that one? - A. It was
 just by where the coaches were parked.

 Right up near the top? - A. Yes.

So, in other words, was it more or less as you got off
the coaches that they looked? - A. We got off the
coach, the bottom of the road where all the coaches
were parked.

Okay.   In 1988 were you in the same part of the
Yesrapen*3Wer8 y°U     tlle centre behind the goal? - A.

How did you get into that pen? - A. Through the centre
tunnel.

Did you have any difficulty getting in? - A. No.

Were they closed, the doors or gates, as far as you
can remember in 1988? - A. I didn't notice.

You were not directed to the side? - A. No, I didn't
even know there was a side.

So in 1988 you just went straight down the tunnel, you
had free access? - A. Yes.

What time did you say you got there? - A. About half­
past 2.

The pens in 1988, Pen 3 in particular, was it crowded
or not? - A. It was near the back of the pen, but as
you got further to the front there was more room down

 I think, you having arrived at 1 o'clock, your friend
 was not    feeling very well,or one of your friends, and
 you were looking for a chemist? - A. He was travel

           Easy.       Were there Police Officers outside the

B          one Officer next to each turnstile.

     Q.    Did they search you, as a matter of interest? - A. No.
     Q.    You got through without a search? - A. I got through
           without being searched, yes.

           I think you also saw a couple of stewards, I think you
           said, is that right? - A.. I saw two stewards, I think?
     Q.    Where were they? - A. Inside the turnstiles.

     Q.    On the inside? - A. Yes.

     Q.    Hot on the outside? - A. No.

     Q.   I think, having got through the turnstiles, there were
          more Officers on the inside as well, were there not? -
D         A • x6 S •

    Q.    Did they search you? - A. No.

    Q.    So you managed to get through without? - A. Yes.
    Q.    Did any of your friends get searched? - A. No, none of
          them did.

          How many were there in your group? - A. There were
          live a n together, but there were only three of us on
          the terracing.

          So having come through, you presumably decided to go
          tiie same place as you went last year, is that r i ^ h t ’ -
          A. Yes.                                            °

    Q.    Down the tunnel, which was empty, I assume, for all
          practical purposes? - A. Yes.

    Q.    And out onto Pen 3? - A.      Yes.

    Q.    So what time did you get into the pen? - A. As we got
          « ! Z act* ally noticed the clock on the score-board,
          which said it was 2 o'clock.

    Q.    What was the pen like, as far as you remember, at that
          time. - A. Near the exit of the tunnel there were
          quite a few people there, we had to push our way
          through there, and as we got to sort of the middle of
          the pen there were less people down there and near the
          iront there was hardly anybody there.
                                                P. DUGGAN

 So people were already congregating ____ ? - a . At the
 Dack of the pen.

 But the further you got forward the emptier it became
 is what you are saying? - A. Yes.

 Obviously you were not worried at that stage? - A. No
 not at all.                                           *

 You did not want to stand right at the back anyway,
 did you. - A. No.  I wanted to get pretty near to the
 iront.

Where did you want to go to, where was your preferred
position? - A . My preferred position at a match is
usually behind the goal, pretty high up so that you
are not sort of looking up.

So where did you want to be on this occasion? - A.
      near the front because if you are sort of in the
middle of the pen there is a bar at the top of the
fence which blocks your view a bit.  So we wanted to
get so that we were actually below that bar.

So in other words you have got to be either right at
the top or fairly far forward? - A. Yes.

There is a bit in the middle which is really bad? - A.
Yes.

I think eventually you managed to make your position
towards a barrier, I believe? - A. Yes.

In fact, as is common with a lot of people, did you
stand in front of it? - A. Yes I stood in front of it.

Because it is more comfortable that way? - A. Yes.

You lent against it, I take it, and used it as a back
support? - A. Yes.

I do not know if it was you, but the others were doin*
that anyway, leaning back against the barrier? - A.
One of my friends was actually next to me, and the
other was sort of in front of me.

So you were in between them, so to speak? - A. Yes.

You could also see quite a lot of youngsters near the
iront, right up against the fencing? - A. A few of
them were actually standing sort of on the wall going
onto the fence.
                                              P. DUGGAN

   e passed, I think Martin went back and passed a
programme up to a friend, but you were just waiting
for the match to start.  At about half-past 2, I think
Martin went off to get some food, is that right’ - A
Yes.                                           ’     *

So he managed to get out of the pen, and did he return
with anything to eat? - A. He came back with a burger.

How long would you say it took him to do the journey
out, buy the stuff and back again? — A. About Quarter— •
of-an-hour.

At that point can you remember was a beach ball being
knocked around? - A. It was around that time, yes.

Everybody was happy, would you say, in the area in
which you were? - A. Yes.

Now this would take us until about quarter-to 3 from
what you have told me, and it also fits in with the
beach ball episode.  Did things stay normal after
kick-off, or did they change?  I mean up to kick-off,
 u     take you throu§h kick-off later on. - A. From
about half-past 2 to, say, quarter-to 3, there seemed
to be a lot more people coming down to sort of the
front area, just a steady flow of people really.
There wasn't loads of people coming down at once.
Then by about quarter-to 3, it was like shoulder to
shoulder then.




                      /Q.   Yes, carry on.
                                                                46

                                                        P. DUGGIN


    Q. Yes, carry on. - A. As it got nearer and nearer to kick-
       off there seemed to be more and more people coming down.

    Q. Are you quite sure about this?    I have got your
       statement.  It is slightly different.    This was given in
B      May 1989, which was a lot nearer, of course.    I want you
       to describe again to me what the position was like for
       you at the time.   Never mind what you know now because
       the danger is because we know there has been a disaster
       we want to make things fit.    I want you to tell me how
       it was for you at the time in the pen, between quarter to
       three and three o'clock? - A. It was all right for me.
       I had enough room at either side and front of me and
       there was nobody behind me because of the barrier.

    Q. So it would be fair to say - obviously there were more
       people in the pen? - A. Yes.

    Q. But you yourself were not in any particular danger at
       that point? - A. Oh, no.

    Q. Would that be true? - A. Yes.
D   Q. Did you see the players come on to the pitch? - A. Yes, I
       did.

    Q. Was it at that time that people started coming below the
       barrier and moving you about a bit? - A. It was
       roundabout that time.

    Q. That is not unusual, is it, when something happens that
       there is crowd movement? - A. You find when somebody is
       pushing forward and somebody is against the barrier you
       quite often find them ducking under to get away.

    Q. What was, if anything, different about it on this
       occasion?   There may not have been anything different
       about it but if there was what was the difference with
       the people coming forward when the players were coming
       out? - A. Well, usually as people move forward you often
       find they move back as well, but here you were just
       staying where you were and you were going further
       forward.

    Q. So once you had moved forward there was not this coming
       back? - A. No.

    Q. You have already mentioned there was a load of youngsters
       at the front? - A. Yes.

    Q. Did you see them again around this time? - A. I did see a
       couple actually climb over the fence.   A couple were
       actually helped over the fence.




H
                                                   P. DUGGIN


They were helped over? - A. Yes.

Was this before kick-off? - A. Yes, before.

Did you see kick-off as a matter of interest? - A. I
couldn't really see it.   I could see a bit of the pitch
but I couldn't really see the centre of the pitch because
people were standing up on to the fence.

Could you see any play at   all?    I am not interested in
the detail, but could you   see the players were actually
playing? - A. I could see   they were playing but I
couldn t actually see the   playing.

At this time when people were playing, had it got a lot
worse for you personally? - A. Yes, it was that bad I
couldn't move my arms.   My feet kept getting lifted off
the floor.   I was suspended in mid-air for a while.

Was that before kick-off, do you think, or after or at
the time of kick-off, or don't you know? - A. I think it
was just as they kicked-off.

Now you, of course, by this time from what you have said
were nowhere near a barrier any more, you had been moved
forward? - A. I had been moved about two yards forward.

About three yards forward.   Could you see the gate in
the front? - A. I actually saw the gate being opened.        I
didn't know it was a gate until it was opened.

When did you see that? - A. One of the young lads who had
climbed over the fence had actually been put back in
through the gate.

Did you see how it was opened? - A. No.

You just saw it was opened? - A. Yes.

Did you see it open more than once or was it just that
once? - A. I just saw it open once.

So you say it was opened and you saw a lad being put in?
- A. Yes.

You are sure it was a lad who climbed over and not a lad
who was pushed out because the gate burst open and who
was then put back? - A. I remember him actually climbing
over.

You do remember him climbing? - A. Yes.

You didn't see it open again after that? - A. No, I
didn't.

Q. At some point you felt something hit you? - A. Yes,
   struck me on the back of the leg.

Q. What was it, can you remember? - A. I think it was the
   metal barrier because it knocked me to the floor and
   while I was on the floor I sort of twisted so I was
   facing back towards the stand.   I could see the barrier
   sort of down towards the floor, not far from me really.

Q. In relation to the kick-off when would you say that was?
   - A. I think it was about five minutes after the kick-
   off.

Q. Was the match still in play? - A.' I couldn't really see
   by that time.

Q. The match finished   at the end of five minutes and forty
   seconds.   Did you   see Beardsley hit the crossbar? - A. I
   didn't see it, but   I did hear a big roar and that is when
   everyone seemed to   go forward and when I was actually
   struck in the back   of the leg and was knocked to the
   floor.

Q. You are saying when you heard that big roar, whatever it
   might have been, everybody went forward and it was about
   that time you felt this bit of metal hit the back of your
   legs? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see the piece of metal later? - A. I did actually
   see it on the floor just behind me.

Q. What sort of metal was it?   What shape was it? - A. It
   was round - and like a square block near the end of it.

Q.   Was it long or short? - A. I couldn't really tell.       I
     could only see about half of it.

Q. Then because you were knocked down you were sort of
   covered by people? - A. Yes.

Q. And very fortunately you were one of the people who
   managed to survive.   I am just going to 1988 for a
   moment.   You have already told me you were checked for
   tickets and you didn't see anybody who didn't have a
   ticket? - A. Yes.

Q.   Is that right, you didn't see anybody at any point not
     having a ticket in 1988? - A. No, I didn't.

Q. So you don't know what might have happened to them if
   they had not had one? - A. No, I don t.

Q. You were challenged, or if you were you... - A. I did
   have a ticket to show.

    Q. Can you show us on the plan where you were at about kick-
       off time?  (The witness marked the plan)

              MRS. PERKINS:    That is C.432.
B   Q.        THE CORONER:   When you were struck by this bar, or
         whatever it was, were you in that position or had you
         moved forward a bit? - A. I had moved forward and sort of
         to the right a bit.

    Q. To the right of you, facing the pitch? - A. Yes.

    Q. Apart from hearing the roar which you have mentioned, you
       can't relate that strike any more closely than that? - A.
       No, I can't.

    Q. It is very, very difficult.   We are going to pause for
       lunch.   Can you come back at two?   Don't chat about the
       evidence with anybody until you have finished.  OK? - A.
       OK.

             THE CORONER:     Two o'clock, ladies and gentlemen.

     THE CORONER:   Nobody has any questions for you,
Mr. Duggan, so you have got off very lightly.  I have
no further questions either, so thank you very much for
being here this afternoon.  I am sorry, I knew there
was something.

                   Further by THE CORONER

It is this business about the barrier.  When it hit you
I think you told me today that it was sometime between
kick-off and before the match finished, that is right,
is it?- A. I think the match was still in progress.

Because in one of your statements you thought it was
quite a few minutes after the players had left the
pitch.  That is not what you are saying to me today, is
it? - A. No.

Definitely? - A. Definitely the match was still in
progress.

That is all I wanted to be sure about.       Thank you very
much.

               GARY JAMES GAINS Called (Sworn)

                       By THE CORONER

You are Gary James Gains, I believe? - A. Yes.

                                              Merseyside, is
it/- A . i t   is, y es.

Mr. Gains, you are a Liverpool supporter,        I think? - A.
I am, yes.

Did you come to the semi-final here in Sheffield, 15th
April? - A. Yes.

I think you came by Amberline Coach, is that right? -
A. I did, yes.

I think I am also right in saying that you had a £6
terrace ticket? - A. I did, yes.

And you had to pay a   bit more than that for the return
coach? - A. The coach was £6, yes.

That is fair enough.        Now, I think you went with a
friend.  This wasn't       a supporters' coach as such? - A.
No.

Because you weren't a member of the club? - A. No.
                                                                    51

                                                         G. J. GAINS


    Q. But it was an Amberline Coach? - A. It was just an
       organised Amberline Coach, yes.

B   Q.   I think it was due to leave at about 10.15 but
         it left a little bit later, d i d n ’t it? - A. It
                                                              in fact
                                                              did,
         yes.

    0. Quarter-to-11, was it? - A. About quarter-to-11, yes.

    Q. Was that because there were so many coaches leaving all
       together? - A. Yes, and the coach we were on had to
       stop at Broadgreen as well and pick people up on the
       way.

    0. So the coach itself was delayed because of pick-up
       times in Liverpool and on the way? - A. It was, yes.

    0.   I think you came along the motorway, yes? - A.       We did,
         yes.

    0. It was actually stopped somewhere near Sheffield by the
D      Police, is that right? - A. It was, yes.

    0. w’hat happened? - A. The coach was pulled over by the
       Police and the Police came on checking tickets, and
       that, seeing if there was any alcohol at all, and they
       didn't take any cans off anybody at all.   Everything
       was okay, and off we went.

    0. You have got an interesting comment in your statement.
       You said there weren't any cans on the coach by the
       time the Police came, or words to that effect.  Does
       that mean there had been some but they had all been
       drunk? - A. No. When I say cans, people had cans,
       tnere was Coca-Cola cans, there was lemonade cans, some
       people had lager cans, but there was no cans taken by
       the Police at all.

    0. I see, so there were a few cans .... - A. The Police
       could see cans on there when they came on, but there
       was no cans taken off the coach whatsoever.

    0. I see, I misunderstood you.  So they checked for
       alcohol and they checked the tickets as well? - A. I
       don't know whether they were just checking for alcohol
       or they were just checking the tickets, but everything
       was okay.

    Q. I see.  That was the main thing they were interested
       in? - A. That was the main thing, I think.

    Q. Did you have any non-ticket holders on that coach, as
       far as you remember? - A. Sometimes, I have been at
       away games before, sometimes you heard people selling



H
                                              G. J. GAINS

tickets on coaches and all that, but I never heard that
at all.

So as far   as you were concerned, no problems? - A.
There was   no problems at all.

You, of course, had one, so there was not any problem
as far as you personally were concerned? - A*. No, I had
my ticket anyway.

What time did you actually arrive in Sheffield, would
you, say? - A. I would say it was about half-past-1,
quarter-past-1 - ish.

Yes, that is near enough.  Then what happened? - A. We
nad come to the semi-final the year before, 1988, and
we went for a drink the year before to a pub called the
Travellers Arms, just a little bit past the ground.   We
went there but it was shut, you couldn't get in, the
doors were shut so you couldn't get in.  We carried on
a bit further up the road and got some pies and that
from a pie shop, and there was a supermarket a bit
further up, people were sat out having drinks.  You
could buy lager, bitter, whatever, at the supermarket.

Don't go too fast. - A. Sorry.  We went to the
supermarket and we bought four cans --- we bought six
cans of lager, there was three of us, so we had two
cans of lager each.  We sat on the grass eating our
pies and had a drink and that.

It was a lovely day, wasn't it? - A. It was a nice day,
yes, so we sat out. We had had our first can and were
supping our second can, and the Police were on
horseback - this was about 2 o'clock-ish - they were
moving people down to the ground then saying, "Come on,
make your way down to the ground".  This was about 2
o clock-ish.

So what you are saying is that you were actually being
encouraged to go down? - A. Encouraged to move down to
trie ground, yes. There was no trouble whatsoever, they
were just encouraging people to move down to the
ground.

From what you say I gather you, in fact, went off to
the ground at around that time? - A. Yes, about that
time.

With your friends?- A. Just the three of us, yes.

Do you remember what time you arrived, about, at the
ground? - A. I think it was about quarter-past to half-
past-2 outside the ground.
                                                                 53

                                                        G. J. GAINS


    Q. At that time you didn't have any particular difficulty
       getting through the turnstiles, or did you? - A. Yes, I
       did.  I remember approaching the gate to go through to
B      the turnstiles and there was a mounted Policeman, a
       Policeman on horseback there, and it was just a mass of
       people at that particular time.  There was people going
       underneath the horse and all that, and I lost my two
       friends actually going through the gate.  I just lost
       them. I got pinned up against the dividing wall that
       leads you down to the turnstiles, and there was people
       trying to climb over that wall at that particular time
       outside, it was that squashed.

    0. Are you saying this was at 2.15, 2.20? - A. No, what I
       am saying, approximately that time.  It could have been
       later than that.  It was packed at that particular
       time.

    Q. I see, because that would have been a bit early, from
       what we have heard from other people. - A. Yes.

D           MR. KING:    Sir, I am sorry to interrupt.  Could I
       direct you to page 151 of the transcript before Lord
       Justice Taylor, at just beyond letter Q", a reference
       to kick-off?   You see the comment of Lord Justice
       Taylor, sir?

            THE CORONER:    I have a nasty feeling my version
       is not the same as yours.   Just read me what Lord
       Justice Taylor says.

            MR. KING:      I would rather not, sir.

            THE CORONER:     Okay, pass it to me.     I will look.

            MR. KING:   Sir, there is a difficulty which is
       being experienced, certainly on this side of the table,
       also now.


            THE CORONER:     Yes.

    Q. Slow down, okay? Let's take you back to the
       turnstiles, all right?  Forget the time for a minute.
       You got to the turnstiles? - A. Yes.




                  /Q. You say it was




H
                                                  G. J. GAINS

You say it was very crowded when you got there? - A.
Very crowded.

You are sure about that? - A. I am positive.      It is a
thing you are not going to forget, is it?

You were there in 1988 as well, were you not? - A. I
was, yes.

Can you remember whether the crowd was outside the
perimeter gates - the perimeter gates are the
parklike gates - or were they .just within the
perimeter gates? - A. In 1988__
No, in 1989? - A. In 1989?

Yes? - A. How do you mean?   Can you repeat the
question?

When you got there in 1989, the 15th April 1989, you
said that it was very, very crowded? - A. Yes.

Was the crowd outside the perimeter gates in 1989 or
were they within the perimeter gates? - A. No, I
could walk up to the gate no problem. It was
actually when you went through the big gates.

That is when you got squashed? - A. Squashed, where
people were queuing up.

You, so far as you remember, were squashed against a
wall, is that right? - A. Yes.

You could see people climbing up the walls? - A.
People were trying to get on top of the wall to get
over on to the other side, you know.

Did you by any chance see any Police Officer standing
on top of the wall? - A. No.

How did you yourself get into the ground? - A. I just
made my way and eventually got to the turnstiles. I
gave my ticket in and gave me the stub back.

So you did go through the turnstile? - A. I did go
through the turnstile, yes.

Had you noticed any big gates opening at all? - A.
No, I actually passed the big gates because as you
follow the wall down you actually come to the big
blue gates at the back but they were shut at that
particular time.
                                                                55
                                                       G. J. GAINS

    Q.    Sergeant Griffiths, if you could just point to the
         wall and the gates so that we know where you were,
         not the perimeter gates but the wall. Is that the
B         one? - A. That is the one, yes.

    Q.    Then there is a big gate there and that is theone
         you went by and it is almost as you get to the
         turnstiles? - A. That is right, it is, yes.

    Q. Having got in through the turnstile, where were your
       friends? Were you with them or had you lost them
       then? - A. I had lost them then.

    Q. Did you wait for them inside? - A. As soon as I got
       in I went to the toilet because you can see the
       toilets facing you as you walk through the
       turnstiles. I thought that they might have got in by
       this time and so "I'll go in looking for them"
       but....

_   Q. Stop. At that point did you see any big gates open
U      at that point? - A. No.

    Q. Carry on now? - A. I was unsure where to go really
       with my ticket and to the right there were two
       Policemen and a steward where the steps go up to the
       upper stand and so I approached the steward. I said
       to him, "Can I go up the stairs with this ticket?".
       He said, "No, you have got to go down the tunnel" and
       pointed me to the tunnel that took you then into Pen
       3 behind the goal.

    Q . So at that point you decided you would go down the
        tunnel? - A. Yes.

    Q. Were there a lot of people in the concourse area? -
       A. No, I just walked through the tunnel by myself.

    Q. Not the tunnel, the area before you get to the
       tunnel? - A. There was people. It wasn't packed.
    Q. Did you see the gate open at all before you set
       off? - A. No.

    Q. I do not the gate that you passed.    I mean the other
       big concertina gate? - A. No.

    Q. You saw no gate? - A. No.

    Q. You then went into the tunnel? - A. Yes.

    Q. From what you just said the tunnel was not too
       crowded? - A. No, I just walked down the tunnel, no
       problem.



H
                                              G. J. GAINS


I just want to ask you a question, taking you outside
again, did you see a Police Land Rover at all? - A.
No.

Did you hear any tannoy or loudspeaker announcements?
- A. No.

Outside I am talking about? - A. No.

The tunnel was clear? - A. Yes.

Could you see the exit? Was it clear for you to get
on to the terrace or was it blocked off by people? -
A. No, I walked on to the terrace, no problem at all.

When you walked out, which side did you go out, right
or left? - A. Right. Right as you go through the
tunnel.

In other words, you are saying that you managed to
get on to the terrace with no difficulty? - A. No,
because actually when I went through the tunnel I
turned right and actually made my way down more or
less in the middle of Pen 3.

What was happening on the field at that point in
time? - A. There was nothing, nobody on the field at
all.

There was nobody on the field? - A. No, definitely
not.

Can you remember anybody playing with a beach ball? -
A. No.

You cannot remember it or it did not happen at this
particular time? - A. No, I just don't remember
anybody with a beach ball.

Do you remember the players being announced over the
tannoy? - A. No. I remember the players coming on to
the pitch but not announced.

You do remember the players coming on to the pitch? -
A. Yes.

Were you in this position that you have described
when the players came on to the pitch? - A. No.

You had already moved? - A. I had already moved, yes.

It is a difficult question this, and if you do not
know the answer, unless you can give an intelligent
                                                           57
                                                 G. J. GAINS

   estimate, do not just pick a figure; from the time
   that you came out on to the terrace and the point
   when the players came on to the pitch, how much time
   had elapsed? - A. It is hard to say, you know. Five
   minutes, ten minutes.

Q. Did it seem a long or short time to you? - A. To be
   honest with you, I wasn't really thinking about it.
   It was just part of the day.

Q. When you first got on it sounds to me as if it was
   not too bad? - A. No, it wasn't too bad at all.

Q. You have no recollection of the announcement of the
   players and you do not remember a beach ball, is that
   correct? - A. That is correct.

Q. But you do remember the players coming on to the
   pitch? - A. Yes.

Q. Where were you when that happened? - A. I had moved
   from where I was in the middle of the pen, more or
   less like in a diagonal position to the barrier that
   was just before Pen 4, the next divide, actually
   right down.

Q. Pen 4? - A. No, where the goal is in Pen 3, just
   slightly back, the barrier that went there, that is
   where I was pushed down to.

Q. I will show you a plan in a moment and you will tell
   us but you went against and towards the barrier. In
   fact, you are saying that the barrier broke, is that
   right? - A. That is right, it did, yes.

Q. That was when the players were on the pitch? - A.
   When the players were on the pitch I was squashed
   anyway at this time. It was possibly slightly before
   they were on the pitch that I was squashed.

Q. That is what I am trying to find out? - A. Yes, but
   it is hard to say whether the bar went before kick-
   off or it actually happened after kick-off because I
   don't remember any of the play at all.

Q. Just take it slowly. You remember coming up against
   this barrier? - A. Yes.

Q. You can remember that the players were on the pitch
   at that point in time. What you are saying is that
   you might have got on to the barrier before the
   players came on the pitch? - A. Yes.
                                                G. J. GAINS

But you were definitely there when the players were
on the pitch? - A. Yes.

Did you see the kick-off   at all? - A. No,   no.
You did not see it? - A.   No.

Before you were squashed against the barrier, because
presumably it was in front of you, is that right? -
A. When you are saying the barrier, it was the
supports at the side of the barrier. It was not the
bar itself, no.

It was the legs? - A. The legs that come down the
side, yes.

That is what you were squashed against? - A. I wasn't
literally squashed. There was a person in front of
me first and he tried to move himself round the bar
and as his leg come up I was squashed against his
knee against the side of the barrier.

That, of course, hurt him an awful lot? - A. He was
screaming. This was before kick-off.

This was before kick-off? - A. Yes.

Never mind about the time, did you notice the barrier
collapse? - A. Somebody shouted, "The barrier is
going, the barrier is going". I just heard the
cracking noise. There was that many people you
couldn't see if the barrier had gone or not. The
only time I realised how badly it had gone was that I
ended up on the floor with the lad who was in front
of me. He was on the floor and I was on top of him.

That was the lad with the knee? - A. Yes, that was
the lad with the knee. I was lying on my stomach
with my legs sort of like up round the bar.

What happened was that you heard somebody shout, "The
barrier is going"? - A. Yes.

Then you and the lad were lying on the floor? - A.
Yes, face down on the floor.

Can you remember whether it was rather sudden that
this happened or was it a gradual thing and then a
sudden collapse or what? Are you in a position to
say? - A. Yes, because it seemed like a long time
before the barrier actually went and we were actually
squashed up against it. It didn't just go straight
away.

                                                             G. J. GAINS


            h L 5 ? 6re W3S 3 *ime lnterval that you were against the
            t! f           against this boy who was crying out? - A.
B           it ielt like we were there for ages, you know.
     Q.     But you are totally unable to say what was happening
            on the pitch at that time? - A. No.

     Q.     You cannot say? - A. Before the barrier went and we
            were squashed up, we were right down by the bar by the
            fencing, and we were screaming then to the Police and
            to the stewards, "Open the.gate, open the gate",
            because there were people being squashed at that time.
     Q .
            Are you saying that that was when you were against the
            barrier? - A. That was when I was against the barrier,
            yes.                                                  ’

           You had not moved away from the barrier, once you °ot
           there that was where you stayed? - A. That was where I
           stayed.

           So what you are saying is that when you were being
           squashed against this barrier when the players were on
           the pitch     A. Before the barrier went.

           Before, you and others were calling to the Police to
           open the gates? - A. Yes, "Open the gate, open the
           gate".

           Could you see the gate? - A. I was looking at the gate
           but it just all looked like one big fence, you see.   I
           was trying to look for the gate.  The only time I saw
           the gate was when I saw a lad climb over the fence,
           and they opened the gate and he was pushed back into
           the ground again.

    Q.     You saw that, did you? - A. I saw that myself, yes.

    Q.     Did you see the gate open and shut more than once? -
           A. No, just the once.

    Q.     You do not, of course, know when    that was inrelation
           to     A. No.

    Q.     But you were against the barrier you say? - A. I was
           against the barrier, yes.

    Q.     You are quite   sure that this lad went over the fence
           and then back   through the gate and not out through the
           gate and back   in through the gate? - A. No, I actually
           saw him climb   over the fence.

    Q.     You are quite certain of that?     - A.   I ampositive   of
           that, yes.

                                                   G. J. GAINS


Q.   Just the one you saw, is that right? - A. Just the
     one, yes.

Q.   Can you show us on a plan where you were?
     (Witness marks pla n )

           MRS. PERKINS:   That is C433.

Q.        THE CORONER:  So the nearest we can get to the
     barrier breaking, as far as you are concerned, is that
     it happened after the players came on the pitch? - A.
     It was definitely before kick-off.  When I say "before •
     kick-off", I saw the players when they actually came
     on the pitch and they were knocking the ball about,
     but I don't remember anything of the kick-off at all.

Q.   So you are making a deduction that it must have
     happened before kick-off, but you cannot, of course,
     be certain because you did not see it? - A. Obviously
     I can't be certain, no.

Q.   But you are sure that you were against the barrier
     when the players were on the pitch? - A. Yes.

Q.   This lad was crying because his knee was hurting him?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   Then after a period of time, which is difficult to
     estimate, you could feel it go and you fell down and
     after that, of course, you did not see anything until
     you got rescued basically? - A. Yes, it was just pitch
     black on the floor with bodies everywhere.

Q.   Did   a lot of people fall forward at that time, would
     you   say? - A. I don't know.  I had the lad in front of
     me,   and I was trying to save him as well as myself,
     you   know.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. KI N G :

Q.   Mr. Gains, did I understand you to say that you were
     being slightly squashed, I think you used the
     expression, before the players even came on the pitch?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   We know the players came on the pitch round about 6
     minutes to 3, so you are saying before that time what
     was it like even before that time? - A. I have been
     going to football matches for 12 years now, possibly a
     bit longer, and you expect a little bit of pushing,
     you always get a little bit of pushing and it gets a
     little bit packed, but this time was different in a
     way.  As the lad said before, you were going forward
     but you couldn't go back.
                                              G. J. GAINS


Were you experiencing this before the players came
onto the pitch? - A. Yes, before the players came onto
the pitch.

Before 6 minutes to 3? - A. Before 6 minutes to 3,
yes.

             Further by THE CORONER:

Mr. Gains, the Jury have asked me to ask you a
question, and actually I have remembered I forgot
about 1988, so I am going to come back to that.   The
question the Jury have asked me to ask you is this.
When you were outside in the turnstile area, do you
remember? - A. Yes.

Can you recollect seeing a Police Officer stand on a
railing and shouting at people, or anything at all
about a Police Officer? - A. No.  It was squashed.   I
just tried to get myself towards the turnstile.

Did you see any Police Officers outside the turnstile,
within the turnstile area but outside the turnstiles
themselves? - A. Actually on the gate of the
turnstiles?

Yes. - A. I think there was one Policeman on the
actual outside of the turnstile.

Did he search you, can you remember? - A. No, I never
got searched, no.

     MR. KING:   Sir, there was a question.

     THE CORONER: Can I deal with 1988 and then you
can come back.

     MR. KING:  It deals with 1988, sir, and so I
would be obliged if you did ask yours first.  I
thought you had finished, sir.

     THE CORONER:   I want to go back to 1988, all
right? - A. Yes.

Where were you in 1988, on the terracing as well? - A.
The terracing that goes sort of to the left. You can
actually look down onto the pitch. It was higher up.

So you were not behind the goal? - A. No.

How did you get onto the terracing in 1988? - A. We
walked through the turnstile, but where I had gone
down Pen 3 in 1989 you couldn't actually go down there
because they had a big blue door closing it off, so
                                            G. J. GAINS


you couldn't go down there.  So I turned left and
there was like a little bit of a gap between the wall.
I went through the wall and then to the left.

Can you remember what time it was when you got through
the turnstiles in 1988? - A. No, possibly half-an-hour
before the kick-off, you know.

You think it might have been as early as that? - A.
Possibly half-an-hour before the kick-off, yes.

You have mentioned blue gates, have you not? - A. Blue'
gates stick out in my mind.

Were these at the entry to the tunnel? - A. The entry
to the tunnel.  You couldn't actually go through the
tunnel.  It was closed off.

Were the gates just shut, or were there people
standing near the gates, do you remember? - A. To be
honest with you, I just remember the blue gates.   I
couldn't say if there were policemen on the gates.   I
just remember the blue gates.

Then you went, in fact, through a little gap in the
wall? - A. Yes, on the left-hand side, and then just
followed that round and that brought us to the
terracing at the top, yes.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. King, is that what you were
after?

     MR. KING:  I was wanting to investigate his
experience on that issue.

               Further by MR. K I N G :

I wonder if I could just ask you to look at C263 just
to check that we have it right.  Mr. Gains, that
photograph shows the tunnel as you approach it from
the turnstile area? - A. That is right.

Is that the tunnel which you went down in 1989? - A.
That is the tunnel I went down in 1989, yes.

Is that the tunnel which you did not go down in 1988?
- A. That is correct, it is.     *
Do you see on that photograph the gates to which you
have referred, the blue gates? - A. Yes, I do.

Using the photograph, could you tell us what you
remember then of the gates being shut? - A. I just
                                           G. J. GAINS


remember the blue gates, both gates shut, to be honest
with you.

I was going to ask you whether you saw both gates
shut, and that is your evidence? - A. Both gates were
shut.  You just could not go through the tunnel at
all.

I think you have already helped us as best you could
with the time. - A. I just said approximately half-an-
hour.  It could have been quarter-to 3, I don't know,
half-past 2.  It is hard to say.

                      Cross-Examined by MRS* McBRIEN:

     J. Mr. Gaines, did you see any Officers or stewards in front
        of the doors in 1988? - A. I can't remember.   Possibly
Jg      there was but I wouldn't like to say because I am not
        definite about that.

     J. You just saw closed doors and that's it? - A. I saw
        closed doors.   I am 99% certain there was a Policeman on
        the doors but I am not 100% certain.

                THE CORONER:     Anybody else before I let Mr. Gaines
          go?    Mr. Gaines,   thank you very much indeed.

                      ANTHONY JOSEPH HOLLINRAKE Sworn

H
                                               G. J. GAINES


I take it they were also satisfied on the alcohol side? -
A. Yes, completely satisfied.

Did they put a label on the coach to show it had been...
- A. I couldn't say.   I didn't see that.

You then proceeded? - A. Yes.

The coach parked I take it? - A. Yes.   I    think it was
near a brewery near the ground somewhere.

You got off I take it and made your way to the ground as
fast as you reasonably could? - A. Yes, we ran to the
ground.

So you parked at about 2.40? - A. Yes.

What time did you get to the ground? - A.    Two forty-five.

It was quite quick? - A. Yes, I'm a good runner!

When you got to the ground at 2.45 shall we say, what met
your eyes? - A. Just a massed crowd outside.

Was this crowd spilling on to the road? - A. Yes, it was
back up Leppings Lane itself.

Did you see any mounted Officers at that time? - A.
Probably a couple.   There was a couple nearer the
turnstiles when we eventually got there.

So you are saying you saw Officers near the turnstile? -
A. Yes.  Once you went through the gates, the big gates,
there was one inside there.   I think there was one
outside the big blue gates, as I can recollect.

How   long would it take, would you say...   You know, when
you   came down Leppings Lane and saw the people, did you
see   the perimeter gates?   Could you see them? - A. Yes,
you   could see them.

How long did it take you to get up to the perimeter .
gates? - A. I would say five minutes.   It was hard work
getting to the gates themselves.

I am taking you in stages.   I want to know how long it
took you from the road through the perimeter gate.   You
would say about five minutes? - A. About five minutes.

In that period the only horse you saw was one outside the
perimeter gates.   Did you see one outside the perimeter
gate at all? - A. I think so.
                                               G. J. GAINES


And one on the inside? - A. There was definitely one
inside the perimeter gates.

Did you hear the crowd which was outside these perimeter
gates?   Was it a squashed crowd or... - A. Yes, it was
definitely squashed.   It was pretty hectic.

Did you see whether the perimeter gates were open or
shut? - A. I think there were Policemen on it trying to
open it for the flow of the fans, but after a bit they
just couldn't keep them shut.

There are in fact three sets ofperimeter gates leading
to turnstiles A to G? - A. Yes.

Which set are you talking about? - A. I would say the far
right ones.

The ones nearest the river? - A. Yes.

Did you see what was happening on the ones further away?
- A. I think it was pretty similar there, because we had
eyed it up to see which was the best to go to.

You chose that one because that one looked easier? - A.
It looked a bit easier.

You said you thought there was one Police Officer trying
to shut the gate? - A. Yes.There was one on the    gates
but I think he just gave up   in the end.  He just
couldn't contain it.

Was he opening and shutting   it as far as you could see? -
A. Yes, at the start, until   he lost control.

Why did he give up?   What happened? - A. It was just a
mass of fans and he couldn't control the gate.

Whilst you were in this area did you see a Police Land
Rover? - A. No.

Did you see it at any time before you got into the
ground? - A. No.

Did you hear any loud speaker or tannoy messages? - A.
Not as I can remember.

Either from the back or the front? - A. Not as I can
remember.   I can remember the Police on the horses
shouting, but no loud speaker.

I take it the Police on the horses were shouting...
What were they shouting? - A. "Get back. Try and get
back."
                                                G. J. GAINES


You got in through these perimeter gates.   How did you
yourself get into the ground? - A. What happened, it was
one hell of a crush and one of the mounted Policeman sort
of said go round the side, like under this small metal
fence, and round the side and through the concertina
gates which they had opened.

Can you walk over to the model and show us where you were
when that Officer told you that? - A. Round nere.

So you are pointing to about one-third of the way in on
the funnel bar.   Were you right against that bar? - A.
No, not really.

You were a bit more in the middle, were you? - A.
Probably a couple of yards to the left of the fence.

Show us the gate you entered. - A. What, the concertina
gate?

Yes, that's right. - A. That one there.

That is Gate C.   In that area before the Officer told
you to get underneath, was it squashed? - A. Yes, it was
very squashed.

Did you see people in discomfort or distress? - A.
Against the wall where the turnstiles were there were
quite a few in distress.   There were people climbing up.

Did you see people being passed over heads?   Children
and so on? - A. Yes, people trying to climb up the walls
and everything.

Did you see any Officer standing on that bar shouting? -
A. There was one stood round there.   He was stood near
enough where the barrier was round the wall there,
shouting.

Now you got in through this concertina gate.    Was it
wide open when you went in? - A. To tell you the truth I
think we were one of the first to get through, me and my
brother.  We just walked through.   No problem.    No
problem whatsoever.

Had you been to the ground in 1988? - A. Yes.

Did you make your way towards the tunnel in 1989? - A.
Yes.   That was the only entrance I could see.

Were you able to make your way easily to the tunnel? - A.
Yes, no problem whatsoever.
                                                                  68

                                                        G. J. GAINES


    Q. It wasn't that you were being carried by the crowd or
       rushed or anything like that? - A. No.

    Q. You were just able to go? - A. We just walked, strolled
B      up.

    Q. Did you say you were with your brother? - A. My brother
       Peter.

    Q. When you got to the tunnel was the tunnel itself clear or
       not? - A. Yes, it was very clear.   I recall asking a
       steward if we could go up...   I think there were some
       stairs or steps up to the stand itself.   I asked him if
       we could go up there with our tickets, but he said we had
       to go down the tunnel.

    Q. I think you said the tunnel itself was clear? - A. Yes,
       it was pretty clear.

    Q. I am not saying it was empty but you were able to walk
       down it in a normal sort of way? - A. Well, it goes down
       a gradient, doesn't it?  It was getting more packed the
       nearer to the end of it you got.

    Q. That is what I am trying to find out. - A. Then you got a
       sort of a solid mass of people there.

    Q. Once you got towards the exit there was a mass of people
       there? - A. Yes.

    Q. How deep was that mass?   Did it come into the tunnel? -
       A. It was just inside the tunnel.

    Q. What did you do, you and your brother? - A. Sort of went
       to the right, into the ground.   You had to shove a bit
       to get through.  We just went to the right.

    Q. Once you had got through this crowd at the exit, did the
       density change or did it stay the same? - A. It was still
       the same.   You couldn't really move.

    Q. Were there any players on the pitch at that point? - A. I
       recall just getting to the end of the tunnel and the
       players were on the pitch, because as somebody said
       before, Alan Hanson was there, and I remember saying,
       "Hanson is playing."

    Q.   You were still in the tunnel at that point?   - A. Just at
         the end, just going in under the tunnel.

    Q.   You came out, went to the right? - A. Yes.




H
                                             G. J. GAINES


Then what happened? - A. Well, then there just seemed a
surge and you just went to the right and sort of went
forward.   You just sort of lost control of your
movements.




                 Q. Where did you finish
                                         A. J. HOLLINRAKE

Where did you finish up? - A. On the barrier.

Is that the one that broke? - A. Yes.

Obviously the players were on the pitch, you have iust
told me that? - A. Yes.

Do you remember when you first came against the
barrier, had kick-off taken place? - A. I think they
had just kicked off, because all I could see was down
the right wing, as you look to the pitch, and I
remember a bit of play happening there.

Take my nice and slowly through what happened with
regard to the barrier? - A. You went on to the barrier
and I was thinking to myself, "This is the last place I
want to be", because it was straight across my stomach.
The force behind me was pressing on really tightly and
I was really in pain.  There was a lad at"the side of
me, and he was sort of turned round with his back onto
it, and his back was sort of, it must have been broken,
I think, because it was like bent over it, and he said
to me, "Help me, please help me", so I tried to hold
his head and his back, round here, to help him, and the
barrier just slowly started going.  Then all of a
sudden it just went and we went flying forward.   I
weren't holding him any more after that.  I don't know
where he went.

Can you relate when you first felt the barrier moving
or when it broke to what was going on on the pitch? -
A. By that time I weren't interested in what was
happening on the pitch.

No, I am not expecting you to be, but what I am trying
to find out is whether you have any recollection as to
what might have been happening on the pitch? - A. No.
I was just more bothered about this lad at the side of
me.

When^the barrier went you lost your balance, in effect,
cidn t you? - A. Yes, I just went flying forward.

Presumably the people in front of you, did they lose
their balance as well? - A. Yes.

As far as you could tell. - A. Yes,   I landed on top   of
people who were in front of me.

Did people behind you land on top of you as far as you
remember? - A. Funnily enough I don't recall anybody
landing on top of me, for some reason I don't.

Did you have difficulty breathing once you were lying
down? - A. Yes, it was getting very ....

Were you actually flat on your face or were you at an
angle? - A. I was sort of, I weren't flat on ray face
but I weren't stood up.  I was sort of half and half.

Tipped forward? - A. Yes.

In fact, I think when you next looked up you had
actually been moved further forward, hadn't you? - A.
Yes, I wasn't so far off the fence then.   I could see
my brother on the other side of the fence.

He was on the other side? - A. Yes.

Did he see you? - A. Not at first.    I was calling out
to him.

And did he hear you in the end? - A. In the end, yes,
because by this time my breath was being taken away.

How were you eventually got out, briefly? - A. I
managed to hold my hand out and there was a Policeman
on the gate, he had hold of me and our Peter eventually
got hold of me and just dragged me out.

Yes, and a good thing too.  I am pleased.  When you got
out I think the players, were they still on the pitch
or were they just leaving, or were they playing? - A. I
think they were just leaving at that time.

Are you pretty sure about that or not? - A. I am pretty
sure about it because I did see it on Match of the Day.

Sorry? - A. I had seen it on Match of the Day on the
night, and I was stood on the side and the players were
just going off.

I see, you found yourself on the video actually? - A.
Y es .

They were just leaving the pitch? - A. They were just
leaving the pitch, yes.

In '88 which part of the ground were you? - A. Exactly
the same.

What time did you arrive at the ground in 1988? - A. I
would say about 1.50.

How did you get in? - A. Just through the turnstiles.
Handed our ticket in, through the turnstiles.

    Q. Did you go down the tunnel? - A. Yes, down the tunnel.
    Q. Any problems?  Were you stopped? - A. None whatsoever,
B      no problems whatsoever.

    Q. When you got onto tne terracing at 1.50 were you in the
       same pen, pen 3?- A. Near enough exactly the same
       place.

    0. wnat was it like at 1.50 in 1988? You are thinking
       back a whole year now so be careful, all right? What
       was it like at 1.50? - A. It was just okay.  Say if you
       went on Anfield at 1.50, just what it's like there.

    Q. Nothing. - A. Just normal crowd at that time.
    Q. To be concerned about? - A. No, nothing whatsoever.
    0. What was it like at 2 o'clock, would you say, in 1988?
       - A. Probably not much different.

    0. Did it at any point become more crowded? - A. By kick-
       off time it was pretty crowded, it was.

    Q. Are you saying that until kick-off time it wasn't, as
       far as you were concerned, you were quite content with
       it?^- A. Just a normal build-up to a match, I thought,
       in 88.

    0. It is difficult this, but I want you to try and think
       back to 1988.  You weren't expecting this, I have no
       doubt, so it may be a bit difficult.  I want you to
       think back to about 2 o'clock, 1988, okay? - A. Yes.

    Q. Just describe to me what the terrace was like at that
       time? - A. Tnere was plenty of room.

    Q. Plenty of room? - A. Yes, plenty        ofroom. You could
       chat and move, no problem.

    Q. Show us on a plan where you were   in1989. (The
       witness marked Exhibit C434) I want to ask you one
       other question about 1988.  When you were in that
       terrace in 1988 did you have occasion to go out to the
       loo or to buy anything? - A. No.

    0. Once you were on it did   you stay? -    A. Just stayed on.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE

    0. Can you go back in your evidence, please, to what
       happened outside the ground?  You have described the
       very bad crush outside, and the way in which you were
                                                                  73

         directed by a Policeman round the corner,    to go through
         the side gate? - A. Yes.

2   Q. Was it quite obvious to you that the large number of
       people in the squashed crowd outside the turnstiles
       were causing difficulty for the people at the front of
       that crowd? - A. Probably.  People were just trying to
       get in the ground.

    0. Trying to get in? - A. Probably the people at the back
       probably couldn't see what was happening at the front,
       so they were just trying to get in.

    0. What were they doing to try and get in? - A. Well you
       just sort of move forward, don't you.  You know, you
       just ....

    Q. Right, and this was causing a big squash at the front
       of the crowd? - A. Yes, probably, against the wall of
       the turnstiles.

D   0. In what you saw, do you agree that it is quite likely
       that if something had not been done, by opening a side
       gate as happened, then it is quite likely that people
       would have been injured outside the turnstiles? - A.
       Possibly, well, definitely, I would say.

    Q. Definitely? - A. Definitely.

              THE CORONER:   I don't think you should take it
         any further than that.

              MR. PAYNE:     Yes.   I don't know whether the point
         is in dispute.

              THE CORONER:     I don't think it is in dispute.

              MR. PAYNE:     No, I would hope not but one never
         knows.

              THE CORONER:     I don't know, it may be in dispute.
    0.        MR. PAYNE:   Anyway, that is your view.  I wonder
         if you can help the Jury about the question which they
         may also have in mind about this opening of the gate
         and people going in, in the way in which you did.   I am
         not criticising you for doing it because you were told
         by a Policeman to do it.  There is going to be evidence
         later on in the Inquest, we understand, that this
         action of having to open the gate to relieve the
         terrible crush outside and avoid people being injured,
         this is the first time in the history of the ground
         that that had had to happen.  Can you, as a visitor to
         the ground that day, just as an ordinary football fan

attending as you did, can you offer any explanation as
to why this should have happened on 15th April?

     THE CORONER:   No, I don't think that is a proper
question, I am sorry.

     MR. PAYNE:    Very well.

     THE CORONER:   It is an interesting question.    I
would like to know his opinion as well but I don't
think it would be of any ....

     MR. PAYNE:   I am just wondering whether it is
helpful to the Jury on the question of how the disaster
occurred.s

     MR. KING:   Sir, what is concerning me more is
telling a witness what the evidence will be.  I don't
know what the evidence is going to be.  Would that I
did.

     THE CORONER:   I am not objecting to that.  He is
putting something, he may well be right, he may be
wrong.  It is the conclusion which I am not so happy
about.

     MR.   KING:   I agree with that as well, sir, but I
will get   into trouble if I try  and follow that path.

     MR. PAYNE:   It is an open ended question.  The
witness can give - I am sorry to call you "the witness"
- Mr. Hollinrake can give any answer he wants.

      THE CORONER:    Yes, but I don't think that his
opinion on this point can carry any weight because he
is not an expert in football construction, he hasn't
been to ground.    He doesn't know whether the premise is
r ight, but even if he has accepted the premise that
this was the first time it is actually the point wnicn
you made on an earlier case when you were submitting to
me, that you would need to give him all the factors and
all the facts before you could get an expression of
opinion, so I think ....

     MR. PAYNE:   I don't want him to pass judgment,
sir.  Don't answer the question, Mr. Hollinrake,
because I certainly don't want to ask a question which
is improper.  What I would like to ask him is, as a
football supporter who attended that day, from his
point of view how it happened that such a large crowd
built up to cause this unprecedented crush.
                                        A. J. HOLLINRAKE


     THE CORONER:   No, I am sorry, I may be wrong but
I don't think that is a proper question.  I don't like
saying no to you but I feel that that is right.

     MR. PAYNE:   As you please, sir.

            Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Mr. Hollinrake, you, go through Gate C and you are not
being carried along by any crowd? - A. Not whatsoever.

The tunnel is reasonably clear? - A. Up to getting to
the end of it.

Up to the end? - A. Yes.

when there is a large number .... - A. A solid mass.

Of fans, a solid mass? - A. Yes.

That isn't just at the mouth of the tunnel, but is in
fact inside the tunnel as well? - A. I would say about
a yard back into the tunnel.

Not a good position to watch the game from? - A. Oh no.

But those people were standing there. - A. They were
trying to get forward as probably everybody else.

Were they, or were they just standing there? - A. No, I
wouldn't say they were standing there.  They were
trying to get a good view of thegame likeevery    normal
person would do, I think.

But you shoved through them? - A. I wouldn't say
shoved, I made my way ....

That is the word you used, Mr. Hollinrake, "I sort of
had to push a bit ', and then you said to the Coroner,
"I had to shove a bit to get through". - A. You know,
as you do.  You just have to try and make your way.    I
never forcefully shoved anybody with my hands.

Well, what do you mean by shove, other than what we all
understand you mean by shove?  Push hard. - A. Well,
push hard with your body.

Why didn't you wait your turn for the people infront
of you to go through onto the terracing rather than to
shove and push your way through? — A. By the time I got
on the terracing these people were probably stood where
they wanted to watch the game.
                                        A. J. HOLLINRAKE


I thought you were telling us that you came across
these people who were a yard into the tunnel and you
pushed your way through them? - A. They were probably
trying to do the same as me, trying to get onto the
terracing.

But you could have waited behind them and not pushed
until they had gone, cleared the tunnel, and you would
have then walked forward onto the terrace? - A. Well,
it is not something you really think about when you are
there.  You are just trying to get onto the ground to
watch the match.

Didn't you think that if you could get onto the terrace
easily those people would also have got onto the
terrace easily and it was important not to push or
shove your way through but just to wait? - A. If I go
to Anfield I do exactly the same, if it was there.




          Q. But it wasn't Anfield,   this
                                                   A. J. HOLLINRAKE

Q. It was not Anfield. This was somewhere new to you? -
   A. Any normal football fan would have done that.

Q. It was just close to kick-off? - A. Yes.

Q. You must have been anxious not to miss anything? - A.
   I was anxious to watch the game. I never forcefully
   knocked anybody out of the way to get in to watch the
   game.

Q. Do you not perhaps think with hindsight now it would
   have been better not to have .done that? Isounds of
   disapproval from the public^

     MR. ISAACS:   It would be much easier, sir, when
asking these questions if there was no noise from behind
me, so much easier. These are difficult matters. We have
all faced this now for any number of days.

     THE CORONER:       I agree with you and I do not think it
helps.

       MR. ISAACS:     I am obliged and it does not help at
all.

                     Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:
Q. Mr. Hollinrake, it is an important and interesting
   issue. You were being asked by Mr. Isaacs just now
   about what you may or may not have done with
   hindsight. What I am interested in is what you were
   doing as an ordinary football fan? - A. Yes.

Q. You havemuch experience as a football fan? - A.Yes,
   years and years.

Q. Was your behaviour that day any different than that
   which from your experience football fans behave in? -
   A. No, I wouldn't say so because everybody wants for
   to see the game.

Q. You were acting     in a way that football fansdo act
   when they arrive     on the terraces? - A. Yes, Iwould
   say so. I have      never caused any trouble in a
   football ground     in my life.

Q.    You werenot in a regiment of soldiers under a
     Sergeant Major, were you? - A. No, there was only two
     of us.

Q. You were not being marched along and told "Stop,
   move, stop, move"? - A. No, it was just of my own
   free will.
                                            A. J. HOLLINRAKE

Q. You were a football fan who was trying to make his
   way on to a terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. The fact is, of course, when you entered the terrace
   at the back it was full at the back, was it not? - A.
   Yes.

Q. Has your experience at other grounds, Anfield for
   example, has that prevented you getting on to the
   terrace and finding a space eventually? - A. No, you
   always do what you have to do to get your space.

Q. You yourself do not have any knowledge when you enter
   a terrace of what it is going to be like, do you? -
   A. I vaguely knew what Leppings Lane was like from
   the year before.

Q. You do not know exactly the state of the terrace? -
   A. No, you don't know how many is going to be on or
   anything.

Q. Are you prepared, however, if you are given
   directions to obey directions? - A. Yes.

Q. On this occasion you went down the tunnel and no one
   prevented you? - A. No, nobody whatsoever.

Q. At Anfield, is it right, when you enter the terrace
   you can spread out across the whole width of the
   terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. Even though it might be blocked at the entrance point
   you can work your way through and then go across? -
   A. Anfield is a lot better.

Q. Did you, as an experienced football fan, as you
   entered the tunnel and went down it to enter the
   terrace, see anything of the behaviour of the people
   around you who were behaving any differently from
   that which you expect and anticipate at a football
   match? - A. None whatsoever.

Q. I am now talking about what you can expect football
   fans to do at a match? - A. They were just trying to
   get on to the terraces.

              Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN;

Q. Mr. Hollinrake, would you say that no one seemed to
   be in control outside the turnstiles when you arrived
   there?

     THE CORONER:   Hang on for a minute. If I do not let
Mr. Payne ask a question about what he was trying to ask
                                            A. J. HOLLINRAKE

then I cannot let you ask a question in exactly the same
form but aimed at the opposite issue.

     MR. KING:   Sir, while Mrs. McBrien is thinking
through that, and I do not mean this rudely, there is
something I ought to have put to this witness about 1988.

     THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, you sit down and think
about what I have just said and Mr. King will ask his
questions and then I will let you stand up again.

            Further Cross-Examined bv MR. KING:

Q. Mr. Hollinrake, at about two o'clock in 1988 you say
   there was plenty of room on the terrace and you could
   move about? - A. Yes.

Q. I assume, however, that it built up so that it
   reached a point where you could not move about so
   easily? - A. Yes.

Q. It reached a point when it was perhaps more like a
   full terrace? - A. Yes, a tightly packed terrace.

Q. What I am interested in 1988 is, you did not have any
   difficulty particularly then yourself, did you? - A.
   No, none whatsoever.

Q. You were in the centre pen, Pen 3? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you look to the right to the pen on the other
   side of you? You might have looked to your right
   anyway? - A. What, in 1988?

Q. Yes? - A. I cannot remember.

Q. You might have looked round? - A. Quite possibly.

Q. Did it look in 1988 that to the right of you, not
   exactly where you but stretching to the corner, that
   there were lots of people there also? - A. I can't
   remember.

Q. Do you ever recall any open spaces in 1988 round
   about kick-off time to your right hand side? Huge
   open spaces to your right in 1988? - A. I wouldn't
   say huge open spaces. It probably weren't as tightly
   packed as middle. I think most football grounds are
   never quite as tightly packed.

Q. You did not notice any huge open spaces? - A. No, not
   huge open spaces.
                                              A. J. HOLLINRAKE

Q. You obviously do not know from 1988 how individual
   people got into the various parts of the entrances? -
   A. No, I just thought there was the one entrance
   which was the one I went down.

Q. You did? - A. Yes.

Q. You do not know how the people to your right got on
   the terraces? - A. No idea.

            Cross-Examined bv MRS. McBRIEN (Cont'dU

     MRS. McBRIEN:   I am not sure that this will be a
question either really.

     THE CORONER:     Try it and if I do not like it I will
say so.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:   Mr. Hollinrake, I think you said
     you felt something should be done to help people
     outside the turnstiles?

     THE CORONER:   I do not remember him saying that. I
asked him whether he could see people who were distressed.


Q. I think you said, yes to that, Mr. Hollinrake? - A.
   Yes, people in distress.

     THE CORONER:   I cannot ask whether he was asked that
question. Can anybody remember from their notes whether he
was specifically asked that something should be done
outside?

     MR. MANNING: What I think he said, sir, is, "People
would definitely have been hurt if something hadn't been
done".

       THE CORONER:   Yes, I think he did say that.

     MR. KING:   I think that was the beginning of the
questioning, sir.

     THE CORONER:  Which in the end I stopped. I do not
object to that. That is fair enough because that is his
observation.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:   I do not know if this part is
     appropriate either but I was going to say that as you
     are not an expert in crowd control you would not be
     expected to know what the correct measures were that
     needed to be taken, were you? - A. No.
                                         A. J. HOLLINRAKE

You would expect the people who were responsible for
crowd control out there to take the correct measures?
- A. I suppose if people are being crushed somebody
has to do something, whoever is in authority.

Just one more question. Can you describe the lad who
said to you, "Help me, please help me"? - A. He was
25 years of age roughly. He had short black hair and
like a white rugby-style top. That is all I can
remember of him.

            Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL:
Mr. Hollinrake, when you were waiting to go through
the turnstiles you have described being in a position
where you were squashed in what we call the turnstile
area? - A. Yes, it was tightly packed.

This was before a Policeman told you that there was
another way in? - A. He said, "Go round the side.
There is a gate open".

I am sorry? - A. He said to go round to the side as
there was a gate open.

At that stage you were about a third of the way down
the funnel bar? - A. Yes, the small barrier.

The small barrier that goes to the right hand side of
the turnstile? - A. Yes.

I think you also said you were about two yards in
from that bar? - A. Yes, because I remember going
under the bar to get round.

I am sorry? - A. I went under the bar to get round to
the gate.

I was going to say, how did you then make your way
out of that tightly packed crowd? - A. People went to
the right to the concertina gate and it eased off
slightly because there was other people going under
the bar besides me.

You followed other people from the turnstile area on
the turnstile side of the little barrier? - A. Yes.

Through into the area on the riverside of that little
barrier? - A. Yes.

Then made your way down to the gate? - A. Through the
concertina gate.

              THE CORONER:   Mr. Hollinrake, I am most obliged
         to you for your help. Do not worry about these
         interchanges. These happen from time to time and it
B        does not actually matter because all we are trying to
         establish, as far as we can, from you is what the
         facts are and your opinions where they are relevant,
         so to speak? - A. Yes.

         That is not to say you do not have very valuable
         opinions but obviously the Jury draw their own
         conclusions and you must not substitute their opinion
         for theirs. Thank you very much. - A. Thank you.

    Q.   You are Paul David Twidale, is that right? - A. Yes,
         that is correct.

    Q.   Can you give us your address? - A.
D        Wallasey.

    Q.   You, I take it, are a Liverpool supporter? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Were you at the ground in 1988 for the 1988 Semi
         Final? - A. No.

    Q. You did come to the 1989 one? - A. Yes.

    Q. I cannot remember how you came.    Did you come by? -
       A. In a car, my dad's car.

    Q. There were several friends of yours? - A. Five of us
       altogether.

    Q. Your brother or was it your dad? - A. My dad.

    Q. You had tickets I think, that is right, is it not? -
       A. Yes.

    Q. What time did you leave home about? - A. It was early
       morning. It was around nine o'clockish.

    Q. What time did you arrive? - A. We got there around
       two.

    Q. Around two? - A. Two to quarter past.

    Q. Was it longer than you had expected or had you
       stopped en route somewhere? - A. No, the roadworks by
       Stockport.

                                            P. D. TWIDALE

It was the Manchester end you were held up at? - A.
Yes.

Having parked you made your way to the ground? - A.
Yes.

What time did you get to Leppings Lane? - A. We must
have got down there around half past two.

Did you get in through a turnstile? - A. Yes, the
first ones you come to down Leppings Lane.

Did you have any particular difficulty getting
through? - A. Yes, it was chocker then.

I am sorry? - A. It was chocker then, you couldn't
move. You couldn't get near them.

How long would you say it took to get through? - A. I
would say about quarter of an hour.

I think you saw a mounted Officer trying to do
something or other? - A. Yes, there was one just
outside the turnstiles but by that time everyone was
in anyway. You couldn't get near the turnstiles.

Did you find the perimeter gates were open or shut?
You know the perimeter gates, the big blue gates? Do
you remember those? - A. They were shut, yes.

So how did you get through those? Perhaps you have
made a mistake? - A. Which ones do you mean?




                    /Q. Sergeant Griffiths, can.
                                         P. D. TWIDALE


     THE CORONER: Sergeant Griffiths, can you show him
the perimeter gates.  Walk over to the model and he
will just show you.

     MR. GRIFFITHS:  The witness has indicated, sir,
that the outer gates were open to turnstiles 1 to 16.

     THE CORONER:  Which turnstiles did you go
through?  Show me, which bank? - A.  These ones here.

     MR. GRIFFITHS:   1 to 16, sir.

     THE CORONER:  Before you come back, how did you
enter onto the terracing? - A. Came through these
gates here, and then went straight in.

     THE CORONER: I will get him to repeat it, but I
just wanted him to show us.
You entered through one of those turnstiles which we
know as 1 to 16? - A. Yes.

How did you then get onto the terracing?  Tell me
again because we could not hear you. - A. You went
through the gates after the turnstiles and all you
could see was the tunnel, so the couple of lads who
went there last year, the year before, said, "That's
the way you go in", so we all went down the tunnel.

Yes, but you cannot see the tunnel from where you have
shown.  How did you get from having entered the
turnstile? - A. I am not too sure.  All I remember is
going through and then there were just like loads of
people just round there and we went through the people
and all we could see was a ---

Did you go through a little gate in a wall? - A. I
think so, yes.  All I can remember is going through
all the crowd, because we were getting pushed and we
went right round the side, and then all I could see
was the tunnel.

Do you remember a wall dividing up the concourse area?
- A. Not really, no, vaguely.  It was just too packed.
We were just trying to get in somewhere, trying to get
somewhere where there was a bit of room.  We stayed
outside by the tunnel for about 5 minutes where we all
met, because that's where we said we were meeting.

Were there toilets there? - A. Yes, just to the left I
think they were.

Is that where you were congregating? - A. Yes, just
met there.
                                         P. D. TWIDALE


Next to the toilet is a big long wall, is there not? -
A. Yes.

Can you remember that? - A. Yes, that's where we were,
just by the wall, by the toilets.

If you look at that model, turn round again, do you
see that wall? - A. Just up the top there in the
corner.

How did you get into that corner? - A. I am not too
sure.

Had you come from the other side of the wall? - A. I
am not too sure.  I just went with the crowd as we
came in through the turnstiles.

Having stood there for a little while you went down
the tunnel? - A. Yes.

Was the tunnel clear? - A. It wasn't too bad.  There
was a few people in it, walking their way down, but it
was quite clear.

Was the exit of it clear, or did you have a crowd in
front of you? - A. It wasn't that bad, but it was
building up at the time.

You got through onto the terracing and you turned
right, I believe, is that correct? - A. Yes.

What did you then do? - A. Well, that is where we
normally stand with the games at Anfield.  We usually
go to the right a bit and behind the goal.

Yes. - A. As we went right, we went for a little while
anyway and it was just too packed, you couldn't move
to the side so we just stayed there for a bit.  We
just stayed at the side for a bit, we just stayed
until it cleared because we couldn't move anywhere.
So we thought it might clear and then try and make our
way further.

So are you saying that you went to the right and
towards the back? - A. At first we were going to go
down.

What happened then? - A. In the end we just battled
our way back up to the top because it was getting too
bad.  I was like with my dad and that.

What was happening when you first got onto the
terrace, what was happening on the pitch? - A.
Nothing.
                                          P. D. TWIDALE


There were not any players or anything? - A. No.

So you wanted to stay immediately behind the goal, is
that right? - A. Yes.

You then say it got too bad.  Was it because there was
surging, or what was going on? - A. Yes, there were
just people coming in and they were just going
nowhere.

So where did you move to? - A. We went right down to
the right and we hit the fence, we were just by the
fence.  So we managed to make our way up to the top of
that fence.

First of all you went down? - A. Yes, to the side.
And then you went up towards the back along the fence?
- A. Yes.

When you were doing that, what was happening on the
pitch at that point? - A. Nothing.  It was only until
we got to the back that the players came out.

I see.  Had you seen the beach ball being knocked
about? - A. No, I can't remember.

You do not remember that.  Did you hear the
announcement of the teams over the Tannoy? - A. No.
Like I say, by the time they came out, wehad  only
just got up the top.

So what you are saying is that you had actually got
into the pen, you had crossed it diagonally? - A. Yes.

It had been pretty tight and uncomfortable? - A. Yes.

And you had worked your way back up to the back? - A.
Yes.

Right up against the back, is that correct? - A. Yes.

It was then when you were in that position that the
players came out? - A. Yes.

Can you describe what it was like right up against the
wall where you were? - A. It wasn't too bad.      It was
all right up the top because we thought the gate was
just running down, it was a different section, but
there was a gate open   at the top you could walk
through, and that was   pretty clear.

That is what I want to find out about, that little
gate.  That was the gate at the top end of the
railing, was it not? - A. Yes.
                                          P. D. TWIDALE


Because I think you were standing virtually next to
it, were you not? - A. I was standing on the gate as
it opened.

Tell me what was happening with regard to people and
that gate.  Was it being used or not? - A. No, not
really.  There were only a few coming up.  I don't
think anyone knew it was there.

Did it have any 2-way traffic?  Do you know what I
mean by that? - A.   No, just people coming out.

Out of Pen 3? - A.   Yes, out of Pen3.

Could you see what   the pen next to you on the right
looked like? - A. There were a few people in it.    It
wasn't as full as Pen 3.

You saw the players come out - yes? - A. Yes.

You then saw the kick-off, I take it? - A. Yes.

Did you see Beardsley hit the cross-bar? - A. Yes.

Did you see the match stop? - A. I didn't notice.  I
was worried about what was going on down at the front.
Someone started climbing over.

At what time did you begin to look towards the front
to see what was going on? - A. It was just after the
kick-off.  You could see surges coming in.  I was like
on the back, on the fence, with my mate, so you could
see all down the crowd, the heads, and you could see
all surges going down.  That was from the kick-off.

That was just about kick-off time, do you say? - A.
Yes.

You could see that? - A. Yes.

Could you see whether anybody was being hurt at that
point in time? - A. No, not until the first one
started getting pulled out.  It was a couple of
minutes into the game.

You were right on the back wall, were you not? - A.
Yes.

Did anybody in that row comment on what was going on
that you can remember? - A. We were the only ones that
seemed to see it, me and my mate, because we were like
on the fence so we were higher.
                                          P. D. TWIDALE


What were the people who were standing on the back
wall doing then? - A. They couldn't see nothing.   The
first thing anyone knew was when they started climbing
over the fences.

Did you notice whether anybody attempted to leave the
pen through that gate which you were on, or through
that opening, after it became obvious that something
was going on in the front? - A. After, yes, they came
up there to get up on top.

You mean to go up into the' stands? - A. Yes.

When did you first notice people going up into the
stands? - A. I had seen a couple before the kick-off
because it was getting packed then, but then it was
mainly just after the kick-off they were all coming up
and getting pulled up.  They were all pulling them up
from the top.

Did you see any Officers or vans, or anybody, at the
front signalling to people to push back, or anything
like that? - A. Yes, they were telling them to get
back.

What were they doing? - A. Just putting their hands up
saying "Get back".

You, of course, could not go back because you were
against the wall? - A. Yes.

Could you have gone sideways into the other pen? - A.
Yes.

I do not want this to be critical of you, but I just
want to know why did you not do that? - A. Well, we
were helping people get up.  There were all girls and
that and we were putting them up for the lads on top
to pull them up because as we were there we could see
it was quite empty and then a Policeman came and he
was directing them all through.  But we were just
standing there helping people get up.

Is it not easier for people to go into an empty pen
through a gateway than to be pulled into a stand?
This is the bit that puzzles me. - A. By the time
everyone knew what was going on people were panicking.
You couldn't tell half of them.  We were telling half
of them to go through, but you couldn't tell them,
they just wanted to get up to get out.  They thought
it was just as bad down the other side as well.

So what you are saying is that people were not
responding to your suggestions to go out through that
                                            P. D. TWIDALE


side? - A. A few of them went down to the side, but
half of them just wanted to get up, they wanted to get
out .

You mentioned that a Policeman eventually turned up at
this gate? - A. Yes.

Did he have any better success than you? - A. Yes,
because he was sort of telling people more forceful to
get in there.

The people who were being pulled up, were they in fact
distressed or not? - A. Yes.

As you could see? - A. Yes.  Some of them were very
distressed.  You would tell them to go down into the
other pen and they were just crying and just saying,
"Just get me out", and they thought going down there
was just as bad, so they were just getting pulled up.
They wanted to get out.

But you could see that that pen was not anywhere near
as full, is that right? - A. Yes, it wasn't anywhere
near as full.

Is it right that, in fact, you did not really become
aware of real problems until you saw people go over
the front fence, is that right, or did you know
before? - A. We knew before, that is why we went to
the back, because it was just getting that bad, just
as you came out of the tunnel, the build-up and it
just wasn't going nowhere.  You were getting another
person on your back, but you weren't moving forward,
to the side or nothing.

Once you got to that position you were reasonably
comfortable, in fact? - A. At the back, once we got to
the back, yes.

Can you show us on a plan where you were?
(Witness marks plan)

     MRS. PERKINS:   That is C435.

     THE CORONER:  The first position is where you
felt you were uncomfortable and you then moved back up
into that position No.2 which you have shown us? - A.
Yes.

That is, in fact, where you remained right through
until you eventually left the terracing? - A. Yes.

           Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:
                                          P. D. TWIDALE


When you were at position 1, did you say that the
players were or were not out on the field? - A. No, it
was only when I went up the back, only in the second
position did the players come out then.

Have you given an estimate of how long it was before
the players came out that you moved from position  1 to
position 2? - A. About 10 minutes.

          Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS:

Mr. Twidale, you are sitting on the fence? - A. Yes,
or standing on it.

And you are with your mate? -A. Yes.

That is before the teams came out? - A. It was just as
we got there, about a minute later the teams came out.

So that is about 6 minutes before kick-off, we know
that? - A. Yes, around that approximately.




                       /Q. The gate that you
                                             P. D. TWIDALE


The gate you were sitting close to was open? -A. Yes.

There were some people going through from pen 3 into the
relatively empty pen, pen 2? - A. Yes.

I don't think you will be able to help.   Please do so if
you can, but if you can't remember, say so.   The people
who were using that way to go into the emptier pen, could
you see where they were coming from? - A. Just at the
back, because people would see it when they got to the
back.   Once they made their way at the back.   It was
getting too packed.   They saw them and thought, "Let's
go this way.    Like we did, really.

It wasn't only the people who were right next to the gate
who went through it?   People did seem to you to be
making their way to the gates as long as they were at the
back? - A. Yes, as long as you could see it, because
nobody could see it.

If you think back now, the gate being open, there were
some people who appeared to be at the back and moving
towards the gate and then through the gate? - A. Some of
them, yes.

As well as those who found themselves right next to the
gate and must have thought to themselves, "What's going
on here?   Oh, there's a gate here, let's go through." -
A. Yes.

So there were those two different sorts of people who
went through the gate? - A. Yes.

Those who made their way to the gate from the back and
those who were right next to the gate? - A. Yes.

            Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING:

Can I try to look at the two people who had oeen lifted
up into the seats above. - A. There were loads of them.

There were loads after the kick-off? - A. Yes, those were
the first two.

There were two I think you referred to who were before
kick-off? - A. Yes.

Had you heard them say anything about why they were being
lifted up? - A. Yes.

What had you heard them say? - A. They were saying, "It's
chocka down there.   You can't breathe.  Pull us up", to
the lads at the top.
                                             P. D. TWIDALE


Were you actually one of the people who helped either of
those two to get up? - A. No, not at first.

When they said, "It's chocka", did you say or did you
hear anybody else say, "Go through this gate on to the
other side, there's space there"? - A. No.

You didn't say that? - A. He had already seen the gates.
He was standing by it with us.

I'm sorry? - A. He had  seen the gate because he was
there, but he was just   like all fullof sweat and his
shirt was ripped.   I remember seeing his shirt ripped.

Afterwards, after the kick-off, a lot of people were
being lifted up? - A. Yes.

Presumably it took two of you to lift somebody up? - A.
Yes.   Well, some of them we were just giving them a lift
on to where the railings were and then when they were
stood on that they could reach up anyway.

It would have been much quicker, in dealing with numbers
of people, for them to  have gone through the gate to the
other side? - A. Yes.    You couldn't talk to them.   They
just wanted to get out.   They were hysterical, some of
them.

You on a number of occasions tried to suggest to people
they should go through the gate and that there was plenty
of room on the other side? - A. Like I said, the
Policeman came just afterwards, when people started
drifting up.

We are taking this in stages and I understand the last
stage is when the Policeman arrived and he very
definitely said to people, "Get through there, there is
room on the other side ? - A. Yes.

And they did what the Policeman said? - A. Yes.   Some of
them, but some of them still wanted to get out.

Some of them still wanted to get up? - A. Yes.

Before that Policeman arrived when there was a load of
people at the back all wanting to clamber somewhere, you
tried on a number of occasions to get those people to go
through the gates, saying, "Come through the gate.
There is room on the other side.    There is plenty of
room on the other side.    Come through this way"? - A.
Well, I didn't enforce it.    I just said, "Come through
the gate."    I was standing on the gate and said,
"Through here", but like I said, you couldn't talk to
half of them.
                                              P. D. TWIDALE


It is right that it would have been much quicker for them
to have gone through that gate and into the other side? -
A. Well, the amount of people getting pulled up, they
were getting pulled up right across it.   There were
hundreds going up.

Of course they weren't on the railings, were they?   They
didn't have the railing that they could stand on? - A.
No, they were just giving them bunks up.

That is   right, there were a couple of   people down below
passing   them up to a couple of people   up above? -A. Yes.

All of that could have been dealt' with more quickly if
people had taken notice of you and gone through the gate?
- A. I don't know because it was only a small gate.
Hundreds were going up at a time.

I don't   think hundreds were going up.   - A. Tnere were
loads of them.

There were a lot of people going up but they could have
come past you and into the other side? - A. Could have
done.

              Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Could I just investigate this gate for one moment?   When
you entered the terrace down the tunnel were you aware
there was a gate at the back? - A. No.

Just have a look at   C.267.

     MR. KING:   That is probably the best photograph,
sir, I can find:

It may not be as clear as I would like to put it to you,
Mr. Twidale, but I will do my best from this photograph.
Perhaps if we start with C.266 first of all.    That is
the entry on to the terrace. That is    a view as you
enter the terrace.   Obviously the difficulty of these
photographs is that the terraces are completely empty.
As you enter from the tunnel on to the terrace you go
past a wall on the left and the right which juts down on
to the terrace? - A. Yes.

So you don't actually arrive on the terrace level with
the back wall, do you? - A. No.

If we go again to 267, if we may.   The gate which we can
see on the left hand side on that photograph is at the
back on the back wall? - A. Yes.
                                            P. D. TWIDALE


So anybody coming out of the tunnel - no doubt this was
your position - looking downwards, or even to their
right, wouldn't be conscious there was a gate at the
back? - A. No.

Of course you didn't enter on to an empty terrace, did
you? - A. No.

When you went on to the terrace you have told us how you
went to your right and downwards to a certain extent and
you described how it was packed even then? -A. Yes.

What was it like, even then, as you entered the terrace?
- A. You couldn't go anywhere, really, you were just
going where the crowd went.

Do I take it from that that everyone around you was
closely packed? - A. Yes.

Again were you conscious at that stage there was a gate
at the back? - A. No.

The impression I got was you made your way down until you
hit a fence, is that right? - A. Yes.

I wonder if we could have the plan back on which you
signed?   Have you shown us on that plan the farthest
point you reached down the pen? - A. No.

Could you show that?   This will be position 2.   You
moved from a position in the middle of the pen by a
barrier over to the perimeter fence? - A. Yes.

Before you hit the fence, did you know you were going to
hit it? - A. No.

What were you hoping to do? - A. Trying to get somewhere
where you could move more freely.

Were you hoping to be able to get across the terrace? -
A. Yes.

You hit the fence and you have described now you made
your way up following the fence up to the back? - A. Yes.
I just went straight away up getting in between people.
People moved out of the way for us.   Some people went
into this area.

I understand.  When you started off following the fence
up the back, did you even then know there was a gate at
the back? - A. Not until we came to it.

If we were looking at an empty pen obviously one can see
the gate, we can see it on the photograph.   It may be an
                                               P. D. TWIDALE


obvious question and it may be an obviously answer, but
what was it that was preventing your seeing the gate? -
A. Just too packed, couldn't see anything.

When you got at the back was there any gangway at the
very back which had been left clear of people? - A. Not
really, everybody was standing at the back.

There wasn't any clear way which left the right at the
back open or the gate completely open? - A. No, not
really.

When I say "completely open", I mean unblocked of people
around it? - A. You couldn't see it until you got to it.

     THE CORONER:   Do you want him to mark the position?
Put another cross on there where you hit the fence and
mark it 1A.   (The witness marked the plan)

     MR. KING:   If I could just show you another
photograph - C.326.

     MR. GRIFFITHS:   Sir, I have done a better acetate.
It ought to be given a different number.

     THE CORONER:   It is a better quality.   We had
better give it a number although it is exactly the same
photograph.

     MR. KING:      Could it be given the number C.326A?

     THE CORONER:      Yes, a good idea - C. 326A.

     MR. KING:    This is the best photograph I can find
of a view as early as I can find it - just before kick-
off.   In fact this is just at kick-off.    It is 14.59.
One can see there the state of the centre pens.
Obviously on this photograph one can't see the gate, but
it is the top left hand corner of the centre pen.    Do
you see where it says "Presto", a big advertisement?
That is over pen 4.   If Mr. Griffiths moves along the
next series of advertisements are over pen 3, where you
were. - A. Yes.

One can see somebody apparently standing up or apparently
trying to clamber over, do you see that? - A. Yes.

They look as if they are clambering either over the fence
to get into the next pen or possibly clambering up to get
into the stand above? - A. Yes.

Is that the sort of event you were describing? - A. Yes.
                                                                 96

                                                       P. D. TWIDALE


     Q. One can see as best we can the state of the packed pen at
        that stage? - A. Yes.

     Q. I am just interested in the amount of room there was even
l|      around you in relation to the gate.    This photograph is
         not very good because it is from a distance.    However,
         we are not dealing with a situation where there were wide
         open spaces at the back? - A. Oh, no.

     Q. Are we dealing with a situation even around you that you
         were in a packed pen? - A. We were still packed.   There
         was more room than the middle.

     Q. Then the position was the people at the back   as far as
        you could tell were not aware of the tragedy   apparently
        happening at the front? - A. No, it was only   when you
        were right on the gate you knew the gate was   there.

                   Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

     Q. Mr. Twidale, did you look at your ticket to see where you
        were to go?    You said you went through turnstiles 1 to
D       16, but A to G turnstiles lead to the terrace where you
        went.    Did you know that? - A. No.   We just went in the
         turnstiles where everyone was going in.   We all had
        different tickets anyway, but everyone seemed to go for
         the same turnstiles.  We didn't know where to go really.
        We were just going there and everyone was heading for the
         turnstiles.   That was the only one we thought was open.




                         Q. So you didn't look

                                                   P. D. TWIDALE

    Q. You didn't look at your ticket at all? - A. Looked at
       the ticket but you couldn't really tell.  It was too
       packed outside.  Once we got in there you couldn't get
       out.  Once you got near the turnstiles you couldn't get
       back out.
B
    o.   Do you think it was possible you were supposed to go
         somewhere else? - A. Might have done, I don't know.

    o.   There was nobody there to help you, you said? - A. No.

    Q.   When you took up your position at the back of the
         terrace was the gate wide open there? - A. Yes, it was
         up against the wall.  It was opened and padlocked on
         the wall.

    Q- It was padlocked? - A. On the wall, yes.
    o,   But when quite a lot of people came in, you couldn't
         see it? Other people coming in wouldn't be able to see
         it with the numbers of people who were standing near
         the entrance, is that right? - A. Yes, you couldn't see
D        it.
         gate.
               You couldn't see it until you actually got to the


    0.   Until you were right by it. When you first took up
         your position there did you see a Police Officer? - A.
         Not up there, no.

    0. In the terrace? - A. Not on the terrace, no.

    0.   There was nobody standing by that gate? - A. No.

    Q.   You say a Police Officer was in the pen later? -   A.
         Later on, yes.

    Q. Where did he come from? - A. I don't know.  I think he
       came from the front or somewhere.  He came from pen 3
       somewhere because I never seen him go, I just seen him
       when he got there.  I don't know if he climbed up from
       the front or from the side or somewhere, but he come
       from pen 3.

    Q. Do you think he could have come down the tunnel? - A. I
       doubt it.

    Q. You don't think so? - A. No.

    Q. Do you know what time that would be? - A. I wouldn't
       know.  It must have been about 10-past-3.

    0. You said when the Police Officer was there - was it at
       that time you saw hundreds going up into the stands? -
       A. Yes.

About that time? - A. Yes.

Were there a substantial number of people also going
through that gate as well then? - A. Yes, as well.

           Cross-Examined by MR. RUSSELL

Can you remember what you were wearing that day? - A.
Yes, a Liverpool auay top.

Would you please look up C360 which is in the bundle in
front of you?  If you follow the photograph in from the
left-hand top corner you come across the outline of a
gate against a wall. - A. Yes. •

Is that you against the gate? - A. It looks like, yes.

What time do you remember in relation      to the start or
finish of the match there being a lot      of people
climbing up into the West Stand, from      your position? -
A. What time were they going up, most      of them?

Yes.  When did they start to go up in large numbers? -
A. About 10-past-3.

Not until 10-past-3,   I see. - A. Yes.

     MR. RUSSELL:   Sir, he has been able to identify
himself.  Perhaps he could assist Sergeant Griffiths in
pointing it out with the pointer?

     THE CORONER:    Yes, it is probably easier if you
pick yourself out.   (The witness picked himself out
on Exhibit C360)                   -------------------

     MR. RUSSELL:   You are standing just behind
someone with a beard? - A. Yes.

Just in pen 2, in fact, rather than       in pen 3? - A.This
one?

Yes, just in pen 2. - A. Yes, I know all these.        They
were the ones I went with.

     THE COROWER:    Are those your friends? - A. Yes.

     MR. RUSSELL:   And the padlocked gate is the one
that we can see? That is the one that is open against
the wall, is it? - A. Yes.

               Further by THE CORONER

Is that right, that you were actually on the pen 2 side
of the fence, or not?  I find it difficult to
                                             P. D. TWIDALE

 distinguish. - A. It opens to pen 2.    It opens the
 other way to pen 2.

. But where were you? Were you still in pen 3? Were you
  just in the gate? - A. I was just the pen 2 side of the
  gate.

      THE CORONER:   Any other questions of this young
 man? Thank you very much, Mr. Twidale.   Ladies and
 gentlemen, for once we have timed it more or less
 right.  I will see you tomorrow, all being well, at 10.

              (In the absence of the Jury)

      THE CORONER:   Can I just say first the names for
 tomorrow, all being well:  Mr. N. Abbott, N. Savage, R.
 Greaves, T. Cully, S. Sweeney, T. Lloyd, L. Lloyd - as
 far as I know they are not related, it is just chance
 - and D. MacArthur.

      MR. PAYNE:   Sir, there are two matters which
 perhaps it might be convenient for me to mention.
 First of all, may I draw your attention to an article
 which was published in the Times newspaper last Friday,
 which on the face of it appears to be dealing with the
 very subject matter of this Inquest, and I draw it to
 your attention for you to take such action, or not to
 take such action, as you think appropriate.

      THE CORONER:     I missed it.

      MR. PAYNE:    It is page 32 of the Times newspaper
 on 1st February, 1991.   You will see the heading of the
 article, and the relevant passage appears to be the one
 that I have marked.

      THE CORONER:   Can I look at it at my leisure?
 You don t want me to study it now, do you?

      MR. PAYNE:   No, certainly not.  You may need to
 give some thought to the implications of what has been
 said, or you may not think it is worthy of taking any
 further, but I thought it was something which ought to
 be drawn to your attention.

      THE CORONER:   Somebody has mentioned to me that
 there was a TV programme where various matters were
 discussed, which I have not seen.  I am just wondering
 whether this is an article which relates to or arises
 out of that particular matter, but I will look at it.
 Thank you very much for drawing it to my attention.

      MR. PAYNE:     The other matter, sir, relates to the
 evidence ....
     THE CORONER:   Mr. Payne, I think Hr. Catchpole
wants to say something on the first point.

     MR. CATCHPOLE:   Before Mr. Payne makes his
submission on that matter, the TV programme you are
referring to was, I believe, the BBC of Wednesday of
last week, when there was an interview conducted with
four people by the name of Taylor, including Lord
Justice Taylor and a number of others.   It was on the
general problems and general state of football today,
but touched on issues that may be relevant.   I am sure
you can get a copy of it from somewhere.   I believe it
is videoed at the club if you can't get it from
elsewnere.

     THE CORONER:   Tnank you very much indeed.  I had
just heard a rumour about it but that is all I knew.   I
did not know any more than that.  Mr. Payne.

      MR. PAYNE:  The other matter could be
considerably more substantial so this may not be the
appropriate moment to deal with it, and it is the
question of the admissibility of expert evidence,
particularly in the context of Mr. Phillips.  I don't
know at what stage you would like to hear me about
that.

     THE   CORONER:   Forgive me for putting it like
this, it   sounds as if I am asking the most trivial
question   first, but how long would you reckon it is
going to   take you to make your submission to me on this
point? -   A. I think I have to say about half an hour.

     THE CORONER:     Are we too tired for that this
afternoon?

     HR. PAYNE:     That is without replies or furtner
discussions.

     THE CORONER:   Unless something extraordinary
happens we are not likely to be able to fit it in
tomorrow afternoon either.  I am reluctant to cancel
the witnesses who we nave pre-warned for this week.
Yes, Mr. King?

   ^ MR. KING:    Sir, could I make a suggestion that we
^°.1^ ^-n stages?  That is to say, find my learned
friend Mr. Payne his half hour to make his submission
to you, don t have any responses from ourselves
immediately - in any event, it gives us time to
consider it - and then fit in the responses?

     THE CORONER:   I would be quite happy with that,
because we don't need to take a decision this afternoon
on this aspect? Whichever way the decision is going to
go, the expert is not going to come immediately.

     MR. KING:   Absolutely, sir, and it would perhaps
help you to fit it in over a number of days, and thus
we would not need so much time.

     THE CORONER:     Yes.    Are you happy with that, Mr.
Payne?

     MR. PAYNE:     Certainly, if that is convenient for
you, sir.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Manning, I know that it is
inconvenient for you but ....

     MR. MANNING:   No, it is not inconvenient, only
that by the time we reach this time there is a feeling
of relief on the one hand and quite tired on the other,
and I must say that although certain remarks have to be
made, to take what is clearly, from the books down
there, a fairly weighty legal submission on board at
this sort of time, I wonder if I dare suggest that
either we stop at a point in the morning, or indeed
start with it in the morning - let the Jury come in
later and let us just come in to time?

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Payne, may I just make an
enquiry with regard to the submission?  Is the
substance of your submission that it is permissible for
me to call an expert witness?

     MR. PAYNE:     Certainly that is part of it.

     THE CORONER:   I^hat I am really asking you is can
you give me the headings of your submission, because if
it were that particular point I don't think you need to
submit to me.  I have always taken the view I can have
an expert witness if I think it is appropriate, but you
may want to develop it along different lines, and if
you could just give me an indicator, if you like, of
your chapter headings, or is that very difficult?   I
don't want to throw your submission by asking you to
say things which would make it more difficult later on.




           MR. PAYNE:        What I propose
     MR. PAYNE: What I propose to do is to put the
submission in the context of the admissibility of expert
evidence generally because I do not think it is possible to
make a decision about whether the evidence of Mr. Phillips
is relevant without also addressing the question of whether
other expert evidence would be relevant and in what
circumstances.

     THE CORONER:      Yes, I see what you mean.

     MR. PAYNE: If I may develop that slightly on a
headings topic subject and that is, this being an Inquest
there are no pleadings, there is no indictment, no charge
sheet and there are no identified alleged offences and so
to a large extent weare in the .dark. I am not
complaining, sir, as it is the nature of proceedings.   We
are in the dark as to what directions ultimately, sir, you
may give to the Jury and one of the main points which may
be helpful to you in coming to a decision is that in order
to decide whether expert evidence will be helpful it is
first necessary to identify what topics and in particular
what aspects of the case will be left to the Jury for their
decision. If it were decided that you were going to leave
particular verdicts to the Jury, having identified the
elements of those verdicts or the elements which have to be
determined in order to reach that verdict, then one has to
have a look then to see whether expert evidence will be
helpful on those particular elements of that particular
verdict.

     THE CORONER:   I see. I think I ought to let you make
your submission. I am quite happy to go on butI sense
that some of you would rather I did not. Are you happy to
press on?

     MR. PAYNE:     Certainly.

     THE CORONER:    Let us press on and you make your
submission and we will then adjourn it and take the next
instalment later on.

     MR. PAYNE: May I make these submissions please in the
context of the relevance of expert evidence generally? On
the question of the admissibility of expert evidence I
recognise the value of that evidence may apply to a verdict
of misadventure, it may do, ie accident or an open verdict
but probably the main value of expert evidence will be
material to a case if the Jury have to consider a verdict
of unlawful killing probably. In order to decide then
whether expert evidence is likely to be helpful it is
necessary to remind oneself what the elements of unlawful
killing are. I propose then to spend a moment or two on
that. May I ask you first of all, sir, to remind yourself
of the salient points of the West London Coroner case of
which I hand in a copy of the All England Report.

     THE CORONER:     This is the ex parte Gray, is it?
     MR. PAYNE: It is, sir. I do not think it is .
necessary to go through the headnote in detail, although I
know it is familiar to you, sir, but just reminding oneself
of the decision where the verdict was quashed and a new
inquest ordered, the reasons were given and these are a
summary of the very helpful guidance in the judgment of
Lord Justice Watkins which has been referred to in
subsequent cases and he said:

     "(1) When directing the jury as to the standard of
    proof required, a coroner ought to direct the jury
    that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable
    doubt if they wished to bring in a verdict which
    involved a finding that a criminal offence had been
    committed and that for other verdicts (except an
    open verdict) they had to be satisfied on the
    balance of probabilities. Furthermore, when
    directing a jury on manslaughter comprising
    unlawful killing alleged to have occurred because
    of neglect on the part of police, the coroner was
    required to direct the jury on four matters:
    firstly that they had to be satisfied, on the
    evidence, of four ingredients, namely (a) that the
    police were under a duty to have regard to the
    health and welfare of the deceased, (b) that in the
    circumstances there was a failure to do what should
    have been done for the health and welfare of the
    deceased, (c) that the failure amounted to a
    substantial cause of death and (d) that the failure
    amounted to recklessness; secondly that the test
    for 'recklessness' was whether a police officer,
    having regard to his duty, was indifferent to an
    obvious and serious risk to the health and welfare
    of the deceased or, recognising that risk to be
    present, deliberately chose to run that risk by
    doing nothing about it; thirdly that a failure to
    appreciate that there was such a risk was not by
    itself sufficient to amount to recklessness; and
    fourthly that the jury could only return a verdict
    of unlawful killing if they could attribute the
    unlawful conduct to a single police officer and
    that on no account should they name or identify any
    such police officer."

Those are the guidelines, sir, and on the question of what
are the ingredients of unlawful killing these are also
considered and digested by the editors in Archbold. It may
be helpful for you, sir, just to have a glance at the
editorial comment and digests and this might be a
convenient moment to do it. I know my learned friend, Mr.
King, has a copy and I would be grateful if he would be
kind enough to place his copy before you, sir, and I could
share my copy with him.

     THE CORONER:    Can you draw my attention to the page
or paragraph please?
     MR. PAYNE: It is page 1954.   Sir, I have      been told by
the Court of Appeal on more than one occasion,      and I
readily accept, that Archbold is not authority      but it is a
very useful digest. It contains  a very useful      digestof
what the authorities amount to.

     THE CORONER:     Which edition is this?

     MR. PAYNE:     I hope it is the latest!   The 43rd edition
it is, sir.

     THE CORONER:   I think it was quite severely
criticised in one of the supplements in the earlier
editions on this point and presumably they have taken the
criticism on board.

     MR. PAYNE: I think they are trying to keep up with
recent developments, sir.   I am going to go straight to
what appears to be material. On page 1954, paragraph (2)
involuntary manslaughter:

    "This is unlawful killing without intent to kill or
    cause grievous bodily harm..."

- that seems to be what we are going to be concerned with
here if anything. Authority is cited:

    "Apart from the intent required the elements of the
    offence same the same as in murder. The rules as
    to causation, time limit of a year and a day..."

- and I do not need to read that.    Going to paragraph 20-
48:

    "The difficulty is to identify the elements which
    may make the killing unlawful: see Andrews...The
    law has gone through a process of development. It
    was formerly held that there was a doctrine of
    constructive manslaughter..."

I shall not read that further.    Then the next paragraph
beginning:

   "The authorities on involuntary manslaughter are
   difficult to reconcile, but the following
   propositions appear to be established:

         (1) The killing is manslaughter if it is
         either

        (a) The result of a grossly negligent
        (thought it may be otherwise lawful) act
        or omission on the part of the
        accused..."
I do not think - certainly not for my purpose - (b)
applies. If anything we are likely to be concerned with
here the result of the grossly negligent omission on the
part of the accused. That is probably what the case will
be about, if anything, and then we have to consider what is
gross negligence and that is digested at the next page, the
bottom of page 1955, 20-49, under the heading "Gross
negligence":

    "(1) It would have been satisfactory to have been
    able to say, as was suggested in the 39th edition
    of this work, that 'gross negligence' was
    equivalent to 'recklessness' as defined in 17-24,
    ante. Certainly a direction to this effect could
    only be criticised on the ground that it was too
    favourable to the accused. The position however is
    not so simple, and it is necessary to refer to
    certain of the authorities."

Then he refers to certain authorities which I intend to
pass over and I come down to the bottom of the paragraph,
about the middle of the page, a very short paragraph which
says "It should be noted that" and, sir, I am taking the
liberty of missing out a big chunk. About two thirds of
the way down:

    "It should be noted that in involuntary
    manslaughter by negligence there must be both a
    duty to take care and a high degree of negligence,
    which however need not necessarily amount to
    recklessness."

    I have deliberately been very selective in this
exercise because this is not an address on the law and is
intended only really to highlight the points which are
necessary to decide about the admissibility of expert
evidence. What may be helpful to notice, sir, out of
Archbold is that Archbold certainly thinks that involuntary
manslaughter - and I am not saying that Archbold is
authority but merely observing that in digesting the
authorities these are the headings which come out -
includes consideration of gross negligence ie there has to
be gross negligence or, another way of putting it, a high
degree of negligence before you get to involuntary
manslaughter ie unlawful killing.

    The way that it is put in this book is something which
has to be looked at the same time as looking at the
guidelines given in the West London Coroner case. I am
putting it shortly, and I hope to the point, that they are
all relevant to this question of admissibility of expert
evidence.

    One other point which has emerged from looking at these
authorities is that the standard of proof is the criminal
standard ie beyond reasonable doubt. There is one other
aspect of the case which needs to be looked at in law
before I just go on to develop the point about expert
evidence and that is that the standard of care which is
required depends upon the circumstances and the
circumstances include that there may be an emergency or a
dilemma. There is a useful section in Clerk & Lindsell on
this topic when one comes to look at the relevance of
negligence. May I hand in a section from Clerk & Lindsell
16th Edition at page 503? I have deliberately copied the
whole of this section although I am not going to read it
all out but I hope, sir, it would be helpful. They are the
paragraphs under the heading of "Emergency, dilemma or
sport" where the editors of Clerk & Lindsell collect
together all the authorities which touch on this subject
and start off at paragraph 10-69 which says:

    "Another manifestation of the rule that the degree
    of care varies with the circumstances is that a
    person who takes a reasonable decision as to a
    course of action in an emergency or dilemma or in
    the heat of a sporting pastime will not be treated
    as having acted negligently if the course of action
    decided upon turns out to have been the wrong one.
    All that is necessary is that the decision should
    not have been unreasonable taking the exigencies of
    the particular situation into account."

Here one can just pause to notice that the exigencies of a
particular situation would be that the Police were dealing
with an unprecedented emergency outside the gates, by
taking action to avoid the obvious risk of injury to people
outside the gates, and those were the exigencies of the
situation in which, if the verdict of unlawful killing were
to be returned in respect of what happened inside the
ground, the Jury would have to be sure beyond reasonable
doubt that in the exigencies of the emergencies outside the
gate the Police were then indifferent to another obvious
risk of injury inside the ground. Merely by stating that
one hopes to demonstrate the very high standard of proof
which will be required.




                              /Sir, that I think...
         Sir, that I think - I hope - in very short
summary being the background to the relevant
considerations, what one notices then is this, that if the
Jury were to consider a verdict of unlawful killing - and
this does not apply only to the Police but would apply to
any candidate the Jury might think was indifferent to an
obvious risk of injury in any respect - then it is
necessary for the Jury to identify a particular individual
and some particular conduct which qualifies for the
verdict.  Then the Jury cannot, of course, say what or who
they are in their verdict, but in order to reach that
stage they have got to focus upon the particular.

         The Jury have shown during this Inquest
considerable independent interest in various aspects of
the case going quite outside whatever the advocates happen
to have been investigating at any particular time.  Their
questions have shown that they have got a very
independent-minded approach to it.  So that broadly if the
Jury do have to consider whether anyone were indifferent
to an obvious risk of injury which caused the deaths, then
the Jury may be considering that of their own initiative
broadly under the headings of the candidates (I am not
identifying individuals) under Police, engineer, Club,
Local Authority, possibly Fire Service.

          What particular conduct could be identified which
anyone under any of those umbrella heads may have been
"guilty" of which can then qualify as unlawful killing
remains to be seen.   That is why I say, there being no
pleadings, no charge sheet, no offences, no indictment, no
one knows exactly who is accused of what.   So that the
Jury understandably, because it is an Inquest, are being
left at the moment, and have been for the past two months
or so, to draw their own conclusions and to think it out
for themselves.   One does not know quite how far they may
take that in their own deliberations, although of course
they will be guided by your summing up, but it will be
necessary for them to focus on something by somebody
specific.

         Now one is approaching the question of the
relevance of expert evidence because when anybody knows
what the particular conduct in question is going to be
called into question, then one has to consider whether
expert evidence would be helpful on that particular topic.
So that all I can say at the moment about it is this, that
since we do not know what particular conduct of what
individual may be identified in the frame, as it were, the
likelihood is that the conduct by any of these people
under any of these umbrellas will be by a specialist in
his particular field, engineering, or ground layout, or
Policing, or whatever.  So anybody who did anything
"wrong" will have done it in his capacity as a specialist,
exercising his specialist function.

          Now when one gets to that stage, one then
recognises that at the very least what one is talking
about is negligence by a specialist.   In fact, what has to
be proved for the unlawful killing is a good deal more
than negligence, but certainly one has to get over
negligence.   So that when one is talking about negligence
by a specialist, then the standard of care is at the least
that the specialist failed to measure up to the ordinary
standard expected of such a specialist exercising such a
function.

         That is broadly the effect of the decision in
Bolam and recently approved and made perfectly plain that
this applies generally in the case of Gold -v- Haringey. I
wonder if it would be helpful if I just handed in a copy
of that.    I think I have marked that copy with the
passages that are helpful just on this point about what
negligence is by a specialist.    It is a medical negligence
case, but the passages of general application appear at
page 891G.   This is the unanimous decision of the Court of
Appeal.    I ought to give the reference:  1987 2 All
England Reports, p.888. Reading from page 891G:

         "In directing the jury in Bolam, Mr. Justice
    McNair said:

         'A medical man is not guilty of negligence if he
         has acted in accordance with a practice accepted
         as proper by a responsible body of medical men
         skilled in that particular art ... merely because
         there is a body of opinion that takes a contrary
         v ie w . '"

         One knows what happened subsequently in Maynard,
where the Judge at first instance was confronted with the
problem of having two batches of medical experts giving
different views and he chose between them.  He was
roundly, unfortunately, overruled by the House of Lords
eventually saying you are not allowed to do that.   If you
have got rival experts then basically the Plaintiff cannot
win because if you have got a body of expert opinion which
backs up the conduct criticised, then even though there is
another body of opinion which criticises that conduct you
cannot say that the conduct fell below the ordinary
standard of care and skill.

         The other passage in Gold is at 893G, which makes
it clear that this is of general application:

         "Was the judge right when he held that the Bolam
    test is an exception to the ordinary rule in actions
    for negligence?  If by an 'exceptional rule' the judge
    meant that the Bolam test is confined to actions
    against doctors, then I would respectfully disagree.
    I have already quoted a passage from Mr. Justice
    McNair's summing up in Bolam's case.  In an earlier
    passage he had said:

         '.... where you get a situation which involves
         the use of some special skill or competence, then
         the test whether there has been negligence or not
         is not the test of the man on top of a Clapham
         omnibus, because he has not got this special
         skill.  The test is the standard of the ordinary
         skilled man exercising and professing to have
         that special skill.'

         So far as I know that passage has always been
    treated as being of general application whenever a
    defendant professes any special skill.  It is so
    treated in Charlesworth on Negligence. The Bolam test
    is not confined to a defendant exercising or
    professing the particualr skill of medicine.  If there
    had been any doubt on the question, which I do not
    think there was, it was removed by the speech of Lord
    Diplock in the Sidaway case, where Lord Diplock made
    it clear that the Bolam test is rooted in an ancient
    rule of common law applicable to all artificers."

Then they go on and deal with the notorious case of Saif
Ali, which is well-known and I do not think I need to read
any more. In my submission, it is well established that
the Bolam test is of general application.

          So that what one has here then is if some
particular conduct by some particular specialist is, in
fact, to be criticised, then the Jury will have to
consider the question of whether that particular conduct
fell below the standard of ordinary care and skill of a
particular specialist exercising that function, and in
order to be able to decide that question, in my
submissiosn, it would be helpful for the Jury to have
expert evidence to provide guidance as to what was the
ordinary standard of care and skill in such circumstances
and what was to be expected at that time, and not with
hindsight.

         This is of particular importance because many,
many questions have been asked, in fact, by Mr. King of
many witneses during the case - and he is not alone in
asking this sort of question - of witnesses to give their
impression and their opinion of what the situation was and
how it compared with other circumstances.  This has been
done widely.  I am not criticising Mr. King for doing it,
and I have certainly done it myself, but all that must be
kept very firmly in perspective by the Jury, and I know
you have been very, very astute to frequently remind the
Jury of this point, quite correctly in my submission, that
they must not look at it with hindsight, but must put
themselves in the situation as it was at the time.  I know
we have all done that and we have all tried to remind the
Jury of that.

         However, it is important when one comes to this
specialist conduct that, in my submission, the Jury may be
assisted by the evidence of someone who will say what the
appropriate standard was at the time and, in particular,
what apapropriate standard may have been expected at the
time of a specialist dealing with one unprecedented
emergency, i.e. the one outside the ground, and in those
circumstances at that time, if it comes to the Police,
what a specialist would have done in respect of another
concurrent unprecedented emergency.   That is one aspect.

         May I just finally say one more thing and then I
think I have finished, and it is this, particularly with
regard to the Police, that another particularly helpful
aspect of independent evidence would be to show what at
that time was the current standard of Policing of the
arrival of crowds at football matches, and one knows that
Mr. Phillips has, in fact, addressed that topic and that
he has obtained a number of films of crowds arriving at
other football matches on gala occasions which are very
useful evidence to show the kind of behaviour of people
arriving at football matches which the Police had to be
prepared to expect, and the difference in behaviour from
one occasion to another.

         This, in fact, does have some bearing on the
question which you stopped me from asking the witness
earlier on today, and it may well be that that is not an
appropriate witness to ask the question, but it is
certainly a question which does need to be answered, in my
submission, which is how it was that this unprecedented
emergency arose outside the ground when in all the history
of the ground nothing of this sort had occurred before.
That is a material question on the question of how the
disaster occurred because there is obviously a close
connection between the whole sequence of events, and on
that topic, in my submission, that part of the evidence of
Mr. Phillips may be of assistance.

         Then I complete the full circle by saying - and I
may be mistaken in this - that it is probably when one
gets to the stage of identifying who is the candidate who
is to be criticised for unalwful killing by doing exactly
what in respect of what, that one then has to address the
question of whether expert evidence will be helpful on
that topic, and I am afraid I cannot answer that at the
moment because there is no charge sheet - I am not
complaining - and so I do not know.  But if one does get
to that stage, then in my submission expert evidence will
be helpful.  Half-an-hour!

         THE CORONER: You have done very well.

         MR. KING:  Sir, I hesitate to lengthen Mr.
Payne's submission now.

         THE CORONER: I am quite happy.

         MR. KING:  All that would be helpful to me is to
know the nature of what Mr. Phillips's evidence is,
because although I know it by inference from what I have
heard, and I know my learned friend has indicated on
earlier occasions, I still do not actually know to what it
is directed in any substance.

         THE CORONER: Are you in a position to help Mr.
King?  I have seen it, but it would be wrong of me to try
and summarise it because it is not fresh in my memory.

          MR. PAYNE:  I will try and give a summary to Mr.
King, but actually my main answer to what he says is that
these are matters for you to decide.   I have made the
submissions in broad terms about the relevance of expert
evidence.   Now it is true that I have made this speech in
the context of Mr. Phillips's evidence because that is the
topic which has arisen, but I made it quite clear at the
outset that this applies to expert evidence in general,
not just to Mr. Phillips's evidence.

         Certainly one knows that one is going to hear
from Dr. Eastwood, who is going to give evidence, a
representative of the Club is going to give evidence.   The
Court has already heard from the City Council.  So that
the confines of expert evidence do not stop at Mr.
Phillips and I have endeavoured to make my submissions in
broad terms.




                                /THE CORONER:    Yes.
     THE CORONER:    Yes.

     HR. CATCHPOLE:   Although obviously, sir, there may
be an opportunity for me to develop my submissions in
relation to Mr. Payne's submission, just in relation to
what Mr. King has said obviously I have seen a copy of
Mr. Phillips report, but I would like to add in the
caveat that that was drawn up in the context of assumed
evidence that was going to be given at civil proceedings,
which wouldn't necessarily be the evidence which you have
heard at these Inquests.   His report may not be of much
assistance at all.   That would be a matter for you to
decide if you came to call him.   Certainly I would urge
you to disregard a lot of that because we simply haven t
heard that sort of evidence.

     Now there may be other matters, which I won't go
into now, which my learned friend has rightly referred
to, but it is just to add in that caveat about the nature
of the report and the time it was drawn up.

     THE CORONER:   I think I can safely say this,   that I
have never said I wouldn't call Mr. Phillips.    All I
said on the last occasion was - in fact what I said was I
was intending to call him and I was vacillating on the
matter.   I think it goes without saying that simply
because if I do call him just because there is something
in his report which, to my recollection, is a pretty
lengthy document, we would only select out of it, if that
is the right expression, those bits which are directly
relevant to the issues of these Inquests.   Just as I
said when I was talking about the HSE, we could spend
three or four weeks easily discussing the minutiae of the
physics of metals and the mathematics of it as well to no
profit.   We have got to draw the line somewhere.

     I take your point, Mr. Catchpole.   Even if we do
call him his evidence has got to be limited to what is
the cardinal point which we need to consider.

     MR. ISAACS:   Sir, I shall not be here tomorrow so I
don't know whether you would wish to hear observations or
submissions on the submission of my learned friend
tomorrow or on some later occasion.   If you are going to
hear them tomorrow then I shall have to say what I have
got to say now.

     THE CORONER:   I will probably want to do them as
fast as I can, if I can put it like that because we don't
know what else is coming up so I am content to listen to
you now, Mr. Isaacs, if you are happy to do so.

     MR. ISAACS:   I am happy because I can be very, very
short.   That is all I need to say about it.
     Could I just make one comment, and this is my own,
about what has been said by Mr. King, touched upon by Mr.
Catchpole and added to by yourself, so far as I can tell
- and I am not privy to Mr. Phillips' report -
Mr. Phillips is no different from any other witness who
has given evidence.   He is no different from the expert
who will be called in relation to engineering matters.
The decision whether to call him or not cannot depend
upon what is in his report or what he would say.   For my
learned friend Mr. King to say, "Before I can make any
submission on the point of principle, I must know what he
says..."

     THE CORONER:     He doesn't actually say that.

     MR. KING:   With respect, I didn't say that.   I
wanted to know the issues to which he was directed in a
bit more detail so one could see the relevance, not the
content of his opinion which I accept.

     MR. ISAACS:   As I understand it from my learned
friend Mr. Payne, the relevance of Mr. Phillips' evidence
would be as to the standard of care that would be
expected of a specialist, in this particular instance, a
police specialist, as I understand the matter.

     Having said that, and if the standard of care of a
police specialist is to be called into question, as it
clearly is, whatever may be said by Mr. Payne as to not
knowing what the charges are, clearly it is, then if I
may say so with respect to my learned friend, his
arguments are so persuasive that there can be little
answer to them.   Certainly listening to them for the
first time he persuaded me - for what that matters - but
they are very persuasive indeed if you accept that those
matters are matters with which the jury has to grapple.

     It will   be impossible for the jury to grapple with
whether, for   example, Police Officer A has discharged his
duty of care   against the background of what is the proper
standard for   a Police Officer in his position without
knowing from   an expert what that standard is.

     It isn't for - let's take the last witness who came
along, or the one who was asked, Mr. Hollinrake - to give
any comment as to what the standard of care to be
discharged by a specialist Police Officer is.   Of course
it isn't and it would be foolish to even begin to suggest
that it is.

      Sir, it if be the case that you believe that is a
matter with which the jury has to grapple then my learned
friend's arguments are very persuasive and I do support
them.
     THE CORONER:   I am very grateful to you, Mr. Payne,
and I have heard you Mr. Isaacs.   We will leave it for
tonight, if that is acceptable to you.   It will break
our continuity, but I am sure we can cope with that, and
I will listen to what anybody else wants to say to me on
the point of principle.

     I know you introduced it, Mr. Payne, by outlining
some of the principles which underlie the criterion which
have to be met and fulfilled in order to be able to even
considered an unlawfully killed verdict, but as I
understand it you were not addressing me on the law on
that point at this stage, apart from in the most
superficial way.  Would that be fair?

     MR. PAYNE:   That is exactly right.   I wasn't
intending to develop an submission on the law except
insofar as it touched on the question of admissibility of
expert evidence.

     THE CORONER:   It is a very difficult subject and I
have spent a good deal of time thinking about it.   I am
looking forward with great anticipation, if I may say so,
to all your contributions on this topic.   Hopefully it
will help me.

     MISS SINCLAIR:   Could I just ask on the question of
the witnesses for tomorrow?    You did express a hope last
week we would be finished with witnesses who had
something to say about the collapsed barrier tomorrow.
Can you give me any help as to which of those witnesses
which are listed will have something to say?

      THE CORONER:  Miss Sinclair, if you would be kind
enough - when we rise...   I can't remember without
looking at my list.   I know who they are because I have
got a little tabulation.   We should be able to give the
answer within five minutes of our rising or perhaps even
less.

     They are definitely all of them, but there are some
and I cannot remember who they are at the moment but I
can find out without too much difficulty.

     In that case we will start tomorrow at our usual
time of ten o'clock and then we will press on and if need
be we will take more submissions and continue with the
topic tomorrow afternoon unless we overrun.

          (The Inquests were adjourned until
            10.00 am the following morning)

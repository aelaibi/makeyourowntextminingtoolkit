Dear Mr Bone

Report by David Phillips on Hillsborough Disaster

I attach a report dated August 1990 by Mr David Phillips, then Deputy Chief Constable of
Devon and Cornwall Constabulary, now Chief Constable of Kent.

The provenance of the report is a little unclear. At paragraph 2.1, Mr Phillips says;

       “On 20th October, 1989, I was asked to consider documentary material emanating
       from the Inquiry conducted by Lord Justice TAYLOR into the disaster at
       Hillsborough. I have confined my research to a consideration of documentary
       evidence although I have spoken to other senior police officers, serving and retired,
       in relation to this match and other issues in general, (none of whom had any direct
       involvement in the game at Hillsborough)."

In response to your request for “fresh evidence” to be submitted to you, I forward this
document. I do not believe it represents fresh evidence but is principally another
perspective on pre-existing evidence. However, as with all similar material, the Chief
Constable would prefer to lay material before you rather than pre-judge the material’s
freshness. I will cause enquiries to be made into the background that led to this report and
will contact you again as soon as I have more information.

I would be obliged if you could acknowledge receipt of this letter.

Yours sincerely




Ian Daine

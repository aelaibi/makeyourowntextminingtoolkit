 The Football Association
 Lancaster Gate,
 London.

 Dear Sirs,

 I was a spectator at Hillsborough yesterday and I
 want to express my views on one aspect of the
 tragedy.

We arrived by car about 1pm and were able to park
almost opposite the ground. We had a picnic lunch
 y the car and all around us were fans doing the
same thing but also,I regret were 'tanking up' on
 eer.  I asked them why and they explained that as
they could not drink in the ground,they had to
fill up beforehand.

My friend and I finished lunch around 1.45 and
decided to take walk before taking our seats. We
went northwards and within a few hundred yards
of the ground was an Off Licence which was doing
the trade of the century. There must have been
several hundred around the shop.  I thought no
more of it at the time.

When later,I heard and read of the crush outside
the gates at ten to three,I realised that many
of these fans had probably been drinking up to
just before the game outside the ground instead
of going in an orderly fashion much earlier as
they certainly could have done.

I do not know the statistics on ground drunken­
ness since the prohibition,but it may be worth

considering whether this tragedy would have happened
if drinking were allowed inside the ground before
kick off.

This coupled with the abolition of standing with 100%
seating would certainly tempt me to let my grand­
children go to a match again.

Yours-'Ijaithfully   /

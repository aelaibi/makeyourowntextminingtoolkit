 Radio m e s s ag es      from start        of    incident     not    received very well        due to

 b a tt e r y failing       t hr ou gh    long use.

 I felt        that   I was   not used to best a d v a n t a g e and that            I could have

 been     used    in a positive way to help situation.

 I have w o r ke d Semis          at H i l l s b o r o u g h since    1973 as a Dog Hand l e r and

 al w a y s    seem to work       that area.

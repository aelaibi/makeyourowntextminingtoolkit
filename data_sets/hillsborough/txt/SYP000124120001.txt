 INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,        A/TER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THERE WAS A TOTAL LA#K OF ORGANISATION.            THERE WAS NO LEADERSHIP FOR THE

 P O L I C E . IF SOMEONE      HAVE COME TO THE END OF THE TUNNEL AND GOT THE FANS TO

 LEAVE IT WOULD HAVE RELIEVE THE CRASHING A LOT QUICKER

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU J#tsH TO ADJ^ WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 1) THE OPERATION Bt TUE POLICE/fUTSIDE THE GROUND IN FAILING TO ORGANISE

 Gl     IING AT THE TURNSTILES.

 2) WHEN THE AREA IN FRONT JQF THE TURNSTILES WAS CROWDED THEY SHOULD HAVE

 STOPPED ANY MORE FROM JOINING ON THE BACK UNTIL IT HAD EASED OFF.

 3) THE POLICE AND S T E ^ R P I N G      INSIDE THE GROUND WAS VERY POOR. THE FANS TOOK

 THE INITIATIVE IN ORGANISING THE STRETCHERS CARRYING THE DEAD AND INJURED.

 4) THE LOUDSPEAKEf/SYSTEM WAS POOR.             IF IT HAD HAVE BEEN A BETTER SYSTEM

 ANNOUNCEMENTS COJDLD HAVE BEEN MADE EXPLAINING TO THE FANS HOW SERIOUS THE

 SITUATION WAS #ND I AM SURE THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE LEFT IN AN ORDERLY FASHION

 AS SOON AS A N / ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE GAME WAS OFF HAD BEEN MADE,

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE I N C I D E N T A L S H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE POLICE WERE SLOW TO ALLEVIATE THE CRUSHING IN THJi^MIDDLE PENS BY

 TRANSFERRING FANS INTO THE COMPARATIVELY EMPTY S^tfe PENS.

 I ALSO SAW A MAN LYING ON THE PITCH BY THE GO*L WHO WAS GIVEN HEART M A S S A G E ,

 THEN HAD A COAT PUT OVER HIS HEAD AND HE W m              LEFT ALONE.   MINUTES LATER

 A FIREMAN CAME BACK AND HAD ANOTHER GO AT RESUSCITATING HIM FOR ABOUT
                                                    /
 T ^ J T Y MINS. AGAIN THE MAN WAS LEFT, WITH HIS / A C E COVERED UP. ABOUT TEN

 MINS LATER A ST JOHNS AMBULANCE WOMAN CAME AM& TRIED TO RESUSCITATE THE

 MAN AGAIN.      THIS TIME IT SUCCEEDED AND SHE/PUT AN OXYGEN MASK ON HIS

 FACE.      THE MAN WAS PUT ON A STRETCHER ANJr CARRIED INTO THE SOUTH STAND.

 THE MAN WAS IN HIS LATE 40'S, SLIM, AB^UT 6 ', DARK BROWN THINNING HAIR,

 FULL BEARD,     WEARING A BLUE V NECK JUMPER.           I DON'T KNOW WHAT TROUSERS HE

 HAD ON.      IN MY OPINION THE MAN HAD /ECOVERED.              O.H.     4®      .

 I WAS TOLD TO GET OUT OF THE WAY j^Y A POLICE OFF ICER, WEARING A FLAT H A T .

 WHEN I WAS HELPING PULL PEOPLE O f i l OF PEN 3 AND INTO PEN 2. HE GRABBED

 MY ARM AND SHOVED ME TO ONE SIDflE.             I WASN'T VERY IMPRESSED BY THIS,

 I N FACT    I WAS QUITE ANGRY.              I

 IT BECAME OBVIOUS THE POLICE DIDN'T WANT MY HELP SO I MOVED OUT OF THE WAY.

 THERE WERE NOT ENOUGH STRETCHERS AVAILABLE FOR THE EMERGENCY.

 Q34

 IS    THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

LAST YEAR, ENTERING THE GROUND WAS FAR BETTER ORGANISED BY THE POLICE.

 I HAD MY TICKET CHECKED BY POLICE AT LEAST TWICE BEFORE I GOT TO A TURNSTILE.

 THE POLICE HAD SET UP RAILINGS TO FILTER THE FANS THROUGH TO THE ENTRANCE.

 THIS YEAR THERE WAS NOTHING SIMILAR.              THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME I HAD MY

 TICKET CHECKED WAS AT A TURNSTILE.

AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

THE      FEW POLICE AND STEWARDS AT THE FENCES SEEMED MORE CONCERNED ABOUT

BY TELLING PEOPLE TO GET OFF THE PITCH.                                SOUND SYSTEM WAS POOR.                    EVEN

SEVERAL FANS WERE TRYING TO WRENCH A CAMERA FROM A PHOTOGRAPHER WHO WAS

TAKING PICTURES OF THE INJURED AND DYING AND DEAD BUT ^JAS/PROTECTED'BY A

ON THE HALFWAY LINE WERE MERE SPECTATORS WHEN IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THERE

WOULD BE NO DISTURBANCE OR FIGHTING BETWEEN RIVAL FANS AS THE FOREST FANS WERE

REACTION WAS TOTALLY INADEQUATE.

THE OTHER SEMI ~F INA l V a ND SEMI-FINALS WHEN LIVERPOOL PLAYED AT VILLA) THE

ARGUMENT ABOUT THE DIRECTION THE FANS TRAVELLED FROM''JUSTIFIED THE WAY

TICKETS ARE ALLOCATED AT SHEFFIELD SEEMS SPURIOUS / n D IRRELEVANT.

RECONSTRUCTION OF THE LEPPINGS LANE END IS NEEDED TO PREVENT A BOTTLENECK

IN THE FUTURE.              PENS SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUCTED WITHOUT EXITS TO PREVENT

LATERAL MOVEMENT.                LEPPINGS LANE PENS 3                      FOUR HAD ONLY ONE WAY IN AND OUT.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 BEFORE ARRIVING AT SHEFFIELD WE WERE DIVERTED OFF THE MAIN SHEFFIELD ROAD

 IN THE DIRECTION OF HUDDERSFIELD AND THE RE DIRECTED BACK TO THE SAME

 ROAD IE FIVE MILE DIVERSION BACK TO THE SHEFFIELD RD.      WHEN WE PARKED AT

 THE BREWERY WE ASKED A POLICE OFFICER    IF WE COULD DRIVE OUT THE OPPOSITE

 WAY WE CAME IN.      HE DID NOT KNOW BECAUSE HE WAS NOT FROM THE SHEFFIELD

 POLICE.   THERE WAS AS WE FOUND OUT AN EXIT THERE.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL     INGURY?

 (1) START OF ROADWORDS ON MOTORWAY SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO ALLOW FOR THIS

 MAJOR SPORTING VENUE - THIS CAUSED A KNOCK ON EFFECT.

 (2) ORGANISATION BOTH IN AND OUTSIDE THE GROUNDS WAS VERY POOR.

 (3)    IF TERRACE IS TO BE PENNED O F F , SHOULD BE LARGER GATES WITH SOMEONE ON

 THE GATE BUT I WOULD PREFER     IF IT WAS OPEN TO ALLOW FOR MOVEMENT.

 (^SHOULD       HAVE HAD LARGER END DUE TO NUMBER OF FANS.

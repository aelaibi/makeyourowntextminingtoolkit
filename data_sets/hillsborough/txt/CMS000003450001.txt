      Eddie Loyden M P requested in a Parliamentary Question information on thosfc,
      people whose statements were considered J?y the^Taylor Inquiry into the
      Hillsborough disaster but who were u n aiie1to cgive ceviclence (see extract from
      Hansard at flag A). He was dissatisfied with the answer provided by the Home
      Office and asked for a list o f people who were due to give oral evidence but were
      not called aaeU hai^revdi^fK itaG t^                  It is not clear what he hopes
      to gain from this in form ation^

      2.    Home Office passed the Request to this Department as some files on the
      Hillsborough disaster were transferred here from the Home Office due fo-eur
      responsibilitiesjfor safety at sports ground^. The Home Office(
      Home Secretary is considering whether to re-open the Inquest into the Hillsborough
      disaster following                                      television docu/drama.

         3.    The information requested by M r Loyden was not contained in the files
     \ which we have retrieved from the Hayes depository. However, in searching for the
      I records, it transpires that over 106 files relating to the Taylor Inquiry**whieh-we^
      1 were-not-aware-ef, were transferred back to the Home Office and have now been
       \ placed in the Public Records Office. It is not clear from the titles o f the files whether
S2> ' \the details o f those due to give evidence is contained in the files. To find the
  H-*- W orm ation we^vould have to recall and search through each individual file.

      hold the information.

As you arg aware, your request for information on those people who were due to
give oral evidence to Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster but
were not called, has been passed to my Department.


Lord Justice Taylor's Interim Report gives information on how the evidence into the
disaster was collected and presented, and states that all the represented parties were
given full opportunity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be
called. The represented parties included those bereaved or injured as a result o f the
disaster, the football authorities and the emergency services.


We are not sure that the information you have requested exists, as the hundred plus
files relating to the Taylor Inquiry have now been placed in the Public Records
Office in Kew. To sift through the material would take a great deal o f time, effort
and expense, and could in the end prove fruitless.

   PHONE CALL FROM EDDIE LOYDEN MP

   Mr Loyden contacted this office as he was not entirely happy with the response to his
   written questions (No 151 & 214) which he received on 21 January.

   In addition to the answer he received, he would like a list o f people who were due to
   give oral evidence but were not called and therefore did not actually give oral
   evidence.

   I would be grateful for a draft letter for Mr Maclean to send to Mr Loyden by close on
   Friday 31 January.

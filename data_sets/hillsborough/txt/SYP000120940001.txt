                  duty at H e e ley             in order      to commence m a t c h duty at H i l l sborough.

                  Ori arrival           at the      ground and after              the official          match       briefing        I took

                  Around         noon the        serial     was moved, from this                location to assist with

                  the m o n i t o r i n g      of the      turnstiles           on P e n i stone Road.             My first

                  i mpressions           of this        new location being               that     the    crowd was          orderly,

                  early and of good humour.                        I. also was aware              that a number             of

                  t urns t i l e s were          closed,      1 counted 6 of them being                      inoperative as the

                  number         of    persons      attending        the    game     did not warr a n t            all   gates      to be

                  o pened.

                  For      the    next       two hours       or so together             w i t h other memb e r s         of the unit

alcohol.              Th e      cans        were       confiscated                accordingly.                 Nothing          at      this

time       appeared             ou t       of    the       ordinary         from any           other       match          du ty™         Even

Behaviour             appeard              excellent.

At    2 . 1 0 pm      (1410)            I had         c a u se    to a r r e s t        a Nottingham Forest                          supporter

for    attempting                  to      enter       the       ground       whilst          dru n k .        As    is       custom          he w a s

informed             to    complete              my    report         in the           gymnasium          p r io r       to    returning             to

1 was       unaware             of a n y         other         officers           in    the    immediate             vicinity            who        had

Just       pr ior         to 3 . 0 0 p m          (1500)         I heard          someone          shout,,         I have        no     idea who

that       person was                 as    I never            saw    the      face      behind          the       voice,        words         to

Together             with many              other          officers          I left          the    gym and went                 into         the

As     I approached               the      h a lf    way       line       1 was          s t il l       convinced            t ha t       an

invasion        of      the       pitch       was        about       to       happen.

It w a s      o n l y as        I neared            the    goal          line       of       that       end    that         I saw         that     a

major        problem was              evident.             I was          approached                by one          Liverpool

supporter         who        shouted          t hat       I was          a murdering                bastard,             that      there were

people        dying        in the          pens      and       that       I should              get      in a n d        get      them         out.

In f r o n t     of     me      1 saw        vast        numbers          of P o l i t e           officers            climbing            up the

fences        from      the       outside           and    greater             numbers             of    supporters               climbing

from     the     i ns i d e .         On     the     pitch          shouting             screaming             and       hurling           abuse

approached            an     open       gate        to    the       right          of    the       goal       and assessed                 the

Officers         were        trying          to     get    in but             were       forced          b ac k     by      supporters

getting        out      or      at    least         trying          to g e t        out.           I was       aware         at    this         t ime

of     the    smell        of     vomit       and        beer.           The       scene        was      to t a l      confused            chaos.

Going        towards         th e     gate        I sa w       on    the       grass          a male          aged       about        25,

Again        X was      challenged                by L i v e r p o o l         supporters                to    get       into      the         c r owd

and     do    something              but     I was        unable          to       get       any    closer          to      the    fence         than

After        a moment           or    two     1 eventually                    found          myself       at      the       open      gate       and

I left         the    gate        as     I was         unable       to       get    into     the      crowd and              moved       some

their        bare     hands,             I joined            in as       best       I could and after                       a time       the

As     a gap       developed             in the         fence        fans      poured        o n to      the      pitch and            '‘b l u e ’

people         were     banded           up    from a heap               of    bodies,          s om e     4 deep           below     the

fence.          I saw         officers            in the          crowd       attempting           to      revive           those     d ea d

but     all     seemed           to    no a v a i l .         1 remained             at     the    gap a n d           by    th is    time

th e    Liverpool             f an s     were      very       hostile,             words     like B a s t a r d s ,           Murderers,

Pigs,        rained         down       from       those       seated          above       the     terracing.

The     fans       on the         pitch were             pushing             fighting        to get          back       into       the

crowd        and      for     a moment            it    seemed          that        for     e v e r y two         persons         t ha t came

out,     one       went       back       in.

After        a time         an    orderly          confusion             developed           and         s o me   form       of

disorganised                system          came       into       bein g.           Bodies        of p e r s o n s       werehanded

ou t    of     the     terraces             into       the    arms       of    anyone        on    the       outside          of     the

fe n c e ,     the     body       was       placed       on       the    grass       and     left.           At    the       time     that

seemed         the     best       p ol i c y ,     1 was          handed       a    body,       1 carried              it,    placed          it,

left     it     then went              for     another.              Everyone          was      blue,        lifeless          and       limp.

I returned              to       the      fence        and was ha nd ed              the     body      of     a young           b oy a b o u t

him     onto       a    board            and    together            with about            8 Liverpool                supporters            1

ferried        the           body        across        the     ground towards                 the     Kop       end.

On     arrival          at       that      end       1 saw about              20    bodies          lyin g      on      the    gras s,         all

very     blue,          all       very         dead.        An ambul an ce              attempted            to      get      into    the

ground        but       my       body     and        its a t t e n d a n t s        would       not       allow         its a c c e s s

               On S a t u r d a y           15 April             1989         (150489), I      ra n g on duty at 0 900 h o urs.               My

               i nstructions were                          to be at             the ground at 0 94 5 hours          for a briefing            for

               the Semi            Final.              All       the Officers             on duty were        seated    in the N or t h

               S t a n d where              they were                given a full and           comprehensive          b riefing     by Chief

               S u p e r i n t e n d e nt D U C K E N F I E L D and other Senior Officers.                               I have      no doubt

               that at the end of the                                 briefing,        each Officer         knew what was         expected

               of him and what                        his       specific        duties were.           The Senior O ff icers          in

               charge of any specific                                 task or       part of the ground were              i ntroduced and

               stood          up in order                  that       they     could be recognised.               I was on Serial           1,
                                                                              NMolb
               w h ic h was            s upervised by PS C H A PMAN.

               After          the briefing,                     packed          meals were handed out and              consumed.         My

               specific            duties were                   to       patrol    the    perimeter       track from 1115 h o u r s , to


      X        kick      off,          then take up a position on the                                 perimeter    track for       the

d u r ation of the game.               My    point was     in front     of the N or th S tand at             its

j un c t i o n w i t h S p i on Hop.         I patrolled the         perimeter      track    until    1230

hours,      w hen    I was      released by PS C HA PM AN to have a hot meal.

F o ll ow in g    this    I returned to the            perimeter     track    until      1345 h o u r s ,

w hen because         of the      large      volume of prisoners         being      taken to the

Po li t e    room,    I was      i nstru cted by Police         control      to   ’m a n ’ the door         to

the Police          room a llowing          only those with      prisoners        or other      legitimate

access       into the      room.       Most    of those a rr es t ed were for offences

involving         d runkenness and m any of them were                  violent.

By    1430 hours,         the    drivers      of the    prison buses were           reporting      that      the

cells       on the buses were           full and that they were              having      to put two       to a

cell.

I was       still manning         the door to the Police              room shortly after           the kick

off,    when      it was     reported        that there was a pitch           invasion and         that all

a v ai la b l e Officers were a sk ed to go onto                 the    pitch.       1 made my way to

the    pitch but on the way met PS Paui nunTQN who                           had just       come from the

pitch.        He was      visibly shocked and shouting                 urgently for an am bu la nc e

that was         parked near       to the      pitch between the North Stand and                   the Hop,

to follow him onto               the   pitch.       He stated that there were at                least

twelve       people      dead at that         time.     He was met w ith disbelief.               He got

the am bu l an ce        to follow      him onto       the piteh and slowly towards                the

L ep pi n g s Ln end of the ground.                     Isaw that there were b e tw ee n two

hundred       to four      hundred      people        on the pitch and       that   people were          being

crushed behind the wire                 fences        at the rear    of the Leppings Lane             goal.

I went       to the gate a t the             rear      of the goal   and saw that a l t h o u g h the

gate was         open,    there were about            four or five bodies,          ob vi ou sl y dead,

laying       in the gateway and              blocking     it.   X climbed onto           the wall at         the

side    of the gate and shouted to the                     people    to stop pushing and try to

move    back.        A number      of supporters were           screaming and spitting,

o bviously full           of hate for the Police and shouting                     that    it was the
                                                                                                        PAGE            3
                                                                                                        SS80A

fault     of the Police.                I did not at that time             u nderstand what           they

meant.           Efforts were made             to   remove     the   bodies without        success      until

one y outh braced his arms against                           the uprights       of the gate       in an

effort      to     relieve       some    of the       pressure,      w ith his help it was            possible

to   r em o ve all        of the J o d i e s and some           children from the          compound.          From

that moment             it was    just a matter           of ensuring      that     people     came    out    in a

more    orderly way without                f al li ng .A n u nconscious          person was       passed

through to me and together wit h another                              person I carried him onto               the

pitch where             I tried to       revive him with m ou th to m ou th and                 chest

massage.           After a few m i n u t e sa n am bu la nc e           driver    tried a re suscitator

on him but stated that the man was dead.                                The ma n was mid 2 0 ’s,           slim

build,      clean shaven.               No other       desc.

I tried to          revive at       least two other             persons,    without       success.

W h e n the extent          of the disaster was becoming apparent,                          I told Police

Control          on at    least    two occasions             that a tem po ra ry m or tu a ry was

requi red and a sked them to suggest a venue.                              The    gym na si um was

desig na te d and bodies and                   injured were          taken and directed there,               as

were     any medical          personnel         who v o lu n te er ed their       services.

More and more Liverpool                   supporters were             by this    time on the       pitch.

The Notts Forest             supporters,            for    reasons     best known to themselves,                  had

started jeering.                 This    inflamed the Liverpool              supporters who           started

running          towards    them.        They were held back by a line of Police

p f fi c er s across        the    p i t ch.        I saw one Officer        in a state of shock

being      ranted and         raved at by a supporter without a p p ar e nt l y seeing                            or

hearing          him.     At this       stage       in the    proceedings       the fj_re brigade

a rr i v e d and a ss is te d w ith the               removal     of the   dead and       injured.

Whe n    it became a pp arent             that most          of the dead and        injured had been

released,          I a ss is t ed w it h       carrying a stretcher             to the g y m a n s i u m .

By this          time,    emergency medical               supplies     had just a r ri ve d and        I

tied up all         the    remaining medical         supplies       into     the   crates    in which

they     came and     left them piled up in              the    centre      of the gym.

M ost   of the      bodies had been brought              to the gym na si um by this time and

w h e n a number of body bags a r ri ve d              I a s s i st e d   in placing      some   of the

bodies     in them.

During     the     rest of the evening,            I obtained       supplies       of body    tags,

rubber     gloves,        reports and any other            items    required and a s s is t ed with

the     reception of more            bodies w hich had earlier              been taken to hospital

but which had been dead on arrival.

A n area was        later    s cr eened off       in the top       part of the gym where

relatives who had made a p reliminary                      id en ti fi ca ti on of a body from

Polaroid      photos       of the     d eceased    taken earlier,           could view the

I ceased duty at about                1330 hours Sunday           16 April     (160489).

I feel     that the manner            in w hi ch the    incident was          dealt w ith     can only

reflect     credit        on the Police.          Many O ff ic er s were       deeply shoc ke d but

               in a professional            manner and           carried out   their   duties the best          they

               could under            difficult    circumstances.

               The    fans arrived too            late and a lot of them under            the    influence of

               d r i n k , to get       into the gr ound          in time   for the kick off.

               I have a t t e nd ed most          of the matches at the SWFC            since a rr iving        in the

the ground d ir ectly next to the turnstiles                             for the Hop and that              being

used by the N o t t i n g h a m ticket               holders.        As they a l i g h t e d from the         bus

these fans            d i d n ’t join the queues to             enter    the ground but started to

walk     back        into    the Pen is to ne Rd are a where             they had seen        public houses

were     open and had visited them the                        previous year.           I then      returned to

the Midl an d S t a t i o n wit h the PSV.



At a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 .1 5 p m     (1415)    a train a r r i v e d from Hull          containing

N o t t i n g h a m fans,      there were about 60              in number,     they were          boisterous,

all    had been drinking and were                     unco-operative.            They were .escorted

onto a PSV and taken to the ground.                              Whilst    en route      this      group were

r epeatedly a t te mp ti ng               to force    their way off the          bus    in order      to visit

public houses.                 They were       prevented from doing             so.      By the time         this

bus arri ve d at the ground the bus was a wash with ur^nie on                                      both upper

These      fans a l i g h t e d and were met            by Police Serials work in g                in the

vicin it y of the t urnstiles                  in P enistone Rd.           I then went, to the

gymnasium,            having    been d i r ected to there             for meal.



I mealed at 2. 45 pm                (1445)    and at 3.0 0 p m       (1500)   I was     told to make my

way    into the            perimeter       track    no reason being         given,     just       to go

straight        there.          On arrival          there     I saw that the       players         were in the

process of            leaving       the    pitch and there was           large m o v e me nt s     of Police

O ff icers at the L ep pings Lane                    end of the ground.            It a p p e a r e d that a

                     pitch     invasion was         in progress.            I went          over and on reaching             that        end

                     of the     pitch,      hundreds       of fans were        on the         pitch.         I a s s i s t e d at an

                     e mergency gate to a ll ow fans access                    onto         the    pitch,    several     fans had

                     minor     leg    injuries and         I a s s i s t e d to escort            them to about       the    edge of

                     the    18 yd box were          they were       left    to seek further attention.                         As    I

                     r eturned towards            the    e me rgency exit an           Inspector        direc te d me to        cover

                     the area        in front      of the N o rt h S t an d to prevent a pitch                      invasion        from

                     fans    in that stand.               I remained here          for some          15 minutes       during which

                     time    I was     r epeatedly subject           to verbal          abuse       by Liverpool        fans who

                     were    on the     pitch but showing            no signs          of    injury.        Under     normal

                     circumstances          these       fans w ould have       been a rr e s t e d for dr un ke nn es s and

                     public order          offences       such was their          behaviour and             condition.



                     It became a pp arent           that a large        number         of Liverpool          fans    on the     pitch

                     were    intent     on a t t a ck in g   the N o t t i n g h a m    end of the ground and were

                     m aking    their way to that end of the ground.                                I was    then d ir ec te d to

                     a ssist    in forcing a cordon across                  the    pitch near to the                halfway     line

                    l to prevent       the 2 rival         groups    clashing.               It was obvious          to me that
K       _
    ^               persons     being      carried from the L ep pings Lane end of the ground were                                   in

                r    fact    dead due to them being              covered over.                On two      occasions      I

                     assisted        to carry a body on a hoarding                     to the P enistone Rd end of the

                     ground.         The    persons were dead and the                   persons        carrying      them were

Ap s^       >        stru gg li ng with the weight as they                    passed the halfway                line.



                     I remained on the            pitch until       after     the game            had been a b a n d o n e d    and

                     fans    began to       leave.



                     I was then d ir ected to              return to the M i dl an d S t a ti on to supervise

                     N o t t i n g h a m Forest    fans    returning       there       for    return trains.

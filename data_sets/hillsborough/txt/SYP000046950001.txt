Dear Dr. Popper,
Re:   RESUMED LIMITED INQUESTS - HILLSBOROUGH

Thank you for your letter of 6th April 1990.
As requested in your letter I wish to verify that      the   names
indicated on your list are applicable to myself.

I also understand that there are specific queries relating to
the   autopsy on WILLIAMS    (Case 51) and correlation with
statements. However, I am informed by Inspector Sawyer that he
will contact me further about this point.

Yours sincerely,__________________

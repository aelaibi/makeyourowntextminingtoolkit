                I am a LiveT’-fcool supporter.                     b n S at ur d ay        15th April    1989    <15041989)        I

               a t t en d ed the Liverpool           versus N o t ti n gh a m Forest                 cup match w hi ch was

               taking       place at H i l l s b o ro u gh Football               Stadium,        Sheffield.



                I was able         to obtain a ticket                for this       game w it h a voucher           from my

               friends       season ticket.           He was not going                     to the game.       The   ticket    1

               got was       for    the West S tan d entry at Gate                                                       It cost

               me £12.00.



                I w e n t to the ground wit h 7 frie                           in two        cars.     I went    in my own        car

               with

                                        and                              wno     lives       in
In the other         car were                 and

                                                          I d o n ’t know his full       address    but

                                   and                       He   lives    in




We set off at         11.00 am       (1100),       both
                                                cars together and tra ve ll ed by
                                                        CA-^r \ T 6 L A - f ~ f iC
motorway.          As we   came to S to ckport we were held up \jr^ the H62 m o t o r w a y

for a period of about               three    quarters       of an hour.         There was a terrific

amount     of traffic        there.        Once we    passed thro ug h there,           there were     no

hold ups at all            right    through    to Sheffield.



We   stopped       in a    lay-by on the A 5'7 near to L a dy bo we r Res er vo ir and                had

some    beefburgers and tea or coffee.                      Apart   from that we d i d n ’t stop.



I d i d n ’t see any other supporters at all                      on this       route because    it was

a    lesser    used route.



We a r r i v e d   in S he f fi e ld at about 2.20           pm   (1420)    and at that time we

had easy access along               the    roads    really.       We did go wrong        once

because we ended up at               the N o t ti n gh a m end.      We just turned         round and

went    back.       I did not go to the m atch               last year      so I w a s n ’t aware of

where     to   park but the ones            I was with knew and they d ir ected me to

where     I e ventually          parked.



There were         no policemen about          to tell me where            to park so      it was a

good job my friends               knew.



W here we      parked      was    in a small       shopping are a about           5 minu te s   walk from

the ground.
                                                                                                                   PAGE             3
                                                                                                                   S2359

             Once we    parked      I saw no signs         of any       police a gain so once again                 I had

             to rely on my friends             getting me to the ground.                  We got out of the

             car,    went    to a   ' C h i p p i e ’ , bought   some    chips and walked whilst we ate

             them.



             We were    parked opposite a pub and theVe we re "'f-^Vss who had been                                in the

             pub.     They were walking          down the        road drinking       from       cans.       Apart        from

             the    odd one    or two who were a bit boisterous                    there wasn't any

             drunkeness       or fighting       on the walk        towards       the ground.         There were

             soffie who were singi ng .

S.o.a        large    crowd who were          crushed both        jsnside and outside           the gates and

u   •c _ .   right up to the turnstiles.                  Because       of the    large    crowds         there were no

             queues    up to the turnstiles.

             There were about 3 or 4 policemen ohsjiorses                         in b e tween the gates and

             the turnstiles and the fans               wbkb      crushed up agai ns t          the horses.               I saw

             a lot of policemen sitting               in v a n s \ n d    cars    in the       road outside.              I

             think    they should have          been organising           the    crowd e sp ec ia ll y outside

             the    gates   because     it was     just a free for all             out there.



             Outside    the    turnstiles       I saw no other           policemen who were d ir ecting                       the

             fans and not one steward.                 They were     totally       invisible.         I     d id . see        two

             or three       policemen helping          fans to    climb up and        over the wall             into          the

             ground.        I didn't    have any       problem      locating m y turnstile but                 1 had

             diffi cu lt y getting       to    it because        of the    crowds.      Once      I got to them                I

             passed straight         into one,       gave up my ticket and had the stub handed

Whilst      I was waiting           outside      the gates and turnstiles        I did not        see

an y gates       opened to a ll ow entry             into the ground but once          I got     inside

through the turnstile                1 went      to the toilet.      Where    I was    standing

there     is a window at head high.                   I could see    through this       into     the

one     drinking at all.



I was     sat    in the fourth            row back from the front wall          of the balcony

and over        to the     left     hand side       looking at    it from the back.

          people to get           into    it.     T hey were     really squas he d        in.      I also    saw that

          the section        immediately below me and looking across                            the middle      section

          to the far section that                 both of these were            empty in comparison.              There

          was another        larger       section to my left w hich was on an embankment.

          This    one was        full    but    comfor ta bl y so.



          I could not tell              if the middle         section was       se pa ra te d    in the m iddle        or

          not.



          I had my eyes           on the       pitch but      1 was also a ware of what was             happening

          below and       I saw even at           the terras on the           pitch kicked off that             there

          were    people     climbing          over   the fenc^ at          the front    trying     to get      out.

          As   they got towards            the    top I sawSi^me            policemen    pushing     them back         in.

          I stopped w at ching            the m a t ch at this        point     because    even more        people

          were    climbing        up and some         of them got out onto the              pitch.     The      ones

          that    did at this           stage were      caught hold of and marc he d out               to the

          corners      probably         to eject      them.

          As   they did \Lhere was a sudden atte)h«pt by a lot of supporters                                 to   climb

          there was       terror        on their      faces.     I could hear screams and shouts

          coming      from the        crowd.



          Ely now there were             fans    sitting on the top of the fence.                    fhey were

there were       hundreds of fans                     out on the       pitch.        There were a lot of

policemen standing ar ou nd as                       if they didn't         know what          to do,    but    there

were    some who       by now had realised the e no rmity of the s ituation and

By about 3.03          (1503)      to 4        (1504)       the fence      had been torn open             in a few

places.       As with most grounds,                    there         is a wall       at the front       on which

the fence       is put and this wall                   was about waist               height.     The    people who

were    nearest     to this wall               were    jammed up against               it and unable       to

move.      It was      the fans who were about 3 or four                              feet back from the

wall    who were able          to get out by climbing                     over       the ones at the       front

and through the hale               in the fence.



There were       policemen         by now            who were        standing at the top of the fence

and    reaching     over' into              the area        tolift     people out.         There were other'

p o l icemen together wit h St Johns a m b u l a n c e m e n on the                        pitch.       The y were

trying     to revive some of the fans.



I looked along             the stands and I saw a whole                     group of people             pulling

fans    up into the stands.                    The ones who were            being       pulled up looked

very white and were               e xt remely shaken.                  Quite a lot of them were

I saw them being m ov ed a way by the ones who                              had       pulled them up and

comforting       them m a in l y because they were doubled over and                                crying.

put the        child in it and w r ap pe d him up in it.                   He then        picked him up

I think that          once    the    police that were a c t u al l y behind the goal

realised the          problem they did really well.                  The y just seemed to                react

p o l icemen d i d n ’t want         to move     for them.        In my opinion they were                  only

i n terested        in crowd    control       and w e r e n ’t b ot he re d about a ss isting              the

lot of        pressmen taking         ph otographs       of the scene.         I think         that    they

were    inciting       the    crowd by doing           this and some       of the fans           ran at

them.    They had to be taken awa y by the                      police.     One       in p a r t i c u l a r , he

had a number             on his        bib,    just    ran up to the fence and took a

could see he was             fuming.      He hit him several          times       before he was

            I consider that most           if not all       of the deaths and         injuries    caused was

            e n t i r e l y due to the o v er cr ow de d    nature    of the   centre    sections.



            Where    I was there wa             steward     in the    bottom   left    corner    of the

            stands an d when he realised how serious the s it uation was he                           removed

            his stewards vest put it in a plastic bag a nd wa lk ed away,



            I heard a few a n n o un c em e nt s ^ o v e \ t h e   tannoy asking      for any medical

            people     in ground who       could assist and others asking               for   people to

            remain where        they were    to allow the a mb ul a nc e s       easy access and free

            passage away from the ground.



            I myself        left whe n the anno u nc em en t       came over   stating that       the game

            was off,        This was about 4 .20       pm    (1620)    to 4.30    pm (1630).       I made my

            way out        of the ground wit h my friends and met              up with the ones who

            were    in the N orth stand and Leppings Ln terraces at the                       cars.

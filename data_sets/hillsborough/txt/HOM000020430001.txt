HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY


I refer to the recent article in the Sunday Times dated 3
September regarding Maidstone United FC entitled "League's newest
club in safety dispute" from the Inside Track series by Chris
Dighton and Chris Lightbown.

Lord Justice Taylor has read£ this article and would appreciate
your comments on the remarks made by Mr James Tye, the Director
General of the British Safety Council, regarding the Watling
Street ground. I should also be grateful if you would let me
know the present position regarding the safety certificate.

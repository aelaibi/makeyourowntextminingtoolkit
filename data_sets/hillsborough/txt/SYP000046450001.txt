  I do not know whether your people have tffti information but if they
  do I would be very grateful of your further assistance.

  In relation to the "remoteness" cases a number of test cases have                             '•   fiC/h
  been taken covering the ciircumstances where people have suffered                             '<11*   ^
  post traumatic! stress disorder but who were not actually in Pens
  3 or 4 helped in the rescue; or were at the ground with parents/
  children or spouses in the Pens.

  Some of the test cases deal with the position where people saw the
  events on television and had relatives in Pens 3 or 4 and have
  suffered shock as a result.

  We have asked the BBC for copies of the video tapes were actually
  screened.   As you appreciate the Court will want to know what the
  individuals actually saw on the television rather than the total
  footage recorded.                                             -

  We have therefore made a friendly application to the Court (the BBC
  do not object in principle but require a court order before disclosing
  the tapes). This was to have been heard on Monday next.

  However, we understand from the BBC that all their material was handed
  over to Lord JusticSe Taylor'S Inquiry and although they have a rectord
  as to what went out on the 5.00pm news, the 9.00pm news and Match
  of the Day they do not have a record of what was actually screened
  during the afternoon of the 15th April.

  They tell us that the Inquiry cannot say w h ^ was screened and; what
  was not.

  Have you or your officers have any reciord as to wtiat went out and
  what did not ?   I do not know whether the tapes were marked in anyway
  to indicate what was screened or whether there is a tape separate
1      utjl   ow ltd UvtVw^v
i >a          C^S /K/N^
C/tnd    (2)




from what I understand are nine hours of BBC tape where bits are
put together to show what was screened during the afternoon.

I know it is abit of a long shot but I would be grateful if you
are able to help.

It would be helpful to know even if there are limited sections of
tape where one can say with certainty that this was seen on BBC TV
that day even if that does not comprise the whole of what was seen
on BBC TV that day.

I look forward to hearing from you and would be grateful if you are
able to assist.

Every good wish.

Yours sincerely,

        Dear Miss Steel

        Having made enquiries I am now in a position to respond to your letter of the
        6 April 1990 concerning what was and was npt broadcast by the B.B.C. in
        connection with the Hillsborough disaster.  Unfortunately, the result is not
        helpful to you and your Committee in that from our enquities with the B.B.C and
        its staff we were unable to satisfactorily determine what material went out
        over the air live on 15 April 1989.  This information was required to try and
        identify individual deceased who had allegedly been seen on T.V. by relatives
        for the C o ro n er ’s Inquiry.

        Regrettably, I must therefore refer you back to the B.B.C. as the absolute
        authority for any further assistance you may require in connection with the
        identification of material for use in civil proceedings.

        Yours sincerely




        J M Jones
        Assistant Chief Constable (HI)

                PLAN --v- SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE EXTENDED TMP.Tr.EMT LOG



                The South Yorkshire Police Major Incident Manual (SYPMIM) is a document
                setting out details of required action to be taken for consideration
                in the event of major incidents occurring.

                A major incident is defined as:-

                    "A serious disruption of life arising with little or no warning
                    causing or threatening death or injury to numbers of people in
                    excess of those that can be dealt with under normal conditions".

               Quite clearly the incident at Hillsborough on 15 April 1       fell into
               this definition.

               To be read in conjunction with the SYPMIM is a further document, the
               South Yorkshire Police Major Incident Contingency Plan (SYPMICP) which
               in effect details how the Force is put at alert following a major
               incident by one of two code messages

               Operation 'Support'
                       and
               Operation 'Maine'

               By the first, all available operations officers are deployed to give
               support to an incident of major proportions or spontaneous major
               disaster within the South Yorkshire Police Force area and by the
               second, in respect of similar incidents in another Force area, hence
               the numonic MAINE, ie Mutual Aid In the North East.

               In order to evaluate these two documents as to their efficiency on
               15 April 1989, it is necessary to compare the requirements contained
               therein with what actually took place on that day, details of which
               are contained in the Extended Incident Command and Control Log
               (document number D194) (EIL).

               Page three, paragraph 3.2 of the SYPMICP dictates that the Senior
               Divisional Officer should, when the need for operation support is
               required, obtain permission of Assistant Chief Constable (Operations)
               which is what, of course, happened on 15 April 1989, operation support
               was called for at 1507 hours (page 10 EIL) and confirmed by Assistant
               Chief Constable (Operations) Mr Jackson, at 1510 hours.
                                  -   2   -




Part of the responsibilities of the Senior Officer present is to
identify rendezvous points for emergency personnel (SYPMICP page 6,
paragraph b) within the planning for Hillsborough these points were
already identified, although criticism was voiced at Lord Justice
Taylor's Hearing that the emergency services were not privy to such
planning, be that as it may, rendezvous points were pre-determined.

Page 6, paragraph e SYPMICP dictates that Detective Chief
Superintendent should be contacted in respect of manning personnel
reception points etc, of course, this was taken care of in the
planning for the match.

Page 8 of the same document dictates the actions to be carried out by
the Force Operations Room, by comparison with EIL it is clear that all
the requirements of paragraphs a - h were complied with, together with
those requirements outlined on page 9, paragraphs i - r.

However, when comparing the EIL with SYPMIM several discrepancies are
found.

Section 4 of the MIM dictates that the code word 'catastrophe' should
be used between emergency services, this clearly was not done by South
Yorkshire Police and perhaps the unacceptable delay in notifying the
Fire Brigade in particular, would have been avoided if this section of
MIM had been implemented.

Section 7 of MIM, paragraph b, placed the onus upon the Force
Operations Room to alert emergency services and other authorities and
departments whose facilities and expertise may be needed. With this in
mind, section 19 of MIM, paragraph 3, suggests that three organisations
be alerted 'Becon', 'React' and 'Raynet', to assist in radio
communications. Criticism has already been levelled at South Yorkshire
Police from Becon to the effect that they were not called to assist.
If that criticism is justified I suggest it may be levelled at the
South Yorkshire Police Force Control Room.

Section 7, page 2 details the responsibilities of the Duty Inspector
in the Force Operations Room and in paragraph 3 clearly it is that
officers responsibility to use the code word 'catastrophe'.

It is true to say that an Extended Incident Log of Command and Control
was commenced and the Sub-division at Hammerton Road was notified in
compliance with MIM.

Paragraph 9 requires the Major Incident Box to be transported to the
scene which was in fact done as indicated on page 15 of the EIL at
1530 hours, in fact more than one Major Incident Box was used that day.

            The Senior Officer callout check list was adhered to in as much as most
            of those officers listed were already in attendance and the remainder
            were contacted very soon after the extent of the incident was known.
            Hospital Liaison and Casualty Party were both set up within a short
            time. Turning to the duties of the Site Commander, page 1 of section
            10 MIM, states the first duty is to assume overall control. This was
            cause for discussion at the Hearing, but it is quite clear that who
            ever was deemed the Site Commander did not identify himself by wearing
            the provided tabbard. I am not in a position to state with certainty
            if in fact the Site Commander liaised with other emergency services
            Commanders, I think not.

            Section 11, page 1 refers to instruction card 'E' entitled Medical
            Requirements at site and stresses that every effort should be made to
            ensure the ambulance crews are able to load priority patients.
            Clearly this was not possible due to the confusion on the pitch and
            also the difficulty the ambulance crews were experiencing entering the
            ground. Paragraph 5 of that page refers to a Site Medical Officer
            being despatched from a local hospital and being accommpanied by a
            Constable, I am not aware of the attendance of such a Medical Officer.
            These requirements are paragraphs marked XR264 and XR265 of page 1 of
            section 11, to my knowledge were not complied with.

            Despite these few discrepancies the vast majority of requirements
            contained in MIM and SYPMICP were complied with, I suggest, by South
            Yorkshire Police officers.

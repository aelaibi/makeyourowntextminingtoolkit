              At      approximately 3.14pm                  that       d a y we   received a         call    to a m a j o r

               incident            at   Hillsborough            Football      Groun/,       Penistone        Road,    Hillsborough

              and       we    were      informed         that    cutting       equipment       was     required.          Three

               tenders         were       sent     from Central                   Station,       two     water    ladders      and      the

               vehicle          I was      driving,        the    emergency        vehicle.
                                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                                               S2058

The    emergency           vehicle        is     u s u a l l y -alerted for                chemical,          radiation and

road    traffic        accidents,               but    on    this        o c c a s i o n as      it w a s     a major

incident        the    vehicle           wa s    called          in use as           well.




As we       arrived        on P e n i s t o n e       Road,       outside           the    Football          Ground       I

overheard        over       the     radio        that       one     of    the       tenders       from R i v e l i n V a l le y

Fire    S t a t i o n wa s       already         inside          the     perimeter          of    the     ground and            t hat

they    had     not    had a n y         contact        with any Police                    to    receive       di re ct io n and

that    there        was    confusion            ins ide.




I would        estimate          that     it w a s      around 3.20pm                  w h e n we a c t u a l l y        entered

the    gates     on P e n i s t o n e       Road       into       the     ground.I          drove       the    emergency

tender       down     towards        the        rear    of       the S o u t h      Stand       but     was    unable          to   use

this    route        due    to    th e    height        of       the       vehicle passing under                    a    concrete

canopy.         I then        drove       the     vehicle           along        Penistone            Road and          into

Penistone        Road       North,        again        the       height        restriction             on the       gates

prevented        me    taking        the        emergency           vehicle          through          these and          I decided

to    drive     to L e p p i n g s       Lane     end       of    the     ground          where       from    personal

knowledge        I knew          I would         be a b l e       to          get    the v e h i c l e in.



On    our    immediate           arrival         at    the       ground        both       Leading Fireman                HOUSELY.

and    myself        took     the    mortivus           re s u s c i t a t o r       e q u i p m e n t from       the     vehicle

along       wit h a first           aid     kit       and    made        our     way      behind       the W e s t      Stand

towards        the    North Stand.                We    then ma na g ed              to    push       our w a y     through         the

crowd       in the     stand        to    the     front          and     then       gained access             onto       the    pitch.




I could        see    that       there     was        alot       of a c t i v i t y       over    by the       goal       post

in f r o n t    of    the W e s t        Stand.         I was          amazed        at    the a m o u n t     of       people      on

the    pitch,        there       were     people        staggering               about,         others       sitting

obviously        in s h o c k       and     others          l y ing      on    the     pitch      receiving

    treatment.            We     made       our    way       over        towards          this      area    but w e r e       stopped              on

    route      by a s m all           gathering          of       youths        that       were      round a young                boy     on

    the    pitch        t hat    obviously             required           treatment.                Leading       fireman Housely

    and    myself        set     to w o r k       on    the       bo y    giving          both      cardiac       massage           and

    resuscitation               with    t he m o r t i v u s        equipment.                 It    seemed       as    th o u g h we

    worked      together          on    the       youth       for a n          endless         period       of    time       but     in

    reality       I would         estimate             it as       being        around         5~7 minutes.                 During        this

    time     I d i d n ’t see          any    signs          of    life        in the       youth,         a n d we w e r e

    approached           by a m a l e        stating          he w a s         a doctor          who      helped       us    giving

    cardiac       massage         to    the       youth.           The     youths          who      were    gathered           round       him

    were     distressed and                 believing             he w o u l d       need      further          treatment           they       got

    hold     of a s t r e t c h e r         which       they       brought           to    us.       We    placed       the       boy     onto

    it a n d     it w a s       carried       over       the       pitch        to    the      Spion Hop          end       to w a i t     for

    a   free ambulance,                all    the       time       this        was    going         on    I contiued           to    give

    o x y g e n , to    the     youth       right       up u n t i l       the       p o int     he w a s       placed       on     the

    ambulance.



    I would       describe            the    b o y as        approximately                 14 y e a r s     o l d.      He was           white
f
    and    I would        estimate           a r o u n d 5 ’4 “ tall.                 He    seemed         to    be    slightly           built

    and    I believe            had    fair       straight           hai r      which       appeared            unkempt.            I think

    that                                                                                                                            He    was

    wearing       blue        jeans     and       no    t o p at         all    when       I saw         him.     His

    trousers           were     undone       and       I believe           he w a s        wearing         boxer       shorts        but       I

    cannot      recall          the    co l o u r .      I d o n ’t k n o w           if    he      survived          but    its

    doubtf u l .




    Once     t his      boy was        inside          the    ambulance              I returned            to    the    pitch again

    with Leading              Fireman        HOUSELY.              Together,/we                assisted          a s m a ll       number           of

   After       these           I recall          assisting          a white           male       aged 25-28 years                 who     again

   him    problems              breathing           so    I again administered                          oxygen      to a s s i s t      the

   I would          estimate            that      I eventually               left       the      football         g r o u nd at a r o u n d

   4.50pm.            At       no    time       whilst     I was        present            at    the     g r o u n d w as    I

   obstructed              by a n y o n e        in a n y w a y ,    and         I would         say     I was      no    threatened

   personally              in a n y w a y .            There     was        an    occasion          after        the     disaster         where

   I witnessed                 a number          of L i v e r p o o l       f an s    close        to    the     Leppings         Lane

   entrance           were          verbally        abusive         towards           both       the F i r e      Brigade         and     the

  ,P d i c e .        A    number         of     them were          banging \on/the                 tenders        as     they     passed

   by    bit     I donot             believe        any    damage           was      found       on t h e m at all.               At    no

   time    whilst              I was      in     the     ground      did         I se e      any    of    the     f ans     drinking

   any alcohol                 but     I was      aware      that       a    lot      of     the    Supporters            had     b een

   drinking           by       the    smell       and     their      general            behaviour           as    they were            leaving

   the    ground.

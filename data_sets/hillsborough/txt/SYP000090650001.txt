             I am a Police C o n s t a b l e ; i n the Road Traffic D iv i s i o n of the South

             Yorkshire Police               sta ti on ed at Carcroft.



             On Sunday         15th April          1989    (130489)     I was detayfed to work Sam x 8pm
                                                                           S2-13
             <0800 - £000)            in company with PC             1263 S i ^ g P K ^ D and our duties were to

             provide extra m o t o r w a y             cover    on the iyf between T i n sl ey and Haig                  in

             respect       of football         semi-final         traffic.          We   commenced our          patrol    of

             the Ml at         10am       (1000)   and     nothing u nt oward o c c u r r e / until             12,25pm

             (1225)       on the      s o ut hb ou nd     carriageway at TankerjKley when we                     stopped at

             a transit         van    parked on the            hard shoulder v^ith 2 youths                 urinating at

             the side       of the m o t o r w a y .        PC S H E P H A R D X s ^ a l t with the driver and            I

             dealt with the 2 youths who were                        reported / o r         urinating       in a public

                 ilace.    The    van was      checked for alcohol              but      none was      found.       What was
                                                                                                   P A(jE.
                                                                                                   S3491

found were         several      plastic      bags full        of empty beer       cans and all         the

youths      in the van a p p r o x i m a t e l y 8-10 with the exc ep ti on of the driver

had been drinking             but at that        time were       not drunk.



We     resumed     patrol     w h ic h was    normal     until    3.06pm       (1506)   w h e n we were

directed         to Gate     ’0" at H i l l s b o r o u g h   S t a di um due    to some    sort   of

major     incident.         Due     to our distance and the amount                 of traffic      1

estimate         it took     us some     10-15 minutes          to arrive.



On arrival         we went     to Gate       ’0' where        large    numbers of       people were

gathered,         a vast m aj or i t y     of w hich were        incensed and abus iv e and a

good number were             drunk.



On entering         the stad iu m       I saw a large          number    of    people   g at hered and

persons         lying   injured or dead on the                ground with       people wandering

aro un d a im I e s s iy «



I gave a s s i s t a n t / to several           persons who were          injured and also

a ss is t e d    car/ying     people on m akeshift             stretchers who a p p e a r e d to be

dead.



Thro ug ho ut      this time        there was a general air              of h ostility      towards      the

Police and,         I formed the         impression,          to anyone       in uniform.



There were         numerous       persons shouting at us while we were ass is ti ng and

a vast number           of these      had been drinking,              they were abus iv e and one

m an    in particular         was    bordering       on violence.



A mbul an ce s     began to arrive           but due      to the utter         confusion were      not

getting         to the scene        quick enough.
                                                                                                           P AGE
                                                                                                           S3491



             Together with other Road Traffic Officers we set up a corridor which

             we kept        clear and o rganised a system to get the a m b u l a n c e m e n           through

             w it h m i n im um delay.



             I remained        in this    duty until       released from the scene.



             I can say from my experience and knowledge                   that on our arrival

             confusion        reigned.        It was a difficult      s ituation but wi th in a very

             short    period of time Police Offic er s were              o rganised and e fficiency

             took    over w ith O ff ic er s      being    given specific    tasks.

  •
             The vast m aj or i t y      of   persons     outside   the ground were       the worse        for

             drink,     they were abus iv e        to the Police and      I saw a number          of occasions

             Officers        being   spat on a lt ho ug h unable      to do a ny thing a bout        it.



             The moo d of the-? crowd was           ugly and    1 sensed that       not much would          be

             required to start a riot.




                                                                            J B OT F I E L D P C 2 5 S 3 S IG NE D

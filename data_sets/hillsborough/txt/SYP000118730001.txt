              On S at ur da y     15 April      1989 commenced duty at W oodseats Police Station

              in uniform at 8.30am.                  A tt ached to Serial 5 under                        s u p e r vi s io n of

              Sergeant        1084 H o d g e t t .

              T r an sp or te d to H i l l s b o ro u gh Football                Gr ou nd where           I was a l re a dy aware

              t h a t , together with other members                       of the Serial,                 I was to       perform

              duty at turristiles 29 to 32.                         My   prior knowledge                 of these       came both

              from      relevant      parts    of the operational                  order w hi ch had been displayed

              at Woo ds ea ts Police Stat io n during the                           previous week and from a

              personal        telephone       call        from S g t . Hodgett              on 13 April          1989 to ensure

              I was aware         of my duties.                                                           ,

              A fter a mass          briefing        of    all     officers       in the stand at the football

              ground by Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t            D u ck e n f i e T B    I went       to   turnstiles

              numbers 29 to 32,             w h ic h are s it ua te d            in the sterile area at the

              l_eppings       Lane    end   of the ground a n d at a p o i n t where                            t he    television

              broadcasting           vehicles are           parked.         My    instructions                from Sgt.     Hodgett

              were that only N o tt i n g h a m Forest                   ticket       holders were              to be a llo we d

              t hr ou gh those        turnstiles.            No L iverpool            ticket       holders were to be

              a ll ow ed through those               turnstiles and no non ticket                          holders.         I also

              under st oo d that         no persons a ff ec t ed by alcohol,                         persons           carrying

              alcohol        or any    item of a n          offensive         nature,          i ncluding        large

                                                                                                 R234

inflatable      iterns, were to be admitted.                           ,

Until    2.30 pm a p pr o xi m a t e l y very few fans entered through                 *m y ’

turnstiles and at that           time the m aj or i ty of persons who were                    to enter

began to arrive         in an orderly and good humoured m a n n e r .                  They

consisted     in the m ain of       couples,,    families and mature             persons.            Being

adjacent     to the barriers        forming     the     sterile area         it was    n ec essary

for ticket holders          requiring to enter my turnstiles                   to be a dm it t ed

Into that sterile area and a p p r o x i m at e ly 4 other                 officers were

strictly     regulating      entry through the barrier              to Notts,         ticket

holders.     In total     I w ould estimate only something                   in the order of 250

persons entered through my turnstiles                    and because         of the    small     amount

of   ’traffic'     I noted that the officers              on the sterile         barrier

a pp e a r e d to be   checking every ticket            in an efficient m a n n e r .           At

a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 . 4 5 pm three Liverpool    fans,    d isplaying no team            colours

m ana ge d to slip by the officers            checking      tickets and a t t e m pt e d to

gain entry at my turnstile             by paying        cash for a ticket,             At this        time

there were      very few     persons at the tunrstiles and I turned                      them

away.     I believe     they were taken back out of the sterile are a by

other officers without           trouble.

From a pp r o xi m at e ly 2 . 4 5 pm reducing     numbers       of persons      ente r e d through

my turnstiles and from kick off at 3pm until a few minutes                               later        only

the odd late       fan arrived and was a dm it t ed directly thro ug h the

turnstile.

I had been aware        of trouble at the L ep pi ng s Lane                turnstiles        from

about 2. 4 0 p m as     it came over the        public address         system twice asking

people outside         the ground not to push as there was                    plenty of room

inside    the ground.

A few minutes after          kick off     several       officers    ran from the t elevision

van car park and shouted            "Everybody         inside.     P it ch    invasion".         I am

not aware of the         identity of these         officers and        I was     not    in
                                                                                                 PAGE
                                                                                                 RE3A-

possession of a personal              radio so     1 had no first         hand k no wledge        of

what was       taking    plat©    inside    the ground,

Hyse'lf and several         other officers         i mmediately entered the gr ou nd and

1    saw that    there a pp ea r ed to be trouble             on the Lappings Lane             terrace

in the    centre       'pen".     O ff icers    on the    pitch at the front         fencing       of

that    pen were       trying to lift       fans over the top of that fencing and

that there were          considerable       persons      in the area of the Leppi ngs Lane

goal    mouth.        I saw that    persons we re being          crushed against          the    front

fencing and also along             the vertical        fencing    running along          the    left

hand side of the          pen when viewed from the              pitch.     It then became

apparent       that   there was     panic to      leave the      pen but as       I could see no

evidence of fighting             I was unable      to a s ce rt ai n why they were             trying

to    leave.

As there a pp ea r ed to be no un if or me d officers at the vertical                           fencing

I immediately went          there.      Persons were being          crushed       in the       panic to

climb over       the vertical       fencing and fans outside              the    pen were       tryi ng

to assist       them over       the fence.      The   densely packed crush on the

vertical       fencing a p p e ar e d to be about        five    persons deep and at             its

worst where       I w a s , a p p r ox i ma t el y a half     to two thirds the way back

towards      the top of the terrace.

After ass is ti ng a couple          of persons       over     the fencing       it became

a pp arent     that there was no obvious              cause    for the    crushing.        Behind

the    five deep       crush there was         plenty of space and most            people were

ignoring the          crushing at the       fence and       looking forward over           towards

the    pitch with ou t a ny apparent           distress       or discomfort.        (I am unable

to recall       whether    the game     had been stop pe d at that              time.)     I shouted

to those       persons    crushing to get over           the fence that          there was       plenty

of room behind          them and    to move      backwards.       Other    fans outside          the

pen seemed to see the merit                in this and also took up the              call       to move

back.     However most          of those    trying    t o scale the       fence    ignored this,
                                                                                                               PAGE
                                                                                                               R234

one    or two shouting               such     remarks as         “You d o n ’t know what            it's      like".

I could see               that at the        front      fencing     the      crush and       panic: to       leave

was muc h worse and was                    seven or eight           persons         deep.     O ff ic er s    at    this

time were            sat a top the           fencing a s s i s t in g        fans    over    but once a g a i n       I

could see behind those                     crushing       that    there was          plenty of      room      if only

they w ould move               back,

I decided to assist                  from     inside      the    pen an d       scaled the vertical

fencing,          climbing         over    the    s ho ulders     of several          fans still        pressing

to get out.                I pulled       several       fans    p hy si c al l y backwards        to all ev ia te

the    crush,            a ga in shouting        that    there was          plenty of       room behind them.

This     had a little              effect and the          crushing          eased and very shortly

after      entering          the    pen I made my way             quic kl y and rela ti ve ly            easily

down the terrace                  to the     front      fencing.         1 could not u n de r s t a n d        still

why there was               the    panic     to scale      the fencing.

At    this    time         I do not       believe       there were any other                officers     inside

the    pen and            I repeated the o p e r a ti o n at the               front    fencing      s ho uting

for    persons            to move    back an d p hy si c al l y d ra gging              back a number          of

fans.        As      I    did so    I was     conf ro nt ed      by a large m ou nd of            persons          in a

heap     i mmediately             in front       of the fencing.              On top and facing              upwards

was a youth a g e d a p p r o x i m a t e l y            19 years,          I believe w it h      reddish hair

who    showed all            the signs        of being dead.                For the first        time    X

realised there were                  fatalities.           S t a n di n g    in the mid dl e      of the mound

w i t h dead or u n c o ns ci ou s            persons all         a ro un d her and          up to her waist

was a young w om an aged about HO years.                                 She was      conscious      but

a p p a r e n t l y unable         to move.        I began d ra gg in g          bodies      back off the

m o u n d but found this more d i ff ic ul t                     t han      1 a n t i c i p a t e d as they were

enmeshed toge t h e r .                The    first      few wit h the e xc e pt i on of the dead

body already               referred       to a p p e a r e d alive but          badly    injured and w i t h          the

a ss i s t a n c e       of fans    inside       the    pen were      passed over the            fencing       to

officers and with                  the a ss is t an c e    of fans          inside    the    pen were        passed
                                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                                RES 4

over     the      fencing      to officers           on top of the fence.

I believe          that this was            taking     place     d ir ec t ly    in front         of    the wicket

gate which was             open but         clogged wit h bodies             from the mount and                 it was

e asier      to    pass    persons       over the fencing             for a short          time.         There was

still      pressure        from     persons         still    trying    to    leave the          pen and the

operation          to move       bodies was          badly hampered.             I c o nt i nu al ly had to

break off what             I was     doing      to shout       to fans       to move       b a ck wa rd s and

give     room-          Some    r e mo n st r at e d wit h me,       shouting       obscenities,              some    had

to be pushed away to                 prevent         them    climbing       over    the m ou nd         of bodies.

Several          were    shouting      r e cr i mi na ti on at       the Police          for    causing        the

incident          but many fans          showed great          presence         of mind        in a s s i s ti n g

w it h the dead and              injured.           A great m an y     fans a p p e ar e d a f f e c t e d       by

alcohol          and there was an odour                of beer/l iq uo r         general ly on the terrace

One    heavily built             y o u th age d about 22           showed signs of              life a l t h o u g h

initially          taken for        dead.       I slap pe d him about              the    face an d shouted

at him to breath w h i ch                I believe          he was    not doing at             that     time.

S ud d e n l y    he star t e d snatching             breaths an d such was his we ig ht                      that      it

w o u l d not      be possible         to    pass     him over       the fence.          He was         ca rried to

the    rear of          the terrace         by myself       and several          fans and out t h ro ug h

the    tunnel          where   he was       laid down and          sho we d signs         of    recovering.

I returned to the                front      fencing and        it was apparent             by the n       that a

lot of fans had                left the      terrace,        p re su m ab l y t h ro ug h the          rear tunnel.

S u p e r i n t e n d e n t G r e e n w o o d was    standing at the open wicket                       gate    in the

f encing and with a m e g ap h on e was                     trying    to organise a             'chain gang*            to

pass bodies             t h ro ug h the gate w h ic h had            cleared       considerably.               This

was a b a n d o n e d a fter a very short                   time as a number             of the

approximately             150 fans       left       on the terr ac e        c on ti nually kept           gett in g      in

the way          either    to shout         re cr im in at io ns     at the      police,        get     out through

the    gate       to    look for     friends         or just     g en e ra l ly stagger about.

Although          there     is no doubt m an y were              b adly shocked,           there        is equally

                                                                                                            R 234-

no doubt that m an y were               drunk       or at the        least a ff ec t ed      by alcohol.

Eventually           the    bodies    and    injured were         removed and           I went      out    through

the wicket           gate.     Persons were a i m l e s s l y trying              to get     back     in the

pen or       leave       it and     I stood guard on the gate                   re st ri ct in g    entry and

exit as necessary.

At one       point,- wh il st        doing    so,    I saw a very drunken man,                     age d about

25/27,       thinly built,           s taggering about          on the      terrace       near      the front

picking        up and       placing    coins      in his     pocket w hich had o b v i o u sl y been

dropped by the dead and                 injured.          Be fo re    I could       respond two           fans    in

the    pen leapt           on him and one struck             him v iolently          in the        face.     I

e ntered the          pen and       dragged the d r un ke n y ou th out of the                     pen and onto

the    pitch to get           him out of the way.               There was         still    approximately

•100 persons         on the        terrace and the         public order s i t u a t io n            could once

a g a i n have      deteriorated.            A c c o r d i n g l y and w it h    regret    I was      unable       to

arrest       the d r un ke n y ou th and stayed              g ua rding    the gate.          A bou t      this

time     fighting          broke    out at    the front       of the balcony above                  the    terrace

and    I saw a number              of officers       despatched        from the         pitch to deal w ith

F ol l o w i n g   the     incident w it h the m an          p ocketing         coins    those      remaining

on the terrace              became a g i ta t ed by the         personal         p os se ssions      of the

dead and           injured    left on the terrace.                I o r ga ni se d a number           of    the

fans       in to c ollecting          up the      possessions,         consisting         of handbags,

coats,       glasses and w at ch es and a v er y                large     number of        shoes.          These

they       passed to me t h ro u gh the gate w here                   they were         piled.       Via a

passing S er ge an t w it h a radio                 I r e qu es te d that a number            of bags        be

sent     for.       These     e v e nt u al l y a r ri v ed and the       p ossessions were               bagged

and taken by m ys el f and several                    other     officers         to the     Incident

Control        in the g y m .

I did not           return to the       pen or the          pitch as by then the g ro u nd was

well       on the way        to being       emptied.)

   In any    life and death             si tu at io n    such as this           r ec ol le ct io ns will

   become    distorted.           This account           is a cc ur at e      to the       best    of my belief

   but, it has to be said that whilst                         some areas are             crystal    clear anti

   have a lasting          impact,,      other areas are              hazy.      I am unable         to give any

   accurate       idea of time          scale     for    these    events.

   I am fairly       certain that           I was       the    first     to the front           fencing     on the

   inside    of    the    pen having made my way at                    least half          of the distance

   down the terrace.              I know       I was able        to do so w i th ou t           too much

   diff i c u l t y and will       remain c o nv in ce d         that many of the               f atalities        and

   injuries       could have       been a v oi de d       if persons          in the       "crushes'       had

   simply m oved backwards,               a lt ho u gh    1 a p p re c ia t e    the blind         panic    to

   leave    precluded        this.

  As far as        police actions           are    con ce rn ed       it has     to be said that            in the

   early stages          it was    n ecessary       for       individual        o ff ic er s   to do what          they

   thought    best       in the    rescue       operation.            Persons      were     l iterally dieing

   before    their       eyes,    and    I speak        p er so na ll y of my own experience.

  Seconds     counted and there wasn't                    time    to stand a r o u nd a wa it i ng

   instructions.           My first        r e co l le c ti o n of a senior              officer    being

   present was,          as a l re a d y described,           Superintendent Greenwood

   organising a c ha i n for             the    removal        of bodies        but such w ■>        the actions

   of the    fans    on the       terrace at that              time    that any a t te m pt at

   o rg a ni s at i on was    e x tr em el y difficult.               Although       cr it ic is in g   the

   actions    of man y fans          for their          conduct       I also      praise       the m an y who

   were of great a s si s t a n c e         in the       rescue       o p er at io n and u n d o ub t ed l y

   saved    lives    by their        readiness          to act    both on their             own    initiative

   and the    i ns tr uctions        of myself a nd other                o f f i c es.

At a b o u t         12 m i d d a y     (1200)         I met                   a n d we        travelled             in his F o r d

Escort          van    to S h e f f i e l d .          This     j o u r n e y was         without              incident,            without

any major             traffic         delays         and      during        the     journey           I did          not       notice         any

other        football            supporters            going        to    the     ground.

Police          presence         at     this       location and                n o b o d y was        directing                or   escorting

us    to     the      ground.           At    t hi s     time       there        was     quite        a    la rge        volume          of

Nottingham             supporters            and       they were            walking            freely and              singing           the

normal          so ng s .        I did       not     notice         any     persons            drinking             alcohol         and       there

were       no    instances            of     violence          or     fighting.                I p e r s o n a l l y wa s

I walked             with               along        Penistone            RD and         it w a s         our       intention            to go

to L e p p i n g s         LN and       meet       our     respective             parents.                We    turned          left      down

location             there       were      about       a hundred and                fifty           supporters             in the         street

walking          in b o t h       directions             and again             there      were        no       instances            of    note.

br idq e outside               the      ground and             there        met      my    father          and     sister.              During

the      short       journey          I had        not w i t n e s s e d a n y            spectators             consuming              alcohol

or    indeed         carrying           cans       of    beer.           I ha d      not    seen any             public           houses

open      on the        r o ut e      I took.

This      is the        first         time       I had        been       to H i l l s b o r o u g h a n d          I was          not a w a r e

were      masses        of    the       supporters             present          and       there       were       no     queues          as    such

to    the      respective             turnstiles.                                               /

I saw       t hat     there        was a Poli ce               offifer          on h o r s e b a c k        present           but       he wa s

unable         to do a n y t h i n g         with        the     crowd.           There appeared                   to      be a     to tal

lack      of    organisation and                    there        were       no s i g n s        of a n y        crowd        control.

We    saw      that     there         was    a     big    blue        sign      indicating                the    turnstile

entrance          'B ' a n d we          decided          to     try a n d m a k e          our       way       through           the    crowds

to    it.       We    joined          the m a s s e s         a n d we w e r e        immediately                swallowed              up    into

the      crowd.         We w e r e       virtually             carried along                by       the    crowd a nd             had       no

say      in w h i c h w a y we w e r e              to    travel.              The    scene          was    one       of     t o t al    panic

and      I could        he ar      and      se e    supporters              screaming               for    help.           There        were

only      a few Police                Officers           present          at    this       location and                 by    thi s      t ime

they      had     lost       control         of     the       situation and                d i d n ’t a p p e a r          interested              in

the      crys     for      help       from       the     supporters.                 I c an s a y          there        were       no

stewards          present          at    this       location and                this       f a ct     s u r p r i s e d me         somewhat

as    they      could        have       served          some     useful         purpose             there.

We    eventually approached                         the       turnstile           *B ' a n d at            t his      location           there

fa c t    I w as      forced          against           the w al l        leading          to       the    turnstiles              and

although          I was       squashed against                      it    I did       not       receive          any       injuries.               I

seem      to    remember           one      young        lad     climbing            up the          outer       w all       of    the

       ground        by    this m e a n s .          When       we    got       to    turnstile            ’B ’ t h e r e       were    groups

       of     some      six     or    seven     people          b e ing        forced       by    the      volume         of    the    crowd,

       through          the     turnstile           when      only        one    should          h av e    been       going      through.

       The     supporters            were      trying         to     be    helpful          but     were        prevented         by    the

       masses        of    people       present.              I handed my              ticket        ovej'- a n d         eventually             got

       through          the     turnstile.               Prior       to    t hi s     p o int     I did         not      see    any    of    the

       big     b lue      gates       being     opened and                I did       not    notice            any    other

       unauthorised                ent ry.

       Once     in the          uncovered area                inside           the    turnstile            I stood and waited                     for

                                                to       come      through           (marked A /G              on the       plan).          The

       crowds        had      thinned        out     c o n s i d e r a b l y at        t his      location and                 I was    able        to

       move     about         fairly        freely.

       I was       joined          inside      by                                                 and      it wa s        then    t hat      I s aw

       were     about         eight     other        police          officers          present            at    t hi s    location          and

       officers           and      offered      them       their          tickets.           I then            noticed another               te n

       or     twelve       people       enter        the      ground           in t his      way.          Everybody            was    telling

       the    Police          that     crushing           was      taking        place       outside            and asked         them       to go

       ou t    but      they       remained         on    their       post.

        opened more               or    less       to     its      full       extent        and     I saw a steady                flow        of

        supporters             gaining            entry       to the          ground.            I would        say       there       were        three

        hundred          people         entering             the    ground          in this         way.        I di d      not       see     any          of

        the      f ans      singing          inside          the    gro u n d ,         although         I couldn't          see       the        pitch

        through          the      tun n e l .

        After       a few m inutes                 I saw        the      gate       C    c lo s e d ,    I don't          know who          by,        and

        the      crowd seemed                to    decrease             as    t h e y all       went      down       the    t u n n e l.          We

        then       decided         to m a k e          our    way       into     the      ground,         a n d as        I did       not     see          any

        signs       directing               us    to    other       parts        of      the    g r o u n d we w e n t       directly                 to

        of P o l i c e       officers             or    stewards             present.           We w a l k e d       down    the       tunnel

        could       see      from       t h is     po int       that         pens       3 and 4 were            packed although                       in m y

        opinion          not      o v er     packed.            The      supporters             did      not a p p e a r     to       be    being

        crushed and were                     able       to    stand          sti ll.

        were       forced         forward a few                 steps         and       there     appeared           to    be a s w i r l             of

feet     were        not       touching           the       floor       and    suddenly           due     to     the       volume          of    the

crowd       present            we    came        to a s u d d e n        s top.          I could        h ear      people         for       the

screaming            out       for     help.           There       were       crys       for     the    gates         to    be    o pe n e d ,

and     people        were          shouting           us    to m o v e       b ac k     but     I personally               couldnt             move

any     direction.                  My arms        and       legs       were     pinned          s ti l l .      I could          see

people        fighting              for     their       lives       and       I found          it v e r y       hard       to    breath.                 I

also     saw a        couple           of    lads       who       had    fainted          but     who     were        being       held          up

struggling            to s u r v i v e           myself.

There       was      then anoth er                surge       forward which                  a m a z e d me      because          there

appeared           nowhere           to     go a n d        I was       again       carried           forward.             This       stopped

was     about        to    faint          and     pass       out.        There         were      supporters            in f r o n t         of me

appear          to    be     being       forced        back      into       the     bar.         I cant        remember                how       long

I was        against          the      bar a n d       I di d      not      see w h e t h e r        or      not    the       game       h ad

started.              I did        not     even       remember         seeing        any       of    the      players             on    the

pitch.

The     next         thing       I remember            was      being       raised        forcibly            o ve r     t h is        b a r and

I wa s       hu ng      over       it w i t h m y         trunk     and      legs        either        s ide       of    it.           I could

see     that         either        side     of me         there     were         other      supporters              in s i m i l a r

positions             to m y s e l f .          I am      unable       to    recollect              what     any        of    these          other

supporters              were       wearing          except       for A n d r e w S E F T O N           w h o wa s        wearing             a

thick        black         good     quality           cas ua l     leather          jacket.

At     t h is    t im e      I f e lt      the      bar m o v e     forward about                   f iv e    inches          and       it

remained             there m o m e n t a r i l y          and    then       it     collapsed           completely.                     Somehow

my     legs      went        underneath             the    bar a n d we            hit    the       floor.          I wa s            doubled

up     on the         floor        again with             the    bar      on t o p       of m y      stomach.                My       head       was

f ace     down        into       the     corner        of a s t e p a n d           the     small         space         in the          corner

of     the      s t e p a l l o w e d me         to    breath.            I could         he ar      screams            all

a r o u n d me        and     I could           feel      people       dropping           on     top      of me.             The       pressure

on me        was      again        intense.            I wa s     having           trouble          breathing            and          I firmly

believed             I was       going      to      die.        I thought           the     end      had      come       so       I

accepted             it a n d      ju st    lay       th ere .      I k ep t        drifting           away and              everything

I dont          remember           anything           else      u n til     I came        round and            I heard                people

talking          a r o u n d me.           There       were      people          on t o p      of me         and    I heard             someone

say      "Leave         them       theyre        dead."          I then          felt     someone            pulling          me w i t h

their        hands       under          my arms.              They were           unable         to m o v e     me    because           I was

still        trapped          by     the         bar a n d      I whispered             ths      fact     to    them.

I then          saw     that       there          were       about      four      to    six      people        on t o p      of m e      and

they      all      appeared             lifeless             and were          white        in the       face.        I heard           one       of

the     other         persons           say       "Move       them      out      of    the     way"      referring           to    those

who     were       apparently                dead.           These      f o ur    or    si x     people        were      then m ov ed

off     me      and     the      others           were       j us t    looking         for     anybody         who    wa s     alive.

The     barrier          was       eventually                lifted s li gh t ly             and     somebody         p u l l e d me         from

under        it.        This       p e r s o n w as          slim      about      £ 4 yr s       with     short       csinqer       crew

cut     h air      wearing          a       claret       coloured            l e a t her     jacket.           I remember           this

well      because           he     r e mained w i t h me                throughout             the    events         that      followed.

I wa s       then       carried             up    the    steps         a short         distance          and whe n        someone

tried        to s t a n d me            up       I collapsed            onto      the      floor.         I w as      then        given

medical           a s s i s t a n c e by w h a t             1 believed           to    be an a m b u l a n c e          m an who        was

about        4 5 y ears,           black          hair,       going      grey wearing                a black         uniform with a

yellow          reflective              jacket.              He t e s t e d m y       pulse a nd          I was       conscious,              so

he    suggested             that        I    should           go to     hospital.

I was        then       carried             through          the      tunnel      by    two      p eop le,      one      of w h i c h

being        the      ginger        haired          lad a n d          the     other       being      of a s i m i l a r          age    group

with      a mass         of      dark        hair       going         grey.       I wa s       placed      flat       on m y       back       at

a    p oi n t     I have m a r k e d A3                 on the         plan.           The     lads w h o       t o ok    me      there

then      went        and     got a          couple           of p o l i c e      c o ats    from a nearby Police

officer           and    one w as            used       as     a pillow           and      one   as a b l a n k e t .          There      were

a    number        of    other          injured          persons         lying         near      to me     but       I not        pay    then

any     particular               attention.

Shortly           after       this          a Police          officer          came     over       and    suggested            t h at    I

the     plan.           They       put me          on    the       floor       a n d as      I looked          round      I saw         there

were      about         fifteen             dead    bodies            alongside         of me.           I c o u l d n ’t see           the

                  h air    knealing          o v er    the     body      n e xt    to me.        This        m a n w as      grief       stricken

                  t hat    he w a s     dead.




                  I referred           earlier         to m y      old    school         f r i e n d A n d r e w S E F T Q N a n d my

                  and     I firmly          believed         he    had    no      hope,     although          at      that    t i me     he was

                  conscious           and    screaming            out.    I h a ve       since       r ead    in the T O D A Y           newspaper

                  I have also           referred          to      other      dead       bodies       at   various           stages       but    I am

                  through        the    turnstiles             but     they       did    not    frisk        me.       The    other       pioint        is

5.     Charges fbr the Services of Police at Football Matches

A joint report of the Chief Executive and the County Treasurer was circulated
to each Member present on the current position regarding accounts which had
been rendered td the five South Yorkshire Football Clubs in respect of
charges for police services.

As reported at tihe meetings of the Sub-Committee held on 24th July and 2nd
October, 1984, both the Sheffield United Football Club and the Rotherham
United Football Club were defending the Writs served on them by the County
Council.  In so far as the other three Clubs were concerned, the revised
system (recommended by the Sub-Committee on 24th July, 1984, and agreed by
the Police Committee on 30th July, 1984) appeared to be working well and it
was considered that no further action was required by the Sub-Committee at
this stage.

The Sub-Committee discussed both the legal and financial implications of the
current positionL
                i
RESOLVED - That the report regarding the current legal and financial position
be noted.

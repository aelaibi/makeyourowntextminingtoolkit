                took    off my helmet             and climbed onto         the wall     in front of the

                high    fencing.         I leaned over the top, trying to reach a fan.                                I

                 at an angle to the                rest of the fans,            to stop fans from climbing

into the holes           in the fencing and with PC MA DD GC KS                               I was able

their early 20' s and               pull    them both over             tjxsr^f e n c e .        Both

 the Police were              releasing      the' crowd from the front                         it^as

filling up from the/oack.                    I then saw that                   p o 1 ic e      ficers had

broken down a section of the fencing and w e r e^ ab le                                       to gain

entry     into ^ne       crowd.       M a n y more were          pulled out here.                     I also

took     holcj/af the wire           fXnce and        rolledyit            back       partially to

a s s i s U ’ where    upon J/was          handed the^/oody of a man                         in his    late^

out    cardiac massage and               I held his         neck and head                   in the

a p p r o v e d manner    to      carry out mouth to m ou th                    resuscitation.

This     fan smelled st rongly of                irttoxi cants and as                  I carried out

respiration and           cardiac massage.

We were     then joined by a ^ f i r e m a n in unifo rm who                           had a plastic

ai rw a y and this wa^^j/ftserted into his iTioutj^^ this time we were

joined by a man who                stated he was a ilo/for and he started to

carry out      cardiac m a ss age           on the victim.                 This app ear ed to

have     no effect       so    I said to the fan who                 had been helping me,

'I think he          is d e a        The fan sc reamed at me to continue,                 so we did,

The    doctor       thr^n took     from the fireman an oxygen mask

and    placed this        over     the airway,       he then turned on the oxygen

from a small          bottle      in a kit bag, wh ic h the fireman held.

After a time the doctor                took off the mask and said,              "I think he's

 dead".       He tried his          pulse    in his neck and wrist            but got    no joy.

 We were then joined by a couple of f>arffs' who                      had a maj<gj»4«f t

stretcher.           They placed him ojeK'lfhis and           caf ri><rnim away

towards       the    police      ropanT    I never    saw JM & X   injured man again,

I remember my          radio was switched ^orT but the messages a p p e a r e d

non -s to p and garbled and               I could not tell a word of what was

said.     I then as si s t e d other          persons     to make     temporary stretchers

 from adverti s i ng/ffoards.               I then saw that a large number of

Liverpool       f^afis who were        on the    pitch aro un d the goal         began to

storpt^upT^the pitch towards the Nott i nji^Srrf^suppa r ter s on the far

Hop.     I saw a number            of o f f i c e n / r u n towards   the half way       line

and    I joined them and tojs^elfher we forced the j^dTverpoo 1

I wa lk e d    badlf^owards         the L e p p i n g s ^ r T ”I saw most of the officers

in my Serial,          including PS WF^KjH T , then joined them.                  Ev eryone at

 that side of the g r o u m k w a s           clearly upset and was            crying,

including myself ajPrtlother Police Officers.                         After   spying      on the

Li verpool      supporters         back    to Midlaftd Station.         As we walk ed      to

those buses          I can clearly         remember fans      calling me a "MURDERING

BA ST AR D" and a "KILLER",               they also    said   "I BET YOUR GLAD OF THE

OVERTIME".           These      comments m a d e v e r y      upset.

After    remaining at Wads ley f r i d g e            with the buses      for some       time and no

more    fans appeared,            Inspector DEWS       instructed us to make up a van and

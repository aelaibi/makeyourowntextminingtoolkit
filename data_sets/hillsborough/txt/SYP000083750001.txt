               On Saturday the 13th April               1989 (150489)     I went to the FA Cup semi

               final      between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough                           in

              Sheffield,          I travelled to the game with the supporters                    club.

               I caught the coach t g / ^ / ^ g a m e       in Worwich Road,        Covent ry at about              10,

              30 am,        I travel      on^Wiy own as far as family goes but I know people on

              the coach.

              The        coach left Coventry and went to the Ground at Hillsborough via
                                                                                  PAGE

         Bedworth, Nuneaton Hinckley and Leicester.

         I know a lot of people on the coach from travelling to the games

         We arrived at Sheffield and the coach was     parked, we had all     been

         given our tickets,   we got off the coach and made our way to the

         ground,   we walked casually to the ground, Nicholas and Carl Hewitt had

         got off the coach together first,    that was the    last time I saw them.

         There were a lot of people   in the streets and I didn't see Nicholas

         and Carl Hewitt after they left the coach, Nicholas and Carl stay

         together at most games and they tend to stand up at most games, my

         ticket was for the North Sta          I (didn't see any of the fans        in the

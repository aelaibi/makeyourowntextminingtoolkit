    Dear Mr Kennedy

    I enclose statements from Chief Superintendent Mole and Chief
    Superintendent Denton, South Yorkshire Police, which cover the areas we
    discussed at the meeting on Friday 20 April 1990.

    Detective Superintendent Taylor is pursuing the BOWNES statement and once
    that is received it will be forwarded.

    The statements enclosed are numbered for insertion in the relevant part of
    the file, Chief Superintendent Mole in Part II and Chief Superintendent
    Denton in Part V. Amended alphabetical witness lists are included with
    the statements to insert in each Part.

    Yours sincerely

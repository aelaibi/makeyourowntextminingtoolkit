       SPORTS GROUND SAFETY: ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION AT SPORTS
       GROUNDS OTHER THAN FOOTBALL LEAGUE GROUNDS_______________

       This is to confirm, following your meeting with Lord Ferrers
       this morning, that Lord Ferrers is content with the course of
       action recommended in your submission of 5 November, not to
       take forward the Taylor recommendation to extend mandatory
       all-seated accommodation to sports other than association
       football.

       2.   He has suggested removing the penultimate sentence of the
       draft PQ.

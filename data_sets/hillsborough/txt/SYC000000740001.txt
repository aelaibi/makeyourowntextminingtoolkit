                   CROWD' MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE LOADS GENERATED BY


    Consider a person on the nth step behind t barrier. The whole crowd is assumed
    to be up on its toes, inclined forward at an angle i , in a fashion which would
    be adopted to obtain a view of an incident in front of the crowd. The
    spectator is leaning forward on a support provided by the person in front and
    is thus subject to supporting force Pn, from the front and to a toppling force
    Pi*-1, froa the person behind, offset by the terrace step height h.

                HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER CORONERS INQUEST

Dr Nicholson,

You asked for an analysis of discrepancies between the capacities of the
ground areas and the number of admissions.

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY COMPUTER PRINTOUT FOR APRIL 15 1989 AND
CAPACITIES OF THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE STADIUM

The SWFC computer printout was produced by Mr R J Houldsworth of Abbey Systems
Ltd, whose company maintained and operated the computerized system for
Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. I do not know the precise time that the
printout was produced but I understand from Mr Houldsworth that it was after
3:00 pm on 15 April 1989 when he realised that there was a problem. On 25
April I witnessed the production of another computer printout and the totals
for all areas of the ground, except 'Lepping Lane turnstiles A to G ' , agreed
with the totals on the printout of the 15th. However turnstiles A to G had
been operated for testing purposes in the intervening period.

The SWFC printouts give the total number of admissions for each turnstile and
I was told that all the counters were set to zero before the turnstiles were
opened.

The printout also totals the admissions for sets of turnstiles corresponding
to different areas of the ground but on 15 April some turnstiles did not serve
the areas to which they were normally designated. The computer program had not
been modified to account for this change in designation and hence the printout
totals for particular areas were incorrect. I believe that the Interim Report
(para 48) is in error on this point. The turnstiles that were incorrectly
designated on the computer printout were as follows:

Turnstiles 77 and 78 were designated as 'North Stand' but fed the 'Kop'
Turnstiles 9 and 10 were designated as 'West Stand' but fed the 'North Stand'

Appendix 1 shows the relevant parts of the computer printout and by
transferring the admissions from the turnstiles that were designated to
different areas from normal it was possible to derive the corrected totals for
the different areas. These are shown in Appendix 2.

The summary table shows the capacities of each area, the number of admissions
derived in Appendix 2, and groups the areas according to either Liverpool or
Nottingham Forest.

Appendix 3 shows all extracts that refer to capacities etc in Lord Justice
Taylor's Interim Report

1.0     INTRODUCTION                                                     A c t i on




       DCC Mervyn Jones gave a brief introduction describing the

       Coroners Court and the reasons for holding the meeting.

       The Coroners Acts and Rules dictate that only the coroner

       can call people to give evidence, persons acting for the

       bereaved can only cross examine the witnesses.    The

       Coroner will call the Health & Safety Executive [HSE] to

       give expert evidence probably towards the end of the

        inquest in March.
The reason why the meeting was called was to Identify the

differences between the figures that Elrond Engineering

[EE] had obtained and those the HSE had obtained.




The Coroners primary interest was how 95 people died at

the Hillsborough football disaster and this meeting was

intended to clarify two points;

a)    the number of people in Pen 3

      and

b)    the col lapse load of barrier I24A




The meeting was also intended as a forum to discuss any

other points which may be pertinent to the case.




NJB related how he was appointed by Hammond &

Suddard to prepare a technical report on the Hillsborough

football disaster for a Third Party Litigation action.

Despite being employed by Hammond & Suddard NJB

emphasised that he was eager to obtain the truth and that

from previous investigations he had found this was the

only way to practise.
NJB described how he had founded EE 17 years ago

and how he had been in the business of accident

investigations for the past 40 years.       Investigations had

been undertaken by EE, a firm of Chartered Engineers,

together with Dr. Dickie, Dr. Baker and Ha Icrow &

Partners.   This Third Party Civil Action had resulted     in

a huge amount of primary research work including the

removal of barrier I24A to laboratories in West Bromwich

where it had undergone extensive testing by SGS.      Similar

barriers to I24A had been tested in the field and the

laboratory and field results had shown a remarkably good

correlation.     Regrettably, some of the testing undertaken

by Eastwood & Partners [ EP ] was performed in a

questionable manner which cast doubt upon the validity of

their results.    Finally, NJB described the vast

amount of photographic and video evidence which EE has,

all of which is available to the HSE with costs being met

by Municipal Mutual    Insurance [MM I ].




Dr. Nicholson outlined that the HSE were also interested

in obtaining the truth and undertake extensive and

regular investigations into a I I kinds of accidents and
                                                                      Act i on
       research work.




2 .0   NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN PEN 3




2.1    Dr. Nicholson outlined how the HSE had reached their

       count of the number of people in Pen 3.    The H S E ’s head

       count was based on a photograph taken at 15.03 (15.02

       real time).   This was an AI enlargement of a police

       photograph which clearly showed the heads and faces of

       people in Pen 3, however, one corner of the Pen was

       missing.   They had used a computer drafting system to

       digitise a I I the faces that could be clearly seen.

       New photographs had then been taken of the area, to

       superimpose the missing space, by applying the same crowd

       density as that near to the missing area a total estimate

       had been produced.




       The site had then been divided into four strips based on

       the three rows of fencing.   Crowd densities had then been

       calculated for the four strips, these were from.the back

       of the stadium 7.5, 7.6 and 8.1 people per square metre,

       the front row had proved more difficult to count because

                                                                    Act i on
      of the angle of the photograph.       However, from tests

      undertaken by the HSE an assumed density of 10 people per

      m2 had been taken in this area, this gave their preferred

      figure of 1576 people.       However, their minimum figure

      would have been 1408, purely based on the number of

      counted heads.    If the assumed density had been altered

      to 8.1   in the front row this would have given a total

      figure of 1478.




2.2   Mr Burne showed the 14:59 [real time] photograph taken

      from Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry which had formed the

      basis of E E ’s head count.    Clearly, this photograph did

      not show people in as much detail and could not hope to

      offer the same accuracy in obtaining numbers as the HSE.

      NJB thought the HSE method of obtaining the number

      of heads was commendable but questioned why the HSE

      photograph had not been made available to E E .




2.3   The HSE then showed another photograph taken from the

      North stand at 14:52, this was of similar angle to the

      14:59 photograph used by EE.       The HSE felt the angle

      made it difficult to apply their criterion of counting



                               5
9




                                                                       Act i on
          actual heads because of the numbers obscured.     However,

          based on this criterion the HSE had obtained figures of

          678 people in Pen 3 and 821   in Pen 4.   However, the HSE

          felt this was unrealistic because the number of people

          obscured seemed excessive.




    2.4   NJB asked whether more people were moving to the

          right as a natural preference.   However, the HSE produced

          a photograph taken at pitch level to show that the

          density was approximately the same in each pen and thus

          showing the head count for Pen 3 was perhaps too low.



    2.5   NJB questioned the time that the pitch level

          photograph was taken and concluded with the HSE that it

          was some time before the barrier collapsed.    Discussion

          then followed about when the barrier actually collapsed.

          NJB had worked back from videos taken and concluded

          that the barrier collapsed between 15.05 and 15.06.

          However, Dr. Nicholson had found that it was very

          difficult to estimate an exact time particularly with the

          number of crowd surges that appeared to indicate

          collapse.   DCC Mervyn Jones stated that the police could



                                 6
                                                                   Act i on
      only estimate that the barrier had collapsed between

      15.00 and 15.06.




2.6   A further discussion followed about the density

      immediately in front of barrier 124A, which the HSE had

      taken at 10 people per square metre.    NJB described

      an anthropometric booklet by Weaver from the BSI which

      suggested   12.5 people per square metre for robust men

      and 16.1 people per square metre for women, or small men.

      NJB agreed to supply Dr. Nicholson with a copy.                EE




2.7   Dr. Nicholson concluded that the density could then be

      between 12.5 and 16.1 because of the number of children

      and women in the crowd.    He further concluded that a

      figure of 10 would perhaps be on the low side.    Dr.

      Nicholson asked whether NJB agreed with the figure

      1576 based on 10 people per square metre in the front

      row.




2.8   NJB felt that the figure was in the high 1400’s

      instead of the high 1500’s but could not give a more

      definite answer.   This was largely because the density in



                             7
                                                                          Act i on
        front of barrier I24A was not significant in the

        calculations that EE had undertaken for the Third Party

       Litigation and that is perhaps why the differences had

       ar isen.




2.9    The HSE raised one point on page 26 of    Elrond’sreport

       describing the ellipse of occupancy and asked Elrond to

       check that the density of 6.75 people per square metre

       was in fact correct.   The HSE felt that purely based upon

       a rectangle as opposed to an ellipse the figure should

       have been 8 people per square metre.     Elrond to check the

       number and to revise report if necessary.                            EE



3 .0   ESCAPE ROUTES FROM THE GROUND




3.1    NJB showed the HSE Appendix M from     the EE report

       and asked whether they agreed with     the 12m escape routes

       that it showed.   NJB highlighted that the exits

       were significant to the maximum allowable capacity of Pen

       3   and related pages 28 & 29 of the EE report.        The basis

       of the 12m escape route, seen in the Green Guide, was

       from a Structural Engineer who used the figures given in



                              8
                                                                    Act i on

      BS 5588 "Means of Escape from Offices” .   The criterion

      for the number of people within the ground is either 5.4

      per square metre for those that can leave within 8

      minutes or those that can leave within 2? minutes in the

      case of an emergency.




3.2   The HSE said that they had also calculated the maximum

      figures for Pen 3 from the Green Guide but had not worked

      out escape routes.   From their calculations they had

      concluded that the maximum allowable figure for Pen 3 and

      Pen 4 was 1693.




3.3   NJB highlighted clause 220 and the three

      alternative safe capacity evaluations and the use of the

      lovest figure for estimating safe ground capacity.      The

      escape through the tunnel was limited to 417 people in 2?

      minutes.   In addition only 300 people could escape to Pen

      2 giving a total maximum allowable occupancy for Pen 3 of

      770.




3.4   The HSE did not dispute this figure and agreed that it

      would be important evidence.   DCC Mervyn Jones took



                              9
                                                                       Act i on
        special note.



4 .0   BARRIER I24A




4.1    NJB outlined the extensive testing performed on

       barrier I24A and the vast number of corroborative field

       tests,    information that had not been available to the HSE

       at the time of their investigation.        NJB described

       page 60 of the EE report which showed the stress strain

       curve for wrought iron under load.        NJB took time

       to explain the behaviour of wrought iron and to explain

       the concept of elasticity and plasticity.




4.2    NJB then explained the SGS laboratory report which

       gave a detailed analysis of the barriers and measured the

       amount of corrosion found.      In addition, the tensile test

       which SGS had obtained indicated that the stresses found

       by the HSE were slightly low.      The tensile strength

       results obtained by SGS were;

       RaiI     I- 2 - low carbon steel 499 N/mm2

       Rail     2 - 3 - wrought iron 375 N/mm2

       Rail     3 - 4 - wrought iron 405 N/mm2




                                 10
       This was in comparison with the HSE figure for rail 3 - 4

       of 365 N/mm2 .




.3    NJB stated that the figures obtained by the HSE had

      been used in all calculations undertaken by EE, to avoid

      any confusion over the results.




4     The HSE highlighted the difficulties in obtaining tensile

      stress figures for wrought iron, because of the degree of

      work hardening.     They stated that their sample had been

      taken from the neutral axis to minimise, as far as

     possible, work hardening effects.




     NJB then highlighted a minor error in the HSE

     drawing of barrier I24A.     Support 3 had been drawn with

     the angles facing in the wrong direction, they did In

     fact face the other way.




     NJB described the analysis performed on barrier

     124A, which had been ratified by Dr. Dickie, Dr. Baker

     and Ha Icrow's.    This consisted of an elastic analysis of

     the rail which indicated that it would deflect 34.8mm
                                                                      Act i on

      under a load of 6 kN/m, however,this would exceed         the

      elastic limit for the rail.Consequently NJB       felt

      that failure of the rail occurred under the clip at

      support 3 at some load less than 6 kN/m.      This would mean

      that the rail between supports 3 & 4 was simply supported

      and it would undergo a large deflection.      This could

      result in the rail pulling out of its retaining clip at

      support 4.     This inturn would increase the loading

      instantaneously on support 3 by a factor of 1.5, causing

      failure.     Testing of a similar barrier I28A by SG had

      indicated rail failure at a load of less than 6 kN/m.

      The cracked rail was seen in the photographs attached as

      Appendix G in the EE report.




4.7   The HSE asked how many times the barrier I28Ahad been

      tested prior to failure.      NJB confirmed the barrier

      had previously been tested twice by EP with further tests

      in July, making three tests before failure.



4.8   The HSE asked what the failure load of Barrier I28A

      actually was, because the results showed that it had

      carried a load of 7.24 kN/m run.     NJB pointed out




                               12
                                                                   Act i on

      that although it had carried this load, under a load of 6

      kN/m, the deflection was still    increasing and failure

      would have occurred had the loading been continued.



4.9   NJB stated that there was a further minor

      discrepancy in the proving ring of the SGS's test rig

      which meant that there would be a few percentage

      differences with the actual   load applied to the rail and

      those shown in the results.   NJB felt that failure

      was in fact at something under 6 kN/m but without a

      calibration certificate from SGS could not confirm this.

      NJB continued to discuss the field testing of the

      various barriers and how the results incorrectly

      indicated the barriers could carry a load of 7.2 kN/m.

      This was in fact merely a reflection of the method of

      testing which only applied loads for 5 minutes whilst not

      accounting for continuing deflection that would lead to

      failure.   NJB then described how rail fracture in

      barrier I28A had been found, because whilst loading was

      being applied there was a large bang, the load was

      released and   the clip over the.rail was removed to take

      photographs of the failure.      The loading was then



                             13
continued to see how the barrier would fail.    It would

appear from these tests and later analysis that failure

of the back leg occurred simultaneously with failure of

the rail, followed by buckling of the front leg at 6 kN/m

which causes collapse.




NJB said that this was borne out by EP testing in

which several rails actually failed under testing and

were cut out and replaced.   In addition, EP had

misinterpreted how to undertake the tests and in

particular how the total deflection of the barriers

should have been measured.




Of the Experts called to the Third Party Litigation Dr.

Eaetwoods Expert, Mr Thorburn, had failed to address

barrier failure loads entirely in his report.   Ha Icrows

who were the only other Expert asked to consider barrier

failure had   concluded in agreement with EE that failure

would occur at or about 6 kN/m.




Further discussion followed about failure and yield of

the barrier   The HSE noted the deflection of barrier I28A
                                                                      Act i on

       under 6 kN/m was only 51mm which does not indicate the

       permanent set of 120mm found at the failure of barrier

       I24A.   NJB stated that if the load is applied for

       long enough,   i.e. a very long ram, then failure would

       occur at 6 kN/m and the limited deflection is only a

       reflection of a poor test procedure.      Further discussion

       followed on the calibration effects caused by SGS not

       having produced a calibration certificate, this NJB

       felt would have tended to reduce the actual     load of the

       barrier by a few percent, but this he did not consider to

       be particularly important.




4.12   NJB then described EP's test rig and in particular

       the arrangement of nuts and bolts which were tightened to

       a H o w easy erection.   This in fact allowed the frame of

       the rig to span over the support carrying some of the

       load.   The HSE had carried out a computer simulation of

       Eastwood's rig and they were happy with it.      However,

       they were not aware of the on site problems and were

       prepared to review their assessment.     The tightening of

       bolts by operatives was apparently carried out without

       Dr. Eastwoods knowledge.      Although this could not be




                                15
                                                                     Act i on
       confirmed because he had not written any operating

       instructions.




       DCC Mervyn Jones asked where the discussion was leading.

       Would a Jury return a verdict of misadventure, an open

       verdict or would the accident be attributed to unlawful

       killing.   Due to the discussions and   differences between

       the Expert Witnesses, DCC Mervyn Jones thought it was

       unlikely that a verdict of unlawful killing would be

       returned by a Jury.    NJB went back to the Ha Icrow

       report which stated that failure occurred at or about 6

       kN/m run which was in agreement with the Elrond report.




4.13   Some discussion followed as to interpretation of the

       Green Guide NJB felt that the statement, "a record

       of any deformation" indicated that EP had not carried out

       the tests correctly.   The HSE felt the wording was too

       loose and that the interpretation drawn by EP was one

       that could have been reasonably made although the HSE's

       interpretation would have been identical to EE.        DCC

       Mervyn Jones concluded that the issue was not clear and

       that criminal proceedings would be unlikely to succeed.




                               16
Further discussions followed as to how barrer I24A had

failed, the HSE insisted that failure occurred

plastically in the rail at a load of 8.1 kN/m.      However,

NJB highlighted that failure must have occurred in

the leg as well, otherwise it would not have collpased to

the ground.   NJB reiterated his mode of failure,

characterised by the rail fracturing at the clip at

around 6 kN/m, thus increasing instantaneously the load

on the central support causing it to fail and the rail

bowing rather than forming a 'V' which   would be

necessary for plastic failure of the rail.




The HSE then asked where the figure quoted in the EE

report of failure at 5.25 kN/m had come from.    NJB

agreed to supply calculations for the failure load

together with the appropriate computer printouts.      Some

discussion followed as to whether it was appropriate to

use an elastic analysis on the failure of essentially a

plastic structure.   NJB stated that there was no

evidence that plastic joints had formed in the      barrier,

consequently an elastic analysis would be appropriate.

In addition, an elastic analysis of the structure would
       offer a 'lower bound' solution.



4.15   There appeared to be some confusion as to the words yield

       and fracture and whether the loads at yield referred to

       in the EE report were actually yield or whether they were

       fracture loads.   Again this would be clarified in the

       calculation and printouts to be produced by EE.




       NJB agreed to obtain copies of the Ha Icrow and SGS

       reports for use by the HSE.




       The HSE agreed to carry out further analysis of the

       barrier failure in light of these reports.   The HSE

       requested that EE obtain a calibration certificate for

       th-e SGS proving ring and update or modify the results as

       necessary.

COMMENTS ON THE ELROND ENGINEERING LTD REPORT
THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER - 15 APRIL 1989
A REPORT FOR HAMMOND SUDDARDS


Summary

This is not presented in a logical sequence and contains rather
sweeping statements, together with some inaccuracies and loose
terminology.

Page 5    - Para 4. The figure of 1200 is not substantiated and     in
            our opinion is a gross under-estimation.

Page 6    - Para 6. Barrier 124a would have begun yielding at
            5.25kN/m but would not have collapsed. Our figure of
            8.1 (span 3/4 corroded) is a better estimate for
            collapse, based on the tests to bend a horizontal tube
            (corrected for the amount of corrosion).

Page 20   - "... the HSE preferred figure of 1576 based on a density
            of 8.4/m2 , may be too generous." We profoundly
            disagree, our estimate was based on just the front row
            at 10/m2 , and the rest were actual counts. In our
            opinion, the density could have been greater than 10 in
            the front row and greater than all the other densities
            measured in the other rows.

Page 25   - "... force ... average human can exert." The HSE model
            is based on the force exerted by a person leaning on the
            person in front.   In a dense crowd it is debatable
            whether people would still be able to actually push one
            another.

Page 27   - The HSE do NOT conclude that the 6kN/m test load is
            inadequate.

Page 32   - The column labelled "Real GG Effective Height" is not
            substantiated by either Brade's measurements or HSE's
            measurements.

Page 37   - Elrond uses the HSE model to predict the force of a 7m
            depth crowd - infers acceptance of the model.

Page 40   - This seems to suggest that failure occurs at the elastic
            limit - but this is the point at which yielding starts
            to occur. There seems to be a lack of clarity in
            Elrond's criteria for failure - elastic limit, yielding,
            collapse, failure - serviceability?

Page 41   - Prediction here appears to be based on a purely elastic
            analysis in which the gusset plate is rotated around the
            front leg. Yielding actually occurs in both the front
            and rear leg and not by a simple rotation.

Page 56   - HSE's figure of 1576 is not a MAXIMUM "... unlikely to
            be an over-estimate ..." This clearly means that we
            think the figure could have been more than 1576.
            - HSE count at 1452 (678) was from a photograph of poor
              quality and therefore "... should be regarded as being
              unrealistically low."

            - "HSE density maximum -10/m2" - we do not claim to be
              an achievable density.  It is very likely that this
              figure was exceeded in Pen 3.

Page 62     - This is a very confused discussion on yielding in
              barriers, not logically presented.

Page 71     - This failure sequence does not appear to include a
              consideration of the behaviour of the top rail. The
              evidence of severe bending must be taken into account.

SECTION F

Page 4      - This criticism of the Eastwood rig may be valid but it
              does give a reasonable load distribution which is
              theoretically more severe than an evenly distributed
              load.

Page 22     - These claimed inaccuracies for Eastwood's rig are not
              supported by factual evidence.

Page 23     - These SGS tests, which went to full collapse are
              compatible with the theoretical figures derived by HSE.

Page 27     - This SGS test data shows complete recovery of the two
              supports after failure of the horizontal rail.

SECTION G

Page 1      - The 3 ram SGS rig would produce a more severe loading
              than the Eastwood rig.

SECTION H    This gives a confused picture of various data extracted
             from the HSE reports.

1     INIBODOCnON

1.1 Following an incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
    Football Club's (SWPC) Hillsborough Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
    request of Mr M S Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
    Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
    Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the HSE team
    investigating the incident following correspondence between the Court of
    Inquiry and the Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hammer.

1.2 This report contains details of examinations performed on site and in the
    laboratory. The work was carried out by me and by other staff of HSE
    working on irty instructions and under my general supervision.


2 SURVEY OF PENS 3 AND 4

    2.1 Using the drawings prepared by Ralph Rrade & Associates, 1340/02 and 03,
•       and comparing with figures stated in the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds
        1986, the following assessments were made.

2.2 The heights of crush barriers should be 1.02m to 1.12m with a preferred
    height of l.lm. In Pen 3 four out of five barriers do not conform. In
    Pen 4 six out of nine barriers do not conform.

2.3 The alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace should
    form an angle of less than 60° to the barriers. Of the four 'paths of
    gaps' in Pen 3, two do not conform. Of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Pen
    4, one does not conform.

2.4 Gaps in the line of crush barriers should be at least l.lm and not more
    than 1.4m in width. In Pen 3, four out of five gaps do not conform. In
    Pen 4, nine out of ten gaps do not conform.

2.5 For a terrace slope of approximately 14° the interpolated maximum
    horizontal distance between barriers is 3.9m. In Pen 3 only one spacing
    does not conform. In Pen 4 only two spacings do not conform.

2.6 Gates or other access points should have a minimum width of l.lm. The
    gate to Pen 3 has a clearance width of 0.81 to 0.82m and the gate to Pen 4
    has a clearance width of 0.77 to 0.79m. Both therefore do not conform.

2.7 The aim is for every spectator on the terraces to be within 12m of a
    gangway or exit. If the perimeter gaps are not considered as exits then
    approximately 40% of the spectators in Pens 3 and 4 will not be within

3.1 Barrier 124A was examined by HSE staff at Hillsborough Football Ground on
    17 April 1989. Various parts of this barrier and 3 core samples of
    concrete were taken to the Sheffield Laboratory on 24 April 1989 for
    detailed assessment.

3.2     It was deduced that barrier 124A had consisted of a continuous horizontal
        tube, made fron wrought iron, and four vertical supports each made from
        two lengths of steel angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset

                                          1
      plate. Five of the eight support feet were reinforced by additional angle
      sections which appeared to be let into the concrete terrace steps. TVjo of
      the rear support legs were braced by further angle sections. A
      reconstruction is shown in Figure 1. The barrier had failed apparently by
      partied, collapse and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the
      horizontal tube at supports 2, 3 and 4, as shewn in Figure 2.
      of the tube which had been located between supports 2 and 3 had been bait
      uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 133rtro at midspan. The
      portion of the tube which had been located between supports 3 and 4 had
      been bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
      midspan. Barrier 124A was estimated to be approximately 60 years old,
      although it had received a number of modifications during its lifetime.

3.3 The tensile strength of the wrought iron tube material was measured at
    365MPa (23.6 tonf/in2) with an estimated elastic limit of 150MPa
    (9 7 tonf/in2). The tensile strength of the mild steel angle used for
    the supports was measured at 360MPa (23.3 tonf/in^) with a yield stress
    of 288MPa (18.6 tonf/in2).
3.4 The tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under the
    metal straps designed to retain the tube. At these locations the tubes
    had not been painted, and the tube wall thicknesses, nominally 4.5mm, had
    been reduced significantly by corrosion. At the fracture surface
    corresponding to support 2 the residual thickness of the tube wall was
    found to vary from 0.4itm to 4.4itm arcxind the circumference. Similarly a
    the fracture surface corresponding to support 3 the wall thickness was in
    the range 1 .6irm to 4.5am. At support 4, however, there was evidence that
    the tube wall had been perforated by corrosion at two locations producing
    holes which would have been approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before
    the collapse. Elsewhere, arcund the fracture corresponding to support 4,
    the wall thickness was in the range l.Umn to 4.5am.

3.5    in qeneral the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
       iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. Fracture
       of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on the vqphill
       side of the barrier at a position approximately 90° fran tqp dead centre.
       The other tube fractures had suffered seine post-failure damage and the
       origins were not readily identifiable.
3.6 The failed supports had been corroded, particularly at the junction witti
    the concrete steps and/or reinforcement angles. In these r e g i o n s residual
    thicknesses in the range 3. Iran - 5.9nm were measured cxtipared with a
    nominal thickness of 6.3irm.
 3.7 Large amounts of metal had been lost by corrosion from supports 3 and 4
     near, what would have been, the original junctions between the support
     feet and the terrace. In one case (rear leg support 4) a ligament of
     metal Bran wide was all that remained of the original angle section (50 x
     50mm). On two of the four feet this region had been reinforced by the
     addition of a length of metal angle whidi had been bolted ai tcp of the
     original angle from which the support had been made. The heitfit of the
     concrete terrace had been raised at sane stage and this had concealed the
     previous corrosion damage. The appearance of the concrete cores,
     extracted from near the support feet, was consistent with this
     observation.

     barrier 124A, and the collapse sequence are currently underway.

4    INVESTIGATION OF TOKNSTTLFS AT TOE TKPPTMGS LANE EM)

4.1 On 25 April 1989 HSE staff made tests on turnstiles at the lappings lane
    end of the stadium to investigate hew the application of a force to a
    'gate' affected the release of a turnstile. On 28 April 1989 tests were
    marte to apsftfis the accuracy of the computerised systam for counting and
    recording the admissions through the turnstiles. Calculations were made
    to compare the average admission requirements of turnstiles serving the
    designated zones of the stadium. Counts of people passing through the
    turnstiles A to G were made from video recordings.

        toe EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL FORCE POSHING ON TOE 'GATE' OF A TOKNSTIIE

|4.2    Turnstiles C to G appeared to be of the same pattern, whilst turnstiles A
        and B were of a different pattern. In the tests a known force measured by
        a load ™=>n was applied to the 'gate' of the turnstile. Standard test
        weights were then placed gently on the pedal until the spindle was
        released. The tests showed that turnstiles C to G were likely to be more
        difficult to release than turnstiles A and B.

 4.3    A turnstile operator having a weight of 750 N (12 stone) or less might
        have difficulty in releasing turnstiles in the group C to G if a force of
        480 N (110 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'. Hie same operator
        mi^it have difficulty in releasing turnstiles A and B if a force of 1340 N
        (300 lbf) or more was applied to the 'gates'.
        TOE ACCURACY OF TOE CCMEUTERISED SYSTEM FOR CCXJNITNG AND RECORDING
        ADMISSIONS
  4.4 Turnstiles were checked by rotating the 'gate' a known number of times and
      then recording the count measured in the control rocro. Tests of
      ■Hin yat-ilog in the group 9 to 16 indicated that they recorded the correct
}     number of admissions.
 4.5 Tests indicated that turnstiles A, B, C, D, E and F were likely to record
     the correct number of admissions. In irty opinion turnstiles A to F, as a
     group, would indicate the correct number of admissions to within 1%.

    4.6 Tests indicated that there could be a persistent error in the recorded
        nuntoer of admissions through turnstile G. It is my opinion that this
        turnstile mi^it continuously register less than the correct number of
        admissions during a period of operation. It was concluded that the error
        was probably attributable to the roller of the roller-plunger micro-- switch
        fitted to this turnstile only just making contact with the upper boss of
        each 'gate'.
    4.7 Additional detectors were installed across each turnstile passageway at
        positions above the gates. Examination of these devices ^indicated that
        some appeared to be disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been
        cut.

 4 12 The method of counting used a micro-coqputer and specially developed
      program. A push-button was depressed every time a person was se«^to
      emerge fron an identified turnstile booth and theccirputer recorded the
      siqnal and its time. People emerging from turnstiles A and B were counted
      together because it was not always possible to differentiate between
      people emerging from these individual turnstiles.

 4.13 The analysed data provided the relationship betweai the total nujtoer of

 ESTIMATE OF PBOPLF ATMnTED THROUGH 'GATE C' TAKEN FRCM VIDEO RECORDINGS

1 A video recording labelled RJH2, delivered by West Midlands Police, was
  iycg>H for this analysis. It was copied by HSE photographers and a tuning
  reference added. This copy was given the identification DF1/B. It shewed
  the exits of turnstile booths A to G, Gate C and the general area on the
  West Stand side of these turnstiles. The continuous reference timings on
  the video recording related to the start of the tape and not to BST.

2 I was told by West Midlands Police that, following scrutiny of
  synchronised video recordings, the 'First Opening' of Gate C had occurred
  at approximately 14.48pm for a duration of ~ 30 seconds. I was also told
  that the 'Second Opening' of Gate C had started at -14.52pm and finished
  at ~ 14.58pm, a duration of ~ 5h minutes. A 'Third Opening' then occurred
  approximately one minute later when the gate was opened for approximately
  8 minutes, sufficient to allow the entry of people in single file.

3 The method of assessment for the first two openings was to count the
  number of people passing a reference line for a period of 3 seconds and
  then to repeat this process at intervals of no greater than 15 seconds.
  At times when the rate was seen to vary rapidly, and for the whole of the
  'First Opening', samples were taken more frequently than at 15 seconds.
  Figure 5 shows a graph of the number of people who entered through Gate C
  during the 'Second Opening'.
4 p.gt--iTnat-g>g of accuracy are based on the possibility of missing one in ten
  of the people passing the reference line and the unlikelihood of missing
  more than two in ten.
.5 Hie estimate of the number of people passing through Gate C during the
   'Second Opening' based on the counting was 1800 tut this should be
   regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be 10% higher than 1800
   i.e. about 2000, and in my opinion the actual number was unlikely to be
   greater than 2200.
.6 Hie estimate of the number of people passing through Gate C during the
   'First Opening' based on the counting was 130 tut this should again be
   regarded as a minimum. The best estimate would be about 150, and in my
   opinion the actual number was unlikely to be greater than 180.

.7 In the 'Third Opening' entries were much slower and a more accurate count
   was possible. A total of 90 were counted over a period of about 8
   minutes, and in my opinion the actual number is unlikely to be greater
   than 100.
.8 The following table is a summary of the estimates of both Gate C and
   turnstile A to G entries.

6.1 Drawing 1340/02A by Ralph Brade & Associates gives dimensions of Pens,3
     and 4 Both Pens are shewn as being 13.1m deep; Pen 3 is shewn as being
     14.350m wide and Pen 4 as being 14.645m wide. Based on these dimensions
     the areas are 188.Osq m and 191.8sq m.

6.2 The 1986 "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" states
       "222     The extreme allowances for packing density are as follows:

                a.   54 persons per 10 square metres when the terrace or
                     viewing slope is in good condition (as set cut in
                     Chapter 8); and
                b.    27 persons per 10 square metres when it materially
                      deviates from the reocranended guidlines, so as to
                      constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
                      packed.
       223    It may be necessary to interpolate between these figures where
       conditions fall between the two extremes. When ..."

 6.3 If 54 people per 10 sq m is assumed as the allowable packing density
     for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and the ^
     capacity of Pen 4 is 1036 making a total of 2051 for the oonbined
     area.
 6.5   The above calculations of capacity nust therefore be assumed to be
       the maximum allowable capacity for this terrace area.            also
       qives examples of hew this maximum capacity figure should be reduced
       when certain factors do not conform to the guide. Exaitples include

        a)       When the strength of crush barriers conform with the
                 guidelines but the spacing of such barriers does not ...

          c)   When the positioning and width of gangways do not meet with the
               reccranendations of Chapter 8. ...
6 6 It also states that when crush barriers do not meet the quinines on
    strength      bat are well constructed, consideration may be given to
    allowing a lower packing density figure for the purpose of calculation.

7,1 ^ S i S 2 S ^ ^ n 15 April 1989, and sev^al of these £°to^aphs were
    identified as providing material for the estimation of the numbe^in
    Pen 3. Enlargements of photographs EKL/7A and EKL/8A             ^   ^
    West Midlands Police and these two photographs were
    The      identification marking on both these photographs was 15.0 .

 •7 9 qvie Ti^thod of assessment entailed mounting the photographs on an
,7-2               S g S S T ^ l e (Digitiser) and then making           of-*
1     person who was discernible. The Digitiser was iinkedtoCon^it^Aad^
      Sftiixi software and the act of marking each person on the photograph
      enabled^the physical points on the photograph to be placed on an
      electronic grid which could then be displayed, under computer control, on
      f ^ ? S ^ o r printed out on a graphics plotter. Actual countmg of the
      number of those identified within a specified area was carried cut
       automatically and no allowance was made for people that were hidden from
      view.
 7 3 On 22 May 1989 photographs were taken of the empty pens by the same
     SrtigrSher, uSETth^same camera and camera position. H u s enabled the
     i      ~i     barrier locations in Pen 3 to be transposed onto the

     in the remaining 25% was similar to that in the photographed area o
     Pen 3.
           rv. ocd-iTnated headcount for the whole of Pen 3 was 1408 people tut areas

           the area forward of the first barriers were generally l e s s disoermoie
           than those behind the first barrier; 1408 is therefore a minimum estimate.

        The results fron a more detailed analysis, in which Pen 3 was sub-divided

        barriers, are summarised in the Table overleaf. Figures 6, 7 and 8

       pecple per square metre; the estimates are tabulated overleaf.

9.1      Various aspects of the crush barriers and perimeter gates in Pens 3 and 4
        did not conform to the 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986'.

9.2      The broken barrier, 124A, was made from wrought iron tube and mild steel
        angle section. Both tube and angle sections were heavily corroded in seme
        areas. Calculations on the mechanism and force required to cause the
        collapse of the barrier are proceeding.

9.3 Examination of turnstiles A-G indicated that there was a fault in the
    counting mechanism of G. From assessment of video recordings, a best
    estimate of pecple entering through A-G was 7494, with a maximum of 7644.

9.4      If Gate C had not been opened, HSE estimate that it would have taken until
         about 3.40pm to admit 10,100 pecple through turnstiles A to G.

9.5 Assessment of the numbers of turnstiles allocated to various zones of the
    stadium revealed that the average admission requirement of the turnstiles
    serving the west Terrace was the highest for any zone of the stadium, and
    was approximately 2.9 times the requirement for Spion Kcp.

9.6 HSE's best estimate of the total number of people who entered the ground
    during the three openings of Gate C was 2240 with a maximum of 2480.

9.7 HSE's best estimate of the total number of pecple who entered the ground
    through gate C (3 openings) and turnstiles A-G was 9734, with a maximum
    value of 10124.

    9.8 Even if the strength and spacing of the barriers had complied with the
        'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds 1986', HSE's calculations shewed that
        the capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was 1015 and 1036 respectively.

    9.9 Since the barriers did not ccnply in all respects with the Guide (see 9.1)
        the estimated capacity of Pens 3 and 4 would be less than in 9.7 above.

    9.10 Hie best estimate, based on photographs, of the number of pecple in Pen 3
         at 15.03 was 1576.

    9.11 The number of pecple who could be accomodated theoretically between the
         pgT-ime>t-/yr gates and the turnstiles at Lappings Lane was estimated to be
         3880 and 4850 for crowd packing densities 8.0 and 10.0 per square metre
         respectively.

Dear Sir,

Re: Barrier Testing

Further to our Fax of 16th June, 1989 in connection with the above
we enclose copies of our methods for testing barriers together
with test results from Odsal and Aston Villa which help to illus­
trate the two methods used.

With regard to your second question we have no experience in deter­
mining ground capacities.  However we suggest you contact
Mr.Paul Stefanuti, Chief Building Control Officer, City of
Bradford Metropolitan Council, Jacobs Well, Bradford.BDl.5RW.

Thirdly we would like to add the following observations regarding
barrier testing:-

a)   The code refers to peak viewing areas but only defines those
      for football. Where are the peak viewingareas for other
      sports ie: Rugby, Speedway etc.?

b)   There is a lower test load for new barriers as opposed to                                           old -
     why?

c)   The code does not appear to include any requirement to check
     that recommendations contained in a test report have been imp­
     lemented. We raise this point as there have been instances,
     when returning the following year for further testing, where
     we have found that our recommendations (either wholly or partly)
     have not been carried out.

d)   Whilst we consider ourselves capable of designing and adapting
     equipment to pull or push Barriers/handrails, some are extremely
     difficult, if not impossible, to test.  Designers of sports

         grounds should be more aware that testing is necessary.

We would like to point out that we are, at present, in the barrier
testing season and, should you have any constructive suggestions or
ideas, we would be very pleased to receive them in order that we
may give them consideration during the course of our work.

Should you require any further information, or assistance please
do not hesitate to contact us.

 6     The general appearance of the barriers on the Northern
       Terrace is poor. Rust is evident, particularly on the
       non-galvanised sections (N.B. some of the new tubular
       barriers are not galvanised and are rusting).
       The equipment used to test the barriers is by necessity
       quite heavy and damage to the barriers' protective coating
       is inevitable. We recommend that a maintenance programme
       be instigated and that barries tested each year are repainted.
       This would result in a barrier being repainted every 5 years.

 7     We consider the scaffolding segregation barriers on the
       Northern Terrace to be ineffective and dangerous. We
       recommend it be removed and if necessary replaced by a
       proper segregation fence.

 8     The scaffolding segregation barriers on the South Western
       Terrace have dangerous protrusions on which people could
       become impaled. These should also be removed or replaced
       as above.

 9     For the purpose of this document the following result
       sheets are titled as follows.

10    When first tested there were several barriers which failed
      to achieve the required standard, these were re tested
      and are marked such in the report.
      It was generally found that the reason for failure was
      the i2®dsk of and defective grout at the base of the
      §tanchions. We would recommend that where the grouting is
      defective the stanchion base be scraped of all loose or
      defective debris and the core repacked with concrete to
      fill.all voids and achieve a reasonably water tight seal
      around base of stanchions.

Dear Mr Jones

Today we are removing the remaining bay of the broken crush barrier No 124A
from the Lappings Lane Terrace. We are also removing barrier 125 from Pen 3
and barrier 129 from Pen 6, and these will be subjected to further examination
and testing in our laboratory. This is in accordance with your letter to
Mr Mackrell of 6 July 1989.

To date our examinations have concentrated on Pens 3 and 4, but in attempting
to locate a barrier similar to 124A in dimensions, structure and condition, we
examined barriers in other Pens at the Leppings Lane end and also at the Spion
Kqp end. We were attempting to locate barriers which showed evidence of
corrosion under the straps at the supports and, if possible, to identify an
isolated case where corrosion had created actual holes in the horizontal tube.
In a brief examination we identified holes in various barriers within Pens 1/2,
3, 4 and 6 at the Leppings Lane end and also holes in 32 of the older style
barriers at the Spion Kcp end. Some of these Spion Kop barriers showed severe
corrosion, with large holes of up to -^50inm being found. It must be stressed
that our examination was in no way exhaustive and in our opinion a thorough
examination by an independent structural engineer is required.

It should   be noted that in his evidence to the Court of Inquiry, Dr Eastwood
was shown   a photograph of a hole in barrier 125 and declared that such severe
corrosion   would result in the barrier being "condemned". In view of this, I
recommend   that re-examination be carried out forthwith.

With the removal of the 3 barriers previously referred to, this completes the
HSE's study at the ground and, as far as we are concerned, the embargo placed
on Leppings Lane end can be lifted. However, for the reasons stated above,
this in no way implies HSE's acceptance of the state of the ground, this must
be dealt with by the appropriate authorities.

Yours sincerely

Dear Mr Jones

HUISBGRCOGH INQUIRY - SUBMISSIONS ON BEHALF OF ER EASTWOOD

My comments on the above document are as follows:

Paragraphs I d ) . 8 and 9: This submission contains no mention of corrosion, or
its assessment, which should have formed part of the inspection procedure.
Dr Eastwood agreed in his evidence (day 26 pl09) that barriers which contained
corroded holes would have been condemned. The collapsed barrier contained
corroded holes (HSE Report para 3.4) which would have been visible at the 1988
inspection.

Paragraph 10: Since deflections were not measured on each span (day 26 pll3
Collins/Eastwood) how can it be said that both spans passed?

Paragraph 11: Dr Eastwood stated (day 26 pll3) that "there has been an error
in testing" and hence this paragraph is confusing.

Paragraph 12: It was accepted eventually by Dr Eastwood that deflections could
get larger with successive load applications (day 26 pll7) and hence it is by
no means certain that the span requiring a re-test would have passed.

Paragraph 13: It has not been proved that barriers 128 and 137 were deformed
on or before 15/4/89. The test results supplied to HSE by Dr Eastwood
(covering letter Eastwood/James dated 1/6/89) state that for barrier 128 the
"first load application, up to 1.4 tonnes resulted in a 75% recovery after
release of load" which suggests that, for this barrier, plastic deformation
occurred at less than 1.2 times the design load for a new barrier (5kN/m).
Eastwood's data require explanation.

Recent HSE results (not available when the report was issued) indicate that the
crowd density was similar in pens 3 and 4 and hence "crush pressure" would also
have been similar in the two pens.

Paragraph 14: The Green Guide does not quantify "crowd pressure" and hence
this statement could be challenged.

Paragraph 16: A definition of "significantly" is required here. Certainly
barriers which were as much as 18% below the minimum recommended height were
not replaced (eg barrier 136 pen 3).

                                        1
Paragraph 18: Most barriers at the Lappings Lane End had been positioned so as
to prevent spectators standing on the same step as the barrier. Hie examples
chosen by Dr Eastwood were not typical (day 27 p61).

Paragraph 20: Some spectators have stated that they were pressed over the
barriers, thus compressing those on the lower side. The height of the barriers
is therefore very relevant.

Paragraph 22: Hie alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers is
specified in the Green Guide. This does not appear to have been considered by
Dr Eastwood. Some of the gaps in the lines of barriers were well in excess of
the Guide reccsnmendations. For example, the gap between barriers 136 and 136A,
immediately above the collapsed spans of 124A, was 57% larger than the Guide
maximum.

Paragraph 33: I do not agree with this statement. In the absence of radial
fences, spectators would have spread more uniformly along the Leppings Lane
Terrace, thus reducing crowd density in the central area.

Paragraph 42: In Pen 3, a configuration of barriers complying with the Green
Guide would have led to a reduction in pressure on specific barriers
(particularly 124A) and hence barrier collapse may have been averted. Crushing
injuries may still have occurred but the death toll would, in ray opinion, have
been reduced substantially. The situation in Pen 4, where the barrier
configuration was better, and the crowd density was similar, supports this
view.

Paragraphs 45. 47. 48 and 50: The capacity of Pens 3 and 4 is not given,
although that of Spion Kcp is! It is not credible that "a loss in capacity"
(para 47) or "the effect on capacity" (para 48) could be quantified or
discussed unless the original capacities had been calculated already. Likewise
the only sensible way of allocating spectators to a particular pen would be on
the basis of a known and agreed capacity. The term "visibly full" (para 50) is
meaningless in this context.


Do not hesitate to contact me if you require clarification of any of the above
points. I expect to attend the Inquiry tomorrow (14th) from 9.30am onwards.

Yours sincerely

Dear Sir

Hillsborough Disaster
further to my letter of the 17th May, I have been informed by
the Club that it is their intention to remove the remaining
barriers and safety fence to the Leppings Lane terrace
immediately before the start of the forthcoming season.

The Club have already agreed to the removal of a further
barrier from the ground for testing in accordance with, the
agreement reached between the experts in the litigation at
their meeting on the 5th April. It is anticipated by the end
of July/beginning of August, that these experts will^ have
completed their encruiries for the purposes of preparing a
-eport   and therefore from that point of view, there is no
need for the Leppings Lane terrace to remain in its present
 state as the parties to the litigation will not be prejudxce ^
by such w o r k s ' being undertaken. I have informed the parties
 Solicitors of the Club's intentions in this regard, and have
 said auite clearly that the whole matter should be reviewed
 once aaain at the end of July when we have a much clearer
 picture of any potential problems that may be caused by these
 Intended works.
 anupver I am of course extremely conscious of any continuing
 interest your investigation team may have in the terrace
 r^SSng L         its preslnt state, together with that of H.M.
 Coroner and the Crown Prosecution Service. I would ask you to
 confirm whether there is any objection to these works being
 c a - i e d out.   As stated above, the position needs to be
 reviewed at the end of July, but at this stage I would be
 grateful if you would indicate whether there is any continuing
 interest in the terrace.

1 INTRODUCTION

Following the incident on 15 April 1989, staff of the Health and Safety
Executive visited Hillsborough Football Ground. The crush barriers in
Pens 3 and 4 (central pen), at the Leppings Lane end of the ground, were
examined on 16 and 17 April 1989 and identified with a paint marker in
accordance with a drawing supplied by Mr Paul Jackson, Sheffield
Environmental Health Department. On each barrier the support locations
were numbered sequentially from left to right when viewed from the pitch.

Barrier 124A appeared to have collapsed and a length of the horizontal
tube had become detached. This detached length of tube had been found on
the pitch in front of gate 3 in the perimeter fence at the Leppings Lane
end on 16 April 1989 by Dr Nicholson. It was kept in a secure place by
Club Officials and was placed in Pen 3 on 17 April 1989 so that it could
be examined in conjunction with the rest of the barrier. Subsequently on
17 April 1989 it was taken to the Sheffield Laboratory of the Health and
Safety Executive together with another small piece of tube found by Dr
Nicholson on 17 April 1989 (see 2.1, page 3 below).

On 24 April 1989 the damaged parts of barrier 124A, consisting of two
lengths of tube and two supports, were removed from Pen 3, under the
supervision of the authors of this report, and taken to the Sheffield
Laboratory of the Health and Safety Executive for metallurgical
assessment. The remainder of barrier 124A was removed by Mr P F Heyes
and HSE staff on 7 July 1989.

This report contains details of examinations performed both on site and
in the laboratory. The work was carried out by the authors and by other
staff of HSE working on their instruction and under their general
supervision.

2 ON SITE EXAMINATION

2.1 BARRIER 124A

Barrier 124A was located on the seventh, eighth and ninth steps of Pen 3
adjacent to Pen 2. The overall length of this barrier before collapse
was estimated to be 7.5m including a tube overhang of 0.6m near the
radial fence adjacent to Pen 2. The horizontal distance from this
barrier to the perimeter fence at the front of Pen 3 was approximately
3.5m, and the distance of the tube end from the radial fence, separating
Pens 2 and 3, was 28mm. There were no other barriers between barrier
124A and the perimeter fence. A sketch of this barrier, showing our
opinion of its appearance before the incident, is shown in Figure 1.

The evidence suggested that, prior to the collapse, barrier 124A had
consisted of four vertical supports with a horizontal tube between them.
HSE staff numbered the supports 1,2,3 and 4, beginning at the end nearer
Pen 2.
V




    Each vertical support had consisted of two lengths of 52mm wide metal
    angle, having a thickness of 6mm, inclined at an angle of 20 degrees to
    one another. During manufacture each front support leg had been curved
    near the top to form a horizontal surface and had been joined to the
    rear support leg by a triangular gusset plate. The latter had been
    rivetted to the two lengths of metal angle. The horizontal tube had been
    made from hollow circular section metal with an outside diameter of
    60mm. An inverted U-shaped strap, approximately 50mm wide, had been
    bolted to the top of each support, and this was presumably intended to
    retain the horizontal tube.

    Figure 2 shows barrier 124A viewed from the pitch as it appeared on the
    morning of 17 April 1989. The detached length of tube had a transverse
    fracture at either end. One of these fractures matched the fracture on
    the length of tube in contact with support 2 and the other matched the
    fracture on the length of tube in contact with support 3. Hence it was
    possible to locate this detached length of tube in the correct
    position between supports 2 and 3. This detached length of tube had
    been bent symmetrically about its mid-point where the maximum deflection
    was 133mm.

    Support 4, shown in the foreground of Figure 1, had been moved forward
    and twisted towards the front left-hand corner of Pen 3, viewed from the
    pitch. The lower portion of the front leg had remained straight,
    although by comparison with the front legs of other barriers, it
    appeared to have moved forward through an angle of 25 degrees
    approximately. In so doing the front leg had broken away from the edge
    of the concrete step in which it had been supported. Several pieces of
    detached concrete were observed nearby, two of which matched the
    fracture on the step, shown in Figure 3. The upper portion of the front
    leg had suffered localised bending and it had been twisted inwards with
    respect to the other supports on this barrier.

    The rear leg of support 4 had been deformed and kinked at the lower end
    near the junction with a piece of reinforcing steel angle which had been
    bolted on top of the original angle section. The latter had been thinned
    by corrosion in the area where this deformation had occurred. The rear
    leg also exhibited localised deformation and cracking in the vicinity of
    the lowest gusset plate attachment hole. The gusset plate appeared to be
    relatively undeformed but had been moved inwards towards the other
    supports. The tube retaining strap appeared to be intact and still in
    position.

    Support 3 had been deformed extensively and flattened so that it was
    almost horizontal. The general direction of deformation was towards the
    front left-hand corner of the pen, viewed from the pitch. At its lower
    end the front leg had been deformed adjacent to a piece of reinforcing
    angle, but both the latter and the surrounding concrete were
    undisturbed. The rear leg had been bent forward and the majority of the
    deformation had occurred at the junction with the concrete step. The
    step itself was intact. The gusset plate was undeformed but it had been
    torn from the upper part of the rear leg and moved forward. The strap
    retaining the tube at support 3 had been straightened partially but the
    tube appeared to be captive at this position. A transverse fracture of
    the tube, in the vicinity of some tube wall corrosion, was visible under
    the strap.


                                    - 2 -
The length of tube in contact with support 3 had been bent by 200mm at
midspan and it had a ragged fracture in a corroded region near the end
further from support 3, i.e. the free end. The latter had presumably
been located under the strap on support 4 before collapse occurred. The
fracture in the tube corresponding with support 4 was partly transverse
and partly longitudinal, the original manufactured end being deformed
but not fractured. At some stage the tube had also been partially
crushed at this location.

During the visit on 17 April, a small piece of metal, roughly
semi-circular in section, was found in Pen 3 by Dr C Nicholson amongst
the debris near gate 3 in the perimeter fence. The fracture on this
small piece matched that at the end of the tube corresponding to support
4. This end of the tube had apparently moved a distance of 1.4m in the
horizontal plane before coming to rest on the steps. In total, the
collapsed part of barrier 124A occupied an area measuring 4m along the
terrace and 1.6m down the terrace in Pen 3.

Supports 1 and 2 were free from damage and the length of tube between
them had not been deformed significantly. This length of tube contained
two circumferential welds positioned as follows when viewed from the
pitch side: one approximately 0.2m left from the strap on support 2; the
other 0.05m right from the strap on support 1. The tube had fractured
transversely under the strap on support 2 and a smaller diameter tube
insert was observed protruding a distance of 25mm from this fracture.
There was evidence of considerable corrosion of the original tube under
this strap. The tube insert appeared to be approximately 150mm in total
length. The strap on support 2 had been welded to the tube on the left
side only. This was the only location on barrier 124A where a strap had
been welded to the tube.

Support 1 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to each foot and the
rear leg had been braced by an additional piece of angle acting as an
outrigger. Support 2 had a piece of reinforcing angle attached to the
front foot only with an outrigger on the rear leg.

2.2 OTHER BARRIERS IN PENS 3 AND 4

The remaining barriers in Pen 3 and those in Pen 4 were examined. The
layout of all the barriers in Pens 3 and 4 is shown schematically in
Figure 4. On each barrier the supports were numbered sequentially from
left to right as viewed from the pitch. Several barriers had been
fabricated with rectangular hollow section supports and these appeared
to be somewhat newer than the rest. Most of the old-style barriers had
been modified in some way, for example by reinforcing of the support
legs and welding of the horizontal tubes. Corrosion was evident at all
joints and intersections, and rust "jacking" had occurred at many of the
gusset plate/support leg junctions.

Most of the horizontal tubes on the older barriers were open-ended and
in two cases (barrier 125 near support 1 and barrier 128 near support 1)
holes in the tube wall, caused by corrosion under the support strap,
were clearly visible. An example of this is shown arrowed in Figure 5
which depicts the end of barrier 125 adjacent to barrier 124A in Pen 3.
The hole is approximately 25mm in diameter and its centre is 60mm from
the end of the tube.

    "C
         2.3 EXCAVATION OF BARRIER 124A SUPPORTS 3 AND 4 ON 24 APRIL 1989

         It was agreed by the Inquiry that supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A could
         removed for laboratory examination. Three cylindrical cores, measuring
         0.1m in diameter and 0.4m in length, were cut from the concrete steps at
         positions specified by Mr C Pertee, a Principal Specialist Inspector in
         the Technology Division of HSE, before excavation of the supports
         commenced. These cores, from steps 7, 8 and 9, were identified by the
         letters P,Q and U respectively. After cutting, core P was found to
         contain a piece of the front foot from support 4 and core U was found to
         contain a piece of the rear foot of support 3.

         It became apparent during excavation that each support leg had been
         flattened and shaped to form a foot which had been positioned
         horizontally in the ground and bolted to a base plate. The supports were
         freed by unscrewing, or grinding off the nuts in contact with the feet
         of the supports. In all cases the boundary between the support and the
         concrete was marked using yellow paint.

         When the front foot of support 4 was exposed, considerable thinning and
         loss of metal was observed in the vicinity of the bend between the
         upright and the foot. This area was further weakened during core
         drilling and the remaining ligament of metal, approximately 5mm wide and
         0.8mm in thickness, became detached during removal of the support. Part
         of the front foot was found to be in contact with a reinforcing wire in
         the concrete and a length of this wire was removed for possible future
         examination.

         The pieces of reinforcing angle, noted previously on the rear leg of
         support 4 and the front leg of support 3, were observed to extend below
         the surface of the concrete to the bend at the start of the foot.

         The length of tube remaining in contact with support 3 slipped out of
         the strap during lifting of the support. It was apparent that this
         length of tube had not been fixed intentionally to the strap and it had
         been held temporarily in position by accumulated rust and debris only.

         2.4 REMOVAL OF INTACT PART OF BARRIER 124A ON 7 JULY 1989

         The feet of supports 1 and 2 were excavated to a depth of 50mm
         approximately and subsequently cut using an angle grinder. This
         permitted both supports, and the length of tube between them, to be
         removed in one piece.

3.2   CONCRETE CORES

The three cores are shown schematically in Figure 6. They were taken at
different positions along the terrace but, for convenience, they are
shown here in the same plane. Core P was extracted in three pieces: a
cylindrical upper piece, approximately 85mm in length, which was
composed of an upper layer (27mm in thickness) containing relatively
fine aggregate, typically a few millimetres in section and a lower layer
(52mm in thickness) containing coarser aggregate, typically 5 -10mm in
section, an irregular shaped intermediate piece, with a maximum length
of 120mm, which contained the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in
section, and bore an impression of a section of barrier support foot; a
cylindrical lower layer, 180mm in length also containing the coarsest
aggregate (20-30mm in section)

Core Q was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
approximately 138mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer (23mm
in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a few
I


    c>   millimetres in section, a middle layer (65mm in thickness) containing
         coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in section, and lower a layer, 50mm
         in thickness, of loosely bound coarse material; a lower piece, 245mm in
         length containing the coarsest aggregate, typically 20-30mm in section.

         Core U was extracted in two cylindrical pieces: an upper piece,
         approximately 141mm in length, which was composed of an upper layer
         (26mm in thickness) containing relatively fine aggregate, typically a
         few millimetres in section and a lower layer (115mm in thickness)
         containing coarser aggregate, typically 5-10mm in section; a lower
         piece, 200mm in length, containing the coarsest aggregate, typically
         20-30mm in section. The lower layer contained a slice through a barrier
         support foot consisting of, in descending order, a nut, a piece of foot,
         a piece of bolt and a piece of base-plate.

         3.3 LENGTHS OF TUBE FROM BARRIER 124A

         3.3.1 Visual examination

         The two detached lengths of tube (CEN/2 and PFH/1) are shown in Figures
         7 and 8 respectively. The length of tube which had been between supports
         3 and 4 was designated "tube 3/4" by the authors and the length of tube
         which had between supports 2 and 3 was designated "tube 2/3". Each
         length measured 2.3m and had an external diameter of 60mm. The length of
         tube between supports 1 and 2 was designated "tube 1/2" and its overall
         length was approximately 3m. The outside diameter of this tube was 60mm.

         Bottom dead centre of tube 2/3 and 3/4 was located by examination of
         paint runs and an accumulation of dried paint. It was deduced that both
         lengths of tube had been deformed towards the pitch in a horizontal
         plane.

         Visual examination of the fractures indicated that in general the
         failure of the tube had occurred in a fibrous, ductile manner. On the
         two matching fractures which had been coincident with support 3 there
         was however a region of bright crystalline fracture, shown arrowed in
         Figure 9, consistent with a more brittle failure mode. This, crystalline
         fracture had occurred where the remaining wall thickness of the tube was
         at a maximum.

         In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of wrought
         iron which had fractured in a single-stage bending/tensile mode.
         Fracture of the tube adjacent to support 3 appeared to have initiated on
         the uphill side of the barrier at a position at right angles to top
         dead centre. The other tube fractures had suffered some post-failure
         damage and the origins were not readily identifiable.

         At all the fracture positions much of the wall thickness of the tube had
         been reduced, mainly by external corrosion. The corrosion had occurred
         under the locating straps in areas, approximately 65mm wide, which were
         unpainted. The end of the tube at the position of support 4 had been
         open to the environment and additional corrosion at the internal surface
         of the tube had occurred. This had resulted in the formation of two
         holes through the wall approximately 10 and 20 mm in diameter under the
         strap. One of these holes, shown arrowed in Figure 10, appeared to have
         initiated the fracture and led to the detachment of the small piece of
         tube (arrowed in Figure 11) found on the steps, item CEN/1. These holes
         were location at the 4 o'clock and 8 o'clock positions and their centres
         would have been approximately 50mm from the open end of the tube at
         support 4 before failure.
The extent of corrosion of tube 1/2 under the strap at support 2 was
disclosed when the strap was removed (Figure 12). Tube 1/2 was removed
subsequently from supports 1 and 2 to permit closer examination. This
revealed that two pieces of tube had been joined beneath support 2 by a
part circumferential weld which also served to join the strap to the
tube at this support. A 150mm long tubular insert (arrowed in Figure
12), with an outside diameter of 49mm and a wall thickness of 5mm, was
located inside the main tube at a position corresponding with support 2.
This reinforcement was retained by means of a tack weld on the inside of
the main tube between support 2 and the adjacent circumferential weld in
the main tube, which had been noted on site. Hence, neglecting the
insert, the tube between supports 1 and 2 apparently consisted of three
pieces joined by: a circumferential near support 1; a circumferential
weld near support 2; a part circumferential weld beneath support 2.

An oval hole, shown in Figure 13 and measuring 35 x 15mm, was revealed
in the tube under the strap on support 1, at the 4 o'clock position when
viewed from the end nearer support 1. This hole had apparently been
formed by external corrosion of the tube under the strap.

A rolled-up newspaper was found inside tube 2/3. This was part of a copy
of the "Yorkshire Telegraph & Star", dated Saturday 24 October 1931. A
piece of another newpaper, "The Star" dated Saturday 26 September 1959,
was found in tube 1/2. Various other items of debris were found
elsewhere in the lengths of tube.

3.3.2 Tube wall thickness measurements

The wall thickness of the tube at the fracture positions was measured at
various locations around the circumference. The thickness range recorded
at each fracture is shown below:

Support 2      0.4 to 4.4   mm

Support 3      1.6 to 4.5   mm

Support 4      1.1 to 4.5   mm (ignoringthe edges   of the   holes)

Measurements taken along the lengths of tube using anultrasonic
instrument showed that the wall thickness remote from the fractures was
in the range 3.2 to 4.9 mm. Corrosion was confined to regions about
70-75mm wide, centred on the support straps, and there were no areas of
pronounced thinning elsewhere. The ultrasonic thickness reading was
5.0mm throughout the length of tube between the circumferential welds on
tube 1/2.

3.3.3 Microstruetural examination

A transverse ring section was cut from tube 3/4 at a distance of 65mm
from the fracture corresponding to support 3. Microexamination showed
 .hat the tube had been manufactured from wrought iron and that it
contained a longitudinal, forged lap weld.

A mi:rosection of a sample of paint removed from a similar position
showed that the paint consisted of 13 coats plus an initial metal loaded
primer coat. The total thickness of these coats was approximately 0.5 mm.
Various microsections from tube 1/2 indicated that this length of tube
consisted of both wrought iron and low carbon steel as follows: the
length between the end nearer Pen 2 and the circumferential weld near
support 1 was wrought iron; the length between the circumferential welds
was low carbon steel; the length between the circumferential weld near
support 2 and the part circumferential weld beneath the strap on support
2 was low carbon steel; the length between the part circumferential
beneath the strap on support 2 and the fracture was wrought iron.

3.3.4 Tensile tests

Two longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T343/1 and T343/2,
were machined from tube 3/4 near the end corresponding to support 3. Two
further longitudinal tensile test pieces, identified as T1221 and T1222,
were machined from the central portion (low carbon steel) of tube 1/2.
In order to minimize the effects of previous work hardening, all test
pieces were taken as near as possible to what would have been the
neutral axis during bending.

These test pieces were tested in accordance with BS 18:1987 "Method for
tensile testing of metals (including aerospace materials)", and the
following results were obtained:


             Elastic Limit     Rp0.2          Rp0.5        Rm         A%
    (limit of proportionality)

               19.5 tsi       23.1 tsi        24.1 tsi     32.2 tsi

None of these test pieces exhibited a yield phenomenon.

3.3.5 Hardness nesting

Hardness tests were carried out on the ring microsection from tube 3/4
and on the microsections from tube 1/2 in accordance with BS 427:Part
1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers hardness test: Testing of metals". The
following results were obtained:

Tube 3/4, wrought iron                   142 - 145 HV 10

Tube 1/2, low carbon steel               146 - 152 HV 10

Tube 1/2, weld metal at support 2        161 - 171 HV 10
3.4 SUPPORTS FROM BARRIER 124A

3.4.1 Visual examination

Supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed. Supports 3 and 4 are shown after
excavation in Figures 14 and 15 respectively. Although the extent of the
deformation of supports 3 and 4 was noted on site (see section 2.1 of
this report), a number of additional features became apparent in the
laboratory.

The legs of supports 3 and 4 had been corroded, particularly at the
junctions with the concrete step and/or additional reinforcing angles.
At these locations the residual thickness was in the range 3.1mm to
5.9mm, compared with a nominal thickness of 6.3mm elsewhere. A
considerable amount of metal had been lost by corrosion from the
sub-surface region of the supports. For example, on the rear leg of
support 4, a ligament of metal 8mm wide and 2mm in thickness was all
that remained of the original nominal 50 x 50mm angle section at a
distance of 150mm below the surface.

The front leg of support 3 and the rear leg of support 4 had been
reinforced with additional sections of steel angle. Both these
reinforcements spanned areas of corrosion on the sub-surface region of
the supports. In general on the collapsed supports, the most severe
sub-surface corrosion was located at a distance which varied from 50mm
to 170mm below the surface depending on which step the barrier had been
located.

3.4.2 Dimensions

In general, the width of the steel angle from which the support legs had
been made was in the range 49 - 52mm and the thickness remote from
corroded regions was in the range 6.0 - 7.4 mm. In some above surface
regions of supports 3 and 4 the thickness of the angle had been reduced
by corrosion and buckling had occurred during collapse. This can been
seen in Figures 14 and 15 in which the thickness of the angle at the
positions indicated was:

           Support 3       (a)     4.6    to 5.9 mm
                           (b)     5 .9   mm
           Support 4       (c)     1.5    mm
                           (d)     5.6    to 5.8 nun

The thickness of the steel angle in the sub-surface regions of supports
3 and 4 varied from zero, where through-thickness corrosion had
occurred, to 6.4mm.

3.4.3 Microexamination

Microsections were cut and prepared for examination from each of the
legs on supports 3 and 4 only. The following microstructures were
observed:

    Support 3   Front leg - 100% ferrite
                Rear leg - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.
    Support 4   Both legs - small amount of pearlite in ferrite in central
                            region; ferrite at edges.

These microstructures were typical of low carbon or rimming steel.

3.4.4 Tensile tests

One tensile test piece was machined from each leg of support 3. The test
pieces were identified FL3 and RL3 and were tested in accordance with BS
18:1987 " Method for tensile testing of metals (including aerospace
materials)", and the following results were obtained:

                          ReH           Rm        A%

    FL3                267 MPa        343 MPa     32
                       17.3 tsi        22.2 tsi

   RL3                 308 MPa        376 MPa     31
                       19.9 tsi        24.3 tsi

Both test pieces exhibited yield phenomenon and hence the upper yield
stress (ReH) was determined.

3.4.5 Hardness tests

Vickers hardness tests were carried out on the microsections taken from
the support legs. These tests were conducted in accordance with BS 427:
Part 1:1961 (1981) "Method for Vickers Hardness Test - Testing of
metals" and the following results were obtained:


    Support 3   Front leg       105 - 109 HV
                Rear leg        113 - 125 HV

    Support 4   Front leg       112 - 140 HV
                Rear leg        121 - 141 HV

These results are typical of low carbon steel

4 ASSESSMENT

Barrier 124A had consisted originally of a horizontal tube and four
vertical supports. The barrier had failed apparently by partial collapse
and fracture of supports 3 and 4, and by fracture of the horizontal tube
at supports 2, 3 and 4. The length of tube which had been located
between supports 2 and 3 (tube 2/3) had been bent uniformly to give a
maximum permanent deflection of 133mm at midspan. The portion of the
tube which been located between supports 3 and 4 (tube 3/4) had been
bent uniformly to give a maximum permanent deflection of 200mm at
midspan. Tubes 2/3 and 3/4 had been deformed in a horizontal plane
towards the pitch. Tube 1/2 and supports 1 and 2 had not been deformed.

Laboratory examination showed that most of the tube had been made from
wrought iron and each support had been made from two lengths of steel
angle section joined at the top by a steel gusset plate.  Part of the
original wrought iron tube between supports 1 and 2 had been replaced at
some time by a 2m length of low carbon steel. In addition, the tube had


                                     -10-
#


    been strengthened at support 2 by insertion of a internal tubular
    reinforcement. Thus tube 1/2 was probably stronger than the rest of the
    tube and this may, in part, explain the lack of deformation in this
    region. In addition, supports 1 and 2 had been strengthened by
    reinforcement with angle section at three of the four feet and by
    bracing of the rear legs with outriggers.

    The tube fractures had occurred in areas which had been located under
    the metal straps designed, presumably, to retain the tube. The tube wall
    thickness, nominally 4.5mm, had been reduced significantly by external
    corrosion under each strap. In some cases holes had been present in the
    tube at these locations before collapse occurred. Corrosion here
    appeared to be a highly localised phenomenon which was confined to a
    distance of 30mm to 35mm either side of the centreline of the strap.

    In general the appearance of the tube fractures was typical of ductile
    failure of wrought iron in a single-stage bending/tensile mode. The
    region of brittle fracture, noted in the tube near support 3, was the
    last part of the tube to fracture at this location. The change in
    fracture mode can be explained in terms of increased constraint as the
    fracture entered thicker material and an increase in strain rate as the
    fracture propagated round the tube. Both these factors would tend to
    promote brittle fracture.

    Corrosion at the tube/support junctions was predictable because liquid
    would have been retained in crevices under the strap and the surface of
    the tube under the strap had not been painted. At the open end of the
    tube, near support 4, internal corrosion had also contributed to
    deterioration of the tube since there was access for rainwater. Here the
    tube wall had been perforated by corrosion under the strap at two
    locations producing holes which we estimate would have been
    approximately 10mm and 20mm in diameter before the collapse. The centres
    of these holes would have been located approximately 50mm from the open
    end of the tube at support 4. They would have resembled the hole in the
    tube on barrier 125 (Figure 3) and, in our opinion, they would have been
    readily visible to the naked eye.

    The direction of collapse of supports 3 and 4 appeared to be towards the
    front left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch. For the most
    part the supports had been buckled and bent at locations which had been
    weakened by corrosion. Although there was considerable sub-surface
    corrosion of these supports, this played no part in the collapse. The
    concrete which broke away at the front foot of support 4 did so because
    this support had been positioned along the riser of a step in the
    terrace.

    In all cases the most severe sub-surface corrosion on the feet of
    supports 3 and 4 had been located near the lower end of the region of
    concrete containing the coarser aggregate. One possible explanation for
    this could be that the height of the terrace had been raised at some
    stage and the sub-surface corrosion may have occurred at or near the
    original junction between the support feet and the terrace. This would
    have reduced the effective height of the barriers.


                                    -11-
The use of wrought iron tube, and the method of tube fabrication,
suggests that barrier 124A was many years old. British Standards
governing the use of wrought iron tube were in use in the 1920s and
1930s but are now obsolescent. The discovery of dated sections of
newspaper in the tube indicates that parts of barrier 124A were at least
58 years old, although clearly this barrier had received several
modifications during its lifetime.

5 CONCLUSIONS

5.1 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had been made from
wrought iron.

5.2 The tube on the collapsed part of barrier 124A had fractured at
supports 2, 3 and 4 in regions where considerable localised corrosion
had occurred.

5.3 The legs of supports 3 and 4 on barrier 124A had been made from low
carbon steel angle section which had been corroded in some areas.

5.4 Two other barriers in Pens 3 and 4 contained tubes which had been
perforated by corrosion at support locations.

In our opinion,

5.5 The general direction of collapse of barrier 124A was towards the
lower left-hand corner of Pen 3, as viewed from the pitch.

5.6 Two holes, caused by corrosion, had been present in the tube of
barrier 124A at the junction with support 4 before the collapse
occurred and these would have been visible to the naked eye.

1 INTRODUCITCM

  As part of the investigation undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive
  into the incident at Sheffield Wednesday PC's Hillsborough football ground
  on the 15th April 1989, I was asked by Dr C E Nicholson to investigate the
  audibility of the Public Address system (PA system) at Hillsborou^i. This
  report sets out the results of that investigation. Information on the
  design of the PA system and the equiment used in it was supplied by Mr R
  Annible (Contracts Director) of DP Sound Systems Ltd at a meeting on the
  8th June 1989 and in subsequent .correspondence and telephone conversations.

  This report contains details of investigations performed both on site and in
  the laboratory. Hie work was carried out by me and by other members of the
  Noise and Vibration Section of the Research and Laboratory Services Division
  (ELSD) working on my instruction and under my general supervision.

2 DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM

  I was informed by Mr Annible that the PA system at Hillsborough was designed
  and installed by DP Sound Systems Ltd of Sheffield. The principle
  components, loudspeakers and amplifiers, were made by TQA Electric Co Ltd, a
  Japanese company which is a specialist manufacturer of public address
  equipment of some 55 years standing.

  Mr Annible informed me that the PA system was installed primarily as a means
  of conmnunicating with the spectators for crowd control or in an emergency.
  The system is controlled from the police control booth located between the
  West and South Stands. In the booth is a control unit (TQA VR 1012) on
  which the microphone input to the system is located together with a button
  which activates the system when depressed. The control unit also has a
  series of buttons which enable sectors of the ground to be selected so that
  messages can be relayed to specific areas (see Figure 1). The PA system has
  been divided into eight sectors; inside and outside of each of the four
  stands (Figure 2). The outside sectors also include the passages leading to
  the upper seated accommodation in each of the stands. Any combination of
  the eight sectors can be selected or, using the button labelled 'ALL CALL'
  every sector can be selected. The sector outside the West stand also
  includes loudspeakers directed at the approach to the turnstiles at Leppings
  Lane. Thus it is possible for the police to talk to those inside the ground
  independently of those approaching it or vice versa. It is also, for
  example, possible to talk to those inside and/or approaching the West
  stand/terracing independently of those anywhere else in or around the
  ground.

  A second input to the PA system has been provided for use by a Disc Jockey
  (DJ) to play music and jingles to the spectators and to mate announcements.
  This input uses part of the same PA system, that directed at all spectators
  inside the ground, ie the four sectors inside the stadium. The DJ's input,
  whether music or speech, is automatically overridden when the police control
  panel is used. Thus a message from the police can be relayed to one portion
  of the crowd whilst the rest hear the DJ. The DJ's booth is underneath the
  police control roan.

  The location of the loudspeakers in the West stand, inside and outside
  sectors, are shewn in Figure 3. These are controlled by buttons 1 and 7
  respectively. The 12 loudspeakers inside the stand are mounted under the
  front edge of the roof and are alternately directed into the upper stand and
  dewn to the terracing. These loudspeakers are TQA TZ 201 units. Outside
the stand TQA TC 15ML horn loudspeakers have been used. Using TQA data for
the loudspeakers calculations were made of the sound pressure level (SPL) at
various locations inside and outside the ground (see Table 1).

NOISE LEVELS IN FOOTBALL GROUNDS

No useful information on typical noise levels in football grounds was found
in the technical literature. Consequently limited measurements were made at
the first available opportunity which happened to be the Liverpool vs
Arsenal match at Liverpool PC's Anfield ground on the 26th of May 1989.
Tape recordings were made of the sound level at the pitch side and on the
collar of a member of RISD's Noise and Vibration Section who was a spectator
in the 'Kop'. The sound pressure level was also logged as 1 minute averages
using noise dosemeters in both cases. The pitch side microphones were
located approximately 1m from the goal line, 8m from the nearest goal post
and 4m from the spectators at the 'Kop' end of the ground. The equipment
used is detailed in Annex 1.

Plots of the 1 minute average sound pressure level (SPL) are presented in
Figure 4. Ihe match kicked off at about 20:15 and finished about 22:00.
During this period the 1 minute average level in the Kop was always greater
than 90 dB(A) and above 100 dB(A) for much of the time. The corresponding
figures at pitch side are about 5 dB lcwer, viz 85 dB(A) and 95 dB(A).

Unpublished data from a football match at Bristol, and from the Rugby League
CX?) Final, at Wembley, were made available to HSE. These data were obtained
as 3 minute averages and are presented in Figure 5 together with the HSE
data re-calculated as 3 minute averages. Clearly the HSE Anfield data shews
much higher levels than at Bristol and Wembley.

The logarithmic units used to measure noise as a 1 or 3 minute average can
mask much lcwer levels which may have occurred during the period. Thus it
is possible for the sound level to be relatively lew for a significant
proportion of the time whilst the average level is high. A statistical
distribution analysis of the sound levels illustrates this effect. Table 2
presents such data for the Anfield recordings for 3 minute periods leading
up to and just beyond the start of the match. From these data it can be
seen that although the 3 minute average levels in the Kop were between 97.9
and 105.7 dB(A), the level was below 91.9 dB(A) for 10% of the total period
 (as shewn by I«q ) and belcw 96.9 dB(A) for 50% of the time (Ic q )•
Figure 6 illustrates the relationship between the various statistical
measurements of fluctuating sound for a 3 minute period of the Anfield
recordings in the Kop. In this period 108.2 dB(A) was exceeded for 1% of
the time; 105.2 dB(A) for 10% and 97.2 dB(A) for 50%; whereas the average
level (Leq) was 101.1 dB(A).

In Figure 6 various crowd activities which give rise to high levels of sound
are identified.

TESTS ON THE HILLSBOROUGH PA SYSTEM

Recordings were made of speech relayed by the Hillsborough PA system at
locations inside and outside the West stand and terracing. The locations
are shewn in Figure 7 and described in detail in Annex 2. The recordings
were made on the 7th June 1989 in an empty ground. The speech was input
using either the microphone on the control panel in the police control room
or the one in the DJ's booth and consisted of a reading of the team list
from a match programme and other lists. Recordings were made for two
different voices, one male the other female. The recordings were analysed
for their sound pressure level and amplitude fluctuation. The A-weighted*
SEL at each measurement location is given in Table 1 together with the
calculated performance of the PA system. As would be expected the measured
sound levels from the PA system vary depending on hew lewdly the passage was
spoken, or indeed individual words in the passage. However, it is dear
that the system is capable of producing the theoretical levels calculated
from manufacturer's data inside the ground (Sector 1). Outside the West
stand (Sector 7) the levels measured are somewhat less than those
calculated.

(* The 'A' frequency weighting is applied to acoustic signals to simulate
the frequency response of the ear.)

TNTFT.T.TCTBTT.TTY OF THE HILLSBOROUGH PA SYSTEM

The 'Green Guide' (Ref 1) states, in Section 12:

"There should be a communications system capable of clearly relaying
essential messages to all parts of the ground in both normal circumstances
and in an emergency."

and in paragraph 194 iii:

"Public address equipment should be installed so that broadcast messages can
be heard under reasonable conditions (including emergencies) by all persons
of normal hearing in any part of the ground to which the public has access.
The system should be capable of being controlled from a central point and
should ideally be capable of addressing messages to each major section of
the ground. The power supply to the system should be such as to enable it
to operate in an emergency such as fire or failure of the mains supply."

I understand from DP Sound Ltd that the Hillsborou^i PA system was designed
to fulfil this requirement.

Whether a message can be clearly understood will depend on many factors but
it was not possible to identify from the literature any criteria by which
the intelligibility of speech from public address systems could be assessed
directly. There are standards for emergency evacuation signals and guidance
for selecting warning signals but these do not address spoken warnings from
PA systems. Standards for assessing the intelligibility of speech in roams
cannot be applied directly to sports stadia PA systems. Therefore it was
not possible to assess the performance of the Hillsborough PA system against
defined performance criteria in terms of intelligibility of messages relayed
through it.

Typically tests of speech intelligibility require panels of subjects to
listen to standard word lists against appropriate background noises. Such
tests were impracticable in this investigation. Instead an ad hoc
assessment was made using recordings of announcements made at Hillsborough
and of crcwd noise made at Anfield.

In this ad hoc test twelve subjects (HSE staff of age range from 21 to 43
years) were a-*=need to judge if they could understand the recording from
Hillsborough when replayed together with the recorded crowd noise from
Anfield. It was not possible to reproduce the exact sound field present at
Hillsborough at the time of the incident. Therefore the recordings were
replayed in an anechoic chamber through a PA system which had been set to
produce a uniform diffuse sound field at the listening position (see
Figure 8). The two recordings were superimposed at knewn relative levels
and the listeners were asked if they could hear the PA announcements and if
they could understand them. The test was repeated at four relative levels
of the two signals. Table 3 lists the level of the announcement relative to
the crowd noise at which the listener could understand the announcement.
Nearly all the listeners could understand the announcement when its average
level (Leq) was 10 dB belcw that of the crcwd noise.

DISCUSSION

Mr Annible informed me that in designing the PA system the installers had
nwfe the following assumptions in respect of noise levels at football
matches: ambient levels 77-80 dB(A); average levels 85 dB(A); short duration
levels 90-95 dB(A). The data from Bristol and Wembley would support these
assumptions but the Anfield data would not. Obviously the noise level of
spectators will depend on many factors such as: number of spectators; design
of stadium; significance of the match; emotional state of the crcwd. Each
of the crowd noise measurements presented in this report were taken at
important matches but with very different crcwd numbers and in different
stadia. This accounts for the range of noise levels reported. It should be
noted that the match at Anfield was the league Championship deciding match
and Liverpool PC fans are noted for their vocal (choral) support for their
team. The Anfield ground is very compact with roofing covering all
spectator areas. All factors which would lead to a high crcwd noise level.

In general a wide range of levels will occur depending on the factors
mentioned above. During any one match or even any period of a match, levels
will fluctuate and although the average may be high this will be influenced
by short periods of very high levels, leaving significant periods at lower
levels (as illustrated in Figure 6). Messages from a PA system can be
understood from information received in these periods. The simple listening
test described illustrates this since messages with average sound levels
10 dB (A) belcw the ambient level could be understood. Thus, whilst it is
•iinpT-arfrir’
             -qKig to design sound systems to overcome the highest levels, a
criteria based on exceeding a particular level which it is assumed crcwd
noise will only exceed for short periods of time is perhaps more realistic
                 There is, of course, a difference in the ability to hear and
                a message and actually listening to it. Spectators deeply
involved in watching the game may not listen to messages they can clearly
hear. At Anfield, and at a recently televised International ru^jy match,
spectator safety messages were preceded by a chime which identified them as
such. This facility seems a sensible way to attract the spectators'
attention.
In the particular case of the situation at Hillsborou^i leading up to the
incident I have no information of crcwd noise levels on the West terracing.
Nor do I have such information for the areas inside and outside the
turnstiles at Leppings lane. Careful examination of a video tape, supplied
by West Midlands Police, for the period 14:45 to 15:07 has not enabled noise
levels at the West terracing to be determined since the 'effects' microphone
is         picking up crowd noise from other parts of the ground. Up to 14:50
it is not possible to identify any chants clearly related to Liverpool
fans. Additionally, when spectators are at their most vocal they usually
wave their hards, scarves and banners in the air en masse. There is no sign
of this activity on this section of the video tape. Throughout this period
Tinigif! is being played on the PA system and can be heard clearly above the
crowd noise. At about 14:50 the teams were announced over the PA system.
  From then on there were the usual chanting of the fans as their team
  members' names were called and as the teams entered the pitch at 14:54 and
  the match started. Between the announcements of the teams and the kick-off,
  music was being played and can be heard except during the loudest chants
  from the crcwd.

  The pattern of crcwd chanting seems much the same as that observed at
  Anfield though visual indications from the video tape suggest that a
  significant percentage of the Liverpool fans were not joining in the
  chanting. Thus given the open nature of the West terracing and the numbers
  of fans there it is reasonable to conclude that crowd noise levels at the
  West terracing would not have been as high as those found at Anfield. In my
  opinion it is probable therefore that any messages relayed through the PA
  system would have been intelligible to the spectators. It should be noted
  that although the Hillsborough system is capable of having a chime, one was
  not fitted at the time of the incident. I understand from Mr I A Ramsay,
  Managing Director of DP Sounds Ltd that a chime has new been fitted
  following the publication of the Interim Report by Lord Justice Taylor.

7 OONCUJSIONS

  From this limited investigation I have made the following conclusions:

  7.1 The Hillsborough PA system had been professionally installed using good
      quality components and meets the performance criteria to which it was
      designed.

  7.2   It is probable that spectators in the West terracing and its approaches
        could have heard any messages relayed through the PA system during the
        period encompassing the incident.

  7.3 There is limited information on crcwd noise in sports stadia and the
      necessary performance requirements for PA systems to ensure
      intelligible conmunication.

6   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
1     INTRODUCTION

Following the incident at Hillsborough Stadium, Dr Nicholson provided me with
several albums of   photographs. He told me that these had been supplied to him
by the West Midlands Police. He said that they contained some photographs of
the spectators in   'pens' 3 and 4 taken at Hillsborough Stadium and that they
had been taken at   about the time that the game commenced. He asked me to
provide him with a scientifically-based estimate of the number of persons in
'pen' 3 and in 'pen' 4, and the crowd packing density (number of persons per
square metre) in these 'pens'.

I was also provided with a dimensioned drawing showing a plan view of 'pens' 3
and 4. The drawing had been prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, Consulting
Engineers, Sheffield, at the request of Dr Nicholson; it was numbered 1340/02
Rev A and was dated 3/5/89. I used this drawing to establish the locations of
the crush barriers in 'pens' 3 and 4 and to calculate the areas of these 'pens'.

1 was assisted in this work by Mr G A C Games, a Senior Scientific Officer of
RLSD's Mechanical Engineering Section and Mrs S M Barker of RLSD's Mechanical
Design Unit.

2     PHOTOGRAPHS USED FOR COUNTING THE NUMBER OF PERSONS

2.1    PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN ON 15 APRIL 1989 SHOWING 'PENS' 2 AND 3 - PR1/7A AND
       PR1/8A

Two prints of the West Terrace were selected by Mr Games and myself from the
albums of photographs. These prints were labelled PR1/7A and PR1/8A. West
Midlands Police informed Dr Nicholson that these photographs were taken by a
police photographer, Mr P Rich of the South Yorkshire Police, from a fixed
position in the South Stand. The photographs were marked with a time of 15.03.
The field of view on the two photographs overlapped and by identifying the
same landmarks on each, it was possible to overlay the photographs to form a
continuous view of the crowd. The prints from the albums were too small for
further work, and I therefore requested that enlargements be provided. West
Midlands Police subsequently provided enlargements of the prints and these
were overlapped, as described above, and taped together.

2.2     PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN ON 22 MAY 1989 SHOWING THE WEST TERRACE WHEN EMPTY -
        PR10/A2 TO PR10/A5

I could not identify the positions of barriers within the 'pens' from the
combined photographs PR1/7A and PR1/8A. Dr Nicholson therefore requested West
Midlands Police to arrange for Mr Rich, using the same equipment as used on
the day of the incident, from the same position, to take a set of overlapping
photographs which showed the empty West Terrace. Common landmarks were
identified on these prints and a subset, marked with numbers PR10/A2 to
PR10/A5, were then overlapped to form a panoramic view of the empty terrace.




2.3     PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN 15 APRIL 1989 SHOWING 'PENS' 2,3 AND 4 - MP1A-14

Other photographs taken on the day of the incident showed larger areas of the
terrace. Photograph MP1A-14, taken from the North Stand, showed a long view of
'pens' 2,3 and 4 and was marked with a time of 14.52. Dr Nicholson requested
enlargements of the photograph and these were provided by West Midlands
Police.
2.4     PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN 15 APRIL 1989 SHOWING AREAS OF 'PENS' 3 AND 4 BEHIND THE
        GOAL AREA OF THE WEST TERRACE - 148.3

Dr Nicholson provided me with two overlapping photographs, marked 148.3, which
had been obtained from the West Midlands Police. No information was available
as regards the time that the photograph was taken. On the basis of my
examination of the other photographs, the fact that several spectators were
already on the field and that the players were still on the pitch, it is
evident that it was taken at approximately 15.00. It showed a view of the
crowd in 'pens' 3 and 4 and was taken from in front of the West Terrace goal.
The photograph appeared to be taken from a position low down, possibly at
ground level. I considered it to be unsuitable for obtaining an absolute count
of the number of occupants of 'pens' 3 and 4 but that it could be used to
estimate comparative densities in these 'pens'.

3     DIGITISING PROCEDURES USED

Digitising is a means of transferring the positional data of physical points
shown in graphical material, eg photographs, into a computer file. The
graphical material to be digitised is attached to the surface of a digitising
tablet, which resembles a large drawing board. The tablet consists of a
plastic working surface, AO in size, over a closely packed grid of horizontal
and vertical wires. These wires are continually fed with electrical pulses
from the digitiser controller. To identify the points to be digitised a hand
held stylus is used; this is a 'pen' shaped device with spring loaded pointer
set in one end. When the pointer is pressed onto the surface at the point to
be digitised, a switch contact is made in the stylus enabling the pulses in
the wire grid to be detected. The time delay between sending a pulse and
receiving it at the stylus is directly proportional to the distance travelled
by the pulse and hence the stylus position. These delays are measured by the
controller equipment and translated into positions in both the horizontal and
vertical directions. This information is then transferred into a computer
file.

The information stored in the file can be accessed by a computer aided
draughting (CAD) program for subsequent graphical display and manipulation (eg
scaling).Plots of the manipulated information can be created using a pen
plotter; the figures in this report were created in this manner, the position
of each person being shown by an asterisk.

The photographs were secured to the digitiser surface, in turn, and a sheet of
transparent plastic film was placed over them. The position of every
discernible person on the photographs was digitised using the centre of the
persons head as an identification point. As the position of each person was
digitised a mark was made on the transparent film at the person's head to
ensure that no person was digitised twice. Great care was taken in the
identification of individual persons and only those people that could be
positively discerned were included in the digitising.

3.1    DIGITISING THE CROWD FROM PHOTOGRAPHS PR1/7A AND PR1/8A

The overlapping photographs PR1/7A and PR1/8A were positioned on the
digitising tablet and the boundary details were entered into the CAD system as
described in Section 3. The outlines of people outside the 'pens' who were
'masking' people within were included in this procedure.
The head of every discernible person in the crowd was digitised to produce
the drawing PR178A, Fig 1 is based on this drawing.

3.2     DIGITISING THE CROWD FROM THE REMAINING PHOTOGRAPHS

The same digitising procedures were used with photographs MP1A-14 and 148.3,
again digitising only positively discernible individuals. Figs 2 and 3 show
the digitised information from MP1A-14.

3.3    DIGITISING THE CRUSH BARRIERS FROM PHOTOGRAPHS PR10/A2 to PR10/A5

Overlapping photographs, PR10/A2 to PR10/A5, were positioned on the digitising
surface and the crush barriers, fences and wall boundaries were digitised into
the CAD system as a separate drawing.


4     CAD MANIPULATION OF THE DIGITISED DATA

4.1    NUMBER OF PERSONS IN THE   WHOLE AREA OF 'PEN' 3

Drawing PR178A (Fig 1) showed asterisks representing people in part of 'pen' 2
and part of 'pen' 3. The drawing did not include all of 'pen' 3, because of
the limited view in the photographs, and therefore an overall count for the
'pen' could not be made using the drawing shown in Fig 1 alone.

The editing facilities of the CAD system were used on drawing PR178A to delete
the asterisks representing the occupants of 'pen' 2, and produced the drawing
shown in Fig 4. The CAD system was then used to overlay and position the
drawing made from photographs PR10/A2 to PR10/A5, as summarized in Section
3.3, on the drawing of Fig 4 by matching common landmarks on each drawing. The
resulting drawing displayed the full extent of 'pen' 3, but only contained
that part of the crowd shown on the original photographs PR1/7A and PR1/8A,
causing part of 'pen' 3 to appear to be empty.

I used the facilities of the CAD system to estimate the number of persons in
this missing part of the crowd by creating a 'patch' of the same size and
shape as the apparently empty part of 'pen' 3. This 'patch' was superimposed
on the populated area of 'pen' 3 and the resulting 'crowd patch' copied to the
apparently empty part of 'pen' 3. The resulting drawing is shown in Fig 5, the
crush barriers having been omitted for clarity and the 'crowd patch' being
shown in bold outline. I used the automatic counting facility of the CAD
system to count the number of heads (asterisks) shown on this drawing.

4.2    NUMBER OF PERSONS IN ROWS WITHIN 'PEN' 3

I was concerned about the difficulty in discerning individual heads near the
front of 'pen' 3. I also wished to have some measure of the variation of crowd
density across the depth of this 'pen'. Therefore 'pen' 3 was divided into
rows parallel to the front boundary fence. Using the crush barriers, digitised
from photographs PR10/A2 to PR10/A5, as demarcations to divide 'pen' 3 into
four parallel rows numbered from Row 1 (front row) to Row 4 (rear row).

Using the overlaying facility of the CAD system the crush barriers were
superimposed on the drawing shown in Fig 5. The top rail of each barrier was
then projected upwards to a common scaled height of 1.7 m, assuming this
dimension to be a common height to the centre of every head. Identification of
the occupants of 'pens' 3 and 4 had been undertaken by locating the position
of each person by an asterisk at the centre of their head. I therefore assume
that any asterisk lying between adjacent projections of the top rails on the
drawing represented a person standing between the corresponding crush
barriers.

Asterisks lying outside the appropriate projected top rails were deleted for
each row in turn, leaving only asterisks representing people in that row. Any
part of the crowd missing from a row, because of the limited view on the
photographs, was estimated using the 'crowd patch' method described in Section
4.1. This technique was used to produce the drawings shown in Figs 6,7 and 8,
and the automatic counting facility of the CAD system then used to count the
number of persons in Rows 2,3 and 4.

4.2.1    Estimation of the number of persons in the front row of 'pen'   3

My uncertainty about identifying the heads of persons in the front row (row 1)
of 'pen' 3 caused me to use an alternative method to estimate the number of
persons in this row.

Some ad-hoc tests had been undertaken on RLSD's premises to assess the
discomfort experienced by persons in crowds of different packing densities.
Increasing numbers of volunteers of both sexes had stood in a closed vestibule
which had a floor area of 2.8 sq m. The criterion adopted in these tests for
determining the acceptability of different crowd packing densities was that no
person should feel physically distressed. Each test lasted approximately 2
minutes. The tests suggested that a crowd density of 10 persons/sq m could be
achieved without distress, although the subjects felt they were "packed
tightly".

I considered the crowd packing densities that were obtained in Rows 4,3 and 2,
and the results of RLSD's crowd packing tests. I then decided that the best
estimate of the number of persons in the front row of 'pen' 3 would be obtained
by multiplying the plan area (in square metres) of the front row by a packing
density of 10 persons/sq m. It is my opinion that this estimate would be
neither unrealistically high nor unrealistically low.

4.3     CROWD PACKING DENSITY IN 'PEN' 2

I estimated the crowd packing density (number of persons/sq metre) in 'pen' 2
by using similar procedures to those described in Section 4.2. Using the
drawing shown in Fig 1 a columnar area was created within 'pen' 2 by
projecting the stanchions of the front boundary fence to the back boundary
wall, the projection lines defining the width of the columnar area. All
asterisks outside this column were deleted and the missing part of the column
filled using the 'crowd patch' method to produce the drawing shown in Fig 9.
The asterisks within the columnar area were then automatically counted and,
knowing the ground area (distance between stanchions multiplied by overall
depth of 'pen'), it was possible to calculate the crowd packing density within
it.

4.4     COMPARISON OF CROWD PACKING DENSITY IN 'PENS' 3 AND 4

I used photographs 148.3 to obtain a comparison of the crowd packing densities
in 'pens' 3 and 4. Onto the drawing obtained by digitising photographs 148.3, a
fixed rectangular area was superimposed in 'pens' 3 and 4. This rectangle was
not intended to represent a specific ground area on the terraces, but rather
to define~"an area on the original photographs. An automatic count of the heads
(asterisks) within the rectangular area in each 'pen' was then obtained. This
procedure was repeated at different locations until 4 sets of counts had been
obtained, at the positions shown in Fig 10, taking care to ensure that
obstructions e.g. persons outside.the terrace, did not protrude into the
rectangular areas.

5     RESULTS

5.1     NUMBER OF PERSONS IN 'PEN' 3 OBTAINED FROM PHOTOGRAPHS PR1/7A AND PR1/8A

5.1.1     Number of persons identified directly from the photographs

The number of persons counted automatically within 'pen' 3, on the basis of
the number of heads directly identified with the digitising method, was 1074.
To this must be added the number of persons in that part of the 'pen' not
shown on the photographs but estimated by the 'crowd patch' method ie 334.
This results in a total figure of 1408. It is my opinion that this total is an
underestimate of the number of persons within 'pen' 3; lack of clarity in the
photographs made it difficult to identify individual heads near the front
boundary wall and also people outside the 'pen' obscured parts of this area.

5.1.2     Number of persons assessed bv dividing the 'pen' into rows

Table 1 shows my alternative assessment of the number of persons within 'pen' 3,
based on the division of the 'pen' into four rows. Persons in Rows 4,3 and 2
were identified directly from the photographs using the digitiser and 'crowd
patch' methods and counted automatically. The number of persons in the front
row (Row 1) were estimated on the basis of the plan area of the row and a
crowd packing density of   10 persons/sq  m. This    alternative and preferred
assessment of the number   of persons in  'pen' 3    is 1576.

Table 1 also shows the crowd packing densities for each of the four rows in
'pen' 3. The crowd packing densities for Rows 4,3 and 2 are based on the number
of persons identified with the digitiser and 'crowd patch' methods from
photographs whilst that for Row 1 is a value assumed on the basis of tests
made at RLSD.

5.2     NUMBER OF PERSONS IN 'PENS' 3 AND 4 OBTAINED FROM PHOTOGRAPH MP1A-14

Table 2 shows the number  of persons in  'pens' 3 and 4 obtained by using the
automatic counting facility of the CAD    system,    after they had been identified
on photograph MP1A-14, using the digitising method.

It was extremely difficult to differentiate between individual heads on
photograph MP1A-14 and only those heads that could be definitely identified
were digitised. I consider this to be the reason for obtaining a count of 678
persons in 'pen' 3 from photograph MP1A-14, a number which is low compared to
the 1408 persons counted from photographs PR1/7A and PR1/8A and to my
preferred estimate of 1576 persons.

It is my opinion that the counts of 678 persons in 'pen' 3 and 821 persons in
'pen' 4 should be regarded as being unrealistically low. It is also my
opinion that I obtained a much more reliable assessment of the number of
persons in 'pen' 3 from the counts and estimate based on photographs PR1/7A and
PR1/8A.

Whilst the above figures cannot be used as a total count for the 'pens' I
believe they can be used to compare crowd densities. The ground areas of
'pens' 3 and 4 are very similar (see table 1) and I consider that the counts
obtained suggest that the crowd packing densities in 'pens' 3 and 4 were also
similar. The larger count in 'pen' 4 can be partially attributed to the angle
and position from which the photograph was taken, which enabled easier
identification of individual heads in 'pen' 4 than in 'pen' 3.

5.3     NUMBER OF PERSONS WITHIN A SAMPLE COLUMNAR AREA OF 'PEN' 2

A total of 150 persons occupied a sample columnar area taken from the front
boundary wall to the rear boundary wall of 'pen' 2. The corresponding crowd
packing density was 5.0 persons/sq m.

5.4     COMPARISON OF THE NUMBER OF PERSONS IN 'PENS' 3 AND 4

Table 3 summarizes the number of persons identified within different areas of
the same size at four locations in each 'pen'. Although the numbers of persons
should not be regarded as absolute values, because of the difficulty in clear
identification, it is my opinion that they do serve to compare the crowd
packing densities in 'pens' 3 and 4.

Making allowance for the difficulty in identifying persons, I consider the
differences between the numbers obtained in each of the four comparisons to be
small. Additionally, there is no distinct bias to suggest an appreciable
difference between the crowd packing densities in 'pens' 3 and 4; this is
confirmed by the close agreement obtained between the average values of the
four sample counts made for each 'pen'.

6     SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

6.1 I used photographs supplied by West Midlands Police, together with a
drawing prepared by Ralph Brade & Associates, as the basis for my assessment
of the number of persons in parts of the West Terrace of Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club's Hillsborough Stadium. I used the facilities provided by a
computer-aided draughting system to assist in identifying and counting the
number of persons within 'pens' on the West Terrace.

6.2 In making my assessment I assumed that a crowd packing density in one
part of 'pen' 3 was reproduced in another, adjacent part of it. Additionally, I
was unable to obtain an acceptably accurate count of the persons between the
front boundary wall and the nearest line of crush barriers in 'pen' 3 by the
direct identification of heads on photographs. I therefore estimated the
number of persons in this area of 'pen' 3 from considerations of the crowd
packing densities in other areas of the 'pen', together with results from an
investigation of packing densities made on RLSD's premises. It is my opinion,
based on a study of photographs of 'pens' 3 and 4, that my assumption and
estimation were justified.

6.3 My best assessment of the number of persons within 'pen' 3 is that 1576
persons were present at 15.03 hours on 15 April 1989. It is my opinion that
1576 persons is unlikely to be an overestimate of the true number. It
represents an average crowd packing density in 'pen' 3 of 8.4 persons/sq m,
which exceeds the maximum value of 5.4 persons/sq m recommended in "Guide To
Safety At Sports Grounds" (ref 1) by 56%

6.4 The crowd packing density within 'pen' 3 increased between the rear
boundary wall and the line of crush barriers nearest to the front boundary
wall. My lowest assessment of the crowd packing density in 'pen' 3 had an
average value of 7.5 persons/sq m, this occurring in the area between the rear
boundary wall and the rearmost line of crush barriers. The highest crowd
packing density that I was able to assess directly had an average value of
8.1 persons/sq m, and this occurred in the area between the line of crush
barriers nearest the pitch and the next line of crush barriers. These crowd
packing densities exceed the maximum value recommended in "Guide To Safety At
Sports Grounds" by 39% and 50% respectively.

6.5 I assessed the average crowd packing density in 'pen' 2 at 15.03 hours to
be of the order of 5 persons/sq m.

6.6 I was unable to assess the number of persons in 'pen' 4 by a direct
counting method and I used a technique that compared the packing densities in
'pen' 4 with those in 'pen' 3. This comparison has caused me to conclude that at
approximately 15.00 hours the packing densities in 'pens' 3 and 4 were nominally
the same.

1.1 Following an incident on 15 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday
    Football Club's (SWFC) Hillsborough Stadium on 16 April 1989 at the
    request of Mr M S Nattrass, Area Director of South Yorkshire and
    Humberside Factory and Agricultural Inspectorate of the Health and Safety
    Executive (HSE). Subsequently I was appointed to head the HSE team
    investigating the incident following correspondence between the Court of
    Inquiry and the then Deputy Director General of the HSE, Mr J D G Hammer.

1.2 The HSE's Research and Laboratory Services Division (RISD) consists of
    3 laboratories, one of which, the Safety Engineering Laboratory (SEL), is
    based in Sheffield. As a Deputy Director in the Sheffield laboratory, I
    was able to assemble a team of scientists and engineers from various
    specialist sections to tackle the various technical problems which arose.
    I was also assisted by members of HSE's Technology Division in much of the
    on site investigation at the Hillsborough ground. They produced site
    reports, which are reproduced in the Annexe, and which have been utilised
    by HSE staff throughout this investigation.

     In considering collapse load calculations of barrier 124A, Professor
     R A Smith of the University of Sheffield Department of Mechanical and
     Process Engineering, acted as a consultant and in conjunction with RISD
     staff produced a report on this topic.

1.3 A few days after the incident, the West Midlands Police were appointed to
    assist the Inquiry and all the initial stages of the investigation were
    carried out in close collaboration with ACC M Jones of the West Midlands
    Police. When the Inquiry assessors were appointed, the direction of
    technical aspects of the investigation was then planned with Professor
    L Maunder of the University of Newcastle Department of Mechanical
    Engineering, but still in collaboration with ACC Jones.

1.4 A summary report of HSE's findings "The Hillsborough Incident
    15 April 1989: An Investigation into Various Technical Aspects prepared
    for the Court of Inquiry" by C E Nicholson, Report No nyi/ME/Mty/89/1 was
    written and presented to the Court of Inquiry in June 1989.

1.5 This compendium of reports contains details of examinations performed on
    site and in the laboratory. The work was carried out by me, by other
    staff of HSE and by the consultant Professor Smith, working on my
    instructions and under my general supervision.

 INTRODUCTION

 During the incident which occurred at Hillsborough Stadium on
 15 April 1989, two bays, 2/3 and 3/4, of barrier 124A, Fig 1, were broken
 down. This report attempts to calculate collapse loads for the barrier and
 to compare these loads with the pressures likely to have been generated by
 the crowd.

 Examination and mechanical testing of the broken barrier by staff of the
 Health and Safety Executive (HSE)(1), revealed that the horizontal tube
 had been manufactured from wrought iron and was probably over sixty years
 old. The upright supports were made from mild steel. The tube was
 attached to the uprights by straps, underneath which considerable corrosion
 of the tube had occurred.

 MATERIAL PROPERTIES

 Tensile tests from 2 specimens taken from the tube gave average tensile
 strength of 366MPa, 0.2% proof stresses of 259MPa and an estimated elastic
 limit of 150MPa. Because of the considerable work hardening which occurs
 after yield in this material and the sensitivity of the yield stress to
 prior load history, there is an ambiguity about what single value of yield
 (or flow) stress should be used to calculate a fully plastic moment. Two
 full scale uniform bending tests were carried out on similar wrought iron
 tubes from a barrier adjacent to 124A, barrier 129. From the
 experimentally determined plastic collapse loads and the geometry of the
 tube, representative flow stresses, ^F, were determined from each
 test. The values obtained were 298.2 and 290.9 MPa. The average of these
 values, 294.6 MPa was used in the subsequent collapse calculations. An
 average value of Young's Modulus, E, (in flexure) of 190.4 Jta was obtained
 from these experiments, which are described in Appendix 1.

 SECTION PROPERTIES OF THE BARRIER TUBE

 Second moments of area, I for a tube of outside diameter D and wall
 thickness, t were calculated from the formula:




Fully plastic moments were calculated as a product of the flew stress <f^
and P the plastic modulus:




 The nominal dimensions of the tube, 60mm outside diameter and 4mm wall
 thickness are used in the preliminary calculations in the bent two
 sections.

 ELASTIC DEFLECTIONS UNDER TEST LOADING

 The elastic deflection at the centre of a beam of length L, built in at
 both ends and subjected to a uniformly distributed load w, is given by
 VL4/384EI. If the ends are simply supported, the deflection is increased
 by a factor of 5.
    For a span between supports (L) of 2.2m, the length of spans 2/3 and 3/4 of
    barrier 124A, subjected to the test loading of 6kN/m, a figure prescribed
    by the "Green Guide"(2), a central deflection of 6.9mm is obtained. If
    the ends are free, the deflection increases to 34.5mm. The deflection
    observed from actual test records correspond more closely to the built in
    end condition. In the calculation which follows, the central span (2/3) of
    barrier 124A has been treated as having built in ends. The outer span
    (3/4), has been treated as having end 3 built in and end 4 simply
    supported.

5   YIELDING UNDER TEST CONDITIONS

    For the span 2/3, the clamping moments are wL2/12. First yield will
    occur when these moments equal 2 ry I/D. If Cfy corresponds to
    the measured elastic limit of the material (150MPa), then first yield
    corresponds to 3.4kN/m, or just over half of the test load. 0.2% proof
    stress gives a first yield load of 5.9kN/m. Thus some yielding occurs on
    first loading up to the test load of 6kN/m. Subsequent loading up to this
    test load will be elastic because of the strain hardening capabilities of
    the material.

6   CALCULATIONS OF PLASTIC COLLAPSE LOADS

    The wall thickness of the tube under the straps at 2, 3 and 4 was found to
    be much reduced by corrosion. The reduction in thickness was not uniform
    round the circumference; calculations of the plastic moduli of the
    as-measured sections have been made by area integration. The following
    table results:

The general case of plastic collapse for a beam of length L Is shown
below:


              MAi                               MC




                                   MB




where MA and MC are the moments at the supports and MB Is the moment
at the centre of the beam. The collapse load Is

         wc - 4     (MA + 2MB + MC)
               T 3-

The standard case we take Is for the original beam built-in at both ends,
le span 2/3 of    barrier     124A. Denoting thecollapse   loadforthis case as
wc,   and noting  MA - MC    - MB - Mp, the fullyplastic momentat
the uncorroded centre,

         wc - 16Mp - 16 x 3.73 - 12.3kN/m
                l   *        nr**

Now for the span 3/4, assuming end 4 to be simply supported, the
calculation above can be repeated with Me - 0, and MA - MB -
3.65kNm, giving a collapse load of 9.05kN/m.

For the spans in a corroded condition, the central plastic moment can be
assumed to remain unchanged, but the appropriate plastic moments in the
above table can be substituted for end moments. The following table
results:



                                      Collapse Loads: kN/m
                         Built-in (Span 2/3) . One end simply supported

  thickness

  Corroded condition         9.40 (1.57)             8.11 (1.35)


The figures in brackets are the calculated collapse loads as multiples of
the test load (6 kN/m).

For the unsymmetrical calculations in the above table, the inner plastic
hinge does not occur exactly at the centre of the span. The effect of
this on the calculated collapse loads is negligible and smaller than other
sources of uncertainty.
Tests performed by Dr Eastwood on a similar, but not identical barrier,
after the incident, showed that a load of 9kN/m (test load x 1.5) was
sufficient to cause very large permanent deformation of the tube. The
calculated collapse loads therefore appear to be realistic values.

COLLAPSE MODE

If the shear strength is assumed to be only 50% of the tensile strength,
then to directly shear a 1.5mm wall thickness of tube, a load of 48kN/m is
required. Even the worst corroded end had an average wall thickness of
this value, yet the shear failure load is many times higher than the
plastic collapse load. This evidence, together with the bent shape of the
tube after the incident, supports the view that barrier failure occured by
plastic collapse of the tube. Because of its position, Span 3/4 would
fail before Span 2/3. If collapse of the legs had taken place prior to
the failure of the tube, the tube would not have been bent in the manner
which was observed.

ESTIMATES OF CROWD FORCES ACTING ON BARRIERS

A theoretical model of the forces generated by a crowd behind a barrier
has been developed, see Appendix 2. Values from this model are shown on
Fig 2, onto which values for the various calculated collapse loads have
been added. For a crowd density of 8/m2, span 3/4 in the original
condition would withstand a crowd depth of approximately 6.4m before
collapse. This would reduce to 6m if it were in the corroded condition.
Because span 3/4 of barrier 124A was unprotected by barrier 136, a crowd
of 7m was able to exert pressure on this part of the barrier. Given that
the crowd was not of uniform density throughout and the approximate nature
of the crowd loading model, these figures adequately explain the collapse
of the barrier. Once span 3/4 had failed, span 2/3 would become simply
supported at end 3 and the support pylon would twist, causing collapse of
span 2/3 at a similar load level. If the crowd had been restricted to
5 .h/m , the crowd depth to cause collapse would be 8m and 7.5m in the
original and corroded conditions respectively. This latter value is in
excess of the depth of crowd at this location and indicates that the span
would have survived had the crowd density been so restricted.

If barrier 136 had been complete, the crowd depth behind barrier 124A
would have been limited to 3.5m depth. The maximum load generated, as
predicted by the crowd leaning model, by a crowd as dense as 10/m2 would
have been some 20% less than the test load.

Given that the spacing behind 124A was greater than that recommended in
the Green Guide, the test load of 6kN/m was inadequate. At 5.4/m2 the
model predicts that a crowd of 7m depth would generate a load some 22%
greater than the test load.

CONCLUSIONS

Collapse loads have been calculated for the spans 2/3 and 3/4 of barrier
124A which was broken down during the Hillsborough Stadium incident.

If the barriers had been of the original thickness at the supports, loads
of 2.1 and 1.51 times the test load of 6kN/m would have been needed to
collapse the barrier at spans 2/3 and 3/4 respectively. With the reduced
wall thicknesses as measured, these ratios fall to 1.57 and 1.35 x test
load.
9.3   These figures have been compared with barrier loads generated from a
      'leaning crowd' model.

9.4   In the corroded condition for a crowd of measured density 8/m. , the
      span 3/4 of the barrier would have been broken down by a crowd of
      approximately 6m depth behind the barrier. A crowd of some 7m depth
      existed directly behind span 3/4.
                                If
9.5   If a crowd density of 5.4/m: is assumed, the same tube would have
      required about 7.5m of crowd to break it down.

APPENDIX 1


In view of the uncertainty in extracting a reliable yield stress value from a
tensile test for use in a plastic collapse calculation for a material which
exhibits considerable work hardening, full scale tests were performed on
wrought iron tubes from barrier 129. A four point bending rig was used to
obtain a constant bending moment over the central span, see Fig 1A.

From the measured tube dimensions, the plastic modulus was calculated using
Equation (2). Then by equating theoretical and experimental collapse moments,
a value of flow stress was extracted. In addition, a value for Youngs Modulus
was calculated from the initial slope of the load/extension curve.

Values of 298.2 and 290.9 MPa, averaging 294.6 MPa, were obtained for the flow
stress. This average value was used in the collapse calculations in the body
of this report.

This value is some 5.7% less than that obtained by using the approximation of
the average of the tensile strength and the 0.2% yield stress obtained in a
tensile test (see section 2 Material Properties).

The difference in the two values of flow stress obtained by experiment gives an
indication of the reliability of the material property input to the collapse
calculations, ie +/- 1.2%.
APPENDIX 2


A 'leaning' crowd model to estimate the loads generated by a barrier

Consider a person on the nth step behind a barrier.  The whole crowd is
assumed to be up on its toes, inclined forward at an angle & , in a fashion
which would be adopted to obtain a view of an incident in front of the crowd.
The spectator is leaning forward on a support provided by the person in front
and is thus subject to supporting force Pn, from the front and to a toppling
force Pn-1, from the person behind, offset by the terrace step height h.




 Equilibrium of person on the nth step, moments about 0

             PpH'costf = mgHsintf + Pn_i(H'cos0 + h)

                         Pn = mg(H/H')tan0 + Pn-i(l + h/(H'cos0))

 ie a recurrence relationship of the form:

                     Pn = A + BPn-i,     A, B constants

 P0   =   0
 Pi   =   A
 P2   -   A + AB
 P3   =   A + AB + AB2

 Pn = A + AB + AB        + .....   + AB n-1

 Pn - A(Bn-l)/(B-l)                       (Sum of geometric progression)


                 mg H sin#             h       n
                                1 + ------         - 1
                                     H'costf             .
For the person immediately behind the barrier, if the barrier is at the push
height, then clearly Pn would be transmitted to the barrier. In general the
barrier is lower than this, and the push is probably transmitted to the barrier
by bending at mid-height for the few rows of people just behind the barrier.
If this were not so, the person at the barrier would be subjected to a large
turning moment. The exact details of this force feed to barrier height are not
yet clear, but for this purpose it is assumed that Pn, where n is the
number of steps behind the barrier in question, is the force on the barrier.

If the crowd density is N/m2, then there are Nw persons/unit length on each
step, thus we obtain the force/unit length on the barrier as:

             F/unit length - N w mg H sin    ff   1 +     h    \n - 1
                                    h                   H* cosJ
which is the expression evaluated on Fig 2. A 'lean' angle of 10 deg has been
estimated as a reasonable value to use in the calculation; other parameters are
declared on the Figure.

It should be noted that no previous work can be found in the literature
concerning this type of calculation. Existing design rules for barriers appear
to rely on empiricism together with limited experimental testing. Caution
should be exercised in the use of this new model, which requires experimental
substantiation.

1    INTRODUCTION

As part of the investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the
incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough stadium on
15 April 1989, Mr G A C Games, a Senior Scientific Officer, and
Mr D Waterhouse, a Principal Scientific Officer, of HSE's Research and
Laboratory Services Division (RLSD) visited Hillsborough stadium on 24 April,
25 April and 28 April 1989. They investigated aspects of the turnstiles,
particularly those giving access to the terraces at the Leppings Lane end of
the ground.


2    THE SCOPE OF THE INVESTIGATION

We examined a drawing labelled "Eastwood & Partners - Drawing No 8945/lA" that
Dr Nicholson had received from Eastwood & Partners on 24 April 1989. This
drawing had the title "Sheffield Wednesday F.C. PLC Hillsborough, Ground
Layout 1987" and was dated 16/4/87. The drawing showed the number of persons
(capacity) allocated to each designated zone of the stadium and showed the
location and designation of turnstiles around the perimeter of the stadium. In
this report the term 'West terraces' is used as the collective name for
the terraced zones at the West, or Leppings Lane end, of the stadium.

The drawing showed two groups of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of the
stadium. It appeared that group A to G could be used for admissions to the
West terraces and the West Stand, and that some of group 1 to 16 could be used
for admissions to the North Stand and some for admissions to the west terraces
and the West Stand.

Our investigation was divided into three parts:

i)     tests to assess the difficulty experienced by an operator in releasing
       the rotary 'gate' of a turnstile when a horizontal force was applied to
       to one of its 'wings' (or 'paddles');

ii)    tests to assess the accuracy of the computerized system for counting and
       recording the number of persons admitted through the turnstiles in
       Leppings Lane;

iii) calculation of the average number of persons to be admitted through each
     of the turnstiles if all zones of the stadium were filled to their
     designated maximum capacity, i.e. calculation of the average admission
     requirement of the turnstiles.

We were assisted by other staff of RLSD working under our supervision and to
our instructions. Our tests to assess the effect of a horizontal force on the
'gate' of a turnstile were observed by officers of the West Midlands Police.
Our investigation of the accuracy of the computerized system for counting and
recording admissions through the turnstiles was supervised by Detective Chief
Inspector Tope of the West Midlands Police.
3     INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL FORCE ON THE *GATES *
      OF TURNSTILES SERVING THE WEST TERRACES

3.1     TURNSTILES IN THE GROUP A TO G

We examined all the turnstiles in the group A to G. Turnstiles C to G appeared
to be of the same type, but turnstiles A and B were of a different pattern and
were slightly different from each other. However, the principle of operation
of all the turnstiles in group A to G appeared to be the same,

Fig 1 shows a view of a typical turnstile in group A to G. Each turnstile had
four equally spaced 'wings' on its 'gate', which was attached to a spindle. It
was apparent that a quarter-revolution of the spindle was intended to admit
one person when the pedal of a pivoted locking lever, shown in Fig 2, was
depressed by an operator. A counter-weight on this lever normally       caused its
inner end to engage with one of four teeth on the lower rachet of a dual cam
assembly attached to the base of the spindle, as shown in Fig 3. Depression of
the pedal raised the inner end of the lever, allowing the spindle to rotate
until the upper cam drove the inner end of the locking lever back down into
engagement with the next tooth of the lower rachet. The cam/rachet mechanism
locked the spindle after each quarter-revolution of the 'gate', the operator
having to depress the pedal of the locking lever each time that he wished to
admit a person. The rachet on the upper part of the dual cam assembly
prevented the 'gate' from being rotated in the reverse direction.

Our examination of the turnstiles caused us to suspect that a person pushing,
or being pushed, against a 'wing' of a turnstile might cause the operator to
have difficulty in depressing the pedal to release the 'gate'. It was our
opinion that difficulties in releasing the 'gate' might reduce the flow
through a turnstile to below the maximum notional rate of 750 persons/hour
that was suggested in the Home Office/Scottish Office publication "Guide to
Safety at Sports Grounds" (H M Stationery Office: 1986).

On 24 April 1989 we conducted tests on the turnstiles designated B and C to
investigate the relationship between the horizontal force applied to a 'wing'
of a turnstile and the force required on the pedal of the locking lever to
release its 'gate'.

3.2     METHOD OF TESTING

Fig 4 shows how a horizontal force was applied to the mid*span of a 'wing' of
a turnstile by means of a baulk of timber, a nylon sling, a tensile loadcell
and a 'pull-lift' rachet-hoist apparatus. The loadcell, connected between the
sling and the 'pull-lift', measured the force applied to the 'wing' of the
turnstile on a digital display unit. We calibrated this display unit before
making the tests by suspending standard test weights from the loadcell.

We used the 'pull-lift' to apply a force to a 'wing' of the turnstile and then
gently placed standard test weights on the pedal of the pivoted locking lever,
as shown in Fig 5, until the 'gate' was released. This procedure was repeated
with increasing forces applied to the 'wing'. The results obtained from the
tests are shown in the graphs of Fig 6.
4     INVESTIGATION OF THF. ACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM FOR COUNTING
      AND RECORDING THE NUMBER OF ADMISSIONS THROUGH THE TURNSTILES

On 25 April 1989 we visited Hillsborough stadium, accompanied by Detective
Chief Inspector Tope of the West Midlands Police. We discussed the system used
for counting and recording the number of persons passing through the
turnstiles with Mr R J Houldsworth of Abbey Systems Ltd, whose company
maintained and operated the computerized system for Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club. On 28 April 1989 we conducted limited tests to assess the
accuracy of the recording system on the turnstiles in Leppings Lane.

4.1     THE COUNTING AND RECORDING SYSTEM

The counting and recording system was described to us by Mr Houldsworth.

4.1.1     The counting device on the turnstile

An electrical switch was attached to each of the turnstiles serving the
stadium, and signal cables connected each switch to a signal conditioning unit
housed in a control room beneath the South Stand. Each quarter-revolution of a
turnstile was intended to cause its switch to close and re-open, transmitting
an electrical pulse to the signal conditioning unit.

Mr Houldsworth said that he was in the process of modifying an earlier design
that had used a roller-plunger micro-switch on each turnstile to provide the
pulse signals. The intention of this system had been for the plunger of the
micro-switch to be depressed as it was traversed sequentially by each of the
four horizontal lugs of a cruciform cast metal boss that connected the upper
tubular arms of the four 'wings' to the spindle of a turnstile. However, the
micro-switch was prone to mis-counts arising from the cast surface of the lugs
and the vertical 'float' of the spindle in its bearings, and the position of
the micro-switches required frequent adjustment.

The reliability of the pulse generation had been improved on more modern
turnstiles serving other zones of the stadium by enclosing the micro-switches
within the upper mounting of the spindle, but this modification had not been
possible with the older turnstiles in Leppings Lane.

The roller-plunger micro-switches on the turnstiles in Leppings Lane were
being replaced by more robust switches that were operated by 'rat-tail' spring
probes. The compliant probe on this type of switch was deflected horizontally
by the vertical tube of each 'wing' as the 'gate' rotated, and the correct
generation of pulses did not depend on a relatively precise positioning of the
switch. However, the new switches had not yet been fitted on all the
turnstiles in group A to G; the new switches that had been installed on this
group were attached to temporary mountings, permanent installation awaiting
the end of the season.

4.1.2     The recording and display system

The pulse counts obtained from the switch on a turnstile were received by a
storage register which was dedicated to that turnstile and formed part of the
signal conditioning unit. The storage registers were scanned continuously and
the counts transmitted to the central processor of a micro-computer. The
programming of the micro-computer enabled its visual display unit (VDU) to
display a list identifying each turnstile and showing the number of admissions
through it, i.e. the number of pulses transmitted from the turnstile. The
count of the number of admissions through each turnstile was incremented
continuously and the admissions through the groups of turnstiles allocated to
the zones of the stadium were displayed as accumulating totals.

The system was therefore designed to count the total number of admissions
through each turnstile and to provide a record of the accumulating total
admissions to each zone of the stadium, i.e. Spion Kop, North Stand, West
Stand, West terraces, etc. Financial information corresponding to the
admission price at each turnstile was also displayed.

The rated maximum capacity of each zone of the stadium was displayed on the
VDU. A warning was provided, by means of flashing inverse contrast on the
display, when the capacity of each zone was within 1,000 persons of its
maximum designated capacity.

The micro-computer system did not have 'backing' storage in the form of disc
or magnetic tape. Long term storage was confined to obtaining a copy of the
display on the VDU from a printer, although the display on the screen was
retained in the memory of the computer until a command was typed from the VDU
to clear this part of the memory. There were no facilities at present to
undertake any further processing of the data held in the central storage of
the computer.

Mr Houldsworth said that on 15 April, when he realised that a serious incident
had occurred on the West terraces, he had printed three copies of the display
on the VDU. Apart from the relatively few turns of the 'gates' made by HSE's
staff whilst examining turnstiles A to G, the data in the computer memory and
displayed on the VDU was the data that he had copied on 15 April.

4.2   ASSESSMENT OF THE ACCURACY OF THE COUNTING AND RECORDING OF ADMISSIONS
      THROUGH THE TURNSTILES IN LEPPINGS LANE

We assessed the accuracy of the system for counting and recording admissions
through the turnstiles in Leppings Lane. We concentrated the assessment on
turnstiles designated A to G because they were labelled both "Standing Only"
and "Leppings Lane Standing".

However, we made some assessment of the accuracy of the counting system on the
turnstiles in group 9 to 16 because, although they were labelled "West Stand",
they might have provided access to the West terraces.

4.2.1   Method of assessment

Detective Chief Inspector Tope monitored turnstiles A to G whilst we observed
Mr Houldsworth take a copy from the printer of the accumulated admissions
displayed on the VDU. The control room was then locked and we accompanied
Mr Houldsworth whilst he simulated 50 admissions through each turnstile in
group A to G by rotating each 'gate' through 50 quarter-turns, at a speed
corresponding to approximately 2.25 sec/admission (1600 admissions/hour).
Detective Chief Inspector Tope then monitored turnstiles A to G again whilst
   returned to the control room with Mr Houldsworth and observed him take
another copy from the printer of the display on the VDU.
A similar procedure was used to check the accuracy of the counting and
recording system of turnstiles 9 to 16, but each 'gate' in this group was
rotated through only 10 quarter-turns.

We then returned to the turnstiles in group A to G and repeated the first
test, rotating each 'gate' through 50 quarter-turns

Table 1 shows the results of our investigation of the accuracy of the counting
and recording system on turnstiles A to G and 9 to 16.


5     THE AVERAGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS OF THE TURNSTILES

The number of persons (capacity) allocated to each zone of the stadium and the
location and designation of the turnstiles were shown on Eastwood & Partners
Drawing No 8945/lA, dated 16/4/87. The zones and their capacities are shown in
Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2.

On 28 April 1989 we walked around the outside of the perimeter of the stadium
and observed any labels on the entrances to the turnstiles that indicated the
zones they served.

A printed record of the admissions to the stadium, made by Mr Houldsworth on
the afternoon of 15 April 1989, was delivered to Dr Nicholson on 24 May 1989
by Detective Constable Phillips of the West Midlands Police. We examined a
copy of this record, in conjunction with Eastwood & Partners Drawing No 8945/lA
and our observations of the labels on the turnstiles, to assist us in deducing
how turnstiles were allocated to zones of the stadium on 15 April 1989.

We deduced that the turnstiles were allocated to zones as shown in Column 3 of
Table 2, the number of turnstiles allocated being shown in Column 4. The
capacity of each zone was divided by the number of turnstiles allocated to it,
giving their average admission requirements (persons/turnstile) as shown in
Column 5.


6     DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF THE INVESTIGATION

6.1     THE EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL FORCE ON THE 'GATE' OF A TURNSTILE

The relationship between the force applied to the 'wing' of a turnstile and
the force required to depress its release pedal showed considerable 'scatter'.
Some variation between individual tests might be attributable to differences
in the position at which the horizontal forces were applied to a 'wing'.
Furthermore, we could not ensure that test weights were always placed on the
pedal at exactly the same distance from the pivot of the locking lever, and we
would have preferred to have applied smaller increments of weight to the
pedal. However, a frictional force had to be overcome when depressing the
pedal to release the 'gate', and it is our opinion that the 'scatter' was
principally attributable to the inherent variability of the coefficient of
friction between unlubricated metallic surfaces.

Fig 6 suggests that, typically, a pedal force — 0.56 x 'wing' force would be
required to release turnstile B, and that a pedal force — 1.56 x 'wing' force
would be required to release turnstile C, i.e. turnstile C required a force on
its pedal that typically was 2.8 times greater than that for turnstile B. We
had observed that turnstiles A and B appeared to differ in detail from
turnstiles C to G.

An operator weighing 750 N (169 lbf or approximately 12 stones) might have
difficulty in releasing the 'gate' of turnstile B if a force exceeding 1340 N
(301 lbf) was applied to a 'wing', because he might have to exert a force of
more than his weight on the pedal to release the 'gate'. The same operator
would probably have difficulty in releasing the 'gate' of turnstile C if a
force of 480 N (108 lbf) was applied to a 'wing'. It is our opinion that
turnstiles A and B would be likely to behave in a similar manner and that
turnstile C was representative of those in the group C to G.

Variations about the predicted average force required on the pedal ranged
between approximately plus 70% and minus 44% for turnstile B, and between
approximately plus 55% and minus 36% for turnstile C. The stated relationships
provide only approximate indications of the forces that might be needed to
release turnstiles in the group A to G.

6.2   THE ACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM FOR COUNTING AND RECORDING ADMISSIONS THROUGH
      THE TURNSTILES IN LEPPINGS LANE

Table 1 shows that the first set of 50 quarter-turns of turnstiles A to G
caused turnstile E to record six more 'admissions' than we had counted, and
turnstile G to record one less 'admission' than we had counted.

The second set of 50 quarter-turns of turnstiles A to G caused turnstile E to
record the correct number of 'admissions' and turnstile G to record three
fewer 'admissions' than we had counted. Turnstile C recorded three more
'admissions' than we had counted, but we were interrupted during the counting
and it is our opinion that the discrepancy was probably attributable to this
interruption.

We inspected turnstile E and concluded that the discrepancy obtained during
the first 50 quarter-turns arose from vertical upward 'float' of the spindle
in its bearings and the position of the roller-plunger micro-switch. The
combined effect was that the micro-switch occasionally appeared to be actuated
spuriously by protrusions on the cast surfaces of the lugs of the upper
cruciform boss that connected the 'gate' to the spindle. The error only
appeared during the first set of 50 quarter-turns and we concluded that it
was likely to have occurred during the first few 'admissions' after a period
of inaction. It is our opinion that the error would not persist throughout a
period of continuous operation.

Turnstile G recorded fewer 'admissions' than we had counted during both sets
of 50 quarter-turns. We observed that the lugs of the upper cruciform boss on
turnstile G only just made contact with the roller on the plunger of its
micro-switch. We concluded that this uncertain contact caused turnstile G to
record less than the correct number of 'admissions'. It is our opinion that
this under-recording was likely to persist throughout a period of continuous
operation and that the number of admissions recorded by turnstile G was likely
to be less than the correct value.

Turnstile 14 recorded one more 'admission' than we had counted whilst making
the 10 quarter-turns on turnstiles 9 to 16. However, we suspected that this
discrepancy arose because the 'gate' of turnstile 14 was in a mid-travel
position when the test commenced. Our tests therefore suggested that
turnstiles 9 to 16 would provide an accurate record of the number of persons
admitted through them.

We concluded that the computerized system would be likely to record the total
number of admissions through group A to F of the turnstiles with an accuracy
that was within 1%. In a test turnstile G recorded 6% less than the correct
number of admissions, but we concluded that the uncertainty in the operation of
its micro-switch might cause the under-recording to be more severe than this.

We concluded that the turnstiles in group 9 to 16 would record the correct
number of admissions.

6.3   AVERAGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS OF THE TURNSTILES

Table 2 shows that the stadium's maximum capacity of 54,324 persons was served
by 83 turnstiles on 15 April 1989, and that 45% (24,447 persons) of the
stadium's capacity were to be admitted from Leppings Lane, where 28% (23) of
the turnstiles in use were sited.

Table 2 has been arranged in descending order of the average number of
admissions required from each group of turnstiles serving the different zones
of the stadium. The highest admission requirement was 1,443 persons/turnstile
for the West terraces, followed by 988 persons/turnstile for the North Stand
Seating and by 744 persons/turnstile for the West Stand Seating. The admission
requirement of the turnstiles for the West terraces was therefore almost 3.5
times greater than that for the South Stand Uncovered Seating (the lowest
admission requirement) and approximately 2.9 times greater than that for Spion
K o p , the other terrace zone.

Six groups of turnstiles served the stadium and the three groups with the
highest admission requirements were sited in Leppings Lane. The overall
average admission requirement of the 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane was
1063 persons/turnstile.

The other overall average admission requirements were 500 persons/turnstile
for the turnstiles in Penistone Road and 493 persons/turnstile for those in
the Concourse behind the South Stand. The overall average admission
requirement of the turnstiles in Leppings Lane was therefore approximately
twice that of the turnstiles sited elsewhere around the perimeter of the
stadium.

We have therefore concluded that, if a maximum capacity crowd was to be
admitted, the longest delays would be likely to be experienced by persons
required to enter the stadium through the turnstiles in Leppings Lane;
particularly long delays would be likely to be experienced by those with
tickets for the West terraces. We would therefore expect larger crowds to form
outside the turnstiles in Leppings Lane than at other places of entry to the
stadium.
7     SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

7.1    THE EFFECT OF A HORIZONTAL FORCE ON THE 'GATES' OF TURNSTILES SERVING
       THE WEST TERRACES

7.1.1 Our tests suggested that, typically, the force needed on the pedal of a
turnstile to release its 'gate' was 0.56 x the force on a 'wing' for
turnstiles A and B, and 1.56 x the force on a 'wing' for turnstiles C to G.
Variations of up to 70% were obtained in the force required to depress the
pedal and these relationships should serve only as an indication of the forces
that might be needed to release the turnstiles serving the West terraces.

7.1.2 A turnstile operator weighing 750 N (169 lbf or approximately
12 stones) or less might have difficulty in releasing the 'gate' of turnstiles
A or B if the horizontal force applied to a'wing' was 1340 N  (301 lbf) or
more, because he might have to exert a force of more than his weight on the
pedal to release the 'gate'. The same operator might have difficulty in
releasing the 'gate' of a turnstile in the group C to G if a horizontal force
of 480 N (108 lbf) or more was applied to a 'wing'.

7.1.3 It is our opinion that the ease with which an operator could depress
the pedal would affect the time taken for a person to be admitted. Therefore a
thrust exceeding 480 N (108 lbf) that was imposed by a crowd on a person at
the 'gate' of a turnstile would be likely decrease the flow of persons through
the group of turnstiles A to G.

7.2    THE ACCURACY OF THE SYSTEM FOR COUNTING AND RECORDING ADMISSIONS THROUGH
       THE TURNSTILES IN LEPPINGS LANE

7.2.1 Our tests suggested that turnstiles A, B, C, D, and F would record the
correct number of admissions. It is our opinion that the error obtained during
the first test on turnstile E would be unlikely to persist during a period of
continuous operation. In our opinion turnstiles A to F, as a group, would
record the number of admissions within an accuracy of approximately 1%.

7.2.2 Our tests indicated that a persistent error was likely to occur in the
counting system of turnstile G. During a period of continuous operation this
turnstile could repeatedly fail to count some admissions, and the recorded
admissions could be significantly less than the correct number. We concluded
that the error in counting at turnstile G was probably attributable to
uncertainty of contact between the roller of the micro-switch and the four
lugs on the upper cruciform boss of the 'gate'.

7.2.3 Our tests suggested that turnstiles in the group 9 to 16 would record
the correct number of admissions.

7.3    AVERAGE ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS OF THE TURNSTILES

7.3.1 We have concluded that on 15 April 1989 the spectators were intended to
enter the stadium through 83 turnstiles, of which 23 (28%) were sited in
Leppings Lane. If the stadium was to be filled to its maximum capacity of
54,324 persons then 45% (24,447 persons) of this capacity would be admitted
from Leppings Lane, through 28% of the turnstiles serving the stadium.
7.3.2 The turnstiles serving the West terraces had the highest average
admission requirement (1,443 persons/turnstile) of any group of turnstiles
serving the stadium. It was almost 3.5 times the lowest average admission
requirement of 413 persons/turnstile for the South Stand Uncovered Seating,
and was approximately 2.9 times the average admission requirement of
500 persons/turnstile for Spion Kop, the other terrace zone.

7.3.3 Six groups of turnstiles served the stadium. The three groups of
turnstiles with the highest average admission requirements were sited in
Leppings Lane; i.e. West terraces (1,443 persons/turnstile), North Stand
(988 persons/turnstile) and West Stand (744 persons/turnstile).

7.3.4 The average admission requirement of the 23 turnstiles in Leppings Lane
was approximately twice that of the 42 turnstiles in Penistone Road and that
of the 18 turnstiles in the Concourse behind the South Stand. It is our
opinion that larger crowds would form in Leppings Lane than in the other
entrance areas to the stadium when it was to be filled to its maximum
capacity.

7.3.5 It is our opinion that, when the stadium was to be filled to its
maximum capacity, the longest delays in admission would be be experienced by
persons required to enter through the turnstiles in Leppings Lane, and that
those with tickets for the West terraces would experience the most severe
delays.

1     INTRODUCTION

I was told by Dr C E Nicholson, a Deputy Director of the Safety Engineering
Laboratory (SEL) of the Research and Laboratory Services Division (RLSD) of
the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), that on the 15th of April a video
recording had been made which showed people entering the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club's (SWFC) stadium through the Leppings Lane turnstiles A, B, C,
D, E, F and G and through gate C; the turnstiles served the West Terrace and
North-West Terrace and in this report these terraces are called the 'West
terraces'. It is my understanding that the video camera had been in a fixed
position and had been recording from before 1:00 pm until after 3:00 pm. Dr
Nicholson asked us to analyse a copy of the recording to:

i)     count the total number of people who had entered through these
       turnstiles and compare these counts with the counts registered by the
       Sheffield Wednesday's computerised system for recording admissions.

ii)    measure the rate at which people had entered the stadium through
       turnstiles A to G throughout the period of the video recording.

iii) estimate the number of people who had entered the stadium through gate C.

I was assisted by other staff of RLSD working under my supervision and to my
instructions. Police Constable (PC) R Watson of the West Midlands Police
liased with me and he provided the copies of the video recordings. He gave me
a copy of a statement by Peter John Wilkinson of West Mercia Police TV Unit
which gave details of the copy and edit procedure that had been undertaken
from the original video tape.


2 VTDEO TAPE RECORDINGS USED FOR ANALYSIS

Dr Nicholson gave me copies of drawings which had been produced by Ralph Brade
and Associates. Drawing No 1340/05 titled 'Close Circuit Television Cameras
Location Plan' shows 'S.W.F.C. CAMERA 2 GATES A-G' and it is my understanding
that the original VHS video tape identified as 'RJH2' was produced from
signals sent by a camera at this location and that all the video recordings
used by RLSD for analysis were copied from this original tape.

The U-matic video tape recordings used for 'turnstile' admission analysis were
delivered by PC R Watson and the individual tapes were labelled RJH2/E/Part 1
Copy A, RJH2/E/Part 2 Copy A, RJH2/E/Part 3 Copy A, RJH2/F/Part 1 Copy A,
RJH2/F/Part 2 Copy A, RJH2/F/Part 3 Copy A. The tapes showed the exits of
turnstile booths A to G from approximately 12:55 pm until 3:10 pm on 15 April
1989. The '/E/' Tapes showed the exits of turnstiles A, B and C and the '/F/'
Tapes showed the exits of turnstiles D, E, F and G. The two Part l's covered
the first hour, the two Part 2's the second hour and the two Part 3's the
remaining time. The continuous reference timings on the video tapes were with
respect to the start of each tape and not to British Summer Time (BST) but I
determined the relationship between these times and BST using specific
events in conjunction with West Midlands Police.

The VHS video recording used for 'gate C analysis' was a copy identified as
DF1/B and had been produced by an RLSD photographer from a video recording
labelled RJH2, loaned to us by PC R Watson. The copy had continuous reference
timings which related to the start of the tape and not to BST. The recording
showed the exits of turnstile booths A to G, gate C and the general area on
the West Stand side of these turnstiles.
3     LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION OF TURNSTILE BOOTHS A-G AND GATE C

Fig 1 is a schematic plan showing the seven turnstiles and gate C.
The location of the turnstile booths and of gate C is shown on the Ralph Brade
and Associates drawing No 1340/04A and the aperture of gate C when open is
shown as 4115 mm. Gate C, when closed, formed part of the perimeter boundary
and was adjacent to turnstile booth G and approximately perpendicular to the
row of turnstile booths. Normally gate C was closed and it is my understanding
that the main function of gate C was to let people out of the stadium after a
match.

The turnstile booth exits consisted of seven doors, designated in alphabetical
order from A to G. When viewed from the video camera location door A was on
the right and furthest away from the video camera. Doors A and B, D and E, F
and G were in pairs and Door C was on its own. Within the booths the exit
doors aligned directly with the appropriate turnstile passage, but the
internal layout of the turnstile booths did not prevent a person passing
through the 'gate' of turnstile A and then emerging from the door of the booth
marked B (and vice versa); similarly for the other paired turnstiles. In my
opinion, this indirect route may have been used on a few occasions, for
example if there was someone standing in the way at the normal 'direct' exit
door. Thus the individual counts for the 'paired' turnstiles may be less
accurate than the sum of the two counts from the two doors of a pair.

The turnstile mechanisms were not identical in design nor in ease of operation
and details are reported by Games and Waterhouse (RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33).

It is my understanding that on the 15th April these 7 turnstiles served the
West terraces which had a designated capacity of 10,100 persons.

4   THE COUNTING METHOD

4.1    TURNSTILES

The counting method used a specially developed computer program and
micro-computer. The video recording was played at normal speed and the
computer's clock was synchronised with a reference time on the video image.
Whenever a person was seen to emerge from a specific turnstile booth an RLSD
observer depressed a push button, closing an electrical circuit and sending an
electrical pulse signal to the computer. The computer recorded each signal
pulse and the elapsed times from the start of playback. People emerging from
turnstiles A and B were registered together because the shadows on the video
recording image sometimes made it impossible to differentiate between people
emerging from the exit door of turnstile A and those from the exit door of
turnstile B. People emerging from all other turnstiles were registered
separately.

4.2 GATE C

I was informed by PC Watson of West Midlands Police that gate C had been
opened three times and that the 'First Opening' had occurred at approximately
2:48 pm for a duration of about 30 seconds and that the 'Second Opening' had
occurred at approximately 2:52 pm for a duration of about 5 minutes 30
seconds. A 'Third Opening' had occurred approximately one minute later when
the gate was opened sufficiently to allow the entry of people in single file
for approximately 8 minutes.
The position of gate C on the video image and the small distance between
adjacent people as they passed through gate C made it impracticable to discern
each person as they passed through the gap. Therefore the
method of assessment for the first two openings was to count the number of
people passing a reference line drawn on the video display monitor for a
recording period of 3 seconds, and then to repeat this process at intervals
throughout the period of opening. The reference line was drawn so that any
person who had entered through gate C would cross the line, whilst generally
being separated from other people by a much greater distance than when
passing through the gap, thus making each person more discemable. The path of
each person was viewed to ensure that people emerging from turnstiles were not
counted. The counting process was repeated several times, by rewinding and
replaying the video tape, for each sample, to ensure that the chance of not
counting a particular person was reduced to a minimum. The playback speed on
the video recorder was adjusted to play the recording slowly enough to
optimize the counting.

Four samples were  taken during the First Opening and 27    sampleswere taken
during the Second Opening; the longest interval       between     samplesbeing 15
seconds. The whole of the Third Opening was analysed in one continuous sample.

5 DATA PROCESSING AND RESULTS

5.1     TURNSTILES

Details of the data processing are given in the Appendix and the tables,
graphs and charts   produced are described below.

5.1.1    Turnstile Total Counts

Table 1 shows how many people had been counted through the turnstiles at
intervals of 5 minutes, the bottom row of the table being the final count just
before the turnstiles were closed. Each row of the table gives the individual
total count for turnstiles C to G, the totals for the three pairs A+B, D+E,
F+G and the total for all seven turnstiles.

Fig 2 shows the total number of people who had been counted through the seven
turnstiles at any particular time and is a graphical representation of the
same data as the final column in Table 1 but every data point has been
presented, rather than just the totals at intervals of 5 minutes.

5.1.2     Turnstile Rate Counts

Table 2 shows the number of people counted through the turnstiles in each 5
minute interval. Each row of the table shows the individual 5 minute counts
for turnstiles C to G, the 5 minute count for the pairs A+B, D+E, F+G and the
5 minute count for the sum of all seven turnstiles. These counts can be
converted to rates of admission, measured as 'people per turnstile per hour',
by multiplying by 12 and dividing by the number of turnstiles under
consideration. The last column of Table 3 shows the overall rates of admission
for all seven turnstiles for each 5 min period after 2:00 pm and the average
(mean) rate of admission measured over the 45 min period from 2:05 pm
to 2:50 pm was approximately 660 people/tumstile/hour.

A visual representation of the data for turnstiles A+B, C, D, E, F and G is
shown in the bar chart in Fig 3.
I analysed the data obtained from the counts from seven turnstiles in greater
detail to give a more continuous measure of the rate at which people were
entering the stadium through these turnstiles. The method of analysis used a
period of time ('window') of three minutes and calculated the rate of entry
for the 'window' from the number of entries made during its 3 minute duration.
The 'window' was then moved forward by an increment of 0.5 minutes and a new
rate of entry calculated. This process was repeated until the end of the data
was reached and the resulting graph of rate of entry against time is shown in
Fig 4. 1 made analyses using other durations of the 'window'; a longer
'window' gave a smoother curve with some loss of information and a shorter one
gave rapid fluctuations which tended to mask more general trends of change in
rate of entry. It is my opinion that a 'window' of 3 minutes gave the most
representative rates of entry.

5.1.3    Comparison between RLSD counts and Sheffield Wednesday Football
         Club's computer record

The RLSD final count totals are summarised in the following table and compared
with the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's (SWFC) computer print-out, taken
on 15 April 1989 by Mr R J Houldsworth (RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33).

Turnstiles               RLSD    SWFC            Differ
                         Count   Computer

A+B                       1930   2004             -3.7%

C                         1168   1206             -3.3%

D+E                       2130   2196             -3.0%

A to E                    5228   5406             -3.3%

F+G                       2019    1632           +23.7%

Total                     7247    7038



Dr Nicholson informed me that the turnstiles were open for a period before the
start of the video recordings. In my opinion this accounts for RLSD's count of
the admissions through turnstiles A to E being approximately 3.3% less than
the admissions shown on the print-out taken from the SWFC's computerised
system on 15 April. I have therefore concluded that SWFC's count for the total
number of admissions through turnstiles A to E is likely to be correct.


5.1.4    Count for turnstiles F+G and error in SWFC count for turnstile G

The SWFC count for turnstile F was 1049, 2% less than the RLSD count of
1071 (Table 1) but this may be attributable to some people passing through
turnstile G but emerging from Exit Door F; in my opinion the SWFC count is
probably accurate for this turnstile.

RLSD's count for turnstiles F+G was 23.7% higher than that obtained from
SWFC's computerised recording system. RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33 concluded that
there was likely to be persistent under-recording from turnstile G and it is
my opinion that under-recording on turnstile G is probably the sole cause of


                                         -4-
the discrepancy. I have assumed that the RLSD count of 2019 is less than the
true count by the same percentage (3.3%) for turnstiles F+G as for turnstiles
A to E, and have estimated that 2088 is the true total for turnstiles F+G.

My estimate of 2088 for turnstiles F+G can therefore be divided into a count
of 1049 for turnstile F (the SWFC count) and the remainder of 1039 for
turnstile G. The SWFC count of 583 from turnstile G is therefore 56% of my
estimated correct number of admissions through this turnstile.

5.1.5   Estimate of total number of people through turnstiles A to G

It is my opinion that the best estimate for the final total of people admitted
through all seven turnstiles is given by adding the SWFC total for turnstiles
A to E of 5406 to my estimate of 2088 for turnstiles F+G, giving an overall
total of 7494 admissions for turnstiles A to G. In my opinion, based on the
tests reported by Games and Waterhouse (RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33), it is most
unlikely that the true total exceeded this value by more than 2% ie a maximum
of 7644 for the number of people who passed through the seven turnstiles.

My estimated total of 7494 admissions through turnstiles A to G from the time
that they were opened is 247 greater than the RLSD count. It is my opinion
that this is attributable to people entering the stadium before the start of
the video recording.

5.1.6   Estimate of time at which 10100 people would have entered
        through turnstiles A to G

RLSD's count at 2:45 pm was 5495 but an estimated 247 people had entered the
stadium before the start of the video recording. Therefore at 2:45 pm the
estimated number of people who had entered through turnstiles A to G was 5742.
Based on a capacity of 10100 for the West terraces there were still 4358
people yet to enter the stadium for these terraces. If the rate at which
people were passing through the turnstiles A to G at around 2:30 pm had been
maintained I have estimated that it would have taken until approximately
3:40 pm to admit the remaining 4358 people.

Prior to the 'Second Opening' of gate C at approximately 2:52 pm the highest
admission rate, measured over a period of 5 minutes, for the seven turnstiles
was 702 people per turnstile per hour (Table 3 Col 5). If this rate had been
constantly maintained it would have taken about 123 minutes to admit 10100
people. For all these people to have entered the stadium before 3:00 pm the
first entrants would have needed to enter before 1:00 pm.

Prior to the 'Second Opening' of gate C the greatest number of admissions
during a period of 5 minutes through turnstile C, a single turnstile, was 76
people, and for any pair of turnstiles it was 141 people (Table 2). On the
basis of these values I have calculated a maximum composite admission through
all seven turnstiles (single C and pairs A+B, D+E, F+G) during a period of 5
minutes:

i.e. 76 + (3 x 141) - 499 people through 7 turnstiles in 5 minutes, which
represents 855 people/turnstile/hour. If this rate had been constantly
maintained it would have taken about 101 minutes to admit 10100 people. For
all these people to have entered the stadium before 3:00 pm the first entrants
would have needed to enter before 1:20 pm.
5.1.7   Turnstile C - Intervals Between Successive Entrants

Turnstile C was the only turnstile where the people necessarily emerged from
one door. Therefore the data from this turnstile was further analysed to give
the time intervals between the emergence of successive people. The data which
was analysed consisted of the times of emergence, rounded to the nearest whole
number of seconds, for each person.

The admissions after 2:00 pm were divided into successive groups of 10 minutes
duration and the data in each group analysed to give the number of people that
had emergence times of 0 second, 1 second, 2 seconds, 3 seconds, etc after the
previous person.

There is an anomoly which gives a small number of times for a 0 second
interval. The reason for this anomoly is because of the rounding procedure
which rounded the actual times to the nearest integer times; for example if a
person emerged with an actual time of 97.51 seconds and the next person 0.98
seconds later with an actual time of 98.49 seconds, both of these people would
register as 98 seconds and the interval would be calculated as 0 second. A '0
second' interval is therefore occasionally, but not necessarily, recorded for
a person who emerged from the door within 1 second of the previous person.
These rounding errors were not cumulative and do not affect the average or
(mean) time of passage.

Table 4 shows the number of people having the same time interval of passage
through turnstile C and its contents are presented as the bar charts of Fig 5
which show the frequency distribution of the various times; times exceeding 10
seconds are not shown. Both Table 4 and Fig 5 show that the average (mean)
time taken to pass through turnstile C was always greater than the most
frequently occurring time of passage.



5.2   GATE C

5.2.1   First Opening

I assumed that the rate at which people entered through gate C changed
linearly between successive sampling periods. The counts made during each of
the 3 second sample periods were therefore used to calculate an estimated
number of entries between each sample period. The total number of entries
through gate C was obtained from the sum of these estimates, added to the
counts made during the sampling periods. The total number estimate was 130
but in my opinion this estimate should be regarded as a minimum because of the
likelihood that some people were not counted because they were obscured by
others. My best estimate would be that about 150 people entered during the
'First Opening' of gate C and in my opinion the actual number was unlikely to
have been greater than 180.

5.2.2   Second Opening

There was an initial surge of people during which a sample was taken and the
measured rate for this sample was 10 people/second; the flow soon became
relatively steady and the rates of entry for many of the samples during the
remainder of the period were about 6 people/second. Drawing No 1340/04A showed
Gate C to be 4115 mm wide and by assuming a shoulder width of 550 mm 1
calculated that it would allow 7 people to pass abreast when it was fully
opened. The measured rate of 6 people/second therefore corresponds
approximately to a rate of 1 person per shoulder width per second.

A similar method of analysis was used to that for the 'First Opening' and Fig
6 shows a graph of the number of people who entered through gate C during the
'Second Opening'; the asterisks on the graph denote the individual sample
points. The total number estimate was 1800 but in my opinion this estimate
should be regarded as a minimum because of the likelihood that some people
were obscured by others. My best estimate, based on the assumption that 1
person in 10 may not have been counted, would be about 2000 and in my opinion
the actual number was unlikely to have been greater than 2200.

5.2.3     Third Opening

Entries during the 'Third Opening' were at a much lower rate than in the other
two openings and a continuous count was made over a period of about 8 minutes.
A total of 90 people were counted and in my opinion the actual number is
unlikely to have been greater than 100.


6   SUMMARY OF RESULTS

6.1     TURNSTILE COUNTS, ESTIMATES, TOTALS AND RATE OF ENTRY

The '5 minute totals' and rates for turnstiles A to G are summarised in Table
3.

The third column in Table 3 was obtained from my assumption that the
discrepancy of 247 between the RLSD total and final estimated total was due to
people entering the stadium before the start of the video recording. This
number has therefore been added to all the intermediate RLSD counts to give an
estimated count for the intermediate times.

The total entries shown in the fourth column were obtained by adding, at
appropriate times, admissions through turnstiles A to G from the third column
to my best estimates of the number of entries made through gate C.


6.2     COUNTS AND ESTIMATES FOR THE THREE OPENINGS OF GATE C AND THE FINAL TOTALS

The estimates for gate C and estimated totals for the turnstiles are
summarised below:

                   RLSD Count      'Best' Estimate      Maximum Estimate

First Opening       130                     150                 180

Second Opening     1800                    2000             2200

Total              9267                    9734          10124


6.3     SWFC COMPUTER COUNTS FOR TURNSTILE A TO G

6.3.1 Turnstiles A to E

The RLSD counts for these turnstiles would indicate that the SWFC counts for
turnstiles A to E were accurate and in my opinion SWFC's record of the entries
through these turnstiles would not be in error by more than 2%.

6.3.2    Turnstile G

The SWFC count for turnstile G was low and estimates in this report indicate
that the SWFC computer only registered about 56% of the correct number of
entries through this turnstile. Evidence of the turnstile switch
malfunctioning is reported by Gaines and Waterhouse (RLSD report IR/L/ME/89/33)
and this would account for errors in the total registered by the SWFC
computer.


7     DISCUSSION

7.1 RATE OF ENTRY THROUGH TURNSTILES A TO G

I consider it reasonable to suppose that, in the absence of crowd forces, the
rate at which people entered the stadium would rise until there were queues at
all the turnstiles. I would then have expected the entry rate to remain fairly
constant, possibly rising slightly as the match start time approached.

Fig 4 shows that from about 2:05 pm the rate was fairly constant until 2:25
pm, which in my opinion suggests that all turnstiles had queues and people
were not having undue difficulty in entering the turnstiles.

After about 2:25 pm turnstile C generally has the highest admission rate and
it is noticeable from Table 2 that the paired turnstiles were performing less
well. In particular turnstiles F+G recorded a count of only 86 between 2:45 pm
and 2:50 pm and turnstiles D+E a count of 77 between 2:40 pm and 2:45 pm;
equivalent to 516 and 385 people per turnstile per hour respectively. In my
opinion the rate at which people were entering fell significantly at about
2:35 pm and a likely cause was crowd forces acting on the people entering the
turnstiles. Even so the lowest overall entry rate for a 5 minute period of
610 people/turnstile/hour was only 13% below the corresponding highest overall
entry rate of 702 persons/turnstile/hour.


7.2     GATE C OPENINGS

I estimated that an estimated 2000 people entered the stadium during the
'Second Opening', during which significant checking of tickets was not
apparent from the video recording. There was therefore little point in
checking tickets at the turnstiles and therefore rates of entry after 2:50 pm
should not be compared with those before that time.

It is my opinion that the number of people who can pass through a given sized
opening in a given time will tend to be self-limiting. If a person moves more
quickly then more clearance betwejen successive people will be required. If
people shuffle through almost touching each other their speed will be limited
because of lack of freedom of movement. For example if people walk at a speed
of 2 m/sec (4.5 mph) and a spacing of 1.5 m (5 ft) then 80 people per shoulder
width would pass a given point in 1 min; if the speed was 1 m/sec (2.2 mph)
and the spacing was 0.75 m (2.5 ft) the number of people passing the point in
1 min would be the same.


7.3 TIMES TAKEN TO PASS THROUGH TURNSTILE C

Fig 5 and Table 4 show that between 2:00 pm and 2:10 pm the most frequent time
of passage was 5 sec. The entry time then diminished to 3 sec for the
intervals of 2:30 pm to 2:40 pm and 2:40 pm to 2:50 pm, with an approximately
equal numbers of entries taking 2 sec and 4 sec; however the mean entry times
for these intervals were 4.3 sec and 4.4 sec respectively, corresponding to
828 people/hour and 822 people/hour. This shows that the asymmetric
distribution of times, caused by a significant number of people taking longer
than 5 seconds, gives a mean time that is about 50% greater than the most
frequent time for this interval. If all the people passing through turnstile C
had taken 3 sec then 1200 people/hour could have passed through the turnstile.


8 CONCLUSIONS

8.1 My best estimate of the number of people admitted through turnstiles A to
G is 7494 and through gate C is 2240, i.e. a total of 9734. It is my opinion
that the true total is most unlikely to have exceeded 10124, i.e. the total
admissions were approximately equal to the designated capacity of 10,100
people for the West terraces.


8.2 On the basis of RLSD's measured rates of entry through turnstiles A to G,
and the number of people who had already been admitted through these
turnstiles at 2:45 pm, I have estimated that if gate C had not been opened it
would have taken until about 3:40 pm to admit a total of 10100 people through
these turnstiles.

8.3 Using RLSD's measured rates of entry through turnstiles A to G at about
2:30 pm I calculated that people would need to have been continuously
entering through these turnstiles at this rate before 1:00 pm to enable
10100 people to enter the West terraces before 3:00 pm.

If the composite highest measured rate of entry (defined in Section 5.1.6)
achieved prior to 2:50 pm had been continuously achieved on all seven
turnstiles, people would need to have been continuously entering through the
turnstiles A to G at this rate before 1:20 pm so that 10100 people could
have entered the West Terraces before 3:00 pm.

8.4 The rate of entry into the stadium increased markedly at about 1:45 pm
rising from about 300 to about 550 people per turnstile per hour. The 5 minute
rate for all seven turnstiles peaked at 702 people per turnstile per hour for
the period 2:30 pm to 2:35 pm and remained within about 13% of this value from
2:05 pm until 2:50 pm, the average (mean) rate for this 45 min period was 660
people per turnstile per hour. There was a significant fall in the rate at
about 2:35 pm with no recovery until after the 'Second Opening' of gate C.
Just before 2:55 pm the rate increased markedly but at this stage there would
have been no onus on turnstile operators to check tickets since at this time
other people were being admitted through gate C without their tickets being
checked.

8.5 The distribution of the times of passage through turnstile C was
asymmetric and the mean time of passage was always significantly greater than
the most frequent time. Between 2:30 pm and 2:50 pm the most frequently
occurring time of passage was 3 sec corresponding to 1200 people per turnstile
per hour but the mean time of passage was 4.4 seconds corresponding to 820
people per turnstile per hour.

8.6 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's computerised system for recording
admissions to the stadium registered only approximately 56% of the people who
entered through turnstile G. There is no evidence from the RLSD counting that
any of the total counts from turnstiles A to F were registered incorrectly.

APPENDIX

1   TURNSTILE DATA STORAGE

The initial data from the counting is contained in 36 computer files each of
the general name HD******.TCD eg HDJDF623.TCD; each of these files is for a
particular turnstile and for a specific time period, i.e. session of
registering the data. Each file contains the time in seconds, from the start
of the counting session, of every push button depression.

The 3rd and 4th characters of the filename eg 'JD' denote the RLSD member of
staff who created the data.

The 5th and 6th characters eg 'F6' denote the turnstile, however turnstiles
'A' and 'B' were counted as one and are denoted by 'A l '.

The 7th character eg '2' denotes the video tape 'Part Number' and the 8th
character the 'session' number for the particular tape. Part 1 tapes were
analysed in two sessions, Part 2 in three sessions and Part 3 in one session.

2   TURNSTILE DATA PROCESSING

The 36 'initial data files' were each converted to give two columns of data,
the first column being the person count number from the start of the relevant
Part 1 video tape (Section 2) and the second number being the elapsed time in
seconds from the start of the relevant Part 1 video tape. The names of these
files are all of the form HD******.TIM eg HDJDF623.TIM; and the central
characters are identical to those of the 'initial data files'. There are thus
six files for each of turnstiles C to G and six files for the combined
turnstiles A and B.

The six files of data for each turnstile were merged to give a single file for
each turnstile and also a column of elapsed time in minutes was added to give
three columns in total. The filenames are HDAl.ADT, HDC3.ADT, HDD4.ADT,
HDE5.ADT, HDF6.ADT and HDG7.ADT.

Turnstiles D and E shared a common exit and therefore the data in files
HDD4.ADT and HDE5.ADT were merged to form a file named HDD4E5.ADT. Similarly
the data in files HDF6.ADT and HDG7.ADT were merged to form a file named
HDF6G7.ADT.

Data from all seven turnstiles, ie A to G, were then merged to form a file
named HDA.ADT. There were thus nine computer files in this format and these
nine files were then reprocessed so that all the times were with respect to
3:00 pm BST. These new files all have names ending C.ADT, the remaining
alphanumerics being identical to those in the previous nine files.

These nine files contain approximately 18000 lines of data and the data was
reduced, for the purpose of this report, to give the total number of people
who had passed through the turnstiles at specific times having 5 minute
intervals. Additionally, the number of people entering in each period of 5
minutes was calculated. The program which reduced the data is HDCALL.FTN and
the table is HDCALL.TAB.

1   INTRODUCTION

As part of the investigation by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) into the
incident at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough stadium on 15
April 1989, Mr A L Collins, a Scientific Officer, and Mr D Waterhouse, a
Principal Scientific Officer, of HSE's Research and Laboratory Services
Division (RLSD) calculated the maximum number of persons (the capacity) that
was appropriate for Pens 3 and 4, The calculations were based on their
interpretation of recommendations contained within the Home Office/Scottish
Office publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (H M Stationery Office:
1986).


2 ESTIMATIONS OF THE CAPACITIES OF PENS 3 AND 4

Dr Nicholson, a Deputy Director of RLSD's Safety Engineering Laboratory (SEL)
provided us with a drawing that he had received from Eastwood and Partners on
24 April 1989. The drawing was labelled Eastwood and Partners, was numbered
8945/1A, had the title "Sheffield Wednesday F.C. PLC Hillsborough Ground
Layout 1987" and was dated 16/4/87 with Revision A dated 21/10/87. This
drawing showed the capacity of one of the two central 'pens' of the West
terraces of the stadium to be 1,200 persons and that of the other to be 1,000
persons, i.e. the capacity of the combined area w a s -2,200 persons.

The interim report IR/L/ME/MM/89/1 prepared by RLSD for the Court of Inquiry
states that, "if 54 people per 10 sq m is assumed as the allowable packing
density for the West Terrace then the capacity of Pen 3 is 1015 and Pen 4 is
1036 making a total of 2051 for the combined area".

However, Paragraph 221 of the 1986 edition of the Home Office/Scottish Office
publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (H M Stationary Office) states
"Where crush barriers meet the strength and spacing guidelines of Chapter 9
the capacity of a terrace or viewing slope should be assessed from the area
available for standing by allowing a packing density of between 54 and 27
persons per 10 square metres depending upon the condition of the terrace or
slope".

We knew that RLSD's calculation had been made as a preliminary check of the
capacity assigned by Eastwood & Partners to the two central 'pens'. We
therefore examined two drawings that had been prepared for HSE by Ralph Brade
& Associates, Consulting Engineers, Midland Bank Chambers, 3 Sharrow Lane,
Sheffield. Drawing No 1340/02 Rev A, dated 3/5/89, showed a plan view of
Pens 3 and 4 on the West terraces and Drawing No 1340/03A Rev A, also dated
3/5/89, showed a section through part of the West terraces. These drawings are
reproduced, to a smaller scale, in Figs 1 and 2 respectively.

Our examination of these drawings caused us conclude that RLSD's nominal
maximum capacity 2051 persons for the central 'pens' might have to be reduced
to compensate for some departures from the recommendations of Chapter 9 of the
Guide. We therefore calculated capacities for Pens 3 and 4 on the      basis of the
areas behind crush barriers and perimeter fences in which a crowd packing
density of 5.4 persons/sq m would be permissible, provided all other aspects
of the terraces conformed with the Guide's recommendations.
3   METHOD OF CALCULATING THE REVISED MAXIMUM CAPACITIES OF PENS 3 AND 4

The calculation of the revised maximum capacity of Pens 3 and 4 was based on
our interpretation of Paragraph 113, Paragraph 225, and Table 1 of the Guide.

Paragraph 113 states: "Ideally, crush barriers should be provided along the
full width of a terrace, with gaps only at radial gangways".

Paragraph 225 states "The capacity of the terrace is calculated by multiplying
the area available for standing by the appropriate packing density. The
following following formula may be used:

                                A
Capacity (Number of persons) - -- x (27 to 54)
                                10

where 'A' is the area available for standing in square metres.

Table 1 recommends the maximum horizontal distance that should exist between
barriers conforming to the "greater" and the "lesser" strength requirements
when they are installed on "peak viewing areas" and on "other areas". We
classified Pens 3 and 4 as being 'peak viewing' areas because they were
behind a goal, and the barriers as conforming to the "greater strength
requirement" because this permitted greater horizontal distances.

Pens 3 and 4 did not have radial gangways, nor did their crush barriers extend
the full width of the terraces, gaps being present along the rows. We
therefore calculated the plan area of terrace behind each barrier (or
perimeter fence) by multiplying the length of the barrier by a 'permissible
depth' behind it. This 'permissible depth' was either the maximum horizontal
distance between barriers that was recommended for "peak viewing" in Column A
of Table 1 of the Guide, or the existing distance between the barrier and the
next barrier (or wall) behind it, whichever was the least.

Brade's Drawing No 1340/03A showed the slope of Pens 3 and 4 to be 13 degrees
40 minutes. The recommended maximum horizontal distance between crush barriers
that corresponded to this slope was interpolated from Table 1 of the Guide as
being 3.9 m. Brade's Drawing No 1340/02 Rev A showed that the horizontal
distance between the rows of crush barriers in Pens 3 and 4 was usually 3.5 m,
i.e. the existing distance between the rows of crush barriers was usually
within the recommended maximum value.

The heights of the barriers were generally less than the values of 1.02 m to
1.12 m recommended in the Guide. However, we did not discount any of the crush
barriers in our calculations; no barrier had a height less than 81% of the
minimum recommended value, and our intention was to calculate a 'base'
capacity that could be further reduced because of other departures from the
Guide's recommendations.

We multiplied each plan area behind a barrier (sq m) by 5.4 persons/sq m and
truncated the product to obtain the number of persons appropriate to each
area. Fig 3 is a pictorial representation of the method of calculation, the
details of which are shown in Appendix 1. The total capacities of Pens 3 and 4
were then obtained by summing the numbers of persons appropriate to each area
behind a barrier. Our calculations showed the capacity of Pen 3 to be 822
persons and that of Pen 4 to be 871 persons, i.e. the combined capacity of the
central 'pens' was 1,693 persons.
4   ASSESSMENT OF REVISED CAPACITIES

The white areas of Fig 3 represent those parts of the terrace where, ideally,
persons should not stand, otherwise the thrust exerted on part of a crush
barrier by a crowd of 5.4 persons/sq m might exceed the force intended by the
Guide.

Our calculations did not include any reduction in capacity of the central
'pens' to compensate for departures from other recommendations contained in
the Guide. Brade's drawings indicated that departures from Paragraphs in the
Guide, other than those associated with the continuity (Paragraph 113) and
spacing (Table 1) of crush barriers, existed in the central 'pens', i.e.

Paragraph 92      - "A terrace step should not be less than 280 mm or more than
380 mm wide.      The preferred dimension is between 355 mm and 380 mm".  Pens 3
and 4 had 33      terrace steps, of which 28 (85%) were slightly wider, (not more
than 10 m m ) ,   than the maximum recommended w i dth .

Paragraph 96 - "The aim should be to ensure that every spectator on the
terraces is within 12 metres of a gangway or exit so that spectators can move
quickly on to exit routes at the end of an event or in the event of an
emergency. This may be achieved by a pattern of gangways (not less than
1.1 metres wide) linked to the exit system". There were no gangways in Pens 3
and 4 and if the perimeter gates are not considered as exits, then
approximately 40% of the persons in these 'pens' were not within 12 m of an
exit.

Paragraph 110 - "In order to locate the top rail against that part of the body
most able to tolerate pressure the heights of crush barriers should be 1.02 m
to 1.12 m above the nosing of the step immediately behind the barrier, with a
preferred height of 1.1m" . Four of the five barriers in Pen 3 and six of the
nine barriers in Pen 4 did not conform with this recommendation.

Paragraph 114 - " Where barriers are not continuous between radial gangways,
the alignment of gaps in successive rows of barriers on a terrace should form
an angle of less than 60 degrees to the line of the barriers. There should be
no more than 2 consecutive gaps in any line of gaps". Two of the four 'paths
of gaps' in Pen 3 and one of the eleven 'paths of gaps' in Pen 4 did not
conform with the recommendation on alignment.

Paragraph 115 - " Where there are gaps in the line of crush barriers these
should be at least 1.1 m and not more than 1.4 m in width". Four of five gaps
in Pen 3 did not conform and nine of ten gaps in Pen 4 did not conform to a
literal interpretation of this recommendation. A more liberal interpretation,
relating the acceptability of the width of a gap to the resulting depth of
crowd that could form between two rows of barriers, resulted in four of five
gaps in Pen 3 and three of six gaps in Pen 4 not conforming, as shown in the
schematic plan of Fig 4.

Paragraph 215 - "For most major stadia, whether used for association football
or other sports, the pitch perimeter fence will be required either to prevent
access to parts of the pitch as mentioned above (Paragraph 214), or at least
to discourage attempts by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates or other
access points (minimum width of 1.1 m) should nevertheless be provided for use
in an emergency and, at those grounds where a perimeter track is used as part
of the exit system, for the departure of spectators at the end of an event.
Provision of such gates or access points is particularly important to allow
for access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a
place of safety in an emergency. Such gates or access points should be
properly stewarded and clearly marked so that immediate access to the playing
area or perimeter track can be ensured". The gate to Pen 3 had a clearance
width of 0.81 m to 0.82 m and the gate to Pen 4 had a clearance width of
0.77 m to 0.79 m. The two gates in the perimeter fence of the central 'pens'
therefore did not conform with this recommendation.

It is our opinion that it might be advisable to reduce the 'base' capacities
of 822 persons for Pen 3 and 871 persons for Pen 4, because of these six
departures from the Guide's recommendations.


5   SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

5.1 We used recommendations contained within the 1986 edition of the Home
Office/Scottish Office publication "Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds" (the
Guide) to calculate revised maximum allowable capacities for Pens 3 and 4 of
the West terraces of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's Hillsborough stadium.
We calculated the maximum allowable capacity of Pen 3 to be 822 persons, and
that of Pen 4 to be 871 persons. It is therefore our opinion that the combined
maximum allowable capacity of the two central 'pens' should      not exceed 1,693
persons, provided that all other aspects of the terraces conformed with the
Guide's recommendations.

5.2 Our calculations showed the capacity of Pen 3 to be less than that of
Pen 4. Eastwood & Partners Drawing No 8945/lA dated 16/4/87 showed The
capacity of Pen 3 to be greater than that of Pen 4.

5.3 Our revised maximum allowable      combined capacity of 1,693 persons for the
two central 'pens' was 83% of that     initially calculated by RLSD, solely on the
basis of the area of Pens 3 and 4,     and was 77% of that shown on Eastwood &
Partners Drawing No 8945/lA, dated     16/4/87.

5.4 Our calculation of the revised capacities of Pens 3 and 4 did not include
any reduction that might be needed to compensate for some departures from the
Guide's recommendations in these 'pens'. These departures were associated
with:

(i)     the   width of the terrace steps.
(ii)    the   distance of persons from gangways or exits;
(iii)   the   heights of crush barriers;
(iv)    the   alignment of gaps in the rows of crush barriers;
(v)     the   width of gaps in the rows of crush barriers;
(vi)    the   width of the gates in the perimeter fence;

It is our opinion that the revised number of 1,693 persons for the maximum
combined capacity of Pens 3 and 4 should be reduced further because of these
six departures from the Guide's recommendations.

Summary


Following suggestions that the condition of the perimeter wall, adjacent to Gate ’C ’,
may be relevant to the Hillsborough enquiry, a detailed examination of the wall and
parapet walls over the Leppings Lane turnstiles was made. The survey was
subsequently extended to cover the remainder of the perimeter walls. The wall in
question was found to be distorted and lacking in lateral stability and could be
made to sway when pushed by hand. The parapet walls over the turnstiles were found
to be dilapidated with a loose pier, loose copings and loose/broken infill railings.
Other than these parts of the perimeter the remainder was in a generally adequate
condition, subject to minor repairs and pointing. Recorrmendations are made
regarding the remedial works considered necessary to ensure the integrity, safety
and effectiveness of the wall and parapets over the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane
entrance to the ground.

1.   WALL BETWEEN GATE 'C' AND SOUTH STAND AT SOUTH WEST CORNER OF GROUND

     1.1 The wall is approximately 71 m (233 ft) long, stretching from Gate 'C'
     to the brick building housing turnstile 19 adjacent to Gate 'D'. The wall is
     not perfectly straight but has a slight curve on plan, being concave when
     viewed from outside the ground, and having an oblique corner at a distance of
     46.8 m from Gate 'C'.

     1.2   It is constructed from 230 mm (9 inches) brickwork, laid in black mortar,
     to a type of Flemish garden wall bond with alternate header/stretchers in
     every sixth course. The rear, or inner, face of the wall is reinforced with
     700 mm x 115 mm (27*5 inches x 4H inches) buttresses at approximately 7 m (23 ft)
     centres. The wall is capped with a precast concrete coping approximately 75 mm
     (3 inches) high and the height to the underside of the coping varies from
     2.36 m (7 ft 9 inches) to 2.98 m (9 ft 9 inches). It is constructed on sloping
     ground and the height varies in steps along its length.

     1.3   Mild steel angle brackets, curved outwards and carrying three strands of
     barbed wire, are bolted to the top external face of the wall. Some of these
     were loose and all were rusty and dilapidated.

     1.4    The wall is distorted and bowed along its length and is also out of
     plumb, leaning inwards over parts of its length and outwards over other parts
      (see Table 1, Photographs 1-4).   The maximum deflection out of plumb is
     100 mm (4 inches) leaning outwards. No damp-proof course appears to have been
     provided when the wall was constructed and the mortar near the base has eroded
     and weathered due to damp and frost action. Both faces have been repointed in
     cement mortar in the past but the original black mortar can be seen where the
     pointing has deteriorated.    It is not known upon what type of foundation the
     wall is constructed. However, the base of the stretch between the comer and
     Gate 'D' shows stepped brickwork at the base and it is possible that this is
     the top of a stepped brick foundation.

     1.5   There was some diagonal cracking in the wall at a distance of 40 m from
     Gate 'C' and again at 50 m, the latter extending for the full height of the
     wall. In addition there were areas of loose brickwork at the top of the wall,
     and in places the concrete coping was weathered and cracked, particularly
     where the top of the wall was stepped (see Photographs 5-8).

     1.6   It was found that the wall could be made to sway and oscillate when
     pushed. For example, when pushed near the comer, some 40 m from Gate 'C',
     the wall swayed and a wave travelled to the end such that the lamp pillar
     bolted to the wall near Gate 'C' could be seen to sway and shake. Similarly,
     if Gate 'C' was pushed the adjacent wall was found to shake due to the bolted
     connections between the gatepost and the end of the wall.

     1.7 Advice was given that the wall was significantly distorted, had failed
     as a structure and was unsafe. It was considered to be liable to topple during
     high winds, or if set oscillating by crowd pressure. Consequently it was
     considered that it should be either taken down and reconstructed or stabilized
     by buttressing or other equally effective means.
BRICK PARAPET WALLS AND INFILL RAILINGS OVER TURNSTILE BUILDINGS AT
IEPPINGS LANE ENTRANCE

2.1    The perimeter of the ground between gates A-C at the Leppings Lane end
is enclosed by single-storey buildings housing turnstiles 1-16 and A-G. The
outer face of the buildings has a 230 mm (9 inches) brick parapet wall
surmounted by brick piers with an infill of ornamental cast iron railings
 (see Photographs 17-20). As the railings do not present a barrier to cliirbing,
but rather the reverse as they provide hand-holds, the effective height of the
wall is 3.43 m (11 ft 3 inches) ie to the bottom of the railings.

2.2    The parapet walls, piers and railings are generally dilapidated with
loose and spalling brickwork in places, loose and broken sections of railing
and loose coping stones on top of the brick piers (see Photographs 10-16).
The 230 mm x 345 mm (9 inches x 13*5 inches) brick pier adjacent to Gate 'C'
has become detached from the wall and is displaced (Photographs 9 and 10).
The end of the infill railing is fixed to the pier but the opposite end of the
railing is only loosely held by the next pier (Photograph 11). As a result the
pier and attached railing are loose and can easily be rocked by hand. They are
held in position by the wooden post of a large notice board which is positioned
diagonally across the corner of the turnstile building (see Photograph 9).
However, the effect of a nuirber of people using the railing as a hand-hold to
cliirb over the wall could be sufficient to pull the railings and pier over
onto the crowd below. The coping belonging to the brick pier above turnstile
16, adjacent to Gate 'B' was lying on the ground adjacent to the exit from the
turnstiles (Photograph 20).

2.3   As can be seen from the Photographs, the front of the turnstile building
does not provide an effective barrier against determined assault. The fixed
guide barrier adjacent to Turnstile 'G' provides a convenient foothold and the
parapet railings a hand-hold (Photographs 17 and 19). Similarly, the panelled
gate adjacent to Turnstile 16, together with its stay and wall brackets,
provided convenient means of scaling the wall (Photographs 17 and 18). The cast
iron railings are, in fact, broken in two at this point (Photograph 18).

2.4   In view of the general condition of the parapet wall, brick piers and
railings, and their failure to provide an effective barrier, it is reconmended
that consideration be given to dismantling and reconstruction of the parapet
as a solid barrier of sufficient height to deter climbers.

NORTHERN PERIMETER WALL
3.1   The northern perimeter comprises a 230 mm (9 inches) thick brick wall,
approximately 2 m high, surmounted by a mesh fence to a total height of 4.3 m.
The perimeter forms the rear boundary of the houses fronting Vere Road and thus
has no access by the general public. It is generally in satisfactory condition
and is not considered likely to give rise to any hazards.

REMAINDER OF PERIMETER WALLING

4.1   The remainder of the perimeter walling is generally provided by the outer
walls of buildings, such as turnstiles, the south stand etc and there are no
other substantial lengths of freestanding wall.
     4.2   There were some relatively minor defects noted that required remedial
     action and these are listed below.

            (i)   The brickwork above turnstiles 35/36 and the return wall
           behind the turnstile building required inspection and repointing.

           (ii)   The screen wall to the toilets behind turnstile 43 requires
           repairs to the brickwork at the top of the wall.

           (iii)   The parapet wall above turnstiles 82-88 requires repointing.

5.   CONCLUSIONS

     5.1   The North,South and East perimeter walls of the ground appear to be
     adequate apart from the relatively minor defects noted above.

     5.2   The freestanding wall at the South West corner, between Gate 'C' and
     turnstiles 19-22 is distorted, has inadequate lateral stability for its
     height and is unsafe and liable to topple if subjected to wind or crowd
     pressure. As recommended earlier it should be taken down and reconstructed,
     suitably buttressed or stabilized by other equally effective measures.
     Whatever course is adopted the wall should be upgraded to meet modern design
     loading criteria for sportsgrounds.

     5.3   The parapet walls and infill railings surmounting the turnstile building
     1-16 and A-G, between Gates A-C at the Leppings Lane end of the ground are
     generally dilapidated and in poor condition. In addition, the adjacent barrier
     and gate and the infill railings provide hand and foot-holds facilitating
     climbing and unauthorised entry to the ground. I consider that this parapet
     walling should be taken down to sound brickwork and reconstructed as a solid
     barrier to a height that will effectively prevent unauthorised access.

Summary


Examination of turnstiles A-G confirmed that although old, somewhat worn and in many
cases in need of lubrication/routine maintenance etc all were working satisfactorily
and would each allow at least 20 persons per minute throughput.

Data on load/pedal release pressure tests, throughput and computer count tests are
the subject of a separate RLSD report.

SUBJECT:     EXAMINATION OF TURNSTILES A-G
USER:        SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH, SHEFFIELD

INTRODUCTION



I visited the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club ground during the week commencing

the 24th of April 1989 to continue investigations at your request and in accordance

with the wishes of the judicial enquiry team headed by Justice Taylor.



I was present on site between the 24th and 28th of April with the exception of

Thursday the 27th of April and on each occasion I was accompanied by Mr C J Pertee,

Principal Specialist Inspector, Construction Engineering, North East FCG.      During

the week I examined turnstiles 17-23 (A-G) and this report contains the results of

this examination.



TURNSTILES



The general layout of the 7 turnstiles A-G which feed the west terrace at the football

ground is shown in Fig. 1 of my earlier report NE/FCG 14/M/18/89 and details are

confirmed in Messrs Ralph Braid & Associates drawing no. 1340/Q^.
A general view of the turnstiles from the approach side is shewn in Fig. 2 and from

the egress side in Fig. 3.



All the turnstiles were of considerable age and were noted to have been manufactured

by Messrs W D Ellison & Co Ltd, Irlam, Manchester.    Details of the turnstiles and

their method of operation are shewn in the makers trade literature at Appendix 1.



All the turnstiles were of the low pattern type and turnstiles A, C, D, E, F and G

were fitted with convex arms.     Turnstile B was fitted with straight arms.



I took detailed dimensions in all the turnstile enclosures and assisted with

functional tests of each unit.



All the turnstile ratchets were working satisfactorily and although worn, all the

foot pedals and footstep motion cams were working correctly.      Some of the lower

mechanisms were in need of lubrication, however, this did not prevent the mechanisms

from operating satisfactorily and allowing at least 20 persons per minute to pass

through each turnstile.



I noted the patent nuirfoers on the tumstil^j which were shown as 658191 and 658226

and were marked on several of the mechanical counter cover plates.      The serial

nuntoers were also marked in this area but were only present on turnstile C (serial

no. 14038), turnstile D (serial no. 13263) and turnstile G (serial no. 14039).



1 noted that all the doors at the front of the turnstile enclosure were approximately

0.63 m (25 inches) wide and the opening widths were between 465 nm and 555 nm

 (18.3 inches and 21.8 inches).     The heights of the openings were approximately

2 m (79 inches).
The passageways through each turnstile were approximately 2 m (6 ft 9 inches) long

and 0.5 m (20 inches) wide.    The ceiling height in each passageway was

approximately 2.25 m (7 ft 5 inches).



The height of the turnstile tables was approximately 1.04 m (3 ft 5 inches).    The

heights of the turnstile arms and their lower skirt plates etc and the gaps between

the ends of the arms and adjacent walls in individual passageways are shown in

Table 1.



Vertical blocks of wood were secured to the walls at the entry side of the

turnstiles in all except passageway C where a box had been constructed on the wall

opposite the centre of the turnstile spindle.     All blocks of wood in turnstiles

except C were approximately 14 cm x 14 cm x 61 cm long (5.5 inches x 5.5 inches x

2 ft long) which were positioned with their lower ends approximately 38 cm (15 inches)

above floor level and their central axis approximately 30 cm (one foot) forward of

the turnstile axis.



The box mounted on the wall opposite the rotating arms of turnstile C was 46 cm

(18 inches) long on its front face and 61 cm (2 ft) long on its rear face.     The

box was 24 cm (9.5 inches) deep and projected from the wall by approximately 10 cm

(4 inches). The top face of this box was approximately level with the top face of

the turnstile arm.    (See Fig. 6).



Additional wooden blocks were also fitted on the walls opposite the turnstile arms

in passageways A and B only.    These blocks were mounted on the turnstile side of

the aforementioned vertical wooden blocks and had curved form varying from

7.5 cm (3 inches) thickness at the ingress end to 9.5 cm (3.75 inches) thickness at

a point opposite the turnstile axis centre.     These blocks were approximately 49 cm

 (19.25 inches) long and 14 cm (5.5 inches) deep and reduced the gap at the end of
the turnstile arm to approximately 2.5 cm (one inch).



Photographs of turnstiles A to G taken from the egress side show the aforementioned

features together with the respective footstep cams and pedal counterweights etc.

(See Figures 4-10).



I removed several of the foot pedals from the turnstiles and two of these from

units B and C are shown in Figs. 11 and 12 respectively.



Pedal return action was achieved by a counterweight mounted on the respective arm,

these weights can be seen in Figs. 11 and 12.



OTHER OBSERVATIONS



During my examination of the turnstiles I noted that an electronic counting system

had been installed and that duplicate switching arrangements were present on the

majority of the units.



Small roller type limit switches were noted in positions immediately above the

central boss carrying the turnstile arm adjacent to the main rotating shaft.     These

switches were arranged such that they would be actuated at each quarter turn of

the turnstile.   The central switches at units C, D and E were the only ones

connected.



Additional rat-tail switches were seen to have been positioned on the wooden frames

at the egress side of the turnstile block and were actuated at each indexing motion

by the respective turnstile arm.   However, these switches were disconnected and

had broken tails at turnstiles C, D and E, they appeared to be connected and
functioning correctly at the other turnstiles A, B, F and G.



load/pedal resistance testing and throughput rate testing of the turnstiles together

with checks on the mechanical and computer counting systems are the subject of a

separate RLSD report.



It was also noted that photoelectric emitters and sensors had been arranged in pairs

across each turnstile passageway at positions above the turnstile arms as well as at

table level at the egress side.   Examination of these devices indicated that many

had been either removed or disconnected and in some cases the wiring had been cut.

The latter was noted on the over/turnstile sensors at units C and F.



CONCLUSIONS



Examinations of turnstiles A-G confirmed that although old, somewhat worn and in many

cases in need of lubrication/routine maintenance etc.    all were working

satisfactorily and would each allow at least 20 persons per minute throughput.



Data and load/pedal release pressure tests, throughput      and computer count tests

are the subject of a separate RLSD report.



RECOMMENDATIONS



It is recorrmended that the gaps between turnstile arms and adjacent walls should be

reduced to the minimum practicable safe dimension in order to prevent persons

gaining access without actuating the turnstile mechanism.



 In my opinion the over/tumstile photoelectric devices should be reinstated to detect

 persons clinking over without actuating the mechanism, alternatively, full height
turnstiles (floor to ceiling) should be installed.



Where necessary, individual turnstiles should be repaired at their broken table

supporting pillars in order to improve rigidity and several of the units required

re-levelling.



End float in all the turnstile spindles should be checked and adjusted accordingly

as many exhibited approximately 4 nm lift.



All ratchets, pedal mechanisms and cams should be suitably lubricated at appropriate

intervals.

     INTRODUCTION

     I visited the Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground on the 16th, 17th and 18th of
     April 1989 at the request of Mr S Nattrass, Area Director, H & SE, South Yorkshire
     & Humberside Area following the tragedy which occurred on the 15th of April 1989.

     The initial purpose of my visit was to assist in investigating the incident with
     particular reference to the crush barriers.

     Other members of H & SE staff present during the first 3 days of the site
     investigation are shown on the attached list.

     During the visits I spoke to Mr D Perchon (Director - Health & Consumer Services,
     Sheffield MBC), Mr P Jackson (SEHO, Sheffield MBC) and Mr M Ford (EHO, Sheffield
     MBC) .

     Mr W Eastwood and Mr R Eastwood of Messrs Eastwood & Partners, Kingfield Road,
     Sheffield were also present on site on the 17th of April 1989 and conducted a nuinber
     of tests on the crush barriers which were witnessed.

     CRUSH BARRIERS

|    Two types of barrier were seen in the central area, the older type having half 'A'
     frames embedded in the concrete steps were reported to have been installed in 1966.

      New types of barrier utilizing steel box section support pillars had been installed
       at several locations and again the pillars were embedded in the concrete steps.
      Both types of barriers carried horizontal tubular type handrails of between 60 and
       75 mm diameter. In general the spacing across each handrail between vertical
^ __ • supports was pf the order of 1.23 m (7 ft 6 inches). Barrier heights varied
.'    between O.83 and 1.l5^m and thi~corresponding details for each barrier in the
       central pen are given-in Table 1 and on Ralph Brade & Associates drawing No.1340/02.

     Barrier height recommended by the Code of Practice 'Guide to safety at Sports Grounds
     should be a minimum of 1.02 metres with a preferred height of 1.1 metres.
                                             1
A site plan and end elevation is shown in Fig. 1 which also indicates spacings
between barriers etc and confirms the position of the two sections which collapsed
at barrier no. 124A. Similar details are also included in Ralph Brade & Associates
Drawing No. 1340/02.
A sectional view of the entry/exit tunnel is shown in Fig. 2.and in Ralph Brade &
Associates Drawing No. 1340/03.
A general view of the collapsed section of barrier 124A is shown in Fig. 3 where
it can be seen that both of the horizontal tubes had been severely bent prior to
the bending over and collapse of the leg supports. The bottom ends of the latter
had remained in position in the ground although the right hand front column at the
end of the barrier had broken away a small section of the concrete step.

The failure at the top of the central leg; of this section of barrier designated
124A/1?1is shown in Figs 4 and 4A where it can be seen that the strap has remained
in position although distorted and the rear leg has tom from a point adjacent to
the lower bolt hole. The horizontal tubes which were badly corroded in the areas
underneath each strap at the top of the respective pillars appear to have fractured
after the support pillars have been bent over and although the tube section is
considerably thinned it appears to have been capable of carrying sufficient shear
force at the strap positions to enable the vertical pillars to be bent over under
the pressure generated by the crowd.

An inner view of the top end of the right hand pillar at connection 124A/4 (see
Fig. 5) indicates the extent of corrosion underneath the strap and underneath the
pillar head behind the gusset plate and again confirms the tearing mode of failure
from the inner edge of the rear pillar at the section through the lower bolt hole.
The metal angles forming the legs were nominally 50 mm x 50 mm x 6 mm thickness
(2 inch x 2 inch x 0.25 inches).

The fracture of the tube section from connection 124A/4 is shown in Fig. 6 where
it can be seen that the end of the tube has been bent and approximately half its
section has broken away at the time it separated from the pillar connecting strap.

The tube which was originally in position between connections 124A/2 and 124A/3 is
shown lying on the terrace steps in Fig. 7 and the fractures at the corresponding
ends of this tube are shown in Figs 8 and 9 respectively. The grass at the left
hand side of the fracture in Fig. 8 confirms that the tube was recovered from the
pitch after the incident.

The top of pillar 124A/2 is shown in Fig. 10 where extensive corrosion can again be
seen, particularly at the gusset plate which has corroded through. This connector
had been repaired at some time during its life and it can be seen that a section of
steel tubing had been inserted inside the original tubing. The insert was found
tcTbe 50 inn CD x 35 mm ID and was approximately 127 mm long (2.0 inches CD x
1.375 inches ID x 5 inches long).

BARRIER TESTS

During my visit to the football ground on the 16th of April 1989 I was shown a test
rig used for load testing of the crush barriers underthe supervision of
"MelW Eastwood of Eastwood & Partners, Kingfield Road, Sheffield who were the
Engineering Consultants to the Club and carried out routine tests annually on
barriers at the terraces. A general view of the front section of the test rig is
 shewn in Fig. 11. The front pusher arms of the rig are designed with various
 fulcrum points to enable a single load from each of the main pusher arms to be
distributed to 4 points equally spaced along each section of barrier rail. The
 main pusher arms were driven forward by a pair of hydraulic rams which were
 pressurized from a small hand operated pump unit with calibrated load gauge.
 A copy of a calibration certificate for the test rig is shown at Appendix I.

During testing, the forward load on the barrier was gradually increased to a figure
of 1.4 tons in each of the main pusher arms and simulated a load of 400 lbs/ft run
across the barrier as recommended for class A barriers in the Code of Practice
'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds' at Annex C paragraph 1. The forward deflection
of the barrier rail was measured as shown in Fig. 12 and the tests were conducted
in accordance with the Code of Practice.

The left hand end of barrier 136 in the south west pen adjacent to the central pen
was found to deflect by approximately 16 "mm in the forward "dj^r^cSorT^on application
of the test load. The barrier recovered fully at the end of the test.

Similar tests were performed on barrier 137 in the central pen area and this was
found to deflect by 13 mm on application of the test load (400 lbs/ft run).
Barrier 137 recovered fully at the end of the test.

A further load was applied to this barrier to initiate its failure and at
500 lbs/ft run the deflection was 20 mm which gradually increased to 29 mm. The
barrier recovered to 11 mm and had undoubtedly failed under this load. The
condition of the barrier after this overload test is shown in Fig. 13. Initiation
of fracture/tearing had been produced at the central leg immediately below the
gusset plate and adjacent to the lower of the 2 rivets in the rear section of the
leg as shown in Fig. 14. The commencement of twistina of the leg is shown in
Fig. 15.

Further tests were also carried out on barrier no. 128 which was seen to have
already been damaged. One of its tubes was bent outwards by approximately 55 mm
and was also bent downwards by approximately 25 mm close to its centre. These
tests were again carried out in accordance with the guidance given in the Code of
Practice and at a load of 1.4 tons (400 lbs/ft run) the rail deflected by a further
16 mm and returned to approximately 4 mm. These figures indicate a 75% recovery
as required by the Code of Practice.

The load was then increased to 1.75 tons and later to 2.1 tons where a deflection
of 40 mm was recorded together with a recovery back to 13 mm. This severe over­
load was equivalent to approximately 600 lbs/ft run on the barrier but its recovery
was outside the recommended levels.

CONCLUSICNS/BARRIER TESTING

The barriers tested were seen to meet the load testing requirements of the Code of
Practice 'Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds' Appendix C Para 1 for class 'A' type.
The results of tests carried out in July 1988 on the barriers in the central pen
also confirm that the units in this area met the load test requirements of the
Code of Practice at the time of their last test although barrier 124A did not
recover fully until the third of the 3 tests recommended by the Code of Practice.
(See Appendix II).

SITE DATA

As indicated earlier in the report a site plan to scale is shown in Fig. 1 and a
sectional plan of the entry/exit tunnel is shown in Fig. 2. These details are also
shewn in Ralph Brade & Associates Drawings Nos. 1340/02 & 1340/03 respectively.

I also examined gates 3 and 4 leading from the central terrace area onto the

pitch.   These gates were of similar construction and opened outwards to the

left as viewed from the terrace.



The effective width of the gate openings were found to be 0.81 - 0.82 m

 (32 inches approx) for gate 3 and 0.77 - 0.79 m (30.75 inches approx) for gate 4.

The gaps in the low wall at the gate positions were found to be 1.0 m wide

 (39.4 inches) and the walls were approximately 1.07 m high (42 inches) from the

lowest terrace step.



The effective opening heights at the two gates were found to be 2.11 - 2.16 m

 (83 - 85 inches).



It was noted that the step configurations at the two gates were slightly

different.   Both level concreted approach areas (plinths) commenced at the

third terrace step level but at gate 3, two risers of 0.165 m (6.5 inches)

and 0.22 m (8.6 inches) with an intermedia-ce tread of 0.480 m (19 inches)

were seen.   (See FIGJ16, Negs8!X)4 frOti/O-C). The approach plinth at gate 3 was

found to be 1.185 m (46.75 inches) wide and the step-up from the lowest terrace step

at each side was 0.340 m (13.5 inches high).
                                           1
At gate 4 the level concreted approach area (plinth) again commenced from

step 3 of the terrace and extended forwards to the wall by a distance of

0.86 m (34 inches) to a single step up through the gateway which was 0.340 m

(13.5 inches) high.     The concreted plinth area to gate 4 was 1.125 m (44.25 inches)

wide and the step-up from the lowest terrace step at each side was approximately

0.190 m (7.5 inches).    See FIGS 17 - 19 which confirm the step arrangements at

gate 3 and 4.

PEN CAPACITY



The area of the central pen was approximately 376 square metres and allowing

54 persons per 10 square metres gives a maximum capacity of 2030 persons.     The

rated capacity for the pen was stated at 2200 persons on the drawing of the

site provided by the club.



In view of the variations in barrier openings in the central pen, further

calculations have been made of the pen capacity based on the recommendations        *-■ ^ ^

ik. Para 286 of the Code of Practice.



The total length of barriers in the left-hand side of the pen behind gate 3

including the 14.3 metres of the front fence was approximately 45.5 metres,

giving 45.5 x 3.8 x 5.4 = 934 persons.



The total length of barriers in the right-hand side of the pen behind gate 4

including the 14.4 metres of the front fence was approximately 48.3 metres

giving 48.3 x 3.8 x 5.4 = 991 persons.

                                            2
The revised calculated capacity for the central pen was therefore 934 + 991 = 1925

persons.

Note:-      Please amend figures on page 1 of my report to read



     'Barrier heights varied between 0.83 and 1.15 m ---- '



to comply with the revised data in Table 1.

The site plan indicates that many of the barrier spacings were outside those
recommended by the Code of Practice where it is suggested that gaps between
barriers should not exceed 1.4 m width.

The slope of the terrace was found to be approximately 14 degrees and Table 1 on
page 37 of the Code of Practice recommends a horizontal distance between barriers
in peak viewing areas for the type 'A' barrier of 3.8 m at a terrace gradient of
15 degrees. Examination of the site plan confirms that in general the barriers
were arranged within this figure and consecutive gaps between rows of barriers
were in accordance with Fig. 3 on page 36 of the Code except at the areas immediately
in front of the entry/exit tunnel area.

Steps on the terraces were found to be approximately 75 mm depth with 380mm treads.
These were within the limits laid down in the Code of Practice.

CONCLUSIONS/TERRACE LAYOUT

The spacingof the barriers and gaps between barriers did not fully comply with the
recommendations laid down in the Code of Practice 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds'. The areas giving rise for concern were those directly in front of the
entry/exit tunnel which was seen to have a down gradient of approximately 10 degrees
for a distance of some 8 - 10 m leading to the terrace doorway openings.

PEN CAPACITY

The area of the central pen was approximately 373 square metres and allowing 54
persons per 10 square metres gives a maximum capacity of 201^persons. The rated
capacity for the pen was stated at 2200 persons on the drawing of the site provided
by the Club.

RECOMMENDATIONS

If the area is to be re-used as terracing it is recommended that a full site survey
of the whole of this terrace and the other terrace at the opposite end of the
football stadium should be made by a competent authority.

Where necessary, it is recommended that barrier heights should be increased slightly
in order to comply with the guidance set out in the Code of Practice 'Guide to’
Safety at Sports Grounds' and any barriers which are found to be suspect should be
either strengthened or replaced with barriers of the new design. The latter should
preferably be fitted with flat or box section top rails which should be of the order
of 100 mm vertical deoth. Barriers heights should be a minimum of 1.02 metres with
a preferred height of 1.1 metres.
Where necessary the spacing of barriers should be adjusted to suit the
recommendations given in the Code of Practice and additional barriers should be
provided across the entry/exit tunnel opening area.

The arrangements for the control of spectators in the area between the turnstiles
and the tunnel to ensure that the capacity of the central pen does not exceed the
rated capacity should be reviewed and amended accordingly. In my opinion the
capacity of this section should be reduced and at least be rounded off to the
nearest hundred below the calculated capacity.
FUTURE ACTION

You may wish to arrange confirmation of the above recommendations with the Football
Club via the H & SE Area Staff and the Local Authority as soon as the official
enquiry is completed and if the terrace is to remain, most certainly before it is
re-used.

It is anticipated that metallurgical work and an engineering assessment of the
design and strength of the failed barrier will be undertaken by H & SE RLSD staff
in due course. This work will be the subject of a separate report.

HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - CROWD DENSITIES AND PRESSURES


1     Further to my note of the 1 May.           I have been able to make some progress with
     my enquiries and discuss these below.


A    The capacity of the terraces
2     In correspondence obtained from Dr Eastwood it appears from his report to the
     directors of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd and from the application he
     made on their behalf for a safety certificate dated 12/1/79 and 17/1/79, he
     proposed that the numbers of persons using the Leppings Lane terraces should
     be restricted to 7,200.      This is 10% less than the maximum that could be
     allowed in the area using the Green Guide figure of 54 persons to 10 sq m.
     The 10% being deduced because there were no gangways within the terrace area.


3    The rough figures used to calculate the area of the terraces to obtain the
      crowd capacity are also on the file and from these it is possible to plot on
     drawing 1610/64E the area that was considered in making these proposals.              This
      is the drawing I have been given as showing the current position of the
     terrace capacity.     This drawing indicates that the total capacity of the same
     areas of terraces referred to in the January 1979 correspondence is still
      7,200.


4     From drawing 1510/64E the areas of the pens and the numbers of persons who
      could use them at 54 persons per 10 sq m less 10%, are shown in the table
     below together with the capacities given on drawing 1610/64E.


                                                                                 Numbers given
                                                                                 on drwg 1610/64E

    S.W. corner pen              532.6 sq m             x 5.4 x 0.9 = 2588              2600

    Central pen                   198.8 sq m(190.8)           "      966(927)    )
                                                                                 )total 2200
    Central pen                   201.6 sq m(192.4)           "      979(935)    )

    N.W. end pen                  322     sq m                "     1564                1500

    N.W.    (lower) corner pen    206.7 sq m                  "     1004                 800

    Total                        1461.7                             7101(7018)          7200
5    The difference in the area from that given in the correspondence and that
     worked out from the drawing in the above table is partly accounted for by the
      corridor now in place between the central pens and the NW pen.        From drawing
      1610/64E this has an area of 26.6 sq m.


 6    It should also be noted that the calculated areas of the central pens have
     not been reduced to deduct the areas at the mouth of the tunnel hatched on
     site in yellow.    Presumably this area is so marked to keep it clear of
     spectators.    Therefore the figures in brackets in the table would be the
     areas if this hatched section of terrace was ignored.


7    From the table it can be seen that the capacities of the two central pens has
     been overestimated by nearly 12% on       the basis of Dr Eastwood's original
     figures (or 18% if the hatched area       is deducted).   However the basis of these
     original figures, particularly the 10% arbitrary reduction, is questionable.


8    Advice given in the Green Guide and also apparently reinforced at a seminar
     given by the Home Office when the Guide was launched in 1972, is that those
     barriers which do not meet the Guide standard should be ignored when
     calculating the area available for viewing.       Although the Green Guide
     only mentions spacing and strength in this respect, Mr Stickley says he
     included references to height in his seminar.


9    On terraces which slope at around 15°, as at the Leppings Lane end terraces,
     and where the barriers have been tested to the 6 KN/m proof load, then an
     area extending 3.8 m max behind the barrier should be used in the
     calculation.


10   Working from the Ralph Brade and Associates drawing 1340/02, the drawing of
     their survey of the central terraces, this shows many barriers are far below
     the Green Guides recommended height       of 1.02 - 1.1 m.   If those barriers which
     are lower than 0.92 m high are ignored i.e. allowing barriers up to 100         mm
      low by Green Guide standard, the usable terrace are is 119.51 sq m and
      135.14 sq m which at the full 54 persons/10 sq m would only allow 645 and
      729 persons respectively to use the terraces.


11   Therefore by generously applied criteria, using the Green Guide as a basis,
     the designated numbers were 60% more than those which could be regarded as



                                           2
(


         acceptable even when considerable latitude had been given.   For instance if
         only those barriers which meet the Green Guide recommendations were used in
         this calculation, the allowable numbers of persons able to use the central
         terraces would drop to 389 and 540.


    12   A search through the correspondence may throw more light on how the
         designated numbers were chosen and accepted, and on why other barriers were
         installed at later dates as shown in the revision notes on drawing 1610/64E.


    13   It is probable that a member of the Safety Committee attended the Home Office
         Seminar in 1972 referred to in para 16 and should therefore have been quite
         clear how the Green Guide was to be applied even though the Guide itself is a
         little ambiguous.   I hope to obtain the delegate list of those who attended

         the Seminar.


    14   It is clear that some barriers have been removed from the central pens   over
         the last 10 years when Dr Eastwood made his original proposals.   If left in
         place some of these could have increased the area calculated in paras 9, 10
         and 11, which could be designated for spectators.   Further searches will have
         to be made to find out their detail and the history of their removal.


    15   All which I have said above assumes that the barriers are perfectly adequate
         to carry their loads, and ignores the effect of connecting a downward sloping
         tunnel, of the length noted at Hillsborough, directly into the terraces.


    16 From conversations we have had so far with Dr Eastwood I query whether     the
         test procedures used, could categorically guarantee the reliability of the
         barriers.   That is whether the tests would pick up all the weaknesses in the

         barrier.


    17   It appears that the test procedure was only nominally as required by the
         Green Guide i.e. in loading the barriers three times.   I do not believe at
         the moment this would be very significant, as the required procedure seems a
         little excessive.   However as an indication of the state of affairs, it seems
         that Dr Eastwood and his staff thought they were implicitly following the
         Guide.

(
    18    The procedure as I presently understand it, could have resulted in the end
          frame in bay 1, not being measured for permanent deflection.   (See the notes
          of my telephone conversation with Dr Eastwood, 5/6/89 in reply to
          question 3).


    B    The recommendatons of the Green Guide in respect of the barriers and
         crowd densities
    19    I have had discussions with Brian Stickley of the Home Office Prison Service.
         He is the structural Engineer who worked out the structural provisions in the
         Green Guide and is probably the most informed person about what was intended
         to be in it and what research or other information was available as a basis
         for those provisions.


    20   Mr Stickley clearly believed that both the provisions of the Green Guide were
         exceeded and had they been complied with, then the number of injuries could
         have been greatly reduced, if not avoided altogether.   The basis of this
         comment was not just that the designated crowd densities were too high
         because of the position, number and height of the barriers, but also that the
         Guide's recommendations on stewarding were not followed.   Clearly a huge
         influx of fans down the tunnel, whatever the level of occupancy of the
         terraces, was potentially hazardous.


    21   However there are certain inconsistancies with his comments.    Mr Stickley has
         agreed that many of the provisions of the Guide are vague, almost ambiguous.
          (This is further discussed in Appendix 'A' giving abstracts from the Guide
         with comments).   He stated that this was deliberate because there are so many
         grounds with widely different characteristics that it would be impossible to
         give definitive clauses without either unnecessarily penalising some and
         being too lenient with others.   However it was expected in the Guide that the
         engineer working for the club would use the background philosophies from the
         Guide and relate these to any particular ground.   Hence when the Guide was
         launched in 1972 a seminar was organised by the Home Office for members of
         the safety committees, in which Mr Stickley explained how the engineering
         provisions of the Guide should be applied, in particular how to work out the
         safe number of persons who should use the terraces.


    22   While this may seem reasonable, a problem could have been caused because the
         Green Guide does not clearly describe the difference between its general




                                             4
(
         philosophy and practical provisions       (so much so that those dealing with the
         spacing X height of barriers are not stated as being the absolute minimum).
         It is therefore difficult to see how competent engineers like Dr Eastwood,
         can be criticised too much for not strictly following the Guide or because
         they were too liberal in interpreting its recommendations.


    23   In addition, Mr Stickley is now giving support to the Institution of
         Structural Engineers working party which is writing guidance called the
         'Appraisal of Sports Grounds', expressly to give less ambiguous guidance to
         engineers.   This suggests some degree of recognition of the Green Guide's
         shortcomings.


    24   The references in the Guide to restraining crowd surges suggests that its
         authors considered its recommendations would prevent these.       Although the
         heights of barriers must have a big influence on this, heights are only
         mentioned in para 110.   However the paragraph only proposes its the
         recommended height to enable the body to tolerate the crowd pressure.       There
         are other opportunities to refer to height when discussing crowd safety but
         only position and strength are mentioned e.g. paras 118, 221, 226, 227 and
         the preliminary to Chapter 9.


    25   From the video pictures it is quite clear that there was a considerable
         amount of sway or surge in the crowd.       This seemed to be related to the crowd
         density, layout of the barriers and presumably barrier height.


    26   It is also quite clear that at Hillsborough the barriers failed to break up
         the crowd pressure as recommended in para 21.       However the use of barriers to
         control the exit from an area as recommended in the Guide could allow surges
         in the crowd as the two recommendations may not be compatible.       This
         contradiction also appears in paras 113, and 114, leaving considerable
         discretion to the licensing authorities.


    27 In a similar way the design of a layout to help a crowd to disperse when an
         event finishes may result in increasing crowd pressures where there is a
         sudden ingress of people.   The fanning out philosophy for persons moving in
         one direction can easily form a steadily restricting funnel when they move in
         the opposite way.   In general, ingress will normally be at a trickle so that




                                               5
    the funnelling effect is of little consequence, while egress will nearly
   always be in mass when the fanning out effect is highly desirable.


28 The guide is reasonably firm about the height of the barriers although the
   stress on the idea that it is a "voluntary code" and "should be interpreted"
   at the beginning of tha Guide could weaken the importance of having barriers
   at the correct height.    The Wheatley Report, from which the Guide was drawn,
   expresses the height recommendations much more strongly e.g. the height of
   crush barriers should preferably be 3 ’-6" above the ground".    In all cases
   they should be between 3'-4" and 3'-8"'.    Clause 23.5   'Report of the Inquiry
   into Crowd Safety at Sports Grounds' by the Rt Hon Lord Wheatley.


29 The recommendations concerning height appear to have been determined "In order
   to locate the top rail against that part of the body most able to tolerate
  pressure" (para 110).     There seems some evidence that depending on the density
   of the crowd, a low barrier allows a body to bend over the barrier, passing
   the force it is subjected to, to those in front.     This action could make low
  barriers largely ineffective.


30 The testing of barriers described in Annex "C" fails to make a recommendation
  about the maximum deflection.    Strict interpretation could result in barriers
  that move 1 mm yet fail to recover 0.5 mm being failed, while those that move
   100 mm and recover 75 mm being passed.   Although the examples given are
  extreme they do illustrate that without skilled examination and interpretation
  of the results, the tests could encourage the acceptance of weakened barriers,
  while rejecting others that were satisfactory.      Paragraph 6 of the Annex does
  point out that barriers should be examined if any doubt exists about their
  strength, but the lack of more positive advice could easily lead to a wide
  variety in the quality of barriers across the country.


31 Paragraph 6 of Annex "C" says that detailed investigations should be carried
  out where there was doubt about the safety of the barrier, such as might be
  indicated by the distortion of connections.    Quite a few of the barriers now
  show distortion and I question when this occurred.


32 When referring to the packing density on terraces in para 221, little or no
  guidance is given on the criteria which should be used to govern the variation
  between 27 and 54 persons per 10 sq metres.
33 In the 1946 Hughes   Report on the disaster at Bolten Wanderers Football ground
   a maximum packing density of 6.5 persons per metre was recommended.       This was
   reduced to 5.4 in the Wheatley Report.    Dr Eastwood has suggested that average
   densities of around 8.5 were achieved immediately post war,,which is similar
   to that which must   have occurred on the terraces at Hillsborough.


34 Examination of the   videos appear to show an increasing variation in density
   from the back to the front, while those at the centre of the terrace do not
   appear to be unduly worried by their situation.    Initial estimates from the
   video suggest the density varied from about 6 to 10 or 11 persons per sq
   metre, so that those in the centre were at around 8 persons per sq metre.


35 This raises the question of what are suitable densities?     If 6.4 was
   acceptable in 1946 and 5.4 in 1972, should the Green Guide's criteria be
   revised again?   It might be that people today are generally larger and more
   restless, requiring more space, apart from any trend towards the public
   expecting more comfortable conditions.


Further work

36 The maximum crowd densities for various situations should be more adequately
   researched.   Some work might be possible from the photographs and videos of
   Hillsborough, counting the number of persons in the situations where they are
   obviously a) contented, b) overcrowded and c) in distress.    This work could be
   reinforced by packing people into given areas and counting the number of
  teenagers, women and mature men that will accept various densities.


37 Work should be undertaken to check out suitable heights and construction of
  barriers, in particular measuring the most effective height that will stop or
   suitably reduce a crowd surge.


38 Finally, research should be undertaken into modelling the pressures and
   densities in the crowd at Hillsborough so that alternative layouts can be
   tried out and the most suitable layout of barriers and exits can be
   discovered.   I originally considered that a hydraulic model might be suitable
(

       but having seen the videos, which appear to show a variation in density across
       the terrace, I am now not so sure.   I will try to obtain further advice on
       this.

           pie problem of crowd safety at sports grounds
           is complex and cannot be solved simply by

          terracing, is satisfactory in itself.   The         guide's provisions.
          inter-relation of these and other components
          is essential: none of them can be considered
          in isolation without consideration of its
          effects on the others, and they should all be
          compatible and combine to form a balanced
          unit.

         variety of type, function and layout of
         sports grounds and the inter-relationship of
         the different parts of them means that a
         flexible approach should be maintained to
         take account of the particular circumstances

         Guide does not attempt to set a minimum
         standard which would be acceptable for a

         smaller, scarsely~attended ground; or which
         would be an appropriate standard for the
         latter but insufficient for the former.

8        It should be borne in mind that, when using
         the Guide to assess whether existing
         circumstances provide adequately for the
         safety^of spectators, the criterion to be
         aimed for is that of a reasonable degree of
         safety.  It would be unreasonable. even if it

        it is propsed to retain a high spectator

        accommodate safely such large crowds are
        potentially more extensive.
16        The second type is far more important and
          involves crowd pressures.   When large crowds
          are present and densities are high, pressures
          build up within the crowd either through
          motion or swaying which make it difficult, or
          even impossible for individuals to control
          their w«*i movements.  Under these conditions
          crowd pressures can escalate to a dangerous
          level and if a person stumbles or falls the
          crowd cannot adapt to avoid him or to stop to
          help.   Since this type of danger arises from
          crowd pressures its remedy lies in their
          removal or restraint within safe limits.

     114 Where barriers are not continuous between
         radial gangways, the alignment of gaps in
         successive rows of barriers on a terrace,
         should form an angle of less than 60° to the
         barriers. There should be no more than 2
         consecutive gaps m any line of gaps.

     115 Where there are gaps in the line of crush
         barriers these should be at least 1.1 metres
         and not more than 1.4 metres in width.

          from the provision of crush barriers in the
          area available for standing (as defined in
          para 221) as follows:

          (a)   Where a terrace contains either "peak
                viewing areas" only or "other viewing
                areas", by multiplying the total length
                of the crush barriers by an appropriate
                distance between barriers (as given in
                Ch. 9, paras 116-117)  or the existing
                distance, whichever is the   less, and
                multiplying by the appropriate
                packing density.

         guidelines on the strength set out in Ch. 9
         should m .gane-r-

         barriers are well constructed, consideration
         may be given to allowing a lower packing
         density figure for the purpose of the
         calculation.

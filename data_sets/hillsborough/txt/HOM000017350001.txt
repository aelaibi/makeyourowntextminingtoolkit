             Dear Mr. Whally,

                  HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

          I understand that consideration ie now being given to those people and
          organisations that will, be entitled to representation at some stage during
          the Inquiry. Could I formally request that representation be allowed to the
          7 Local Authorities in the North West at that Inquiry.   I would envisage
          that one representative would suffice on behalf of all the Local Author 1 -i.es.
       I  To grant such a request would in my opinion increase and maintain pub 1 .ic
       f confidence in that Inquiry and will be regarded by all as an additional
       1                        od:1 the need to g u a ra n t e e that the Inquiry       is as       t h o v u ^ h and
       \     as open as everyone intends .

              In addition all the Local Authorities concerned will be in a position to make
              observations on the licensing aspects of ground control as well as the co­
              operation between Authorities that has regularly occurred and which in
              particular is a feature of the operations that occur at Anfield and Goodison.

              As the Leader of the City Council could I also tell you that I am being
              bombarded with requests that the City Council is a v a i l a b l e to assist people
              to help the Inquiry reach proper conclusions and we have put and are willing
              to continue to put resources into making sure that no person who might be in
              a position to help the Inquiry is for any financial or administrative reason
              impeded from doing so.   It is also the case that Liverpool City Council's
              Building Surveyor had, prior to the establishment of the Inquiry, visited the
              ground and provided me, as the Leader of the City Council) with a report
              containing his observations. Whilst I appreciate that there will be no
              shortage of expert evidence available to the Inquiry this is just one example
              of the information that has become available to the City Counci 1, and I am
              sure other Local Authorities, which would be of use in establishing mechanisms
              which i.f implemented would red',re the risk of repetition.

              Therefore I formally request that authority should be given for counsel to be
       jI     instructed to appear on behalf of the 5 District A u t h o r i t i e s on Merseyside and
       I|     Lancashire and Cheshire County Councils.

               Yours sincerely,

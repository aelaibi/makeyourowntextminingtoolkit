                    On Saturday,                  15th April,                1989, I paraded at the
          Mounted Department at 0600 hours.                                            My duty was to drive
          Horse Box WBG 522E to Sheffield.                                             On arrival, at
          approximately 1030 hrs, at the South Yorkshire Mounted
          Department Headquarters, I attended and fed the horses
          whilst other officers attended a briefing.


                    At approximately 1230 hours I went out on patrol in .
          Dog Section van with Inspector Phoenix of that section an<
          2 other Constables.                           He patrolled an area of about one

          Hillsborough.                    I noticed that many supporters were
          drinking from beer cans and carrying beer packs as
          made their way towards the football ground.                                                          On one
          occasion we stopped a group of Liverpool supporters p h o .
          were walking along the footwalk carrying pints of beer.f

          They were cautioned and advised to return the glasses td .
          nearby public house.                             They were observed to do this.
          Whilst on patrol we visited two public houses and tha
          parks of these premises were full of supporters drlni|i|
          and sitting on perimeter walls.                                                                                         ^

                    At 1400 hours we went the railway station in                                                                          „

          went off without incident, the supporters being quiet’
          well behaved.


                    At approximately 1430 hours I heard a radio messa||(||
          saying there was crushing at the Leppings Lane turnstliiff
                                                                                $ M b'"

                               2

       We went to this location and I went on foot to the
turnstiles at this location, where I could see the horses
amongst a large crowd.  A line of horses was placed along
the front of the gates at this point and I assisted in
preventing non ticket holders gaining access to the
turnstiles.    Many people were walking around and at one
p o i n t l saw a man, who was very drunk, fall under the
horse No 23 "NORMANDY" ridden by Constable 4886 Narey.


       I heard on my personal radio that there was serious
crowd problems at the Liverpool end of the ground.                                     At
this time ambulances and fire tenders had started to
arrive along Leppings Lane.        I then returned, in the Dog
Section van to the horse boxes at the South Yorkshire
Mounted Department.


       As a result of what I heard on the radio I returned
to the football ground, on foot, with Constable 2089 Deus,
who was the other driver with the Merseyside, Mounted
Department.    We went to the Kop end of the ground where we
knew the main group of police horses were deployed.                                      I
remained at this point until after the natch was abanddned
and most of the crowds had cleared the area of the
football ground.    I then returned to the horse boxes on
foot.


       I later drove the horse box back to Liverpool
arriving back at 2230 hours.

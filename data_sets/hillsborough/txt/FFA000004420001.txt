 DRAFT LETTER FROM GRAHAM KELLY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE
 OF THE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION TO MR
 SPORT AND RECREATION DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF THE
 ENVIRONMENT, 2 MARSHAM STREET, LONDON SW1P 3EB




Dear

Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of 21 April 1989.



As I am sure you will appreciate a thorough investigation of

the events concerning the match at Sheffield on 15 April is

currently being undertaken by my staff in order that all the

relevant evidence is before Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry

due to start, I believe, fairly soon.   I am reluctant to

take resources away from that effort which is already taking

up a great deal of time.



In the circumstances I consider that it would not be

appropriate to prepare any interim "factual report'1 by

Friday of this week.   Please let me know if this causes you

a problem.



Yours sincerely




Graham Kelly

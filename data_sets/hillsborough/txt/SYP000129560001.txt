         Specification of Works for use in Connection with
      the Construction of Foundations and Supporting Structure

                 for a New Score and Message Board


1.0      Excavation
          1.01    The Contractor must take every precaution to
                  ensure the safety of persons and property at
                  all times. The Contractor's attention is
                  drawn to the fact that the services to existing
                  buildings and plant must be uninterrupted
                  throughout the Contract.
          1.02    The Contractor is to remove from the site and
                  dispose of all surplus excavated material
                  unless otherwise expressly required.
          1.03    The existing terracing is constructed from
                  in-situ concrete step units with an expected
                  average waist of no more than 150mm. Some of
                  the terrace steps contain possibly two small
                  diameter reinforcing bars.
          1.04    The existing concrete terracing is founded on
                  made ground comprising a mixture of clay and
                  sandy soil, ash and rubble. In some places it
                  is possible that old timber sleepers or mass
                  concrete will be encountered.
          1.05    The Contractor shall excavate for the
                  foundations to the minimum widths and depths
                  shown on the Drawings, or as directed by the
                  Engineer, to an approved solid bottom.
          1.06    The bottoms of all trenches and foundation
                  holes are to be inspected and approved by the
                  Engineer, and where necessary Local Authorities
                  before concrete is laid, and the Contractor
                  must give sufficient notice for the inspection
                  to be made without any delay being caused.
          1.07    The Contractor shall level, well ram and
                  consolidate the ground surface and bottoms of
                  all excavations to receive foundation bases
                  and slabs.
          1.08    Should any excavation be made to a greater
                  depth than required by the Drawings or by the
                  Engineer, the Contractor shall, at his own
                  expense, fill up such excess excavation with
                  concrete (1:12).




                                     5
      1.09    The Contractor shall make his own arrangements
              for the temporary storage of spoil and include
              for all costs incurred in haulage and double
              handling.

      1.10    The edges of all excavations shall.be adequately
              protected by barricades or fencing to prevent
              accidents.

2.0   Concrete Work
      2.01    All workmanship and materials shall conform with
              BS. Code of Practice CP.110.
      2.02     All concrete shall consist of four parts of
               coarse aggregate 20mm graded, two parts of fine
               aggregate and one part of cement all measured
               by weight and shall have a guaranteed
               compressive strength of 30 N/mm2 at 28 days.
      2.03     Coarse aggregate shall consist of Derbyshire
               limestone graded to the limits given in Table 1
               of BS.882. Fine aggregate shall consist of
               clean hard coarse naturally occurring sand
               graded to the limits of Zone 2 given in Table 2
               of BS.882. Cement shall be Ordinary Portland
               Cement and shall comply in all respects with
               the requirements of BS.12.
      2.04     The slump of the concrete shall be 50mm ± 25mm
               measured as the pouring of the batch commences
               and at a time not more than 20 minutes after
               the commencement of mixing.
      2.05     Ready-mixed concrete from an approved supplier
               shall be used. Each delivery of concrete must
               be accompanied by a delivery note stating the
               exact weights of materials and water content,
               and the time at which water was added to the
               mix.
      2.06     The concrete shall be transported from the
               batching plant and be in its final position
               within 45 minutes after mixing commenced.
      2.07     All concrete shall be protected during trans­
               portation and when in its final position
               against sun, wind, rain and extremes of
               temperature, by suitable covering. No concrete
               shall be placed when the air temperature is
               below 2°C and the concrete shall be prevented
               from falling below this temperature for a
               period of seven days.
      2.08     All concrete shall be thoroughly vibrated using
               an emersion type poker to ensure maximum density.



                              6
      2.09    Before placing concrete the excavations are to
              be cleaned out to remove all loose materials or
              debris and the bottom well rammed to give a
              firm surface. Concrete shall be placed in a
              single operation to the full depth of the bases.
      2.10    All concrete surfaces, except those covered by
              formwork, shall be cured by either keeping wet
              for seven days or using a proprietory curing
              agent. Curing shall commence at the earliest
              possible time following placing of the concrete.

      2.11    Shuttering shall be ply or soft wood and be
              removed gently so as not to damage the concrete
              surface. Any concrete which is in the opinion
              of the Engineer insufficiently dense, out of
              line, of unsightly finish shall be cut out and
              made good at the Contractor's expense. Render­
               ing over any surface shall not be permitted.
      2.12    Horizontal surfaces shall be accurately screeded
              to levels which match the existing terrace steps
              or slabs. The concrete shall be trowelled
               smooth followed by brushing over with a stiff
              brush.
                  Vertical surfaces shall be as struck from the
                  shuttering. The risers shall line through
                  exactly with the vertical edge of the existing
                  terrace step. A chamfer or arrise shall be
                  formed on the nose of the step to match the
                  existing.

3.0   Steelwork
      3.01        The work shall be executed by labour competent
                  for the class of work on which it is employed
                  and is to be under the direction of an
                  experienced and competent supervisor. All work
                  shall be done to the satisfaction of Eastwood &
                  Partners, hereinafter called the Engineer.
                  BS.449 together with other relevant British
                  Standards and the clauses specified in this
                  document shall apply as the minimum standard of
                  acceptance.
      3.02        The principal dimensions for setting out the
                  work shall be those shown on the Drawings,
                  which are to be read in conjunction with all
                  further drawings issued by the Engineer.
                  The Contractor shall allow in his tender for
                  obtaining all dimensions on site necessary to
                  ensure that the steelwork he is supplying
                  matches up with the new foundations and clears




                                 7
       the existing stand structures on each side of
       the board.

       ground to shape.
3.08   All washers, nuts and bolts shall be galvanised.
       The bolts and nuts shall be grade 4.6 to
       BS.4190 not less than 16mm diameter. The nuts
       shall fit spanner tight. Washers shall be to
       BS.4320 and fitted under the nut of every bolt.
3.09   Over the areas of welding, the steel is to be
       cleaned down to bright metal to remove all
       paint, rust, oil and any other deleterious
       matter or contaminants. No site welding shall
       be carried out when rain is falling or in
       conditions of high wind. No welding shall be
       done if the surfaces of the work are wet.
       Electrodes compatible with the grade of material
       being welded shall be used throughout and shall
       be stored and used in accordance with the
       manufacturer's recommendations. Damp or damaged
       electrodes shall not be used.
       All slag and spatter shall be cleaned off every
       run of weld metal.
       In addition to full supervision by the
       Contractor and inspection in accordance with
       BS.5289, if in the opinion of the Engineer, the




                      8
                 quality or strength of any weld is in question
                 this weld is to be completely removed and the
                 piece re-welded. No payment will be made in
                 respect of time lost for carrying out any
                 remedial work.
      3.10       Welded box or hollow sections shall be sealed
                 off and made airtight to the satisfaction of
                 the Engineer, to prevent corrosion of the
                 inside.
      3.11       Surfaces which will ultimately be welded or in
                 contact with concrete or asphalt, shall be
                 free of paint or any other applied finish, oil,
                 dirt, rust and scale. No paint shall be
                 placed within 75mm of a surface subsequently
                 to be welded. The inside surfaces of sealed
                 box sections may remain unpainted.
      3.12       Permanent connections shall not be made until
                 proper alignment has been obtained.

4.0   Painting
      4.01       All surfaces of the steelwork are to be blast
                  cleaned to second quality as defined in
                 BS.4232.
      4.02       All painting materials described in this
                  section are to be products of a recognised
                  paint manufacturer to the approval of the
                 Engineer. One coat of Alkyd gloss is to be
                  applied over one coat of undercoat over a
                 prepared priming coat.
      4.03       All paints shall be thoroughly mixed before
                 use unless there is a specific instruction to
                  the contrary on the container. They shall be
                  stored so as to minimise exposure to extremes
                  of temperature. All painting is to be
                  carried out strictly in accordance with the
                 manufacturer's instructions.
      4.04       After blast cleaning all surfaces of the
                  steelwork shall receive one coat of a high
                 build zinc phosphate primer, applied no later
                  than two hours after being cleaned. Care is
                  to be taken to ensure that all edges of the
                 members are fully covered.
      4.05       Primed or undercoated metalwork shall not be
                  left in an exposed or unsuitable situation
                  for an undue period before completing the
                  painting process.
      4.06       When all priming paint has dried and hardened



                                9
       one Alkyd undercoat shall be applied followed
       by one Alkyd gloss coat after the undercoat
       has dried.
4.07   The steelwork is to be delivered to site fully
       painted but not until the final coat has
       hardened. After erection, lining and levelling
        all blemishes, erection damage and welds are to
       be wire brushed and cleaned. The surfaces are
        then to be primed and overcoated as described
        above. All galvanised surfaces after cleaning
       with a mordant solution, are to receive one
        coat of etching primer before being overcoated.
4.08   No exterior or exposed painting shall be
        carried out under adverse weather conditions
        such as extremes of temperature or during rain,
        fog, etc.

For the attention of Mr.



'Bear Mr.
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .,
                  Camera Facilities
     We have received two letters from Mr. Wyld of
Yorkshire Television Ltd which outline the latest
requirements for the camera facilities in the
South Stand.     We understand that he has spoken to
you about the facilities and that you are In
agreement with his proposals.
      The scope of the work is to be restricted
to making a permanent walkway, to replace the
existing scaffold, and to add an emergency escape
ladder.     The canopy over the camera platform and
the lifting beam are not included.
     We are now preparing drawings for this reduced
scheme and hope to have the work carried out early
next year.     As we have mentioned before the cost is
likely to be relatively high because of the restricted
access and complication of adding a dormer over the
access ladder to give the necessary headroom.          Our own
costs are also likely to be disproportionate although
a good deal of the site measurements taken for the
previous scheme will be useful.
     We believe it is now appropriate to submit our fees
account for the work done so far.   A similar account for the
same amount has been sent to Yorkshire Television Ltd.




                Yours sincerely,

    Canopy over Camera Platform - South Stand
      Following your last tiro letters about the camera
access in the South Stand we are pleased to report that
we are now preparing drawings for the reduced scheme.
It is hoped that the work will be carried out early
next year.

Dear

                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.
                         Camera Facilities.

      Thank you for your proposals for the provision of a
lifting beam at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.      I
Viaw. '1i'scussed the point with our Head of Sport, Mr.
            and the outcome of those discussions are that
Yorkshire Television will not require the lifting beam to
be provided.

     I have noted your remarks in your letter of the 18th
June, 1982 regarding the temporary structure proposed for
Spion Kop.  I will be contacting yourselves on this subject
in the near future.

                             Yours sincerely,




                                              EON K ,

For the attention of Mr.



     H"
Dear Sirs,
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d ..
              Camera Facilities
     Last month, just before going on holiday,       I had a
meeting with Mr. Wilde of Yorkshire Television Ltd at
which we discussed the proposed camera facilities.
     Before the meeting our client told    met   that they
now intend building between the back of the South Stand
and the restaurant.    This will preclude the Installation
of the lifting beam at the end of the walkway, shown on
our drawing 3971/1.    Unfortunately there is no other
convenient location for the beam near the access walkway.
Even if there was there is the possibility that in the
near future an extension will be built along the whole
length of the stand.
     It therefore appears that work on the access
platform is reduced to making a permanent walkway, to
replace the scaffold, and adding an emergency escape
ladder.   The ladder will need a dormer housing above to
give reasonable headroom.    W e estimate the cost of
extending the walkway and providing the access ladder and
dormer to be between £3500 and £4000.
        Mr. Wilde said that the canopy over the camera platform,
even the iess expensive scheme of the two, could not be
afforded at the present time but the Installation of a simple
lifting beam by which cameras can be hoisted onto the
platform would be most useful.     Enclosed are two copies of
A4 size drawings 3971/4 and 5 showing proposals for the
beam.    As I have explained previously, work on this part of
the stand will be expensive and we believe the cost of the
lifting beam could be around £2500.
        Perhaps you would be kind enough to comment on the
proposals.     It is unlikely that the work can be completed
during this present close season but we see no difficulties
phasing the work in with fixtures next season.




                          Yours faithfully,

                   Please accept my apologies for not forwarding the
              proposals for the lifting beam before going on holiday.
              However, I now have pleasure in enclosing two copies of
              our A4 size drawings 3971/4 and 5 which show the
               proposed arrangement.
                     We estimate the cost of the beam to be around
               £2500. Accdss and erection difficulties make the cost
               rather disproportionate for the weight of steel involved.
               Your comments on the proposals would be welcomed.
                     I have written to             *at the B.B.C. to tell
               him the story about the access platform and the lifting
               beam and now await his comments. We also estimate that by
               reducing the work on the access walkway to simply
               extending the walkway and providing a cat ladder with
               dormer, to give the required headroom, the cost will probably
               be between £3500 and £4000.

             Reading through recent correspondence from
        South Yorkshire County Council it appears that communications
        are becoming confused over the temporary structure proposed
        for Spion Kop.
             As you know the Club will be responsible for this
        structure and it is important that communications with
        S.Y.C.C. are dealt with through the appropriate channels.
        Your direct approach to the Department of Planning at
        Sheffield was probably well intentioned but it would be
        helpful if on future occasions you passed correspondence to
        Sheffield Wednesday directly or, probably better still, to us
        with a copy to Mr. England.

     We estimate the cost of the beam to be around
£2500.      Access and erection difficulties make the cost
rather disproportionate for the weight of steel Involved.
Your comments on the proposals would be welcomed.
      I have written to                  at the B.B.C. to tell
him the story about the access platform and the lifting
beam and now await bis comments.        We also estimate that by
reducing the work on the access walkway to simply
extending the walkway and providing a cat ladder with
dormer, to give the required headroom,the cost will probably
be between £3500 and £4000.
     It is unlikely that the work can be completed during
this present close season but we see no difficulties
phasing the work in with fixtures next season.
     Reading through recent correspondence from
South Yorkshire County Council it appears that communications
are becoming confused over the temporary structure proposed
for Spion K o p .
     As you know the Club will be responsible for this
structure and       it is important that communications with
S.Y.C.C. are dealt with through the appropriate channels.
Your direct approach to the Department of Planning at
Sheffield was probably well intentioned but it would be
helpful if on future occasions you passed correspondence to
Sheffield Wednesday directly or, profeably better still, to us
with a copy to Ur. England.

                 Dear Sir,

                 Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
                 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

                 I thank you for your letter dated 25th May.

                 It is noted that the Television Authorities do not intend to
                 proceed with the canopy over the television platform in the South
                 Stand, and no doubt you will let me have details of the lifting
                 beam proposals when these have been finalised.

                 As regards the temporary structure at the top of the Spion Kop,
                 it is true that at their request, YTV had discussions on a
                 preliminary basis with the Building Authority earlier in the year.
                 It was because of the fact that it became clear in March that
                 further progress could not be made until arrangement drawings
                 were submitted for consideration by the whole officer Working
                 Party in the usual way that I wrote formally to the Club on this
                 matter on 31st March (a copy of which I forwarded to you for
                 information).

A *'   %     J   To date, I have not received any arrangement drawings from either
                 the Television Authorities or the Club.

                                                                 Yours fai 1~hfn1 1v .

For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

Dear Mr. Vaughan,
              Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
       Canopy over Television Platform in South Stand
     We have had a meeting with representatives of the yTV
and they together .with the BBC have decided that they cannot
afford the canopy after all. In addition, the lifting beam
for hoisting cameras into position cannot be placed at the
back of the stand because of possible future developments.
We shall therefore now be designing a much simpler system
with a lifting beam over the open seats.
     X understand that representatives of YTV have had
discussions with Mr.              with regard to the structure
on top of Spion Kop. We have not been involved so I am
not able to tell you the outcome.

                              Yours sincerely,




c.c. Mr. E. England - Sheffield Wednesday PC

         Dear Sirs,

         Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

         The Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) has now had the opportunity
         of considering the outline proposals enclosed with your letter dated
         27th April for improving the access to, and providing a canopy over, the
         television camera facilities in the South Stand at the Hillsborough Stadium.

         Subject to the detailed requirements of the Building Regulations and the
         Health and Safety at Work Act being met where appropriate, either of the two
         outline proposals are regarded as acceptable from a Safety of Sports Ground
         Act point of view.

         The Officer Working Party also noted the reference to the temporary structures
         aspect in the concluding paragraph of the copy letter dated 21st April, and
         I was requested to query with you the present position on this matter.

                                                                Yours faithfully,

For the attention of Mr*

Dear Sirs,

                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd
              Canopy over Camera Platform - South Stand

      We understand that some time ago it was suggested that a
canopy should be erected over the external camera platform above
the South Stand.    The club asked us to look into ways of constructing
a canopy and two schemes have now been devised.    These are shown
on our drawings 3971/2 and 3, two copies of which are enclosed.
      Drawing 2 shows a Cantilever system which has the advantage
of an uninterrupted view along the front of the platform.         The
cantilever beams will be taken through and connected into the
main roof structure.    The beams will be propped off the existing
castellated beam supporting the camera platform and by using this
system no additional load will be tansferred to the platform itself.
      However, because of the erection difficulties, access for
cranes, working at height over the seating etc, the cost of this
scheme is likely to be very high.    We believe the cost could be as
much as £11,500.
      Drawing 3 shows a less impressive structure which is a
series of simple frames, bolted to the existing canopy steelwork.
The canopy will not project to the back of the platform but will
cover say the front 3.On, just enough to protect the cameras and
operatives.
      The obvious disadvantage of this scheme is that the front
posts may obstruct sight linos towards the osar corner flag's.
However, suitable positioning of the cameras may overcome this.
      Although some of the erection difficulties are common
to both schemes this slmpller and more modest proposal will be
less costly.    We estimate the cost may be half of that of
the scheme shown on drawing 2.
      After you have had chance to study the proposals we will
be pleased to receive any comments you may wish to make.


      At the beginning of this month we received a copy of
a letter dated 31 March from South Yorkshire County Council
to Mr. Ingland, the Club Secretary.     The letter mentions
temporary structures and scaffolding used in connection with
television transmissions.     We believe this refers to the
temporary platform erected at the top of Splon Kop.     Do Yorkshire
Television L t d . , intend to put forward proposals, probably in
conjunction with the BBC for the erection of a permanent
structure?     If so, could details be forwarded to us please.




                                  Yours faithfully,

be beneficial if this work was combined with the work proposed
for the South Stand but this can be decided later.

Dear Eric,
              Camera Facilities
     I have pleasure in enclosing copies of various letters
and drawings to the B.B.C. and Y.T.V. about the canopy over
the camera platform and extension to the access walkway in
the South Stand.
     You will also see that we mention the platform at the
top of Spion Kop.   When we receive proposals it may be
worthwhile considering this platforms effect on possible
development at this end of the ground.
     Your comments on the drawing will of course be welcomed.
I will be pleased to call in if you need any explanation or
discussions about the proposals.




                                   Yours sincerely,

Dear Sirs,
                         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
                      Access to Camera Platform - South Stand
      We have pleasure in enclosing two copies of our drawing
3971/1 showing proposals for extending the access walkway to
the camera platform over the South stand.
      To cause as little disturbance as possible to the
present seating arrangement we propose that the existing
hoisted stairflight is maintained and a cat ladder installed.
This would be used to evacuate the camera platform if an
emergency occured during a match. A timber hatch over the
top of the ladder, released from above, will prevent
spectators climbing onto the walkway. By adopting this
arrangement only one seat will be lost.
      The walkway is shown extended to the rear of the
stand, raised by a flight of steps to give sufficient
headroom above the back rows of seats and to clear the
existing gutter. A runway beam above the walkway extension
projects over the yard outside.
      We have designed the beam to safely support a load
of 250 kg (550 lb.f). The walkway has been designed to
                                            2             2
carry a uniformly distributed load of 5 kN/m (100 lb.f/ft ).

EASTWOOD & PARTNERS




       A timber clad "dormer" type housing on a steel frame
 will be constructed to fit into the existing roof. This
 housing will have double doors to allow equipment to be brought
 onto the walkway.
       It is hoped that the work shown will be carried out
 before the start of the next season. Your comments on our
 proposals would be welcomed so that we can complete the
 detail design, obtain tenders and award the contract as
 soon as possible.

                                 Yours faithfully,

For the attention of Mr.




Dear Sirs,
         Sheffield Wednesday Football Club L t d .,
         Extension to Camera Platfora Walkway
     Please accept our apologies for not acknowledging
receipt of your letter dated 24 February sooner.      We
have discussed the matter with Hr. England, the
Club Secretary, and he has requested that we deal with
the structure on their behalf.
     It is the intension to erect the accessway at the
end of this present season and as part of the sane
exercise we have been asked to investigate the possibilities
of constructing a protective canopy over the external
camera platform.
     We will forward our proposals    for the canopy and
walkway to you shortly.

                          Yours faithfully,


c.c. Mr. England - S.W.F.C.

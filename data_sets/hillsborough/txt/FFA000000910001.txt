Dear Sir,

PERIMETER FENCING

In reply to your circular letter of 10th January, I return herewith the
form supplied to us completed on behalf of Leicester City F.C.

In fact, u/e hope u/e completed our fencing last November as the only areas
remaining unfenced are in front of our Family Enclosure.

Yours/faithfully,




A.K. BENNETT

Dear Sir,

PERIMETER FENCING

Further to your letter of the 10th January, I return
herewith questionnaire duly completed.

Under section 3 of the questionnaire, we currently
maintain an open mind on whether it is necessary for
this area to be fenced or not.   In the main this
seating area is occupied by season ticket holders.

Yours faithfully,




ft. CUSHING
General Hanaoer/Secretary

               Dear Sir,
                                                                            Perimeter Fencing

                     We acknowledge your letter of the 10th instant informing us that
              discussions have taken place between yourselves and the Football Grounds
              Improvement Trust regarding the possibility of grants being made avail­
              able to cover costs of providing and installing perimeter fencing where
              required on Clubs' grounds. It is our opinion, however, that any grants
              procured by the Football Association could well be used for more useful
              purposes such as safety work and general amenities.
                     Ule return the Questionnaire, completed as requested, but would
              point out that it is not our intention voluntarily to erect perimeter
              fencing on our ground in the foreseeable future and it is the considered
              opinion of our local Police that they would not welcome this.


                                                                 Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

                                                     Perimeter Fencing

       I am able to return your Perimeter Fencing questionnaire duly
com p l e t e d .

     In accordance with your instructions, question 2(iii) has not
been answered.

     With regard to question 3, I do not feel that we would wish
any extension of the existing fencing.

Dear S ir ,

P eria eter Fencing

Thank you fo r your l e t t e r o f January 10. and we enclose as
requested the questionnaire you have asked to 1»e completed.
I t so happens that today we are completing the er ec tio n o f
perimeter fencing fo r sectio n 'D1 on your diagram and
a run o f approx. 32 yards on 'C' se ctio n .          This we have
carried out follow ing d iscu ssio n s with the lo c a l a u th o r ities
and i t means that we have now reached the stage that on
any occasion when we have large v i s i t in g support the
v i s i t in g spectators w ill Tte Ifti accomodated in areas
with perimeter fen cing.
Prom discu ssion s and correspondence i t doe s only seem
a a a tte r o f time tefo re the a u th o r itie s i n s is t on perimeter
fen cin g fo r the remaining s e c tio n s .       We are reluctant
to have a l l sectio n s o f our own supporters 'behind fencing
(one section already are) V it i f the a u th o rities are adamant
then we w ill have to serio u sly contemplate, because we are
sa fe ty eonscious, and grant aid would l*e most h elp fu l in
t h is event.

Yours tr u ly ,




Colin Hutchinson,

                   Dear Sir,

                                                              Perimeter Fencing

                             Further to my letters dated 29th January and 15th February
                   with respect to your letter dated 13th February, the subject of perimeter
                   fencing was discussed at a recent Board Meeting.

                             As you have already been informed, we have three sides already
                   fenced.  It is not our wish at this time to fence the perimeter in front
                   of our West Stand (seated). We would like to investigate the possibility
                   of a segregation fence on the East Terrace which would segregate home
                   and visiting supporters and would allow more space for visiting supporters
                   as our present visitors capacity is approximately 6,000. Therefore, I wondered
                   if you have any money available to assist in this operation if we were
                   to consider putting up such a fence.

                                                                     Yours faithfully,

                  Dear Mr. Croker,

                                                     Perimeter Fencing

                           We are in receipt of your form which we have completed,
                 informing you of the perimeter fencing we have at Charlton. The only
                 part of the ground that is not fenced is immediately in front of the
                 all-seated West Stand.

                           With respect to this area, I am not sure of the Directors
                 policy but I will bring your letter up at our next Board Meeting and will
                 let you know their views in due course.

                                                          Yours sincerely,

The Secretary,
The Football Association,
16 Lancaster Gate,
London.   W2 3LW


For the attention of Mr. H.N. Bird

Dear Sir,

Perimeter Fencing

With reference to your letters dated 10th January and 13th
February 1985 and further to my telephone conversation with
Mr. Bird yesterday I can now enclose herewith your Questionnaire
duly completed.

As we were designated under the Safety of Sports Ground Act
1973 we have already been in communication with the Oxfordshire
County Council and there is a strong possibility that the
unfenced areas referred to on your Questionnaire will in fact
be done under the designation order.

We hope therefore to obtain 75% of the cost from the Football
Grounds Improvement Trust and if you can arrange the balance
to be paid under your scheme then we will be delighted.

Yours faithfully,




 impany Secretary.

  Dear Sir,

  PERIMETER FENCING

  Thank you for your letter regarding the possibility of grants being
  available to Clubs for the above, and we have pleasure in enclosing
  the completed fencing questionaire.

  We would however like to make the following comments with regard to
  our answers to the questionaire.

  Our most urgent priority would be to complete the fencing on Section
  'C' (Habbin Stand). This is the area where we have had trouble with
  crowd invasions on the few occasions that they have occured.
  Section 'D* (Newmarket Road Terrace) would be our second priority for
  erecting new fencing.
 We do currently have some fencing on Section 'B' (South Terrace) and the
 middle section of this, approximately 25 yards in length, had been
 damaged on a number of occasions by visiting supporters and is badly in
 need of repairs. If it were possible to obtain grants for repairing
 this fencing this would probably be our top priority.
 Should you require estimates for erecting                                  the fencing at a later
 date we would be pleased to provide these..

 Yours faithfully,




 P.M. Daw,
 Secretary.

            Dear Mr. Croker,

            Please find enclosed herewith our completed questionnaire on perimeter
            fencing.

            The Police are pressing us to fence our Quarry Lane visitors' end of
            the ground and we already have a quotation for this work, a copy of
            which is attached hereto. Sections A, C and D are merely guess
            estimates.

            Yours sincerely.______________

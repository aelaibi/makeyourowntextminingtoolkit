            G ro u nd on 9th April         1988    (0904S8)       I report a« f o i l o w s :-



            I paraded at H i l l s b o r o u g h Football         Gr ou nd at 9 am          (0900)   where    1 was

            then briefed         in the Sports Hall.



            I c ommenced duty at           10 am    C10000    at the L ep pings LN gate and

            turn st iles       together with ario^ier Officer,                    PC 78 BOOTH,   where we

            s ea rc he d fans after        they hara come through the gate.



            A Police      cordon had bejen set           up outside             the gate and was     controlling

            the      influx    of fans   Lnto     the ground and the S Y o rk sh ir e a nd w Y o rk sh ir e

            H or se Serial was        t/o my    left by the blue                railings   on the outside      of the
                                                                                                            PAGE

              Most    of the fans        entering were       good h um oured but a tew were a ggressive

              towards        us, mainly as they objected to being                sealifted,      Several      fans

              did get        through without       tickets    but w ere   irradiately ejected by other

              Officers.



              The    game     s tarted without      incj^Sfent and together with other O ff ic er s               I

              then stood        in the entraryre to the tunnel,            a lt h o u g h   I cannot    recall    if

              we were        directed to>«fo t h i s .    I cannot     recall     any overcrowding

              problems        in the^/ens    but   then   it was    difficult       to see     into    the P e n s .

•             A f t e r ^ ^ n e match the fans were       h ig h- sp ir it ed   but a gain     left the ground

                  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (As Amended)

 The Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster
                          Published 29th January, 1990

Information Note for Members of the General Purposes Panel
Action Taken by Officers to Date

(1)   A meeting of the Safety of Sports Grounds Advisory Group has been arranged
      for Friday, 9th February, 1990, expressly to discuss the report.  As Lord
      Justice Taylor makes specific reference in his report to the future of
      pitch perimeter fences I have pointed out to members of the Advisory Group
      that I intend to particularly discuss this point.  (There is a further
      Advisory Group Meeting on 22nd February, 1990, when the comments of the
      Clubs will be discussed.)

(2)   My Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Derricott, and my Assistant Solicitor, Mrs.
      Woodhead, are to meet with representatives of Sheffield United and
      Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs on 16th February to discuss the
      implications of the report to their specific grounds.

(3)   I have written to Owlerton Sports Stadium Limited asking for a similar
      meeting.

(4)   (a) I have written to the Fire Service and the Council Building Surveyor
      requesting each to undertake new calculations for the main standing
      terraces in the light of the final recommendations.

      N.B. It would seem that Lord Justice Taylor does not anticipate a further
      reduction of capacity from the 15% (across the board) reduction required by
      the interim report.  I would refer you to the copy of paragraph 172 of the
      final report attached.

      (b) A similar letter has been sent to the Clubs asking them to undertake
      the same calculation exercise.  I have also requested specific details of
      the turnstiles at the Grounds as Lord Justice Taylor has reduced the
      notional flow rate through turnstiles from 750 per hour to 660.

(5)   I have written to the Fire Service requesting them to give consideration to
      the effect of Recommendation 17 copy attached, on pitch perimeter fences.
      (To be discussed at the Advisory Group Meeting on 9th February, 1990.)

(6)   I have written to the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
      regarding Recommendation 69 copy attached, which suggests the use of a
      "major incident vehicle" at matches where the spectator attendance my be in
      excess of 25,000 persons.

(7)   I have written to Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United Football Cluls
      concerning Recommendation 39 copy attached, which asks the Clubs to
      consider maintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of
      the match, for season tickets and tickets for all ticket matches for seated
      areas, containing the names and addresses of those purchasing tickets.

(8)   I have written to the Clubs concerning Recommendation 42 copy attched,
      which recommends that stewards employed by the Clubs should preferably be
      between the ages of 18 and 55.  Currently the Council permits stewards
      between the ages of 18 and 65 years.

(9)   My Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Derricott, spoke with Councillor Butler on
      2nd February, 1990, and appraised him of the action so far taken.
I



    (10) Lord Justice Taylor makes reference in his report to certain technical
         documents and surveys.  See paragraphs 77, 96 and 97.

         I have taken steps to find out if   the Council has these documents and in
         the case of the handbook of Sport   and Recreational Building Design
         published by the Sports Council a   copy is being forwarded to my Chief
         Licensing Officer on three weeks'   approval from the publishers.

    (11) I propose to submit a general report to the 5th March, 1990, panel meeting
         on the effect of the final Taylor report with suggestions as to the initial
         action the Council as licensing authority may wish to take in response to
         Lord Justice Taylor’s final recommendations. A general report will also be
         placed before the Policy Committee at its meeting on 27th February, 1990.




    BH44/JD22
                             PART V - FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS
All-Seated Accommodation                                                                         ~
  1. The Secretary of State should ensure that spectators are admitted only to seated accommodation at
matches played at sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in accordance with
the timing set oat in Recommendations 2 to 4 below.                                        m

  2. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the 1993/4 season at high-risk matches as
defined under the UEFA Regulations set out in paragraph 82 above.

  3. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 abqve should apply with effect from the start of
the 1994/5 season to all matches at grounds in the first and second divisions of the Football League, the
Premier Division of the Scottish Football League, and at national stadia, subject to a reasonable extension of
time in the case of a club promoted to the second division of the Football League or the Premier Division of the
Scottish Football League. Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 20% of the
present standing capacity (such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8
below), the first 20% deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1994.

  4. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the
1999/2000 season to all matches at all other grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 10% of the present standing capacity
(such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8 below), the first 10%
deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1999.

Advisory Design Council                                      ✓
  5. The Football Association and the Football League should establish an Advisory Design Council whose
functions should be:

    (a) to conduct and marshal research into the improvement and design of football stadia;

    (b) to disseminate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in this field to members of the
        Football League and, on request, to other football and sports clubs in England, Wales and Scotland.

National Inspectorate and Review Body
  6. (a) If Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and powers therein specified (power to review the
discharge of functions by local authorities). If Part I of the Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
other arrangements should be made for the discharge of the functions and powers in section 13 of the Act by the
appointment of a body to exercise them.

      (b)       In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
should also be entrusted with similar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local authorities of their
certifying and licensing functions in relation to other sports grounds and sports entertainments pursuant to the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987.

Maximum Capacities for Terraces
  7. Where a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notw ithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

  8. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Cuide
(“the Green Guide figure") subject to the following qualifications:-

     (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide (when the terrace
         or view ing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;


                                                        76
    (b) the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope materially
        deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
        packed) should be 0 not 27;

    (c) in arriving at "the Green Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
        which should reduce the permissible density including those specified in paragraphs 220 to 224
        inclusive of the Green Guide.

  9. Arrangements should be made:-

    (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
        figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.

  10. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 750 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide. The maximum rate for any particular
turnstile must take full account of all circumstances including those given as examples in paragraph 47.


Filling and Monitoring Terraces
  11. There should be a written statement of intent, agreed between the club and the police, setting out their
respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling of each self-contained pen or
other standing area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the document in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

   12. (a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress
throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
other steward or police presence. He should have ready access to a police officer who can authorise access
through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.

      (b)       This Recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where the
spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not exceed one third of the area’s
maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.


Gangways
  13. Gangways should be kept clear, in accordance -with paragraphs 97 to 99 of the Green Guide. Gangways
should be painted in a conspicuous colour whether they are sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require
that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be painted.


Fences and Gates
   14. Ail spikes or similar constructions on perimeter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.

  15. Perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres, measured from the top of the fence to the lowest
point at which spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations forming part of the perimeter
boundary.

  16. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those with
duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
crowd densities.

  17. There must be provided in any perimeter fence of a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates of a
minimum width of 1.1 metres to enable that pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for
an emergency evacuation of that pen or area.


                                                          77
   18. All gates in radial or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit”.

  19. Where there is a perimeter fence in front of a pen or enclosure, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully
open during the period when spectators are in the pen or enclosure, wherever those in command feel that this
can safely be done. Whether they be fully open, partially open or closed, they should be kept unlocked
throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is occupied.

  20. Each gate in a perimeter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or enclosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer when the pen or enclosure is occupied. Whether such manning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be decided by the Police Commander. In either event, the Police
Commander should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to the
pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

  21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there are
perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crash Barriers
   22. All crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately (if this has not
already been done following the Interim Report) to ensure that it complies with the criteria contained in
Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen or
terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 8 above, should reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
  24. The Secretary of State should exercise his powers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) of the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 so as to make mandatory in Safety Certificates those conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act. So far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “s b a ir should be
substituted for “may”.

  25. In assessing these mandatory requirements in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. Once that is done, the resultant figures and terms for that ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be permitted other than by
formal revision.

  26. Where a local authority incorporates any provision of the Green Guide into the Safety Certificate, other
than one within the scope of Recommendation 25 above, it should make clear whether that provision is to be
complied with absolutely or with discretionary flexibility.

  27. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if this has not already been done
following the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority, which should consult the club in respect of
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.
Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its object should be to ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a
matter of urgency following the findings and Recommendations in this Report.

 28. Any locat authority' within whose area there exists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

  29. Even Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
Certificate should require to be renewed annually.

  30. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
amending and renewing Safety Certificates (if this has not already been done following the Interim


                                                        78
Report). Such review should require that there exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by senior officers and
elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local authority's rules.

   31. To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) consisting of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire
and ambulance services and of the building authority. The Advisory Group should consult representatives of the
club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation on a regular basis. The Advisory Group’s terms of reference
should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.


Duties of Each Football Club
  32. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured (if this has not already been
done following the Interim Report). Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile
remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate anticipated.

  33. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such as
to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the turnstiles
within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly. Since
this Recommendation includes terms and conditions within the scope of the original section 2(2)(cMi) of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 it should be given effect in the Safety Certificate (see Recommendation 24
above).

  34. Turnstiles sliould be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be reached
and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile operators for this
purpose.

  35. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before, throughout and at the end of a
match.

  36. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report). It should, in relation to the arrangements for each
match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of
spectators to their appropriate viewing areas. Any redundant signs should be removed.

  37. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with the
information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs should
contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

  38. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report) by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure
that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.

  39. Clubs should consider maintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of the match, for
season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches for seated areas, containing the names and addresses of those
purchasing tickets.                                              N

  40. All-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected.
When a match has been designated all-ticket, clubs should not sell tickets at the match and should take steps to
advise the spectators of both clubs accordingly.
                                                  *
  41. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters' club as to the provision of pre-match
entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

   42. Clubs should recruit and retain sufficient competent stewards. They should be fit, active and robust, and
preferably between the ages of 18 and 55. Gubs should ensure that stewards are fully trained, aware of their
duties under Annex B of the Green Guide and under the statement of intent (see Recommendation 11) and able
to perform them.

                                                          79
 43. The dob should provide a police control room which is:-

    (a) well placed, so as to command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator area surrounding it;

    (b) of sofficient size for the commander, his deputy and enough officers to operate the radios, telephones
        and CCTV screens. There should be space for others who may need from time to time to visit the room
        eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services;

    (c) well equipped with CCTV, radio and telephone facilities and, where necessary, sound-proofed against
        excessive crowd noise.
                                                                  *
  It should be the duty of the club to provide a room and equipment to the satisfaction of the chief officer
nominated under Recommendation 44 below.


Police Planning                                  '
  44. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated sports ground or more
should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

  45. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground, and the pre-match briefing of all
officers on duty there, should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is
detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy i t

  46. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground should enable the police to cope
with any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

  47. Police planning should provide that ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter a designated sports
ground except in an emergency.

 48. Arrest procedures inside and outside designated sports grounds should be reviewed so as to keep to the
minimum the period during which an arresting officer is away from his post.

  49. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

  50. Consideration in consultation with the club should be given, especially for high-risk matches, to the
possibility of an early kick-off or a Sunday fixture.

  51. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television monitoring
outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles
or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the
interpretation and use of these data.

   52. Consideration should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
strategy of policing football matches.

  53. Police authorities should review the charges they make to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home Office should take steps to ensure consistency of
practice, subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.


Communications
  54.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be used,
where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.

                                                        80
  55. There should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate
with his senior officers round the ground.

   56. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

  57. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Important announcements should
be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This
arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for ever)' match.

  58. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   59. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
liaison concerning crowd safety at each designated sports ground.

  60. Before each match at a designated sports ground the police should ensure that the fire service and
ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of spectators
expected, their likely routes of entry and ex it and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the
control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control rooms of each of the
emergency services.

  61. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control room to the local
headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency calls can be made
instantly.

  62. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated sports ground of emergency vehicles from all three
services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility within
the ground itself.

  63. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for the
arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why they are
required.


First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
 64. There should be at each sports ground at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
The club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.
                                                    4'


  65. There should be at each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms
and the equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.

   66. (a) At every match where the number of spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground. He should be
trained and competent in advanced first aid. He should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
and should remain until half an hour after the end of the match. His whereabouts should be known to those in
the police control room and he should be immediately containable.

       (b)        At any match where the number of spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
arrangements to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
at the ground. He should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. The arrangements made should be
known to those in the police control room. <■

   67. At least one fully equipped ambulance from or approved by the appropriate ambulance authority should
 be in attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of5,000 or more.

    68. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
 specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a requirement
 of the Safety Certificate.

                                                         81
  69. A “major incident equipment vehicle”, designed and equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties, should be
deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in excess o f25,000 is expected.


Offences and Penalties -
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence of selling tickets for and on the day of a football
match without authority from the home club to do so.

  71. Each of the following activities at a designated sports ground should be made a specific offence:-

    i.   throwing a missile;

    ii. chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.
                                                  V

  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courts' powers to make attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football matches. The provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum of 72 hours in the case of an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentencing of offenders
convicted of football related offences.


Green Guide                                                   '
  74. As a matter of urgency, the Home Office should set up a body to revise the Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report of the Technical Working Party (Appendix 3).

  75. In any revision of the Green Guide, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various materials should be
specified.

  76. When the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.




                                                         82
    167. The following facts are clear. Leeds supporters had been allocated, as a standing area, a wedge-shaped
pen "D" at the south east comer of the ground. It was flanked by a narrow sterile area on each side. There was
u broad gangway running from top to bottom of pen “ D~. The perimeter fencing at the front of the pen was
topped with spikes. There was not a single gate to the pitch. The only way out for those at the front was by a
kite at each side into the sterile area and thence through another gate to the pitch. Those gates were closed
curing the match. The capacity of the pen in accordance with my interim recommendation was 2108. Leeds
supporters were admitted to the pen. families with very young children being put at the front. The gangway
was not kept clear. Some Leeds supporters managed to get tickets for the opposite home end of the ground
causing apprehension of trouble. A number of them were taken out and moved into pen ~D” from the pitch
s:<Jc. Other Leeds fans with tickets for the wrong end were also allowed into pen “D" from the back. Shortly
•iltcr the match started, there was distress among those at the front of the pen. After two surges down part of
tne pen where there were no barriers from front to back, the police had to assist in getting spectators,
especially children, out of the pen. This was done principally over the fencing although the side gates were
opened and shut a number of times. In the event, 14 people had to be treated for minor injuries in the
ambulance room. Five spectators, three of them children aged 10, 11 and 12. were taken to hospital with
chest injuries, lacerations and bruising.

    168. The local authority, the police and the club were clearly shocked by this incident and have taken
prompt remedial action. Additional crush barriers are to be installed, additional gates are to be provided
including one for pen D. the capacity of that pen is to be halved. Admission to all parts o f the ground, save the
\ isitors' section (pen D), is to be for members only to prevent away supporters buying tickets for the home
end. Fi nally, there is to be a phased programme wh ich will extend seating to all spectators by 1991 /1992.
  169. This incident and its aftermath prompt the query: does there have to be a disaster or near-disaster at
cach ground to trigger radical action? I hope not.

    170. The permitted capacity of the pen was exceeded, although it is not clear to what extent. The police
%icw is that it was only by about 60 persons. In a sense, the smaller the excess the more the point is made that
danger can occur very quickly on a standing terrace even with moderate numbers. Some argue that reducing
numbers and giving spectators more room simply enables a surge to gather greater momentum: that the
tighter people are packed together the less the scope for surging or misbehaviour. This was the philosophy
v. hich allowed excessive numbers to be packed into pens prior to Hillsborough. The only sensible conclusion
is that unless both numbers and terrace layouts are strictly controlled, there will always be a risk of crushing
on a standing terrace. The combination of numbers, excitement and partisanship, even leaving aside
misbehaviour, has a potential for danger.

   171. Comparison with criteria adopted abroad is instructive. France and Belgium adopt the Green Guide
figure of 5.4/m;. But in Holland, the maximum standing capacity is 4/m;. In Italy, the rule varies between
municipalities. In Milan the figure is 2/m-. In Rome it is 4/nr. But in Italy little difference is recognised in
principle between the figures permissible for standing and those for sitting.

   172. Weighing all these factors I do not think it would be right to recommend a substantial departure from
the ctFcct of the 15% interim reduction. Now. rather than take a figure and deduct a percentage from it, what
Wrequired is a specific figure for maximum standing density when terrace conditions are good by Green Guide
criteria. I recommend that that figure should be 47 per 10 sq metres and I would substitute 47 for the figure of
54 in the Green Guide. The effect is approximately a 13% rather than a 15% reduction from the former figure
of 54. I wish to stress as forcefully as I can. however, that this figure is a maximum and it is for the local
authority acting on the recommendation of its Advisory Group to make necessary and realistic reductions from
that figure in respect of any feature of the terrace which deviates significantly from Green Guide criteria or has
any other significant shortcoming.
Counting Them In                                            '
    173. It is no use fixing a maximum capacity for a pen or enclosure unless there are reliable means of
ensuring it is not exceeded. I therefore repeat my recommendation that the number of spectators entering each
self-contained pen or other standing area must be limited electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing
arrangement, by counting or otherwise. The best arrangement is one which makes all facilities for a single
%icwing area self-contained: access should be through turnstiles solely serving that area via a concourse doing
likewise with its own toilets and refreshment points. This point has already been clearly made in paragraphs
 i 01 and 206 of the Green Guide:-

  “Each section should ideally be self-contained and should be serviced by its own entrance/exits,
  refreshment facilities and to ile ts.. . ”

    Dear Sir/Madam

    HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR 11/1990
    FINAL REPORT OF THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

    Introduction

    The Final Report of the Inquiry set up by the .Home Sej^retary
    following the disaster at the Hillsborough football ground was
    published- on 29 January. A copy of the Report is attached.

    2.   The purpose of this circular is first, to apprise recipients
    of the Report's recommendations and the Government's response to
    them; and second to give guidance to local authorities with
    safety certification responsibilities on compliance with the
    recommendations.

    The Report

    3.   The Report contains 76 recommendations, 43 o f ‘which are
    repeated in substance (see also paragraph 6 below) from the
    Interim Report circulated with HOC 68/1989. Attached at Annex A
    is a copy of the Home Secretary's oral statement to the House
    of Commons on 29 January responding to the final Report.     At
    Annex B is a copy of the schedule referred to in the statement
    setting out the Government's initial response to the individual
    recommendations in the report.

    4.   Local authorities may wish to note, in particular, the
    response to recommendations 1-4 (all seated accommodation) and
    recommendation 6 (National Review Body). The intention is to
    bring into force the relevant sections of Part I of the Football
    Spectators Act 1989 in order to implement these recommendations
as regards football grounds as soon as practicable.              Safety
certificates should not be amended for this purpose.

Scope

5.   Paragraphs 238-239 of the Report indicate that in directing
the recommendations "essentially" to sports grounds designated
under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 the flexibility of
approach referred to in paragraph 5 of the Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds (the Green Guide) should apply.    Paragraph 14 of
the Report makes clear that its emphasis is on football, with its
special problems such as overcrowding and misbehaviour, which
are not experienced to the same extent elsewhere.      The Report
states that "crowd problems are directly related to the nature
of the event and the numbers' attending it".   It would therefore
be consistent with the Report's findings for local authorities
to take proper account of these factors when applying the
recommendations to individual grounds:     for example a careful
appraisal, of the value of such matters as the installation of
sophisticated communications systems and CCTV may be necessary
where spectator attendances are numbered in hundreds rather than
thousands and where the police presence at the ground is minimal.

Interim Report Recommendations Adjusted

6.   The   attention  of   local   authorities   is  drawn   to
recommendations 8, 11, 12(b), 19, 20, 31, 33, 58, 66 and 67 all
of which were contained in the Interim Report but have been
modified as follows:

        recommendation 8 -   revised maximum figure

        recommendation 11 - "agreement" between club and police is
                            replaced by "statement of intent"

        recommendation 12 - qualification introduced by 12(b)

        recommendation 19 - discretion as regards opening of pitch
                            perimeter gates

        recommendation 20 - mannina bv colice or steward

        recommendat i on 31 - revised   composition   of   the Advisory
                              Group                           »

        recommendation 33 - reference to 1975 Act provision

        recommendation 58 - hand-signals not recommended

        recommendation 66 - recommended threshold figure of 2000

        recommendation 67 - ambulance may be     approved       by   the
                            ambulance authorities.
    Mew Safety Recommendations

                                                             Lord Justice Taylor pointing out that incitement from the

                                                             improve standards, but Lord Justice Taylor's clear
                                                             conclusion was that the majority had not and that the

                                                             change their priorities and give a leadership which is
                                                             plainly lacking at present.

                                                              11 of the Football Spectators Act 1989 specifically
                                                             provides the machinery for that. The change will improve
                                                             safety and behaviour, and we intend to bring it about.
                                                                 Lord Justice Taylor makes clear that the bulk of the

                                                             the clubs themselves. He says there are ways of raising the
                                                             money if the clubs' management is enterprising and
                                                             resourceful, and he points to the opportunities presented
                                                             by sponsorship. He also points to the revenue that flows to
                                                             the football authorities from television rights and says that
                                                             the football authorities should ensure that this valuable

                                                             canvasses the possibility ofa lew on transfer fees which he

impact of closed circuit television on the hooligan
problem. It also mentions other measures taken by the
Government, such as the restriction on the sale of alcohol
and the power given to the courts to make orders
excluding convicted hooligans from grounds.
    Lord Justice Taylor also recognises the great potential
value of the police national football intelligence unit in
dealing with football-related crime and with hooligans
travelling to matches abroad.
    As Ihave said. Lord Justice Taylor takes the view that
better facilities and better treatment of fans will bring
better behaviour. Beyond that, the report recommends the
creation of three new specific offences to apply at
designated sports grounds— throwing a missile; chanting
obscene or racialist abuse; and going on to the pitch
without reasonable excuse. It also asks for consideration
to be given to extending the courts' powers to impose
attendance centre orders and for the use of electronic
tagging in the case of offenders" convicted of football-
related offences. The specific new offences suggested seem,
to some extent, to duplicate offences which are already
available in the Public Order Act 1986. but I shall look
carefully and quickly at all these suggestions,
    I now come to the proposed football membership
scheme. Lord Justice Taylor examined the invitation to
tender for a scheme which was issued by the consultants
employed by the football authorities. He came to the
conclusion that he could not support a scheme ofthat kind
because he could not believe that the technology would
work well enough to avoid the danger of congestion and                                             t
disorder. He was also concerned about the call on police
resources. Instead, he proposes the measures to which I
have referred.
    In the lightof thisadvice, the Government have decided
not to proceed with the establishment of a football
membership authority, but part Iof the Act will remain on
the statute book. Work will continue to see how the
shortcomings identified by Lord Justice Taylor could be
overcome in case we have to return to the matter again,
 should the problem of hooliganism not be defeated by the
 alternative strategy proposed in the report.
     Let no one imagine that this means that there will be
 any let-up in the fight against hooliganism. Those who.
 unlike the Government, have for so long shrugged offtheir
 responsibilities will now have to face up to them.
     The Government intend to proceed as quickly as
 possible to the establishment of a football licensing
 authority and. subject to consultation, section 11 of the
 Football Spectators Act will be used to direct the Football
 Licensing Authority to require all-seater stadiums— with
 standing being reduced by stages and entirelyeliminated in
 firstand second division grounds by August 1994 and in all
 Football League grounds by 1999.
     The necessary steps will be taken to ensure improved
 arrangements for crowd control and better training for
 police and stewards. There will be urgent consideration of
 the case for new offences and for new powers to deal with
 those excluded from grounds by the courts. The clubs will
 be compelled to get rid of the terraces. But Lord Justice
 Taylor indicates how much more they can do to create a

INQUIRY INTO THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM INQUIRY


Initial response by the Government to the recommendations in the
final report of Lord Justice Taylor's         Inquiry  into the
Hillsborough stadium diaster.


In his statement on 29 January, the Home Secretary indicated that
he would place in the Library a schedule setting out the
Government's initial response to the recommendations of Lord
Justice Taylor's final report.   The schedule is annexed.

Initial response by the Government to recommendations contained
in the Taylor report.


ALL SEATED ACCOMMODATION (Recommendation 1-4)

1.   General recommendation in respect of all sports grounds
     designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

2.   To apply to all UEFA "high risJcH matches from Autumn 1993.

3.   To apply by 20% stages between now and Autumn 1994 to
          Football league, Divisions 1 and 2
          Scottish football league, Premier Division
          National stadia.

4.   To apply by 10% stages between now and Autumn 1999 to all
     other matches played at designated grounds.

The Government accepts this recommendation in principle and
expects to apply it in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the
4 Divisions of the football league, and the national stadia as
recommended.


The application of the recommendation to Scotland and to other
sports cannot be achieved under the Football Spectators Act 1989
but the Government will in any case wish to discuss it with the
sporting authorities concerned. Designated sports grounds under
the 1975 Act include cricket, rugby union and rugby league
grounds which are not all enclosed grounds and w£ich it ittSy not*
be practicable to deal with in this way.



ADVISORY DESIGN COUNCIL (Recommendation 5)

The Government supports Lord Justice Taylor's recommendation
that the football league and Football Association should
establish an Advisory Design Council on stadium design.




NATIONAL INSPECTORATE AND REVIEW BODY (Recommendation 6)

     (a)   The Football Licensing Authority should be created to
           review the discharge of functions by local authorities.

     (b)   The powers of the Authority should be extended to other
           sports and other sports venues.

The   Government   supports  the   recommendation   that   safety
certification of designated grounds should be centrally reviewed
and proposes to bring into force relevant provisions of Part I
of the Football Spectators Act to create and empower the Football
Licensing Authority to carry out these responsibilities in
England and Wales in relation to grounds used by football league
clubs'and the international football grounds. Consideration will
be given to introduction of legislation extending the role of the
new authority to Scotland and in relation to other sports grounds
and sporting venues after consultation with the representative
sporting organisations, the local authority associations and
other interested bodies.    Consideration will also be given to
extending the Authority's responsibilities in the meantime on a
voluntary basis.

MAXIMUM CAPACITIES FOR TERRACES (Recommendations 7-10)

7.    Safety certificates to specify maximum number of spectators
      in pens or areas (interim recommendation 1).

      recommendation 2, revised).

9.    Arrangements to prevent   further access   to pens   (interim
      recommendation 3).

10.   Turnstile flow rates.

The Government supports these recommendations. Local authorities
with responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
(the 1975 Act) have already been urged to review and amend safety
certificates to reflect      reductions  in terrace capacities
recommended in the Interim Report.      The adjusted figures in
recommendations 8 and 10 will be drawn to local authorities'
attention.   The next edition of the 'Green Guide' will reflect
the new figures.

FILLING A N D MONITORING OF TERRACES (Recommendations 11-12)

11.   Statements of intent (interim recommendation 4, revised.

12.   Stewarding or policing of pens (interim recommendation 5).

The Government have already urged police and clubs to enter into
non-contractual statements of intent with the aim of ensuring
that no doubt exists as to the respective responsibilities of
each; and to provide monitoring of terraces accordingly.       The
relaxation in recommendation 12 (b) will be drawn to the attention
of local authorities and clubs.

GANGWAYS (Recommendation 13)

Local authorities will be urged to include in safety certificates
terms and conditions to give effect to this recommendation.

FENCES AND GATES (Recommendations 14-21)

14.   Removal of spikes.

15.   Reduction in height.

16.   Training of stewards (interim recommendation 6).
                                                         k

       recommendation 9).

21.    Cutting equipment (interim recommendation 10).

The Government supports the recommendations on perimeter fencing.
Local authorities will be urged to amend safety certificates to
include requirements so as to implement recommendations 14, 15,
17   and  to  note   recommendation   19 which varies     interim
recommendation 8.   The revised recommendations on closure and
manning of gates in perimeter fences at football grounds will be
drawn to the attention of local authorities, clubs and police.

CRUSH BARRIERS (Recommendations 22, 23)

22.    Inspection (interim recommendation 11).

25.    Variation from terms of safety certificates.

2 6.   Terms of safety certificates.

       certificates (interim recommendation 15).

30.    Review of arrangements for issuing certificates              (interim
       recommendation 16).

31.    Local authority advisory groups (interim recommendation 17,
       revised).

The Government agrees with the aims of these recommendations.
An order under S.15A of the 1975 Act will be made to implement
recommendation 24. Consideration will also be given to including
within the scope of such an Order provisions which will require
terms and conditions addressing other aspects of safety to be
included in safety certificates.
                                                        k
Local authorities will be urged to ensure the terms/conditions
in safety certificates are clear and unequivocal: they will be
reminded of the need to have an effective review system, the
desirability of a properly constituted team approach to
certification and the desirability of consulting club and
supporters association representatives.

Annual review of safety certificates already exists in effect
because annual inspections of designated grounds in connection
with safety certificates is already required by law.       The
Government will consider whether any change in the law should
be made to make annual renewal of certificates compulsory.

senior   officer   training  and   the   objective    to  improve
effectiveness of policing at football matches.     The Government
agrees that the cost of policing inside grounds should be met in
full by clubs and will consider providing guidance to police

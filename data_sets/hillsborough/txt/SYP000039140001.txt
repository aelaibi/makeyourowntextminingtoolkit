Liverpool           supporters               who     had    become          abusive        when     not      allowed            into          the

pub.         They     quietened              down and           asked       where     else     they        could         ge t       a

ground,        but     I must           add     at    this       time       selected         people        who     were         suitable

were     allowed           entry        into        the    public        house.         We    then       returned             to        our

p o s i t i o n at     the S t a t i o n .

We    then     received            a    radio        message          for    our     serial        to a t t e n d        at     a

general        message        was         'Problems             with     supporters           - drinking                on    the

from     the       cans,     they        were        noisy,       but       caused      no    real       problems.                  We     then

stool.        We       advised          them         that       they    would        probably        not        be a l l o w e d in

with     this       stool.             They     said       they       had    only     taken        this      to    the        game         so

the     little        lad    could           see     onto       the    pi t ch ,     and     they    agreed          to       take         it

b ack    to    their        motor         vehicle.

By    this     time        I saw        large        numbers          of L i v e r p o o l    supporters             making              their

way     down    the        main        road,        carrying          packs     of    beer     and       lager.              They        were

very     boisterous           shouting               and    singing.

I noticed           one     youth         in    particular             about        18-19 years            about        5*9"            t a ll,

heavily        built        wearing            Union       Jack       shorts,        was     singing         louder           than

anyone        around        him.         He     definitely             appeared         worse       for      drink.             His

mates        appeared          to    be    telling          him       to    keep       quiet.           They           then    moved       on

down    the m a i n          road.

1' t h e n    heard         a message           over       the    radio          'Assistance                required           outside

Public        House,         Neeps        End,       PC    having          problems*.

Mot    knowing          any     areas          of    Sheffield             I asked          PC    Cammock          was        it    close       by

he    informed          me     it w a s n ' t .

At    approximately                 2.00       pm    the    train          carrying          the       supporters              arrived.

On    leaving          station           arrangements             made          to    hold       them       together           outside

the    public          house        ( n ame     not       known).           The       supporters             all       age     groups,

both    s ex e s ,      were        very well             behaved.              No    singing          or    chanting,              no

evidence          of    drink,           made       their       way    from          off    the    Platform             down        the

steps.         We w e r e       then       joined          by    two       mounted          officers,             I believe              from

South        Yorkshire.

The    supporters             were        held       for    approximately                   5 minutes             in    the        small

triangular             area     outside             the    public          house.

I noticed          that        two       men    at    the       rear       of    the       supporters             were        carrying          tea

urns.        We    were       then        instructed             to    escort          the       supporters             to     the

football          ground.            This       was       contrary          to       the    order       and       also        it was

rather        unusual         considering                 the    supporters                were    so       quiet       a nd well

behaved       .
We    escorted          the     supporters                down    t he      main       road,       arriving             outside           the

Leppings          Lane       entrance           at a p p r o x i m a t e l y          2.13       pm.        No    problems

experienced                 with     the       supporters             from       leaving          the       station          to    arriving

outside        the      ground.

They    then made             their        way       to    the    queues             that    were       forming          outside           the

turnstile          area,        outside          Leppings             Lane.

Already       there          wa s    a    large amount                of    supporters             outside             the    ground        but

this    was       not       unusual        considering                it w a s       a Semi        Final.              i was

approached             by    several           supporters             at   different              times          and    asked.a

      A Police         Officer            I believe             an    Inspector              then appeared                 on    t he      wall      the

      climbing         ceased         but       he       was    lifting           small          children        from          the    developing

      crush     to     safety.

      Again     myself          a n d PC        Cammock          went        to    give          what    assistance              we       could,

      and    I myself           could          feel       the    force        of    the          crowd and           I withdrew             further

      back    towards           the       road.

      I seemed         to     recollect              earlier          hearing           a    radio       message           requesting

      Public       transport              to    be       stopped        from       travelling                along        Leppings          Lane

      but    I saw       th e       buses       were       still       moving           through          the     crowd,          forcing            them

      over    towards           the       turnstiles             in    th e       bottleneck            area         outside          Leppings

      Lane.        I also           felt       in    relation          to     the       entrance             outside           Leppings        Lane

      end    t h at    there         should          have       been        some    sort          of    semi-sterile                 area.          We

      that    is,      Rotherham               Officers,             ha d    this       particular              duty       for       the    F.A.

      C u p S e mi     Final         in    1987,          which       was     played             between        Leeds       United          and

      Coventry         City.

On    this     occasion          we    kept       th e      crowds         back       outside           the       metal       railings

and    gates        to a l l o w      myself          and     other        officers              to    carry       out, s e a r c h e s

etc.        Also       there     seemed          to    be a       general         lack           of    information                coming

from    within          the    ground         from       ground         control            via        the    radio       or       th e

public       address          system,         either          giving        information                 to     us,      or

information             and    requests           etc.,        to    the        crowd.

The    mood       of    the    crowd        by    this        time      was      growing              more     volatile            but       no

evidence          of    violence        towards             us,     but     they       were           continuing             to    push.            A

Land    Rover          containing           a P.C.          which       was      parked           to    t he      extreme          left        of

the    turnstile            area      began       to     edge       in s l o w l y         in a n a t t e m p t          to       slow       down

the    movement          of    the     cro w d .         He    then        had    to       stop        because          of    th e       sheer

weight       of    numbers.            He     then       left       th e    position              in the          ca b a n d       standing

on    the    step was          shouting           loudly          for      the    supporters                 to    stop       pushing,

but    the     crowd a p p e a r e d         not       to     hear      t his,        or    t ak e      no     notice.

Inspector          Ellis       then appeared with                       a m e g a p h o n e / h a i 1er            and       began        to

shout       "Liverpool           supporters,                please         stop       pushing"              this     was      repeated

several        t i me s .

At    this     stage        I d i d n ’t s e e         anything            to    indicate              the     impending

disaster          even      though      there          was a        large        crowd          but     this       is    usual           for

big    gam e s .

It w o u l d      be a b o u t     this      time        I heard           over       my    personal              radio       somebody

making       reference           to a       "catastrophe".                  I had          no    idea w hose             voice          or

whose       call       sign    it was.            We    were        still        receiving              nothing^from                 Match

Control,          it s e e m e d      strange.

I was       then a p p r o a c h e d        by a n o t h e r      Liverpool                s^rjSporter w h o             produced              a

ticket       to me       and     enquired          the        location           af    the       North        Stand.           I

indicated          the      general         direct                       Jne N o r t h          Stand and            saw     that        a

large       double       blue      gate      to    the        extreme           left       of    the     turnstile            area

open,       about      3-4     feet.         People           were      not      rushing          in,        it    seemed          as     if

someone        was      checking        tickets          and      using          this       as    an    extra           turnstile,
                                                                                                                                       page:
                                                                                                                                       R364

but    I dks        still          surprised           to    see     it    op en.

I pointed           out       this       to    t he    enquiring           Liverpool            supporter             and       he

smarted        to      walk        ove r.

At    this     time         I heard           from     other       officers          that       the       game       had       been

delayed        until          3.15       pm.        I told       approaching              supporters             ' D o n ’t          rush,

the    start        now       delayed*.               The    time    about          now 3 . 0 0        pm.       I then             heard        a

loud     cheer         or     r oa r     likened          to a     goal      scoring        chance.              A    group           of

supporters             close~by              said     ' W h a t ’s t h a t      t h e n ’, I replied:                 ’C o u l d       be    the

teams       coming          out.’            I checked        my w a t c h        thinking           t h a t ’s u n u s u a l ,            they

usually        c o me       out     ten       minutes        before        start.          One       Liverpool             supporter

made    a     comment            that        the    start     had    not        been      delayed          and       that       I was

lying.         There          were       still        odd    supporters             asking       fo r      spare        tickets.

I s aw PC         Rose        having          problems        with        one     youth,        apparently              he      d i d n ’t

have    a ticket              and      was     just       making     a general             nuisance           of      himself.

I then        saw      that       th e       large     blue      gate      that      had    been          opened        earlier             was

now    cl o s e d .         Then       about        eight     minutes           pa st     three       I received                a    radio

message        something               to     the     effect       ’All      serials        or       personnel             onto        the

emergency           code         ’Mr.        Meadows        urgently         required           at    the     Police            Room.*

I then        ran      through           a    large       blue     gate      to     the    extreme           right         of       the

turnstile           area.           I ran          through       into      the      area    behind           the      Leppings             Lane

stand       then       to     the      right        towards        the     re a r    of    the       Control          Bo x .         To     my

left    I could             see     terracing             (extreme         right        hand     corner          of    Leppings

Lane)       seemed          to    be     plenty        of    room.         I could         see       no    players           on      the

pitch,        but      I c o u l d n ’t see           any     fighting.

I then eventually                      made        my w ay    onto       the      pitch     vi a      a    gangway           in      the

outside        seating            area        of    the     South    Stand.             From     this        position               I could

see    l a rg e     numbers            of     officers        on    the      pitch        and    standing             on     the

fencing        behind            the L e p p i n g s        Lane    goal.           I saw       several        supporters

running        on      t he      pitch.            I asked       a steward          what        had       happened,             he    replied,

 'Fans      on    the    pitch           a    bit       of    trouble".               He       didn't       seem       really        concerned

Following          other          officers              I went       immediately                 to    the       fencing           behind       a

goa l.       I / c o u l d n ’t see               any    officer          who        appeared          to     be    taking          control.

 I joined         other       officers              at       the    fencing           urging          supporters              to    push

Wek,        at    the    same        time          waving.           At     th e      same       time       I heard           over    th e

 I can      recall       whilst              running          over       th e    pitch          to    the     area       behind       the

I continued             to    run        to       the    fence       and        what       I saw       I ’ll       never       forget.

Young       fans       faces        pressed             against          the     fencing,             pleading           to    be    rescued,

He    was    in d a n g e r         of       being       trod       on    by     the       other       supporters.                  I pulled

him a w a y       from       th e    perimeter                track.            He    was       conscious           he    appeared             to

be    okay.        I placed              hi m      in the          recovery           position and                shouted           over       to

He    was    lying       near        the          goal       posts       again        in       danger       of    being       trod     on.

was    carrying           a    bottle          of    Oxygen          1 put        the        tube       into       the       youth's          mouth

Several          other        Liverpool             fans       came     over          to     him and          they       said       they

would       stay     with        him.

equipment,           off       th e     perimeter              to a l l o w       the        ambulance             through,              to    give

one    of    these        hoardings             there          was     tw o      or     three        young         girls       at    on e      en d

weight       of    t he       hoarding          and       the       b o dy,      and       I subsequently                    injured          my

back.        No    real        pain        felt      at     t hi s     time.            Everybody             seemed          to    be    in a

state       of    shock.          1 wa s        never          made     aware           t h at     there          had    been       any

breakdown          in     radio         transmissions                  but       th e      general           radio       transmissions

on    the    day     were        poor.

My    overall        observations                   of    the       disaster            will       t a ke     many,          many years             to

useless,          people         were        crying        for       help        and       we    could        do    nothing.              As

part    of m y       normal           duty      I work          the P o l i c e          Control             at    Millmoor,             and

             But    one    thing       has   concerned      me,   was    that        th e    p ur e   location    of    the

             Control       Bo x   at    Hillsborough         overlooks        th e    area where         the   tragedy        took

             place.

             Were    not    the    officers         appreciative        of    the     developing         situation?           What

             was    the    feed    back      from    the   officers      working            the   perimeter      of    the    pi ter

             Couldn't       they       not   see    the    developing        crush      on    the     terraces?

While        stood        at    the       bottom           of    the       steps          we     saw       one     or        two     football

Mr.                                 He    expressed              concern              about         supporters               who       wanted              to

go     in    the     *pub'.              He    requested              Police           attendance                to     supervise                but

there        were        no    problems              existing             at    this          time       and     told        him we            would

return        if     required             to    do     so.           We    went        back         to    the      bottom            of     th e

steps,        present           at       this        time       parked          in a          car      some      10 0    yards            up     from

officers            would       be       travelling              with          th e    Liverpool                supporters                on     the

train        and     he       believed          there           would          be a       total          of     some     450         travelling

supporters               from       Liverpool.                  There          would        also         be     one     dog     man         from

British        Transport                 Police,           to    meet          the     arriving               train.

By     this    time           several          small        groups             of     Liverpool               supporters             were          maki*

Liverpool          supporters                who       had    become           abusive         when       not     allowed           into          the.

were    allowed           entry         into       the       public           house.          We    then       returned           to        our

position       at       the       Station.

We    then    received             a    radio          message           for     ou r    serial          to    attend        at     a

general       message             was    'Problems                with        supporters            -    drinking        on       the

All    quiet       on     arrival,            but       a    large        amount,        of    Liverpool              supporters              in

the    excess        of      150       sat    on       the    grass           banking         outside          shops     drinking

returned       to       our       position             at    the     Station.              Whilst         walking        down           the

road    with       PC     Cammock,            we       were       approached             by    a    group        of    Liverpool

supporters           three         adults          one       of     which was            wearing          a Glasgow           Rangers

shirt.        With        them         was    one       small        boy.         They        were      carrying         a    fold           up

stool.        We     advised            them       that       they        would         probably          no t    be a l l o w e d           in

with    this       stool.              They       said       they        had     only      taken        this      to    the       game        so

the    little        lad      could          see       onto       t h e 'pitch,          and       they       agreed     to       take        it

back    to    their          motor       vehicle.

By    this    time        I saw         large          numbers           of    Liverpool            supporters           making              their

way    down    the        main         road,       carrying              packs     of      beer      and       lager.         They           were

very    boisterous                shouting             and    singing.

I noticed          one       youth       in       particular              about         18-1*? y e a r s         about       5'9"        t a ll,

heavily       built          wearing          Union          Jack        shorts,         was       singing        louder          than

anyone       around          him.        He    definitely                 appeared            worse       for     drink.          His

mates       appeared          to    be       telling          him       to     keep      quiet.           They        then    moved           on
                                                                                                                                        PAGE

down    the      tr.a 1 n    road.

I then      heard           a mestage          over        the    radio          'Assis tarjce            required         outside

At    approfaiTiitely              2.00       pm    the     train        carrying            the     supporters            arrived.

On    leaving         station           arrangements              maae        to    hold       them       together         outside

the    pudic          house        (name       not       known).           The      supporters             all      aye    groups,

both    sexes,         were        very       well       behaved.             No    singing          or    chanting,            no

evidence         of    drink,           made       their        way    from        oft" t h e      Platform          down       the

steps.        We      were     then       joined           by    two     mounted          officers,            I believe                from

South     Yorkshire.

The    supporters             were       held       fo r    approximately                 5 minutes            in    the       s m all

triangular            area     outside             the     public        house.

1 noticed          that       two       men    at    the        rear     of      the     supporters            were       carrying               ts

urns.       We     were       then       instructed              to    escort          the     supporters            to    the

football         ground.            This       was       contrary          to      the    order         and    also       it w a s

rather      unusual           considering                the     supporters              were      so     quiet     and        well

behaved.

We    escorted         the     supporters                down     t he    main         road,       arriving         outside              the

Leppings         Lane        entrance          at    approximately                  2.15       pm.        No   problems

experienced                 with    the       supporters              from       leaving        the       station         to    arc ivir.:

turnstile          area,       outside          Leppings              Lane.

Already       there          was    a    large       amount           of s u p p o r t e r s    o u t s i d e the     ground             but

this    was      not       unusual        considering                 it w a s     a Semi       Final.              I was

elderly         man      (grey       ha i r , w e a r i n g        a    light       brown         Crombie          jacket           aged

about        65-70),       numerous               supporters approached                         him       asking        him      for

’T h e y ’ re      asking       me     if    I ’m     selling           tickets’.               In     fact      several

supporters            asked      this        elderly           man      for     spares,           evidently             they        had

travelled           without          tickets.

a    small      sterile         area        between          the       queueing          supporters              and     t.he a c t u a l

this       crowd      outside         the     turnstiles                to    assist         in      forming           some     kind             of

order.          The      numerous           times       we     were      asked        by     Liverpool             supporters

this       time     I saw       outside           the     Leppings            Lane       entrances              Superintendent

At    this      point      PC    Cammock            and      myself          moved       out      of      the    crowd        to      assist

a man        pushing       a    wheelchair,               who      requested             assistance              to    get      through

We     escorted       him       over      to     PC     Rose       and       PC    Morton          and    they       took        o v e r.

I believe        they        managed            to    get     him       into       the       ground.

There     seemed          a general             complaint           from          Liverpool             supporters             of     the

size     of    the    crowds           gathering             and    the       slowness             in    being       dealt           with

entering        at    the       turnstiles.

One    middle        aged       Liverpool             supporter              came       up    to    me    and      mentioned              in

relation        to    th e      crowd        gathering             that       they       had       the    same       attendance

every     week       at    Liverpool             and        manage       much       better.              In    reply        to       t hi s    I

pointed        out    that        they       don't          arrive       all       at    the       same       t i m e.

The     time    now       about        2.50      pm.         I was       surprised             to       see    a large           amount

of     supporters          climbing             onto        the    wall       above          the    turnstiles.                  I

mentioned        this        to    PC     Cammock,            and       also       that       they       seemed          to w a i t

several        seconds          before          jumping           off    the       wall       into       the     ground.

A Police        Officer           I believe             an    Inspector             then       appeared            on     the        wall,

th e    climbing          ceased        but      he     was       lifting          small       children            from        the

developing           crush        to    safety.

Again     myself          and     PC    Cammock             went    to       give       what       assistance             we     could,

and     I myself          could        f e el    th e       force       of    the       crowd       and       I withdrew

further        back       towards         th e       road.

I seemed        to    recollect              earlier          hearing             a radio          message         requesting

Public        transport           to    be      stopped           from       travelling             along        Leppings             Lane

but     I saw    the       buses        were         still        moving          through          the    crowd,          forcing

them     over    towards           the       turnstiles             in       the    bottleneck                area       outside

Leppings        Lane.

On     this    occasion           we    kept         th e    crowds          back       outside          the     metal         railings

The      mood       of    the     crowd       by    this        time          was     growing              more     volatile                bu t       no

evidence            of    violence           towards          us,        but     they        wei'e         continuing              to       p u sh.

the      turnstile           ares       began       to     edge          in     slowly          in a n        attempt          to       slow           dew

the      movement           of    the    crowd.            He       then       had     to       stop        because           of    the          sheer

weight         of    numbers.            He    then        left          the     position              in     the       cab a n d           standm

on     the     step       was     shouting          loudly           for        the    supporters                  to    stop       pushing,

but      the    crowd        appeared          not       to     hear          this,        or      tale       no    notice.

Inspector            Ellis        then       appeared           with          a m e g a p h o n e / h a i 1er            and       began           to

several         times.

At     this     stage        I d i d n ’t      se e      anything              to     indicate              th e    impending

disaster            even     though          there       was     a       large        crowd          but     this        is    usual             for

big      games.

It w o u l d        be    about      this      time        I heard             over        my    personal               radio       somebody

I was        then        approached           by a n o t h e r        Liverpool                 supporter               who    produced                 a

ticket         to    me     and    enquired           the       location              of    th e      North         Stand.              I

indicated            th e    general          direction              of    the        North          Stand         and    saw       that           a

large        double         blue    gate       to     th e      extreme             left        of    th e     turnstile            area

open,        about        3-4     feet.        People          were        not        rushing          in,         it    seemed             ai     if

somec-ne        was       checking           tickets          and     using           this       as    an      extra          turnstile,

but      I was       still        surprised           to      see     it       open.

usually             come        out      ten      minutes             before            start.            One       Liverpool             supporter

made       a    comment             that        the      start         had         not        been       delayed          and       that       I was

lying.              There        were       still           odd       supporters,                asking           for     spare       tickets.

I saw          FC    Rose        having           problems             with            on e    youth,          apparently             he       d i d n ’t

have       a ticket              and       was       just        m a l ing         a general              nuisance           of      himself.

I then          saw       that        the       large         blue          gate        that        had      been        opened       earlier             was

now     closed.                Then        about         eight         minutes                past       three       I received                a     radio

message             something              to     the       effect              ’Al l     serials            or     personnel             onto        the

I    then       ran       through           a     large          blue           gate      to     the      extreme           right         of       the

turnstile                area.           I ran         through              into        the      area        behind         the      Leppings             Lane

Lane)          seemed          to     be    plenty            of      room.             I could           see       no    players          on       the

pitch,          but       I c o u l d n ’t s e e              any      fighting.

I then          eventually                 made        my     way      onto            the     pitch         via     a gangway             in       the

outside             seating           area        of     the       South          Stand.             From         this      position               I could

see     large            numbers           of     officers             on        the     pitch           and      standing           on    the

running             on    the       pitch.             I asked              a    steward            what       had       happened,             he     replied

Following              other           officers          I went          i m m e d i a t e ]y        to    th e         fencing           behind        a

goal.            I couldn't              see       any       officer          who       appeared           to       be     taking           coiitrol.

1 joined              other        officers             at    the       fencing           urging          supporters                 to     push

I can           recall          whilst        running          over- tIte p i t c h                 to    the       area        behind        th e

I continued                  to    run       to    the       fence       and       what        I saw       I'll          never         forget.

Young           fans       faces        pressed          against             the    fencing,              pleading              to     be    rescued

but        we    couldn't              get    to    them       because             of     the       wire       railings.

I saw           four       or     five       bodies          just       piling          up     on    each          other.            It     somehow

reminded              me     of    'Belsen          victims',                faces       blue        and       they        were        being       trod

reaching              the       fence        was    the       strong          smell          of     alcohol             coming         from    th e

area        behind           that       goal.           By    this       time       the        officers             in     th e      left     hand

He    was        in    danger           of    being          trod       on    by    the        other       supporters.                      I pulled

him    away           from        the    perimeter             track.              He    was        conscious              he     appeared             to

another           couple           of    Liverpool             supporters                'stand           by       him'.

I went           to    another           casualty             who       appeared             to     have       a    severe           leg     injury.

He    was        lying          near     the       goal       posts          again       in       danger           of    being         trod    on.

position,           reassured             h i m,    and       he       told      me    his       name          was                  but    he

couldn't           remember          his     surname              or    where         he    came          from       in    Liverpool.

Several        other          Liverpool            fans       came       over         to    him          and    they       said     they

would     stay          with       him.

By     this    time          the    St.    John's            Ambulance             vehicle               came    round       the

perimeter           of       the    pitch,         we    began         moving          people,             hoarding,

photography               equipment          off        the       perimeter            to       allow          the    ambulance

through,           to     give      what     assistance                 they       could.

People        were        being      put     on     hoardings               used       as       stretchers,                and    taken

across        to    the       gymnasium.                I remember               helping             to    put       a young       girl

onto     one       of     these      h o a r d i n g s ,•there              was       two       or       three       young       girls     at

one     end    of       the    hoarding            attempting               to     lift         or       carry.           I went     to

their     assistance                and    quite         unknowingly                  they       le t      go    and       left    me     with

the     weight          of    the    hoarding            and       the      body,          and       I    subsequently             injured

my     back.        No       real    pain     felt           at    t hi s     tim e.            Everybody             seemed       to     be

in     a state          of    shock.         I was           never       made         aware          that       there       had    been

a ny    breakdown             in    radio     transmissions                      but       the       general          radio

transmissions                 on    the    day      were          p o or.

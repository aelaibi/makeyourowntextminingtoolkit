    Dear Sirs,

    Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975 -
    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Limited

    I thank you for your letter dated 15th July.

    After consultations with the Building Authority and in view of the fact
    that all of the barriers were tested prior to certification, the County
    Council is able to agree this year with the course of action which you
    propose. However, I would stress that this agreement is conditional
    upon it being recognised and accepted that it is without prejudice as '
    to what may be required in future years under the provisions of paragraph
    25(2) of the Safety Certificate.

    May I also mention the Certificates by:-

    (a)     a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer (as required by
             paragraph 24 of the Safety Certificate) as to all structural
             parts of the Stadium, excluding crush barriers and handrails;

    (b)     an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             26 of the Safety Certificate) as to the electrical installation
             within the Stadium; and

    (c)     an independent Electrical Engineer (as required by paragraph
             12(2) of the Safety Certificate) as to the condition of the
             Emergency Power Supply.

    I take it that if the Club has not already done so, they will shortly be
    requesting you to supply these.

                                                               Yours faithfully,

  Dear Mr

  Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium

 Following our conversation last week, regarding the standby operation of our
 200 watt CP04/200L ampliers using 48 volt lead acid accumulator banks, I have
 had conversations with our Chief Electronics Engineer, a&out charging rates
 etc.

 Our feeling is that, provided the equipment is not left switched on 24 hours
 per day, the charge rate would be acceptable and no excessive gassing of the
 accumulators would occur. The length of time that the amplifiers would be in
 operation (either standby or full use) during normal use for matches and
 practice sessions etc. (say 2 or 3 times per week for 2 hours +) would be
 sufficient to keep the batteries topped up, and in good condition. Unless the
 batteries are completely discharged (due to fault conditions or neglect) the
 charging circuit in the amplifiers will cope perfectly well, delivering a
 maximum Charge rate of about 6 amps. This rate would be limitted by the
 internal impedance of the charging circuit and power supply.

 In spite of our comments above, if you wish to go ahead with a seperate
 variable charge rate device we suggest that you contact the battery supplier
 or manufacturer for advice about a suitable unit. If you use such a charger
 with the batteries then you must put a diode with a minimum forward current
 rating of 10 amps and a peak inverse voltage rating of 60 volts inseries with
 the lead at pin 8 of the amplifier connector. Wire the diode so that current
 will flow from the battery to the amplifier, but not in the reverse direction,
 i.e. with the cathode end connected to the amplifier. A suitable diode would
 be Radio Spares Schottky barrier rectifier type 30A, stock muriber 262-472,
 two of which should be connected in series to each amplifier, between pin 8
 and the battery +ve terminal. The purpose of this diode pair is to prevent the
 amplifier charging circuit current flowing to the battery, but to allow current
 to flow from the battery to the amplifier in the case of mains failure. (The
 seperate variable rate charger would be inoperative anyway in the event of
 mains failure.)

I enclose another drawing of the circuit diagram with the diodes shown to
help your electrical contractor.

I feel I must draw your attention at this point to the hazards of using
banks of lead-acid accumulators on constant trickle charge, especially in
confined spaces. The gases given off by the electrolyte consist of two parts
hydrogen to one part oxygen and as such constitute a highly explosive
atmosphere. I would hope that you have made provision for adequate ventilation
in the battery storage area. The action of trickle charging means that these
gases are constantly being produced in quantities governed by the charge rate
and battery condition.

If you need any more information please contact me.

Yours sincerely




Technical Director

Dear Hr. England

             Extract Fans and Rewiring in the South Stand

       Thank you for your letter of 7 May, 1980 enclosing the two
invoices concerned with the above work.    We will insure that
we get copies of these direct in future.
       We are satisfied that the appropriate work has been carried
out and we therefore enclose certificates as follows:

                           for Rewiring in the South Stand.
       The Bradwell Electrical invo ice contains an addition for
VAT.   We believe this is valid since the rewiring and replacements
are remedial work to an existing installation.
       There is some work on emergency lighting for the South
Stand which is additional to the existing installation, and we
would hope that this portion    would be exempt from VAT.     We
would suggest that we separate out this amount when the relevant
work has been completed.


                                   Youra sincerely,

      Further to your site instruction for us to disconnect and
 re-route circuits in the 3 AC/DC Boards in the South Stand switch
 cupboard, we confirm that to find the correct neutral corresponding
 to each circuit proved difficult, due to earth faults. It was
 agreed, that we would try to isolate these faults hut owing to
 the limited time available we submit for your attention our report
 on the work carried out and our electricians findings during the
 course of this work.

 Dear Sirs,

                              Re:       Sheffield _Wednesday - Finergency Lighting

          We submit for your approval/variation our quotation for
 raising the lighting; on the Two Penistone Road Pylons to the
 T otd of~each Tower and for Supplying and Fixing Two Additional
 Light Points complete with Exit Legends in the first floor West
 Stand Corridor.

        Concerning the overtime worked, as we did not meet the
 specified completion date, we feel that a claim cannot be justified
 We did however, put in the overtime to improve the achieved
 completion date because of inclement weather our programme was
 much delayed.

        We have pleasure in enclosing our daywork rates for work
 authorised in the South Stand.

         It is hoped that completion will be 1979 but, we are aware
 of an increase in labour rates commencing January, 1930 and take
 this opportunity to include next years anticipated rates for your
 rec ords.

The original Intention of the v isit had been to check th at the outstanding m atters
re fe rre d to In the Note of the m eeting held on 12th November had been completed
o r were In the course of com pletion p rio r to the anticipated Issue of the C ertificate
by the County Council this week.

2.     M inor M atters

An Inspection of the ground showed th at a num ber of m inor m atters still required
attention, but the Club undertook to en su re th at these were attended to In the ib xt
few days.

3.     M ajor M atters

A.     E m ergency Lighting - South Stand

The m eetings which had taken place between the County F ire Service and M e ssrs.
Eastwood and P a rtn e rs since 12th Novem ber on the South Stand E m ergency Lighting
had produced agreem ent on an Interim arran g e m e it which would be regarded a s
acceptable for the duration of the existing battery life. F u rth er m odifications a t
that tim e would rem edy the shortcom ings of the existing Installation. D etails w ere
contained In the le tte r dated 12th Decem ber which M e ssrs. Eastwood and P a rtn e rs
had ad dressed to the F ire Service.

B.      South Stand Construction

The Building Authority ex pressed concern a s to what they saw a s a lack of stru c tu ra l
Integrity In the South Stand. In th e ir opinion, corrosion was contributing to the
p ro g ressiv e deterioratio n of the Stand which, It was felt, could only be p ro p erly
determ ined by a M l stru c tu ra l survey. The re p o rt forw arded by M e ssrs. Eastwood
and P a rtn e rs In the la s t week was not considered to be sufficiently com prehensive
to provide tte required Inform ation, and the b asis of calculation used could not be
ag reed as ap p rop riate. W hilst It was agreed th at th ere had not been a specific
w ritten req u est for such a full stru c tu ra l survey of the South Stand, the Building
A uthority felt th a t It had been Inherent in the detailed discussions which had taken
place that such a re p o rt would be fbrthcom lng. The Building A uthority w ere
concerned a t the possib ility that the requirem ents of the Building Regulations and
the Code of P ra ctice Safety F acto rs could not be m et; In p a rtic u la r the Structural
stability o f the South Stand In conditions of gale force winds and heavy snowfall
was m entioned.

F or the Club, D r. Eastwood agreed that the Stand would obviously not be built to the
sam e specification o r the san® construction standards nowadays, but pointed out
that, fo r Instm ce, none of the buildings In Sheffield built before 1970 could m eet
the la te s t wind p re s s u re req u irem en ts. Even the Building R esearch Station was \
evidently thinking In te rm s th at these req uirem en ts w ere u n reallstlcally high. In
his professional opinion, the Stand was structurally safe and able in p ractice to m eet
foo inaHtngs dem anded. In any case, the conditions which had been described a s
being possibly dangerous would mean In prab tlce that a m atch could not be played
and consequently no sp e ctato rs would be p re sen t.

 E xperience of the co rro sio n of Indoors ste e l in the Sheffield a re a showed this to be
 m inim al, and the Stand was reg u larly te s t loaded by sp e c ta to rs. S tructures such
 a s this would show obvious ex tern al signs, such a s crack s, well before th e re was
 any p o ssibility of collapse, and would be readily apparent on even a superficial
 visual Inspection. Even though he did not consider It e ssen tial, pl&itog of the
 fron t steel columns had been c a rrie d out a s a com prom ise to try and m eet the
 Building A uthority’s concern. He agreed th ere m ight well be a continuing
 m aintenance problem with the stand, but this was a different m a tter to saying th ere
 was a stru c tu ra l problem . R eference was made to the Guide’s advice th at when
 a sse ssin g whether existing situations provided adequately for the safety of sp e ctato rs
 the c rite rio n to be used Is that of a reasonable degree of safety. In D r. Eastwood’s
  view, It would be unreasonable and u n n ecessary to In sist on a full stru c tu ra l survey
 of the South Stand o r to delay the Issue of the C ertificate. It was his professional
  opinion (which he was m ost jealous of and would not put In jeopardy) th at the Sasuth
  Stand was stru ctu rally safe and th at the basis of the calculations provided was
  ap p ro p riate. He was p rep are d to advise the Club to u se the appeal procedure open
  to them should this be n ecessary .
IT WAS AGREED that:

(a)   a s th ere was no obvious d eterio ration in the South Stand stru c tu re of such
       a nature a s to be of im m ediate concern, no objection would be raised to the
       continuance o f the derby gam e with Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning
       provided th at no extrem e w eather conditions o ccurred in the intervening
       period, and

(b)     a f u r t h e r m eeting should be held a s a m atter of urgency between the Building
        A uthority and D r. W. Eastwood to d iscuss the stru ctu ral Integrity of the
       South Stand and the ap prop riateness of the calculations used (Mr. D. Vaughan
       to be p re se n t a t D r. Eastw ood's request).

NOTE As the discussions on the South Stand Construction hinged on stru ctu ral
     theo ries and p rac tice s, the F ire Service and P olice rep resen tativ es felt
     th e re was little they could contribute and left the m eeting p rio r to its
     term ination.

Brief Specification of Works Associated with
The Installation of a Fire Alarm System and
Modifications to the Existing P.A. Amplifier
System at Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Hillsborough


     These works shall include the provision
and installation of a fire alarm system including
all cables, equipment and labour, as indicated
on the drawings and detailed below.


System

     The system shall be of the open-circuit,
monitored type, operating on 24 volts d.c., the
supply being derived from a battery/charger unit
sited in the Public Address/Commentary box
situated at the corner of the ground between the
West and South Stands.

     It should be noted that alarm sounders will
not be installed throughout the stadium. On
actuation of any alarm call point, the relevant
zone indicator light on the alarm indicator
panel will be illuminated and an auxiliary
bu zzer, which will be mounted on or adjacent
the panel will be actuated.

     Final confirmation of any action required
will be transmitted to the Stadium occupants
by means of the Public Address System.

     All of the fire alarm equipment, as detailed
below, shall be as manufactured by Chloride
Gent Limited.


Con t acts

     Alarm C o n t a c t s (break glass type) shall be
installed at the positions shown on the drawings
with centres at 1.35 M above finished floor level
The contacts shall be of the surface mounting
pattern, catalogue number 1102.


End of Line Resistors

     In order to provide monitoring facilities
it will be necessary to install resistors at the
end of each run of zone break glass contacts,
as indicated on the wiring diagram.  These
resistors shall be as catalogue number 9122/01.
                  BUZZER

                       The auxiliary buzzer, which is to be supplied
                  and installed on or adjacent the main indicator
                  panel, shall be as catalogue number 399.


                  Main Indicator Panel

                       The main indicator panel, which is to be
                  installed in the Public Address/Commentary box
                  shall consist 6 zone indicator lights (one being
                  spare), fire indicator light (used in conjunction
                  with zone indicator), Zone fault indicator light,
                  alarm sounder fault light and power supply fault
                  indicator.  The panel will also have a zone reset
                  push button, cancel fault sounder push button and
                  silence alarm sounder push button.  Actuation of
                  the latter in the event of a fire alarm indication,
                  will silence the auxiliary buzzer mounted adjacent
                  and will automatically operated an internal audible
                  signal which will remain in operation until the
                  relevant alarm contact(s) have their broken glasses
                  replaced.

                       The panel shall be as catalogue number 3213/D.


                  Battery/Charger Unit

                       The battery/charger unit, which shall also be
                  installed in the Public Address/Commentary box
                  shall be as catalogue number 5202 and shall be
                  complete with 20 x EP2 nickel cadinium cells.


                  Wiring System

                       Wiring of the fire alarm system shall be
                  carried out using 1.5 sq. mm m.i.c.c./p.v.c.
                  sheathed cable.  The cable shall generally be
                  installed on the surface of structures but as
                  discreetly as possible e.g. the cable shall run,
                  whenever possible, in corners between wall and
                  ceilings or between adjacent walls etc.


Modification to        In order to provide warning or instructions
P.A. System       to the occupants of the stadium by means of the
                  public address system, in the event of a fire
                  alarm situation, it is a requirement that the
                  P. A. system be operable from an alternative
                  auxiliary supply in the event of mains failure.

                       The existing P.A. equipment is as manufactured
                  by Tannoy and is suitable for use with an external
                  auxiliary 48V d.c. supply when modified, as
                  indicated on the drawings and detailed below.

Division Street,
Sheffield 1.

For thaaattentlon of Mr. K. Jones


    )


Dear Sirs,
            Sheffield Wednesday Football Club
             South Stand Emergency Lighting
     Following our recent meetings, we now confirm the proposals
which have been discussed and agreed with Mr. K. Jones.
     We enclose a coloured up copy of our drawing 1610/4IB,
together with the corresponding circuit identification sheet
which indicate the proposed circuit arrangements and additional
light fittings to be installed.   The red coloured areas are
those where the predominant illumination is provided by the
battery-supported circuits, the yellow and uncoloured areas are
those where the predominant lighting is served from mains-only
circuits.
     Either system on its own, we believe will provide adequate
illumination on all escape routes to satisfy the provisions of
B.S.5266.   Normally both systems are in operation fed by mains
power to provide the required level of normal illumination.
In the event of mains failure the emergency system is automatically
transferred to the battery supply.
     The two main exits El and E2 from the upper access level will
be checked for illumination level under failed emergency circuit
and two additional mains fed lights will be added if necessary to
meet the required illumination feevel.
     We understand that the above proposals will be acceptable
only for the duration of the existing battery life.   When the
time comes for battery replacement, we would propose further
modifications which, in addition to reducing the battery
load, would remedy the shortcomings of the existing installation
in regard to physical separation of the cable routes and
switchgear between the normal and emergency systems.   These
modifications would achieve compliance with B.S.5266 by locating
switch or fuse gear in separate fire protected zones and by
cabling with MICC or in steel conduit where normal and
emergency circuits run parallel.
     Work is now in progress to implement the present proposals,
and we anticipate that this will be completed by the Christmas
break or shortly after.

                                Yours faithfully.

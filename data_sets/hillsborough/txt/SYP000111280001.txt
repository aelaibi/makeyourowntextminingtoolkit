On my walk         towards          the ground,           I clearly    heard S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

END OF REPORT
ROBERT IAN PRICE            CHIEF INSPECTOR

SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE      HQ COMMUNITY LIAISON DEPARTMENT




At 9 ^5 am on Saturday 15 April 1989, I paraded for duty at

Hillsborough Football Stadium in accordance with the Operational

Order for the F.A. Cup Semi-Final soccer fixture between Nottingham

Forest F.C. and Liverpool A.F.C.




I had attended the briefing for senior officers which had been held

the previous morning in the North Stand at the ground.




I was responsible to Superintendent Chapman (Sector 3) and was

deputed to supervise sub-sector 3B, which consisted of serials

57-64, in turn commanded by Inspectors Bateman, Burgess and Wallace.




I policed the adjacent sub-sector for the 1987-88 F.A. Cup Semi-

Final at Hillsborough in my capacity as a Chief Inspector.




I have performed duty at Hillsborough regularly as an Inspector and

Police Sergeant and have also assisted in policing at Millmoor,

Bramall Lane and Oakwell grounds during my service.




Following briefing the North Stand, I commenced supervisory foot

patrol along Herries Road South, paying particular attention to the

Five Arches public house, where six personnel carriers from the

Nottingham area were seen parked and unattended in the car park.     As

officers from Inspector Bateman's serials arrived, I directed them
                                  - 2 -



to prevent further minbuses parking at or near to the premises, but

to send them to Rawson Spring Road.       This instruction was to ensure

that passengers would be aware of their vehicle's parking place and

would assist in segregating fans from the opposing clubs.




Once there were sufficient officers at the Five Arches public house,

I continued up hill to the    Devonshire A rm s , in company with

Inspector Bateman.   It was   apparent that those premises were also

the meeting point for Nottingham Forest supporters.




I subsequently returned to    the Five Arches and saw Supt. Chapman who

expressed concern that the    premises were full. After briefing

Inspector Bateman and Inspector Wallace (the latter in a 'Tango'

mobile) to pay particular attention to the premises, I was conveyed

by Mr Chapman in his Land Rover to a point in Herries Road South

near to Penistone Road.




Mr Chapman briefed me to pay attention to public houses in Penistone

Road including the Royal, Bradfield Road, where a build-up of

drinking supporters had been noted.




I had to return to the gymnasium at the stadium to exchange my radio

(set 14) as it was not receiving properly.




A member of the communications staff checked the radio and returned

it to me and I patrolled towards Neepsend, meeting up with Inspector
                                  - 3 -



Burgess and several officers en route to the Royal public house.




On arrival at the premises, I found a Sergeant evacuating the

premises following incidents of disorderly behaviour.     The surrounds

of the pub were heavily littered with empty pint glasses, bottles

and cans.   By 2 00pm the premises were cleared and locked.




I received personal radio messages of trouble at the Victoria public

house, Neepsend, involving Special Constables.    Sergeant Dent, Dog

Section and 'Tango' units went to their assistance.     I remained in

Penistone Road to monitor the behaviour of Nottingham supporters ,

who were walking along Penistone Road towards the ground.




About that time, a coach containing Liverpool supporters drove along

the road in the same direction.    A number of supporters were stood

in the coach gesticulating at Nottingham fans.




Althugh the Forest supporters appeared to have been drinking

heavily, they were good humoured and continued in a steady stream to

the ground.




I am a season ticket holder at Nottingham Forest F.C. and the

behaviour of fans was no worse than I saw at Wembley for the

Littlewoods Cup Final the previous weekend.    There was more evidence

of drinking that I have experienced at League and other Cup games

this season.
                                  -   4   -




After 2 50pm, Inspector Burgess and I began to patrol back towards

the ground, talking with fans en route.




I arrived outside the ground approximately 3 05pm.     I saw the

Nottingham Evening Post reporter, Tony Donnelley, and three Notts,

officers in the vicinity of the car park entrance.




On my walk towards the ground, I clearly heard Superintendent

Marshall radio for "gate to be opened" on two separate occasions.

After the second call, in which there were screams and cries of

panic in the background, I heard a controller advise that "Sergeants

916 and 993 have been sent to open the gates".     I then heard Mr

Marshall ask for the game to be postponed for 15 minutes.     I heard

no reply.




At 3 05 pm, I spoke to Pc 1200 Woodward who was standing at the car

park entrance gate and warned him that I expected a group of around

50 Forest fans to try and d i m into the ground.




I then heard a huge roar from the Liverpool end of the ground

followed by silence.   Seconds later, I saw P.s. Dent and 2 other dog

handlers emerge from their vehicles, leash their dogs and ran

towards 'O' gate.   I heard nothing on my radio.




I entered the ground and went down the ramp to the perimeter track

in front of the Spion K op .   I there saw Supt Chapman who instructed
                                 - 5 -



me to form a cordon   facing the Spion Kop.   I saw what    seemed to be a

pitch invasion at the Leppings Lane/North Stand corner of the

ground.




I continued the cordon along the track, assisting in pushing several

Forest fans off the fence from where they had climbed as though to

get onto the field.   I then moved to the front of theSouth Stand,

which is unfenced.    I saw Liam O'Kane standing on the     pitch but no

players.   Then Archie Gemmill and Ron Fenton walked from the players

tunnel and gestured to the Forest supporters to cease their chanting

and gesturing.




I saw a young Liverpool supporter run up the centre of the pitch

towards the Spion Kop, making obscene gestures at the opposing

supporters.   He was detained.




Minutes later an elderly Liverpool supporter weaved up the pitch

making 'V' signs at the Forest fans.     He was detained.




A man climbed out of the South Stand and said that he was a doctor

and asked if he could help.




Although the public address system appeared to have been operating,

the noise of the crowd, exacerbated by the incursion of the 2

Liverpool supporters precluded my hearing what was said.        I heard

nothing on my radio and had no idea of what was taking place at the
                                - 6 -



Leppings Lane end.




I accompanied the doctor to the opposite end and he went to tend to

the first prostrate body we happened on at the end of the penalty

area.




The time by now was after 3 15pm.

                Regional Controllers         (Planning)



                FOOTBALL LEAGUE


                Many thanks to those who sent in material in connection
                with the League Seminar on Taylor implementation.  This
                was useful both in preparing my speech and in considering
                possible questions.

                Other than a strong piece in support of what I'd said (and   â€™
                a self-publicity plug) from GJW Government Relations, reaction
                was rather muted.  This was the case throughout the day.
                Both Bristol and Luton had a word afterwards - Bristol expect
                to be turned down and to appeal (they thought the lpa wanted
                to pass the buck), while Luton say Green Belt restrictions
                make life extremely difficult.

                I learned at the seminar that GJW have advised the Leagqe
                at national level to approach Regional Controllers.   I attach
                a copy of my speech and of the latest draft of the Sport
                ana Recreation PPG, which may be of assistance.   (Public
                consultation on trie PPG is currently held back by problems
                with DES on school playing fields.)

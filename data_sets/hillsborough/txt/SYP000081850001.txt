a       policeman            trying        to       close       the     gate,        so     I put       my       hand     on    it       to    keep

it o p e n         to    go       in,     which        I did.         My    friends            did     not       get    in,     I cannot

describe              this        policeman.

Other           than     the        policeman             on    the     horses         I did          not    see       any     person

policeman               or    otherwise              giving          any    kind       of      directions              outside           the

ground.

Inside           the     gate        I saw about                twelve          policemen and                f iv e     or     six       stewards,

none         of w h i c h a s k e d            me    about          my t icket         or      even     spoke          to me        for

anything,               they were              not    giving          me a n y       directions.

I waited              there         for    my       frineds          for a b o u t        three        or    four       minutes,              T. w a s

watching              the     turnstiles              for       my    friends          to a p p e a r        when        I noticed             the

gate         opening.             I cannot           say who          opened         the       gate     as       there        was    both

policemen and                     stewards           around.

When         the      gate        was     open       thousands             of    fans       piled       in,       it w a s      about          2.55pm

at      this       stage.           For    a while             I was       trying         to     dodge       the       crowd        while

looking            for       my     mates       but       I thought             if   I stood           there       I would           be

stampeded.

            I cannot            describe          t h is     Policeman.

            There        was     a growing           number           of     people          building        up       behind      the     goal         a r e a.

            Police        were        trying       to      c l e ar     the      pitch,         after       a t i me     the P o l i c e           then

 The    next        announcement                    I h eard was             approx          16 —       15 hrs        when    the       match

 was    abandoned and                     if we       held        onto       our       tickets          they    would        be    valid           for

 the    next        match.           We    were       also        asked         to     stay      inside        the     ground          so     as       not

 to    block        roads        in o r d e r         to       keep       them       clear       for       ambulances.

 I then went              to a g a t e              and    asked          a Policeman              if      I could      go    onto          the

 pitch       to     look        for       my    friends,             this       I did        but      did     not     see a n y        of     them.

 I then asked a Policeman                                 if    I could             lea ve      the     ground,        he    said       I could.

 I left        the      ground            through          pen       ’6"     and       left      through        ’B ’ g a t e       and        went

 to af p o in t         where         I had a g r e e d              to m e e t        them      if we        got     lost,       they        were

 rjpt t h e r e      so     I went             to    the       " H a l l s ’ to m e e t          them.

#The    injuries            I        r e c e i v e d was          slight            bruising          to    the s t e r n u m a r e a a n d a

 slight        mark       on         my    forearm             due     to    pressure            from       the fence.

 During        this       season           I have          visited           Villa         Park       once,        Portman        R o a d four

 tim e s ,     Upton        P a r k,       twice,          Manchester                C i t y,   Barnsley            and Leeds           all

 these       last       three         venues          following              Ipswich.            I have        also     been       to

 Goodison           P a rk,      and       Sheffield              United            Ground       three        times.        I also          went

 to S h e f f i e l d       Wednesday               Ground           once       before,          but       I was      in the       Spion           Kop

 end.I       decided            to a t t e n d        this        game       (Liverpool               v Notts         Forest)          du e      to

 Further          to m y        comments             having          entered           through          the    gates        when       the       fans

 started          pouring            in,       there       was       no     visible          directions             being     given           to

 anyone.          I noticed               when       I got        to      the       en d   of    the       tunnel      that       the       pens

 where       full,        I feel           there          should          have       been       directions            given       to    enter

 the   side         pens        as    while          I was        in t h e r e         t h e y xfid not         appear        to       be     full.

 I would          say     it was           about          2.35pm          when       I at/rived at             th e    entrance             and        I

                another        4 - 3          minutes        until        the       gate     was    opened        the    second          time       and

                thats      when       I made          my way          to w h e r e    i stood        in the        pen,       t ha t     would       be

                about      3pm      or    just        after.          It was        roughly another               three       or    four       minutes

                before       1' got       out     of       the    pen,        it m i g h t    have    been        shorter          as    time

                piping         with       the     first          aid,     but       where     just    standing           around.             Also    there

                were     Policemen             standing           from        one    side     of    the     pitch       to    the       other       they

                appeared         to      be    tw o    deep.          I thought          they      could     have       been       helping

                instead        of     trying          to    prevent           trouble.

                I would        describe           myself          as    being        a white       male      with       "spike"          effect       I am

                about      5 ’ 7"        tall     and weigh              10    1/2.        I am     clean        shaven and             on    15th

                April      1989,         I was        wearing          a denim        jacket       denim         jeans       with a white             tee

VENUES FOR POSSIBLE REPLAYS OF THE CHALLENGE CUP SEMI-FINAL
   TIES Messrs. J.F. Wiseman, L. Smart and E.A. Croker were
   authorised to selct venues for possible replays for Semi-Final
 â–  Ties of the Challenge Cup Competition, after the results of
   Sixth Round Proper Replays were known.


VENUES FOR YOUTH MATCHES The Chairman referred to a statement
  made at the Council Meeting earlier that day in respect of
  the very low attendance at the England v. Iceland Under 16
  match played at the ground of Crystal Palace Football Club
  and whether thought should be given to such matches being
  played on the grounds of senior non-Football League clubs.
  The Chairman explained the problems involved in deciding
  venues for youth games and suggested that the matter should
  be kept under review.


ENGLAND v. ITALY - U.E.F.A. UNDER-21-SEMI-FINAL TIE -
  FIRST LEG - 12TH APRIL, 1984 It was decided that the
  game be played on the ground of Manchester City Football
  Club.


HIRE CARS FOR WEMBLEY MATCHES Reference was made to a
  recommendation of the Finance Sub-Committee, which had been
  brought before Council that morning, that certain arrangements
  made in respect of hire cars for members of the Match and
  Grounds and Challenge Cup Committees be discontinued.
  Disappointment was expressed that the matter had been referred
  to Council prior to it having been considered by the Match
  and Grounds and Challenge Cup Committees, as it was felt
  that had they been aware of all the facts, favourable
  consideration might have been given to the suggestion.   It
  was agreed that the Chairman should make strong representation
  to the Finance & General Purposes Committee that certain relevant
  facts and figures on this matter should be put before the
  Match and Grounds Committee before it was re-submitted to
  Council.
 The Secretary pointed out the likelihood of courtesy cars
 being supplied by General Motors for forthcoming Wembley
 matches.

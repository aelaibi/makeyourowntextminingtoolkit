                    n Saturday,       9 April,       1988     (090488)       I was      enga ge d t og ether with my

                unit at the FA C u p S emi-Final                    between N o t t i n g h a m Forest FC and

                Liverpool         FC at H i l l s b o r o u g h    football     ground,       Sheffield

                We were     positioned           before     the m at ch at        the    junct io n          of L ap pi ng s Lane

                public    order at          that    location.

                It did t r a n sp ir e       that    there were        no    public      order     problems and our

                unit was      for     the most       of the time         di re ct in g     suppo rt er s         to the       corret

               ends of the           ground.        I did not erect any              barriers           or    cause     to be

               e r e c t e d at    the    j u n c t i o n of L ep pi ng s Lane an d P e n i st on e Roa d North,

               match.

               The L iv erpool           s up po r t e r s at that     l oc ation were a l l o w e d             to move       freely

        On Saturday the 9th April 1988, I was engaged on duties together with my unit

        at the F.A. cup semi-final between Nottingham Foraet .F.C. and Liverpool F.C.

        at Hillsborough football ground Sheffield*

        We were positioned before the match at the junction of Leppings ^ane and

        Penistone Road North our primary function being to maintain public order at

        that location*

        It did transpire that there were no public order problems and our unit was

        for the most of the time directing supporters to the correct ends of the ground,

        I did not erect any barriers or cause to be erected at the junction of

        Leppings lane and Penistone Hoad North, with a view to filtering the

        Liverpool supporters through and checking to ensure that they were in

        possession of tickets for the match*

        The Liverpool supporters at that location were allowed to m w e freely along
        Leppings Lane ftgwSrds the ground*

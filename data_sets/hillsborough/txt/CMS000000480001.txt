                           T hank you for your letter of 5 June 1990 enclosing this one from
                           the Bristol Football Club about the rebuilding of their centenary
                           grandstand.

                           The first point in the club's letter is about the                               Taylor      report
                           and its a p pl i cation to sports other than soccer.

                           I u n d e r s t a n d from the Home O f f i c e that o f f i c i a l s there have
                           r ec en t ly met the Rugby Football Union about the p ro vision of all
                           seated a cc om mo da ti on at rugby grounds.         The RFU have mad e the
                           c ase that c onversion to all seating would be difficult, expensive
                           and almost c er t ai nl y u nnecessary for rugby union club grounds.            I
                           g ather that t hese points will be put to Home O f f i c e Ministers
                           b efore any final d ec isions are taken.

                           This should not however inhibit the Bristol club from planning
                           ground improvements which they may feel should include provision
                           for additional seating in line with the reco mm en da ti on s by Lord
                           J us ti ce Taylor.

                           The remainder of the Bristol club's letter is concerned with the
                           ope ra ti on of the building regulations.                      I u nderstand that Bristol
                           City Council have now issued a formal approval of the plans in
                           c o n n e c t i o n w i t h t h e r e b u i l d i n g of t h e c e n t e n a r y s t a n d on t h e
                           b a s i s t ha t 8 s t a i r w a y s w i l l be p r o v i d e d .        It s e e m s f r o m t h e
                           club's letter that they p r o po se to c ha llenge that decision by
                           s e e k i n g a d e t e r m i n a t i o n f r o m t h e S e c r e t a r y of S t a t e for th e
                           Environment that their original plan with only 6 stairways would
                           afford safe passage for the users of the grandstand and thus meet
                           the r eq ui re me nts of the Building Regulations 1985.

                           In t he se c i rc umstances it would be wrong of me to comment at this
                           s tage on the points raised by the Club on the merits of their
                           p r o p o s a l as t h e s e w i l l no d o u b t f o r m p a r t of t h e i r f o r m a l

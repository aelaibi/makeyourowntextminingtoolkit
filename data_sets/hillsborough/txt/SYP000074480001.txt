getting        souvenirs            from      persons         selling       flags,     scarves      etc.   Ho wever       .1

had been the year                   before.

I immediately                started        to    look for       the    turnstile          section    1 had to enter

by because             there were           no    programme        sellers       outside & due         to the       crowas

I    thought      I had better                enter      earlier,,

I found the turnstile                       section marked             '8 ’ & joi. nea a queue             to enter

I had no        problems            finding        the    turnstile          sect i o n    1 wanted    to go through

Upo n    going         into       the    back of the stand              I saw that          it was    quite       empty &

there were             no    police       officers ar o u n d & no stewards                   around.       I saw a

                Upon     entering         the    tunnel w hich was              very narrow         for the amount              of

                thro u g h      the     tunnel.       I was     pushed a long with              them & had to           put my hands

                I stayed at             the    back    of    pen 3 & moved          close       to the middle           fence as

                people were             pushing       from behind & rnoving/forward.                     I wanted        to stay at

It was      hot & people a r o u n d me were a l r e a d y sweating & it was                           difficult

to move       freely.       I wanted       to go for a drink            but    there was        no

signs    directing          people    to the       teabars & even            if I had of gone           it

w o u l d have meant         I would       have    had to         push & shove my way back              through

the    crowd behind to get                out.    So    I decided      to stay where           1 was.

I now had to start             holding       onto       the   fence w i t h one        hand & held my

programme       in the other          in an effort            to stop myself           being    pushed

forwards       down the       terrace       as more & more            people    came     in from       behind.It

was    full    i n the      pen & mo r e     peo p 1e seemed to be             comi ng    i nto our      pen

By now      it was        very hot & you. werys unable                to a*ffve freely you            had to go

wh a t e v e r way the       crowd went.          I Mta s only s .y i e to hoi d onto               the fence

for about 5 minutes              because my / a r m was j/eing bent               back agai n s t        the

               2. 10pm      (1410 h r s ) I was          gewmg        crushed,     i    was    having

d i f f i c u l t y breathing & noticed that a. large                    group of        people       naa just

entered       the    pen from       the    tunnel.       I believe      they were all           from one

coach as       they a p p e a r e d to know each other.                 They all        came    in <% started

to    push forwards,          causing       the    crowd to surge away from me & creating a

gap    in front       of me & to my          right.       I decided to move             into this       gap &

towards       the    front    of the       pen as       it was      getting    very uncomfortable.

About    3 other          people also m o v e d forwards              into    this gap & I made my

w a y down     the    pen & pushed          through a few            people & ended            up stanaing

behind a barrier w hich was about 3 metres                             from the side           fence

seperating          the    centre    pens & about 5 metres               from the front              railings.

As    I stood here          I was    directly          behind the      crash barrier & the more                     I

 tood there          the more       the    pressure       built      up behind me        causing me          to be

pushed forwards & my s t o m a c h was                   being      crushed against           the    barrier.           I

was   unable        to move    fr e e l y and at one              stage my elbow was           stuck    in

By about S. 30prn (1430 hrs)                  I decided        that        1 would have          to move away

from the       back of the barrier & decided to go under                                  the    barrier & stand

in front       of     it.    I noticed a lot of              people        climbing       over the middle

fence     into the          other    pen & I. thought          that        it might       ease    the   crush but

it didn't,           more & more         pressure was         building           up behind me.          I saw about

3 people       go under        the     barrier & decided              to go under          in the gap that

d e v e l o p e d whilst      I had the       chance.        I went        under    the    barrier       but    I had

to    push    people who were              in front      of the       barrier       forward a bit          so that

I could stand up again.

1 was     now d i r ectly          in front      of the      barrier &           it w a s n ’t to bad there.                I

could     breathe       easier       but my back was           right against              the    barrier &

a l t h o u g h at    this    time      I w a s n ’t being     pushed from behind there was

slight       pushing        backwards       from    in front         of me.       1 was still       unable        lo

move    freely & somehow more & more                      people          came    under    trie barrier & the

next    tning        I knew    I was about 2 steps               down from the             barrier & started

due    to the amount           of      people ar o u n d the         barrier.       I noticed       people        in

front     of me also          starting       to go down onto               the    floor as the          crowd

surged & they were                 unable    to get      back up & were             being       trample d on by

people       behind who were             being     pushed f o r w a r d s .I was          looking       down to try

& stop myself           from standing            on anyone       but       I had to keep my head up in

the end as           I was scared, of               getting my head stuck down & then                     i

wouldn't           have    been able          to    breathe.

I could feel              people       behind       me    grabbing my legs as they tried                  to    puli

t h emselves         back    up but was             unable       to move to see who           it was     or assist

them     in any way.

I think        by now the actual                   game    had started       but     1 was    unable      to see any

of    it as        I was    having       to use all my energy to stay up & stop myself

being      crushed.         It was at          this       stage    I noticed a man who had a boy of

about 8 yrs           old on his          shoulders          in front       of me & he was          trying       to

keep the           boy up but          he kept       slipping.       Myself and some            others     around

also     tried       to keep him up but                   there was about 3 youths                of   about 19 yrs

in front & to the                 right       of me       who were        stood    next     to each    other &

a p p e a r e d dead.       They were          blue       in the    face    in fact       one of them wasn't

as    blue as        the    other       two & we          thought at       first     that    perhaps      he was

still      alive      but after a bit                it became a p p a r e n t       that    he was also         dead.

a few      policemen             one who       had a di/terent             hat     on to the     rest?      it was a

           the e m ergency         gate at      the   front    of the      pen & to my         right was         opened by

           a    police     officer       2 people were          taken out of the           pen,     a third       person

           out were        being      searched.       It was    this    that made me very angry.                  People

           they thought          there was       trouble & people were              just      invading      the       pitch.

           There was        then a call         of something        like    "Do    it,   do    it now".         I think        it

           was    by a senior          officer & suddenly a load of                 police        officers       climbed

           the    fence     I became         aware    of a loud bang & c r a c / from behind & m e r e

           was a brief          silence       then    suddenly     loud scr&ajrfing & a            t r emendous surge

           from behind.            I realised         that the     barrier     I had earlier             climbed under

           had broken & people were                   being    pushed forwards.          There was         no    room     m

           front       of me    but    s u d d e n l y there was a gap       in front         of me & to the            right

           as    the    crowd from        behind      surged forwards        I could feel           people       falling

           down behind me & grabbing                   onto my     legs & ankles         but      couldn't       do

           anyt hi n g .

           We were       pushed       into this       gap   it was as      if only half           the

           barrier       had    c o llapsed & we ended up right               at the       front        railings

           ag a i n s t a main        post    that    held the metal        grid up.       We then bounced              back

           from there & people                came from the sides           of us & ended up at                 the    front

           of the grid.          We ended       up    behind them & in fact              Iwas      lifted off the

           ground about 6 inches.                I    could feel myself           being pushed up as             I     was

           being       crushed from behind but                by this    stage     I c o u l d n ’t feel        the bottom

of my feet & the             tops    of my feet were             very    painful       due to the amount

of      t r eadi ng & s tarnping that         they         had taken .

As      I had been pushed against              the main          front post s e parating            the       grids

I hit my right          shoulder       against       the    post whilst          the    rest of my body

was      pushed to the grid,           this was very             painful    & I believe that                 it was

at      this    stage the     eme r g e n c y gate was opened because                  there     was a        surge

the     tops of our       heads      from behind & then             climbing       over    the fence,               I.

was     being hit      in the       head & ear,       by these          people    1 noticed a b o u t _ 3

dead as        they were      not moving & seemed                lifeless.        T here were           faodies on

the     floor    in front      of me    I could see one man was                   dead as he was               lying

these as        I wasn't      sure    if they were          aead.

As    the    e m ergency gate was        opened       there was a surge                towards      1   1 then w^e

were     pushed back         towards    the    left & then we mana g e d to stay                        m     the

same     position.

Pe o p l e were      still    getting    out    of         the    pen by going over the             top but          ay

now most        people were         getting    out         through the      emergency gate.

A fter      about    ten minutes       the    crush eased & a gap a p p e a r e d from D e h i n d &

I started to make my way up the                      pen towards           the back,      I could see

people       being    pulled up out of the             pen       into    the   seated area.                 I had to

go under a barrier & then                I was able           to walk       up towards         the bacs<

turnstiles,

I was w i t h other       injured      persons waiting        for a mbulances & noticed

across      & away     from me    there was a row of about; 30 people who were                  dead

& covered over.                                                  /

tanks    between us all          & we were       told not    to go to sleep & 1 had to keep

knocking      the     person    next   to me to stop him going            to sleep.




I feel      that what     h a p p e n e d was   inevitable a y       last year    I was   crushed &

this year       the    same a g a i n happened.       Tne Liverpool           fans were   given the

wrong    end,   we have a muc h         larger average        gate     than the Notts      forest
             1 feel       the Police       did     not    react    c o r r e c t l y , t h e y we r e e p e c t i n g crowd

             trouble & kept            thinking      it was       crowd trouble        they a p p eared      blind to

             the    fact     it was     obv i o u s l y   not   crowd trouble        at first,       I feel     they

             could have         realized sooner what was                 really happening.             1 don't     think

             they were         treating      the    fans as humans          they wouldn't         listen to what

             they said.             There were also         no stewards a r o u n d at all.

             As    soon as      they    realized though what was                 happening      everyone       did as

             much as       they      possibly      could to help.           The medical        staff    in pa rticular

             were     excellent.

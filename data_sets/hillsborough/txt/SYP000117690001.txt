            On    the a b o v e     d a te     I commenced            duty       at    8 . 0 0 a m at         F.2.

            Following         the      morning        briefing           I cleared           my    d e sk     then       accompanied

            Superintendent               Chapman        to    the    Sheffield           Wednesday             Football              club

            ground,        for    the     briefing           at    1 0 . 0 0 am.

            1 was      to w o r k      with     Superintendent                 Chapman        on S e c t o r        3    (Nottingham

            Following         the      briefing         I had a d i s c u s s i o n           with Superintendent

            Chapman,        then       spoke     to     several          officers         in the         Serials          and,        shortly

            before        11.00 am went              to my        area    of     responsibility.                    This       area

            included        Herriss           Road    S o u t h , Herries             Road    and     t ha t      stretch           of

            situated        and also           where     entrance           to    the    North        Stand         is g a i n e d .            Both

            these      stands       being       for     the L i v e r p o o l         supporters.

same       because           of     th e     turns       in L e p p i n g s       Lane.

I was        on the          side       of    the    ground          where        t he     Nottingham              supporters          were

expected           to a r r i v e .           In f a c t       the     majority            of    co a c h e s ,     o ve r     eighty,

carrying           these          fans       parked       in the S h e f f i e l d              Transport           Department          Bus

D e p o t , which            is     situated         in H e r r i e s        Road        near       to P e n i s t o n e       Road.        On e

task       for     the       Serials          employed          in t h i s        area was            to    direct        the

Nottingham              f an s      along      Herries          Road,        away        from Penistone                  Road.        These

fans       were       then        directed          by    other        officers            to    turn       righ t       down Herries

Road S o u t h , towards                     that    part       of     the      ground          that       ha d    been allocated

to    th em.          That        is    the K o p a n d         the       South       Stand.

The    idea,          of     course,          was    to     direct          the    Nottingham               fans     away       from    the

Liverpool             fans,         many      of w h o m w o u l d          approach            the    ground        from       the

Wadsley           Bridge          side,       that       is d o w n P e n i s t o n e           Road       and     right       along

Leppings           L a ne .         Th e     Liverpool          fans        using        the     special           train       stopping

at W a d s 1 ey B r i d g e             Station,          would        also       us e     that       route.         This       was    the

same       p l a n as        th e      previous          year.

The    Nottingham                 coaches         started        to a r r i v e          around        noon.         The       s y s t e m was

working           w e ll     with       the    odd       hi c - u p , in        t h at     a few       coaches           had    unloaded

prior        to    arriving             at    the    bus       depot        but    steps         were       taken        to    put a s t o p

to    this.

It    is     true       to      say     the    majority          of       the     f an s      were     in a        buoyant       mood and

complied           with         police        requests          as     to    their         approach          to     the       ground.

In a d d i t i o n         to     the      Serials        at    this        poi n t,       there were              two    Police

horses        these          played          a most       us e f u l      part     by      pointing          the     fans       in the

right        direction,,                One    of    their       tasks          was      to     ensure       the     Liverpool          fans

did    not        encroach             onto    this       area       but     t h is      never        occurred.

Many       private           vehicles          carrying          Nottingham                f an s     were        also    parked       in

this       a r e a.

As    the     build          up     continued            it w a s      obvious           many       supporters            had    been

drinking           as      dozens          were     obliged          to     relieve           themselves            in a sma ll
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      R130

woodland           area     opposite            the     bus       depot.        I gave          instructions                that       this

was     to    be    permitted           as      the re w a s        no       public       toilet         in th a t      area.              I

wish     to    emphasise            that        e v e n at        this       stage     the m o o d w a s          s t i ll

generally           buoyant         and a word               from a Police                Officer         to     the    occasional

transgressor               had    the       desired          effect.

I    had w a l k e d       around       my area and                spoken       to m a n y          officers,          there were

no    serious         problems          and       the    atmosphere             was       as    one     would      expect             on

such     an occasion.

I sa w       there      were      no    problems             at    the       turnstiles             on P e n i s t o n e     Ro ad,

which        gives      access         to    the      Kop and           everything             seemed       to    be    proceeding

to    plan.

I remember            about       H .00      pm h e a r i n g       on my       personal             radio       that       the S p e c i a l

Train        from     Liverpool             had a r r i v e d       at W a d s 1 ey B r i d g e           Station.               I

believe        t h is      had a r r i v e d       early.

As    the     fa ns     from      the       Special          Train would             be      escorted          along        Penistone

Road,        past     the     junction            with Herries                Road,       1 made my way                to    that

junction           to a w a i t     their         arrival.              So    far    as      I re-call           it w a s        around

this     time,        or    shortly after,                   there       were       r a di o    messages          directing

Transit        mobiles           to a r e a s      where          fans       were    causing           trouble.             These

included Kilner                  Way,       just      above        Wadsley          Station,           the H o r s e        and Jockey

on W a d s l e y      Lane       and    th e R o y a l        on P e n i s t o n e        Road.

The     Liverpool           fans,       with       police          escort,          c a me     from      the     Station             and

turned        ri ght       into     Leppings            L an e .        They    were         boisterous,           as       one w o u l d

expect,        but      there       was      no    cause          for    concern          so    far as         could        be       s e e n at

that     time.

I remained            in    the     vicinity            of    the       bus    depot         and Penistone              R o a d as             the

pedestrian            build       up    down Penistone                   Road       and      along      Leppings            L a n e w as

very     hea vy .          These       f a ns     were       prevented          from         continuing along

Penistone           Road     or     turning           into        Herries       Road,          as    they were          Liverpool

supporters.

I re ca l l        that        about         2 . SO     pm a n         order       c a me     over       the    Personal            rad io        for

instructed              to     inform a Sheffield                        Transport             Department              official             (Mr.

Middleton)              of     this         and    inform          him       that      service           buses       would        have       to

be     diverted.               I delivered                  this       message         within        two m i n u t e s           and

informed           control.                 I returned             to    the       Traffic          I s l a n d at       the P e n i s t o n e

Road        end    of L e p p i ngs L a n e .                   There        was    no      congestion              of L e p p i n g s       Lane

by     pedestrians                at    that       end       but       I did       notice          there       were     a    large          number

and     many       of    these          seemed          the       worse       for      dri nk .

I would           like       to     emphasise               these       fans       were       not    fighting            drunk         or    in a n

u g l y m o od ,        they were              just what               I would         describe           as    being        stupidly

drunk,        in f a c t          many       were       st ill         actually          drinking.              1 clearly              remember

thinking           I had          never        seen         so m a n y       in s u c h a          state       before..

Th e    police          officers             on L e p p i n g s         Lane       and Penistone                Road        at    t hi s     time,

were        coping       adequately                and,         after        speaking          with       the       officers           on d u t y

at     the    bus       depot,          I walked             along       Penistone             Road       towards           the     g r ou n d.

1 had        occasion             to    speak          to    two       young       f an s     outside          an    off     licence           near

the     ground,          who        apologised               as    some       drunks          do    for      their       behaviour.                 I

then        entered          the       ground          via      the     g at e     leading          to    the       Sports        H a ll .

It wa s       at       this       time       I heard            radio        messages          about         gates       being         opened

at     Leppings          Lane.              I am       s u re     this       was    after          I had       heard        the     roar      of

the     crowd          signalling              t h at       the    teams         had     come       o nt o     the     playing           area.

I distinctly                 remember             there         w as    an    u r g p w r y â e-râ e*-e-n p*a-o4-e in the                    voice

or     voices          passing          the       messages.

I definitely                 heard          âG a t e     C*       and    either          *a Ga te' or           "Gate A â . M y             f i r st

thought           was    they          were       to     open          the   gate        or    g a t e s to a l l o w p e o p l e           out

because           of    th e      crushing,              but       I quickly             r e a l i s e d t hi s      wa s not       the      case.

Before        1 actually                reached             the    playing          a r ea ,       I heard          a message

instructing              all        available               officers          onto       t h is     ar ea.          Knowing        there
                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                      R 130

would         be m a n y       officers          in the S p o r t s           Hall       at    t hi s    time,         I ran         there,

s h o u t e d an         instruction             for     officers            to    comply       with       the      radio         message

arid t h e n        ran       to    the     playing         ar ea.

I saw         the       teams       just     disappearing               back       into       the    players          tunnel          and       on

looking            towards          the     West      (Leppings          Lane)          Stand       I saw       some       fans       on     the

playing            are a.          I also       saw    s om e    climbing           or a t t e m p t i n g       to    climb          the

perimeter               fence       onto     the      playing          area       and    some       scrambling             from       the

Terrace            up    into       th e S t a n d .        I to ok      this       in as       1 wa s        running           across

the      pitch.

On    reaching            t h is     fence       I    assisted          a youth          over,       t h is     youth          was    in a

very      distressed                state.           It w a s    then        I noticed          the      faces        of       the    p eo p l e

pressed            against          the     fence.          1 quickly             helped       another          youth          from    the

top      of    the       fence       and     then      ran      to     the    emergency             exit      gate     in t h i s

fence         which       le ads        from     the     terrace         to       the    playing         area.         I was          within

a few         feet       of    th i s     in a n y     case.           For    some       reason         1 thought              the P o l i c e

officers            at    t hi s     gate       were     not     removing           people          from      the     terrace          fast

enough.             I actually              remember          pushing         one       officer         aside       and        shouting

words         to    the       effect        'get      them      out.''        The       officer         replied        they were

tryi ng        but       were       unable       to do        so.       There       was       a tremendous             crush          of

people         at       that       gate .       One    reason           for       this    w a s the d r o p       of    about          two

f e et    f r o m th e         perimeter             track      to      the       floor       of the T e r r a c e .            People

were      actually             bent       over       this     in a      pile.

I to o k       hold       of a y o u n g         man     by     the a r m s       attempting             to     pul 1 h i m          out a n d

then      realised what                   the    offi cer        had m e a n t .          I found          it    impossible                to

move      him,          I then       realised          he w a s        dead.

I then         took       ho 1d of          th e a r m s      of a n o t h e r      young man and               tried           to    pull

him      out       but    I felt          him    slip       away       and    could       not       maintain          my       hold    on

him.          The       crush       seemed       to     increase.             We m a n a g e d       to a s s i s t        a    few    out

over      the       others          and     I then       saw a m an           in a b s o l u t e        panic,        he w a s

literally               throwing          himself        on     th e    backs       of    other         people        and       I shouted
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    R 130

at    h i m to       stop.         It w a s      at      t h is    time       I saw       two     policewomen             at       the

rear      of    this       crush.         These          officers            were    attempting              to    pull       people

back.          There       was     room       for      this       by    t h is     time     but     the      panic       was       such

t ha t    the     two      officers           were       finding         th e      task     very      difficult.

It w as        about       this        time    the       fencing         was       forced and             people       were        removed

from      the     Terrace.              Many     were         dead      or    seriously            injured.

I remember             using      my Personal                 Radio      to a s k        Control          to a l e r t    the

hospitals            as    we    had a major                 incident         on    our     hands,         although           1 did          not

realise         the       enormity        of     the         s i t u a t i o n at    that        time.         This      radio

message         wa s      not    acknowledged.                    During          this    period          I spoke        to    a man

who      identified             himself        as a d o c t o r          and       whom     I saw         certify        the       death

of    s om e    and assist              with     o th er s.

Police,         First          Aiders     and       others         were       attempting            to     resuscitate              many.

The      advertising             boards        were          pulled      down and           the     dead a nd          injured

were      removed          on    these        although            some       of    the    injured          were       removed        by

ambulance.                Those        removed were               taken       to    the S p o r t s        H a l l,    which        wa s      to

become         the     temporary          mortuary.                Many       fans       assisted          in t h e      removal             of

the      dead and          injured        from         the      field.            Even    at     th i s    stage       a few        fans

vented         their       anger        on me.           It w a s       about       this       time       t ha t   Chief

Superintendent                  Nesbit,        who       1 re-call            seeing        at    the      West       Stand

perimeter            f e n c e , organised               a    1 ine     of    officers           across        the     pit c h.          I

considered             this      a sensible              move      as    th e      Nottingham             fans     had    initially

jeered and             cheered,          not     realising              what       had    taken       place        and    f rom t h e r e

Stand      it no          doubt        appeared          a    pitch      i n v a s i o n was        taking         place       by the

Liverpool            fans.         It w a s at           this      time       I went        to    the      players        tunnel             to

enquire         whether          or     not    the m a t c h           would       re-start         and      actually          spoke          on

this      subject          to Mr.        Lock       an       ex-police            officer,        and      currently           a

Sheffield            Wednesday           employee.

I then went               to    th e    line     of P o l i c e         offi c e rs       and     s p o ke     to Mr.         NESBIT.

It wa s        then a n n o u n c e d         t ha t     the      game       would       be a b a n d o n e d      and    spectators

  started     to     leave       the      ground.

 To     ensure      there       were      a sufficient               number          of    police       officers           outside

  the     ground,       for     public         order       purposes,            officers         were     sent        from      the

  l ine    across       the     pitch.

  I entered         the      Sports       H a l l.      By     this       t im e     the    injured       had       been       removed

 and      1 saw many           bodies      on    the       floor         of    the    Ha l l .     A    line       of P o l i c e

  officers        were       preventing          members            of    the      public        entering          the     area         of

  the S p o r t s    Hall.

  I went     into P e n i s t o n e        Road       to      check       on    the       public       order       situation.

 Everything          appeared          in ord e r,            in f a c t       everyone          seemed       stunned.              I

  only     remained          outside       a fe w m i n u t e s           and      then     returned          to    the       Sports

 Hall.       Things          were    being       organised               and    I d id a b o d y         count.            Ih e r e      were

  seventy     eight          bodies       at    th at      time.

  1 was     informed           shortly         after       t ha t    some       police       officers          at     Niagara

 Club      were     already         suffering           from        stress.           1 h a d PC       3-83 D a v i e s        drive         me

  ther e.     We     only       r emained a few m i n u t e s                   as    there      were     no       obvious

  problems        and     we    returned         to     the     Sports          Hal l .

  I remained         in the S p o r t s          H a l l,      working          with Detective                Chief

 Superintendent                Addis.          I can       fully         describe          the    procedure           in      this

  temporary         mortuary         should          t hi s    be    required.              In a d d i t i o n      to     other

  duties     in the          mortuary          I found         one       of    my main       jobs       was    the

  counselling           of     police       officers,            th e     explanation             to    relatives             the

  procedure         for      identification and                     liaising          between Social                Worker/

  Clergy,     relatives             and     police         officers.

  I was     present          when    the       last     body was              removed       from       this    temporary

  mortuary        shortly        after         5.30     am     the       following          morning,          that       is    the

  â¢16th A p r i l    1989.

            I am a Police Constable       in the Road Traffic Department of the S

            Y o r k shire Poli ce



            On Saturday 15th April,       1989 (150489)       1 commenced duty at 8 am (0800

            hrs)     in connection with duties       concerning the semi-final       football

            m a t c h a.t Hillsborough.



            After     initial briefyng I took up position in company with PC2534

            Step^en^on & PCS%g9 Scargill        in connection with traffic flow control,

            at the roundabout at the junction of the A61 and A61& (trunk)                   road.

            Traffic began approaching very early bearing Liverpool                 supporters,

            both along the A616 trunk        road and by the A&1,          having travelled via

            the M1.     A particular thing that was noticed was that drivers
                                                                      PAGE     2
                                                                      S2971

continued to ignore signs,    that we specifically requested to be put

out to direct fans to Hillsborough.      Rather than follow signs

directing them to Hillsborough,    it was observed they chose to continue

along the A616    (T) towards the Ml rather than turn onto the A61 to the

g rou nd.



As traffic became heavy we carried out traffic      control   to get it to

the ground,   giving priority to football   traffic at the expense of

normal traffic.



The heavy traffic ceased, abruptly at 1.50 pm (1350 h r s ), and after

this time we were not required to carry out traffic      control and merely

observed a light flow until    it ceased completely.



At 3 pm ( 1500 h r s ) we we re due to 1eave our location to t rave 1 for

meal,   but within minutes of doing this, we were directed to

Hillsborough .



Within minutes of arriving at Hillsborough.       I was re— directd to Force

Headquarters to stand-by as the Chief C o n s ta bl e’s staff driver, where

I remai ned unt i 1 relieved a.t 9.30 pm <£130 hrs).

JOE BENTON MP AND CONSTITUENTS MR & MRS CHURCH

Thank you for sending me a copy of your letter of 18 November to Ken Sutton,
enclosing correspondence from Joe Benton MP and his constituents, about the
names of the members of the Hillsborough Steering Group. Whilst this Department
had no responsibility for the Group, we have made every effort to find information
Mr Benton may find of use.

Newspaper reports of the period suggest that the Hillsborough Steering Group
consisted of a group of six solicitors who co-ordinated legal claims on behalf of 300
firms representing the victims of the Hillsborough disaster. The only representative
of the Group that was named in the press was a Ms Nicola Harrison, Unfortunately
her law firm was not named.

From the correspondence from Mr Benton's constituents, there appears to be some
connection between the Steering Group and the Hillsborough Disaster Fund, which
was a charity which ceased to exist in November 1995, but which may provide
another lead. The Liverpool office of the Charity Commission gave their last
Chairman and address as: Mr C M Reddington, PO Box 220, Liverpool, L69 2PN
(tel: 0151 236 0044).
I hope this goes some way to helping Mr Benton.

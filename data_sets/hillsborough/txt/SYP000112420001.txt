                       I was                deployed           on    Serial       ;11         under       the    supervision                   of    PS    Edwards.           The

                      Leppings                Lane         end       of    the    ground             which       give       access             to    the    North       Stand™

                      These             turnstiles                  are    numbered             1-8.        The       remainder               of     Serial       11    were

                      deployed                 to     the       Upper       Concourse                of    the    North          Stand          to    pay       attention

                      At           12   noon        thfe       turnstiles             were          opened       by     C,lub     Stewards.                 A    gate

                      inside                the     gro.und         adj#ctnt           to      turnstile              8- w a s    opened             by    stewards       and
a    temporary          barrier          placed            in    a    similar             position                adjacent       to

turnstile          12.        T h e :e x p l a n a U o n , g i v e n                for       this          was    that    signs          for    the

North    Stand          had    been          W r o n g l y '•f i x e d         in       place          on    the    outside          wall.

This    effectively               increased                the       turnstile                capacity             for    the    North          Stand

by    four    and       reduced          the        West        Stand          turnstile                   capacity       by    four.

During       the    first        hour          together              with          PC    Larkin             I assisted          PS    Morgan

* F ’ Division' a nd             two         officers            on       his       Seria!             outside       the       turnstiles           to

escort       two    'Ticket           T o u t s ’ to            the    Police             Room.              These       two    men       had

several       hundred           pounds           in cash             and       a    large             quantity       of    tickets          in

their    possession.                  Having           assisted                to       escort             these    two    men       to    the

Police       room       myself        and        PC    Larkin             resumed             to       our    original          position.

During       the    first         hour         relatively                 few       fans          entered          the    ground.           I

overheard          one    of      the        turnstile               operators,                   a    young       man    (possibly

turnstile          3)    call       to       the      operator             in       the       adjoining             turnstile             that     74.

fans    had       entered         his        turnstile               in    the          first          hours.        This       man       had

worked       out    the       rate       per        minute           that          fans       would          have    to    enter          that

turnstile          over       the     next          two     hours          in       order             to    reach    is    quota.

During       the    next        hour         < 1 pm         2    pm)       the          rate          of    fans    entering          the

ground       did    not       increase              significantly.                        All          entering          the    ground          were

sober,       good       humoured,              complying              fully             and       willingly          with       Police

directions,             requests             and      searches             etc.

From    about       2    pm     the      rate         of    fans          entering                the       ground       began       to

increase          steadily.              A     number           of    fans          also          began       attempting             to    enter

the    ground       without           tickets              and       were          prevented                from    doing       so    by

Police,       Stewards           and         turnstile               operators                working             together^.

At    2.25    pm    I assisted                 DC     Friend          with          the       detention             of

                                                           Liverpool,                   who       had       entered       the    ground

without       a    ticket.            He       was     taken          t o ‘ the          Police             Room,    where       we

completed          an    ’E j e c t i o n        s l i p ’ and            ejected             I            [from    the    ground          inti)

Penistone          Road,       At     the        direction                of       the    Police             Room    staff,
Having       done        this         myself           and    PC    Friend            returned           to    our       original

positions-               On      our: r e t u r n        it    was        apparent               that    there       were          problems

outside          the     turnstiles,                   with    large           numbers            of    peopie       p u s h i n g ,t o           enter

the    turnstiles.                    The     orderlynesfs                that        had        existed       prior          to       bur       going

to    the    PoliceRoom                  had       disappeared                 and      it       seemed       that       further

officers          tnSy      be     required             outside           the      ground          in    Leppings             Lane.              Before

w e :c o u l d    pass        any       radio          message           to    that      effect          (PC       Larkin          having             the

only     radio).              Inspector                Delaney           attended            at    our       location          with          a

number       of    Officers.                  I    informed              him    that         his       contingent             were       required

outside,          not       inside          the        turnstiles,              but      they          were    unable          to       leave          the

ground       by    any        of      the     exit       gates           due    to      the       volume       of    people             pushing

against          them       from        the       outside.

The    problems             outside           were       rapidly              becoming            worse.           The    weight             of       the

crowd       pushing           was       forcing          people           through            the       turnstiles             in       twos       arid

threes,          with       each        move       of    the       turnstile.                    People       coming          through             the

turnstiles             were        screaming             at    us        that      we    were          needed       outside             and       not

inside.

Many     fans      entering              the       ground          at,    t h is      stage        were       showing          signs             of

drink       and    a     large          number          of    empty           b eer     cans       and       bottles          began          to

gather       on    the        floor         inside           the    turnstiles.

At    this       stage        it      seemed           more    important                to       assist       fans       to    get       through

the    turnstiles                as     quickly          as    possible               rather           than    search          them          for

drink       etc.,        and       it    was       necessary              to    pull         a    number       of    people

physically             through           the       turnstiles.

A    number       of     fans         were        climbing          over        the      walls          in    an    attempt             to       enter

the    ground          and       escape           the    crush           outside.                I witnessed             two       Police

It    was     open          and    people          were          entering                 the       ground          quickly              but          orderly.

shortly        after             saw    the    Gate          A     opened                and    large           numbers             of       fans        rushed

          Jackson          and       PC       Smith.              I    then          searched             the       bodies          and

           listed         the     property                  found          thereon.              A    number             of    bodies

           had     complete              tickets             with          them       and       full       details             of    these

           This      suggests                that       these          victims             had       entered             the      ground

           other         than     via         a       turnstile.

           frightened             for          the      safety             of    those          people          outside             the

           ground,         who       were             attempting                to    enter          through             the      turnstiles,

          The      crush         seemed               such    that          a    wall,          gate       or       turnstile             block

          would          have     to         give       way.

          The      fans        entering                through             those          turnstiles                were       angry       at

          drinking             and       I    tried          to       reason          with       them          that       they       could

Stephen Mishael HTTERTON

Detective Constabld 2571

Woodseats C.I.D.


With reference to the incident at Hillsborough Football Ground on Saturday 15th
April 1989 1 have to report the following:

1* I commenced duty at Woodseats Police Sta ion at 8.30am that day in full uniform,
   and along with all other E2 officers was transported to the football ground
   where a full and comprehensive briefing was given.

2# I was deployed on Serial 11 under the supervision of ES Edwards. The sector
   commander was Inspector Woodward,

3, Myself, DC 1529 Friend, DC 2857 Turner, DC 873 Oakes, PC 107^ Thickett and
   PC 2^09 Larkin were deployed to the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of
   the ground which give access to the North Stand# These turnstiles are numbered
   1 - 8 . The remainder of Serial 11 were deployed to the Upper Concourse of the
   North Stand to pay attention to Refreshment bars etc#

   At 12 noon the turnstiles were opened by Club stewards* A gate inside the ground
   adjacent to turnstile 8 was opened by stewards and a temporary barrier placed
   in i±x a similar position ± s adjacent to turnstile 12# The explanation given
   for this was that signs for the North Stand had been wrongly fixed in place
   on hhe outside wall. This effectively increased the turnstile capacity for
   the North Stand by four and reduced the West Stand turnstile capacity by four#

   During the first hour toghtsher with PC Larkin I assisted PS Morgan *F' Division
   and two officers on his serial outside the turnstiles, to escort two 'Ticket
   Touts' to the Police Room. These two men had several hundred pounds in cash and
   a large quantity of tickets in their possesion. Having assisted to escort these
   two men to the P0lice room myself and PC Larkin resumed to our original position#

   During the first hour relatively few fans entered the ground. I overheard one
   of the turnstile operators, a young man(possibly turnstile 3 ) call to kxs the
   operator in the adjoining turnstile that only 7^ fans had entered his turnstile
   in the first hour. This man had worked out the rate per minute that fans would
   have to enter that turnstile over the next two hours in order to reach his quata.#

   During the next hour (1pm x 2pm) the rate of fans entering the ground did not
   increase significantly. All entering the ground were sober, good humoured,
   complying fully and willingly with Police directions, requests and searches etc.

   From about 2pm the rate of fans entereing the ground began to increase steadily.
   A number of fans also began attempting to enter the ground without tickets
   and were prevented from doing so by Police, Stewards and turnstile operators
   working together.

   At 2.25pm I assisted DC Friend with the detention of
          Liverpool who had entered the ground without a ticket. He was taken to
   the Folise Room, where we completed an ’Ejection slip' and ejected^     from
   the ground into Penistone Road* at the direction of the Police Room staff.

   Having done this myself and DC Friend returned to our original positions. On our
   return it was apparent that there were problems outside the turnstiles , with
  large numbers of people pushing to enter the turnstiles. The orderliness that
  had existed prior to our going to the Police Room had dispappeaited and it seemed
                                                                          K   ' V

                        PAGE TWO

that further officers may be required outside the ground in Leppings Lane. Before
we could pass any radio message to that effect (PC Larkin having the only radio)
Inspector Delaney attended at our location with a number of Officers. I informed him
that his contingent were required outside, not inside the turnstiles, but they
were unable to leave the ground by any of the exit gates due to the volume of people
pushing against them from the outside.

The problems outside were rapidly becoming woi?se. The weight of the crowd pushing was
forcing people through the turnstiles in twos and threes, with each move of the
turnstile. People coming through the turnstiles were screaming at us that we were
needed outside and not inside.

Many fans entering the ground at this stage were showing signs of drink and a large
number of empty beer cans and bottles began to gather on the floor inside the
turnstiles.

At this stahe it seemed more important to assist fans to get through the turnstiles
as quickly as possible rather than search them for drink etc and it was neccesary to
pull a number of people physically throughthe turnstiles.

A number of fans were climbing over the walls in an attempt to enter the ground and
escape the crush outside. 1 witnessed two Police Officers whose details I do not
know but were presumably part of PS Morgans serial be pushed backwards through
the turnstiles into the ground by the sheer weight and force of the crowd.

I then took onefan who had entered the turnstile without a ticket and escorted him to
Gate B on the attached plan in order to eject him. Gate A at this stage was closed
the steward being unable to open it because of the volume of the crowd otuside.
GATE B was also closed but an Officer at that Gate informed me that the next Gate, Sa
Gate c on the attached plan was open. I took this fan to that Gate. It was open and
people were entering the ground quickly but orderly. There was no ticket cjjeck
being made and accordingly I let the fan I had escorted to that Gate enter the ground

I returned to the turnstiles where I had been originally deployed and shortly after
saw the GATE A opened and large numbers of fans rushed the gates and entered the
ground into the N0rth Stand. I was unable to see if this gate was ppened by Police
Officers or Stewards. I then turned to see that Gate B had been opened also. Again
I did not see who opened that.

I then heard the command ’STOP THE GAME’ over PC Larkins radio. Together with the aids
other officers at our location I went to the pitch via the rear of the Police
Control post and Lhe uncovered section of the South Stand. On doing so I saw that
there were a large number of people on the pitch. I also noticed that the elevated
section of the Leppings Lane terrace was relatively empty. My immediate reaction
was that a pitch invasion had taken place. Howeve? it quickly became apparent
that the problem was even more serious. I could see spectators in the West Stand
lifting people from the terracing below into the seated area. Other people were
being lifted over the perimeter fence by Police officers. Insidethe fencing
I could see people alive, and dead, packed up against the fence.

These people were four or five deeep, and a gap began to appear between them and
the remaining fans. I was instructed by Superintendent Greenwood to climb over the
fence and attempt to screen the bodies from the fans in an attempt to prevent further
panic and distress. However I was unable to do this and entered the terracing via
a gate in the perimeter fence. I went to the first person who appeared to be alive
and pulled him from the pack. He was unconcious and appeared to have an injury to
his right hip. I began to carry him jfikjc to the rear of the West Stand and was
eventually assisted in doing so by spectators and another Police Officer (details
not known)This casualty was left in the yard at the rear of the tunnel with that
officer. I moved a number of onlookers from that area into the next yard out
of the way of other casualties and Police Officers.

            Turnstiles opened 12 noon. Gfcte adjoining turnstile 12 moved by a steward, who
            explained that a sign outside had been fixed wrong giving four extar turnstiles
            for North Stand and four less for West Stand.
             Assisted PS Morgan and two officers with two males 'Ticket touts' with PC Larkin.
           Both escorted to Police room. Resumed to original position.
   1pm      Turnstile operator (3?) shouted to his oppo (*f?) that only ?k fans had passed
            through his turnstile in first hour. He had worked out the rate per minute that
            fans would have to come through in next two hours.
   1-2pm Rate of fans not much faster. All good humoured, sober, complying with searches,
           requests, etc.
   2pm     Rate of fans began to increase. Some attempting to ehter ground without tickets
           and prevented.

           through gate into PenistoneR^ at direction of Police Room staff. Return to turnstiles.
           On return to turnstiles saw there were problems outside, with large numbers of pepple^
           and that further officers may be required outside.
           Before any radio message to hat effect could be made ( 1 radio PC Larkin) Insp
          Delaney attended at our location with a number of officers. Informed him that kx they
           were required outside not inside, but they were unable to get out of big gates
          because of volume of crowds, remained inside.
ahck$x     Crowds becoming increasingly d ep outside. People getting crushed outside, and
           screaming at us when they got in that we were needed outside. Coming through in
           2s and threes, with each turn of turnstile. Many showing signs of drink, large
          numbers of empty cans and bottles on floor inside turnstiles. 2 PCs pushed back through
          turnstile by weight of crowd. Fans climbing over walls, took one fan who came in withoul
          ticket   to eject him straight through gate. Unable to get through our ^ate, next
          gate (centre) closed. PC there said next gate was open. Went there, g a te open, fans
          walking in quickly,   ±k£ x£xhx no ticket check, let fan go into crowd, returned to
          position, North stand gate opened and fans rush in.
          Heard command 'stop the game stop the game' over radio. With other officers went to
          pitch. Large numbers of people on pitch, intial thought    f invasion, then went to
          track and saw injured, people in trouble inside fence, people being lifted into
          West stand, officers on fence. Some one said theres a f tality,
          Bodies (alive and dead) four or five deep, gap opening up between fans and bodies.

8 cont,     A large number of messages seemed to be of a trivial nature



9.          As stated I assisted to carry ofae casualty to the rear of the Wesjf Stand#
            Two bodies to the gymnasium areat with PC Jackson and PC Smith,
            I then searched the bodies and listed the property found thereon.
            A number of bodies had complete tickets with them and full details of these
            tickets were logged. One fan had three such tickets. This suggests that these
            victims had entered the ground other than via a turnstile.


10,         In the 30 minutes or so between returning from the ejection of      and
            leaving the turnstiles to go to the pitch I was frightened for the safety
            of those people outside the ground, who were attempting to enter through
            the turnstiles. The crush seemed such that a wallt gate or turnstile block
            would halire to give way.

            The fans enetering through those turnstiles were angry at seeing so many
            Police Officers inside the turnstile area when they were needed outside.
            Many had obviously been drinking and I tried to reason with them that they
            could have avoided the pub and arrived earlier.

            My own observations, as an experienced Police Officer and a football fan who
            has visited a number of grounds in this country is that a tragedy of this
            nature could have happened at any ground.
            Unfortunately the scale has been enhanced due to the size of the crowd and
            the occasion, A number of factors chose to come together which combined to
            cause the disaster. These would seem to be,

          1, A large number of people arriving in the vicinity of the ground without
             tickets,
          2, A large number of people arriving close to kick off time, many having been
             drinking,
          3, Failure to delay the kick-off time and allow those fans outside time to get
             in the ground.
             The design of the Hillsborough ground. The fact that fans effectively only
              enter this ground on two sides instead of the more usual four. The fact
             that the area outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles is shaped like a funnel.
              The fact that people entering the turnstiles see only two entrances to the
              terracing. One of these is directly in front ( the tunnel). Through this
              fans can see the heads of the crowd, the back of the goal and the pitch.
             The entrance to their right (by the Police Control) appeard to be full when it
             is not as spectators stood their can be seen head to toe. The entrance to
             the left side and elevated section cannot be seen to anyone who does not
             know the leyout of the ground. The tunnel is the only entrance marked ±Sbfcx
             •Standing*,
           5, The erection of perimeter fencing and dividing the terraces into 'pensf.
              Although people would have been crushed against the chest high boundary wall
              their rescue would not have been impeded had the fences not been in position*
              In the aftermath of the Bradford fire it was suggested that the perimeter
              fences be removed and this was eventually dismissed.
              The effeet of dividing terraces into pens is that it prevents fans from
              moving sideways from the central area behind the goal towards the edges of
             the terracing. These fences appear to iae to be more dangerous than the
              perimeter fences and more unneccassry.

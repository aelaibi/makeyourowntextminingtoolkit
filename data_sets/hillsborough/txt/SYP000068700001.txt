             SEMI FINAL INCIDENT AT HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL/GROUND SHEFFIELD




              I report that on Saturday        15 April       1989 (1530489)       1 reported on duty at

             Armthorpe Police Station near Doncaster for duty at Hillsborough

             Football    ground Sheffield for the F .A . semi final between Liverpool

             and Nottingham Forest.          I went to Doncaster main Police station from

              there   I was   conveyed with other officers by bus to Sheffield Wed ne sd ay

             Football Ground at Hillsborough.               The/e      in the main stand with

              other officers        I was briefed as tar my duties and assigned to se
                                          - _ _ i    /
              in charge was P.S. 960 Murray ySnd informed I was to go Tankersey

              roundabout to monitor and search football                     supporters busses and mini

              busses for alcohol and weapons.
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S 1296A



At 11am (1180)    that date I commenced duties at Tankersey and together

with the officers on this serial        commenced to search busses and mini

busses for alcohol and weapons.         A quantity of cans of beer was found

by myself and other officers mainly from the mini             busses and vans

carrying Liverpool    supporters to the g r o u n d .     These    cans of beer were

confiscated from the supporters some of whom were already under the

influence of alcohol and resented the fact that their beer was being

taken from them causing them to become aggresive.                 On some of the

larger supporters busses which were generally better organised with

less alcohol    evident either having been consumed

or found on the bus,       however there were several       supporters on the

busses who were not in possession of tickets and stated that there

brother/fathers/friends had their tickets and were on another                  bus or

were being met at the ground.



At appro:; imate 1______              j self and the other officers on my

serial    concluded duty at Tankersey a n d commenced to go

to Clay Wheels Lane Road Traffic garage for a meal                break.   However,

upon reaching Clay Wheels Lane depot we were ordered to go to the

Football Ground where a disturbance was taking             place,    upon receiving

this order we all    proceeded to go to the ground.



Upon reaching the ground at The Leppings Lane end we wp'f'e ordered by

an inspector already at the scene to form a line ^ i h               other o ff ic er s

to prevent football        supporters from getting      ip/to the g round.      After

short    period of time the supporters who haVi/been trying to gain entry

began to disperse and we were directed into the entrance area of the

ground at Leppings Lane where supporters had started to come out of

the stadium.
                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                    S1296A



At this time I saw that some of the supporters were                injured and were

being assisted by other Police officers and supporters from the

stadium and went to assist a supporter who was having trouble

breathing and got him to an area at the             rear of the Leppings Lane

where other persons were being assisted.              He started to breathe more

easily and complained of a sore ankle             I gave him my tunic to keep

him warm to await an ambulance at this time                I saw that some of the

persons    in this area were deceased.          I went back into the area at

the exit of the Leppings Lane terraces and assisted to get some

other supporters out into the area which had been set aside as an

aid area one of whom appeared to be struggling to breathe but after

being brought out of the area, which was by this time packed with

people    leaving the stadium,       he came to quite quickly and was able to

make his own way home.           During this time supporters       leaving the

stadium were becoming very abusive towards Police officers                  in this

area and the whole area became very tense.



While    I was   in the aid area at the wall at the rear of Leppings Lane

was ordered by an Inspector           (Identity unknown)      to take   charge of o/(e

of the deceased,       as a result of this order          I commenced sudden jteath

procedure on a man who          I now know to have    been David Jof\n JSKLNSON 22

deceased to the Medi co\Le^9^Q Centre at Sheffield where                I handed over

the body of the deceased and his property t o the staff at that

centre.       I then left the     centre and returned home       retiring from duty

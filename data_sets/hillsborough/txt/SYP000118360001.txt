On arrival               at       the       entrance           with       other          o f f i c e r s we       formed           a    cordon and

refused          entry            to    other        supporters.                    I    was       o n l y at     this          position a

short       time         when          the     first        ambulance               arrived.              The     cordon          broke        to

allow       the a m b u l a n c e              ent ry .         I thought                someone          must        have       been     i n ju red .

As    the a m b u l a n c e             entered           the    ground             I saw          s o me L i v e r p o o l       supporters

w e re    blocking                it's        way,     I l ef t       the       cordon             to    pull     t hem         out     of    the w a y

thus      allowing                the       ambulance           through.                 When        the a m b u l a n c e        passed       I

looked         up a n d           saw a man            carrying            another             m a n out         of    the W e s t        stand

tunnel,          although               he     did     not      h a ve     a Police                helmet        on    I could           see       it

was      another          officer,                 whose       details          I       do    not       k now.        I ran        to    give          him

assistance               and       as we           rested       the       injured             down       o nto    the       ground,           this

officer          said         " T h e r e ’s h u n d r e d s          more          in t h e r e         dead,        or    injured*.                  I

ran      into       the       tunnel           and     could         see    the          g ame      was       sti ll       in    progress.

Assisted            another             officer           to    carry       out          a man aged about                       23 years           dark

straight            hair          and wearing               a navy         k a g o u l , he a p p e a r e d                dead.         We

carried          him      out          of     the     tunnel         and    also             placed        him    onto          the     ground and

tried       to      revive             him     to     no a v a i l .        A       beard ed man who                   said        he was          a

doctor         l o o k e d at           him,        and after             a brief             e Kami n a t i o n       he       said     he was

dead.          As    more          and more            of      the    supporters                   came       out,     they were

s h o u t i ng at         the          Police        saying          we    caused             all       this.         The       extent        of       the

incident            was       not       apparent.               X could             not       see a n y         stewards           present.                I

did      not     have         a    radio           a n d at     t ha t     time          there were              no    supervisory

officers            at    h and.

At    the      time       of       dealing           with       injured             persons             and     bodies          I did     not

think       of a n y          fears           or    feelings.              I was             too    busy        trying          to h e l p     cope

with      the       situation.                     However,          when       requested                to a s s i s t         with     other

duties         by s u p e r v i s o r y             officers          who       later          had       the     situation              under

control,            I felt             drained and              bewildered.

On    reflection,                  I can           only     place         the       blame          on    the L i v e r p o o l          supporters

             late   comers     for    whatever       re aso n,    for    pushing       their wa y   into    the

             ground.     Had    they        listened    to o f f i c e r s    instructing    them    not    to    force

             their way    into       th e   ground     too   quickly         this    tragedy would    not    h av e

             happened.       The     blame     lies w h o l l y   on    their       shoulders.

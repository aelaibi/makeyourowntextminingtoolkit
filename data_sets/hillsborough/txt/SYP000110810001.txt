    E N D OF            REPORT
POLICE CONSTABLE 611 BOOTH   (F2 SUB DIVISION, ECCLESFIELD POLICE STATION)

F.A. C0P SEMI FINAL , SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989.




At 9a® on the above date I reported to Ecclesfield Police Station where
transport was waiting to take officers from F2 to Hillsborough Stadium*
At Hillsborough I was briefed along with all other officers on duty* I
was one of ten constables in serial 19 under the direct supervision of
P.S. 323 PROCTOR, Our duties on this date were outside the ground in Leppings
Lane near to the turnstiles which were to be used as access points into
the ground for all Liverpool Supporters with the correct ticket* Our
brief was to receive fans at that location and to maintain order and also
to assist where possible and if needed , serials working on the turnstiles
at Leppings Lane, I was in possession of my personal radio*

At 11am that date we received a further briefing at the rear of the West
Stand which is at the Leppings Lane end of the ground. This breifing was
carried out by Inspector £ftrkes who ensured that all officers were aware of
specific duties under his command outside the Leppings Lane end of the
ground* We were instructed to carry out slective searches of fans outside
the ground and to search any vehicles that were carrying Liverpool supporters
and depositing them at the ground* Serial 19 then went outside the ground
to the area of Leppings Lane adjacent to the turnstiles and the mouth of
the official car park at the rear of the South Stand* It was evident at this
point that large numbers of Liverpool fans were already in the area , many of
them asking if tickets were available and also asking for directions to any
local pubs that might be open* At 12 noon the turnstiles into the ground were
opened and some fans began to enter in an orderly fashion* Other fans were not
interested in entering the ground and wepe milling around in Leppings Lane
in quite large numbers many of them drinking from lager cans etc* Up Until about
1,30pm there did not appear to be any serious problems in Leppings lane despite
the fact that many fans (hundreds in my estimation) did not have tickets and
were drinking * From 1*3Qpm onwards maintaining any sort of order either at the
turnstiles or in Leppings Lane itself became very difficult* Officers from
serial 19 were constantly trying to remove fans without tickets from Leppings
Lane • This task was quite impossible as droves of Liverpool fans with
tickets were arriving * The pavements and the road way were completely blocked
and I was made aware that traffic was to be stopped from entering Leppings Lane*
Shotly afterwards a special train containing Liverpool fans was arriving and the
fans would shortly be arriving in Leppings Lane* By 2*3Qpm the situation in
Leppings Lane had deterioated to such an extent that I would say it became
everyman for himself* There was so much nastiness from some fans towards the
P o l i c e that a colleague of mine P«C, 2530 LOCKLEY commented that he had never
seen a situation quite like it * Fighting broke out in Leppings Lane at
about 2.35pra • some fans were arrested * People were coming upto me and
showing obvious forged tickets , some of them were mere photostat copies of
originals and this had created a lot of antagonism amongst supporters*
At about 2*^5pm the double gates situate to the left (as you look from outside
the ground) of turnstile number one were opened to ease what was obviousely
a crush at those turnstiles* Myself and P#C. 3135 BURNLEES went with Inspector
SIKES and other officers and eventually closed these gates to prevent any
other persons from entering the ground using that method* 1 was then aware that
problems were being encountered at turnstiles A to S and the crush there was
unbelivable • I went to the perimeter gates situate fifteen yards in front
of the turnstiles and tried to s. . :

close one of them to prevent any more persons from getting near to the turnstiles*
These gates were forced open by fans wanting to get to the turnstiles, ^he gates
were pushed wide open and fans began to scramble through towards the turnstiles*
Double exit gates just in the official car park were opened to ease the pressure
of the crush outside , one young male fan had already been lifted from withing
the crowd and handed over the top to police officers and fans were scrambling up the
outside wall to get into the ground* The opening of these gates caused many people
to rush through and lots of people in ^eppings Lane saw the opportunity to gain entry
and did so* l then heard a loud speaker announcement telling fans to get off the
pitch. ( I thought a pitch invasion had taifcen place). A radio message was passed for
all available officer®    rrrt rtnto the pitch * 1 did so and assisted at that location*

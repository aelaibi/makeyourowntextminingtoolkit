           I am a married man residing at the above address'.

           On the afternoon of Saturday 15 April          1989 I attended the F .A. Cup

           Semi Final Football Hatch between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at

           the Hillsborough football ground in Sheffiejra,

           I attended as a Liverpool supporter and brave supported Liverpool          for

           twenty years now.       I was a Season Ticket holder up until the end of

           last season and regularly attended home matches          last season.

           However,      since Hillsborough,   I have given up my season ticket and have

           not yet been to a match this season.

           I obtained my match ticket by using a voucher from my season ticket.

           The ticket was for the Leppings Lane standing area a nd cost me six

           po un ds .

           I travelled to the match with the following people;
                                                                                  PAGE             2

       They have both beerrseen by the Police.

       We travelled to Sheffield in my private car.          We went via the H56

       Motorway,    through Stockport and then along the A57 into Sheffield.                  We

       left Runcorn at nine thirty on the morning and travelled directly to

       Sheffield without making any stops.         We did not encounter any traffic

       delays on the way.

       We parked the car in a side street off the main Pennistone Road.                  I

       c a n ’t remember the name of the road,     but   it was only a couple of roads

       up from Leppings Lane.      We left the car at about quarter        past

       twelve and were only about a quarter of a mile away from the ground.

       We then walked around for a while      looking for a toilet and eventually

       found some toilets in the park near to the ground.            We then had a look

       around for a pub to have a drink      in.    We walked up a hill and found a

       pub that was open,      I think it was called the Horse and Jockey.          We

       went   in there shortly after one o'clock

       The pub was full with other Liverpool        supporters and it took a long

       time to get served.      We eventually got served and sat outside the pub,

fiH' The re we re other supporters outside who were all          in good spirits.

       There was one supporter outside the pub who was very drunk,             he was

       ’legless'    in fact.   He was a young lad, about eighteen,        he wasn't

       playing up, just being stupid.       I have sines seen this lad in

       newspaper    pictures showing him hugging a friend on the pitch in the

       aftermath of the disaster.       It was hard to believe      it was the same

       person.     he was the only person that I saw drunk/that afternoon.               We

       left the pub at about quarter to two and                 back to the car and

       had sandwiches and tea that we had taken with us,

       It only took us about five minutes to walk from Jfctie par to the ground,

       There were a few Policemen on the street,         but /Sot a/ jrfs fny as last

year.      /'/L
          WqyGid\3_U^ need directions to the ground, as I knew the way from

having attended the cor responding match at the ground in 1988.                 There

were a few supporters with cans of beer in the street on the way to

the ground,      but not many.     I did not see any fighting or any other

sorlt o,)f disorder,      everybody seemed happy a-rtd in good spirits.     It was
  ! / /ical    match day.

 e arrived at the turnstile area ^n ^ e p p i n g s Lane at about quarter

past t w o .    There were    people in the turnstile area entering the ground

and it was pretty straighforward to get to ac turnstile and go into the

ground.       There were two mounted Policeme/i i / thyr turn>ti 1 e area and

Policemen standing near to the t,urri5^|/es/

The crowd seemed quite subdued,         it wasn't   like a semi Final match and

the Police weren't         required to do anything at that Jflme.      There were a

couple of stewards         in the turnstile ajreayri/to w^/e wearing bright

orange bibs.       The stewards,    like the'-roliSr
                                                 1 iT^r weren't   required to do

anything with the Police.          The crowd were very quiet and there was no

real atmosphere at that time.          I did not see any unauthorised entry

into the ground,       but at that time there was no problem in getting into

the ground.       I handed my ticket into the turnstile operator and was

given back the stub.

Once    inside the ground I didn't see any signs giving directions to the

terraces.       At the corresponding match last year,       I watched the game

from the raised terracing         in the corner between the West Stand and the

North Stand.       Because of this,    I was aware that I could have gone

around the back of the stand to watch the match from there again.

However,            and         wanted to watch the match from behind the goal

to prevent splitting us up,         I said I would go with them behind the

goal.     Once inside the ground I did not see any fighting or disorder,

neither did I see any drunkenness or any people driaking.

To get to a position behind the goal we walked              onfe thg/ central

            tcyyfei undl»rng4i|th tp 4 West S t a n d .      We had a free passage along the

            tunnel,     it was quiet        in there.     1 don't remember seeing any Policemen

            or Stewards at the entrance to the tunnel                or anywhere inside it.       At

            the end of     the tunnel we went to the right hand side             and entered what

V       1   I now know     to be pen number three. We entered pen three              at about

            t.wenty past t w o .      It was very quiet in the pen at that time and we

            were able to walk down the terraces without any difficulty.                   I was

            very suprised because I thought it would have been a lot busier

            because it     was behind the goals.

            We took up     a position in front of a            crush barrier at the front of

            the pen.      This was the crush barrier on the left hand side of the pen,




            after twenty past two.

        >   During the next thirty minutes up until about ten to three,                  the pen

            was filling up, but it was just like standing in a normal                  crowd at a

    r       match.      There was the normal        pushing and shoving that y,ou get in a

            Football     crowd,   nothing more than normal.          It was ajrabout ten to three

            that there was a strong s,urge forwards in I h e ^ n .              It happened very

            suddenly and I felt as though I had been hit in the back with a sledge

            hammer.      I managed to straighten myself up and after doing so,              I felt

            very tightly packed in by the crowd.

            I was unable to move at all.                Prior to that strong forwar ds/ sur ge ,

                  and             had been standing about three or feet i n v f f               me,

            nearer the front of the pen.                Following the surge^ L/log^Xsight of

            them completely,        I didn't know where they were.           It was a couple of

            minutes after the surge that people around me started screaming.

            There were screams of panic and for people to push back,                  but it was

            impossible to push back.             I had restricted breathing but my main

       concern was to prevent myself from going down.             I knew that if I went

       down that would be it,         I wouldn't get up again.     I could see people

       around me beginning to slide downwards and faces becoming Whiter and

       Whiter.     X remember seeing the players having a kick about.           By now,

       managed to get over the fence.      Just prior to the kick off, I saw            a

       young lad with         a broken arm in front of me and to my right hand side.

       It was obvious that the lads left arm was broken because             it was in

       plaster and he was holding the arm out.            Seeing that the lad was in

Vl.c(t*“di 5t ress, myself and the man standing next to me on rny right,         each

~      grabbed the young         lad with one arm and somehow hoisted him up

       towards the top of the perimeter fence.            The fan who had already got

       out of the pen         then grabbed the lad.   Other   people inside the pen then

       pushed the lad         up over the fence and he got out.    The game kicked      off

       at about the same time that he         got over.

       By now there was a scramble by         people to get over    the fence and there

       was   constant screaming for the       gate to be opened.     The gate at the

       front of the pen hadn't been opened and there didn't appear to be any

       efforts to open it.          I helped to push a couple of people up towards

       the top of the fencing to get them out.            The game was only a couple of

       minutes old, when amongst all the screaming,           I heard very loud screams

       to my left.          It was a male voice screaming desperately "Get me out,

       get me out".

       I looked over to my left and saw the lad that was screaming.              The lad

       was in front of me,         perhaps a couple of steps down from where I was,

       about four feet away.          As I looked at him his screams became weaker

       and weaker.          At the same time his face was becoming very white.       For

       the next minute or so I was looking at the lad and switching back to

       the pitch.      Where the game was being played.        Whilst   I was looking at

       the pitch,     I saw the ball hit the Forest        crossbar.             I couldn't see who

       had hit the bar, although I now know that it was Peter Beardsley.                             it

       was about the time that the ball hit the Forest crossbar,                        that I again

       looked at the lad and saw that he was now still.                    He may have passed

       out or he may even have died.          He was still and was being held up by

       the crowd around him.         The lad was a white ma^e and age#d early
                                                                   j\              i

       fully from where I was standing.             The ladi

       was wearing a light brown leather j a c k e t / the bo mbe r/t yp e.               I

       couldn't see anything else of his c 1othifyf.               After seeing the lad

       still     in the crowd,    I again looked at the pitch.             I saw an attack on

       the Liverpool      goal by Forest which resulted in a corner for Forest.

       This was no more than a minute after Liverpool                   had hit the Forest bar.

       The corner was taken from my left,            thats as you look at the pitch.                  At

       the same time that the corner wa£ being taken,                   I was constantly

       looking a r o u n d .   When suddenly I saw^a large gap behind m e .                The gap

       suddenly appeared from nov^j/re. I T/n® q^fp was as far backytfs the next

       c rush b a r r ie r, in fact I could see the end of the barr/er.                   They gap

       was angled to my right,        towards the area of the qat;e in ¥he A r p n t

       ,fence.     I couldn't think why such a gap had appealed, m j y ^ n l y vcxHrtcern

       was to try and get out of the pen.             I went back up the terracing where

       the gap had suddenly appeared and joined a stream of people who were

       heading for the tunnel.         I got out of the pen             through the tunnel*          As

       I came out of the tunnel all         I could see were            people laid out and

       people being dragged out of the tunnel.             It was absolute             carnage.      I

       dont think anybody really knew what to do.One                    young Policeman seemed

       to just freeze.         I wanted to go back into the             terraces to try and

* f ind      and              I went back into pen three and walked down

 towards the front.      By now the match had stopped a rfp f the players had

 left the pitch.1 looked towards the front of the/yejfr [and all                   I could

 see was a pile of bodies up against the frojht            (Vf.    me       bodies were

 piled four or five high.         I went back up the terracing and went                 round

 into pen four to try and get out onto the pitch.               1 was eventually let

 out onto the pitch area by a Policeman who allowed me through the gate

 at the front of pen four.           As I got onto the pitch area I could see a

 lot of bodies     lined up on the grass near to the goals.             By now I was

 in a real daze and my only concern was the whereabouts of                              and

          I walked all around the pitch up as far as where the Police had.

 formed a cordon by the half way line.           I could n’t see               or

 I approached a Police        Inspector near to the gate at the         front of pen

 four and asked him for advice.           He adv ised/me    return to my c a r .              I

 Throughout the course of the afternoon I did not witness -^rfything that

 I would consider to be a criminal offence.

 As a result of my experiences at Hillsborough I sustjrtn/d                  X / r e n e s s to

 my ribs for a couple of days.

 I did not see a crush barrier break in pen three and the first time I

 became aware that a barrier had broken was on the television later in

 the evening.      However,    I am now convinced that     the sudden gap in the

 crowd behind me that is mentioned earlier, was             created at the time               of

 the barrier breaking.        Just    prior to the gap appearing there was a
                                                                                           PAGE

          strong push behind me towards the gate                               f the p e n.    This

          strong push would also have been in the di recti cjQ^f? the crush barrier

          that broke.

          At Hillsborough I wore the following          clothing - A plain red round

          necked jumper and                             jacket.         I wore blue    enim jeans

          and a pair of white training shoes.           I am a white male

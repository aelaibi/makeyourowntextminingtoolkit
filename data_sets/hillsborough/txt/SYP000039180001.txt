10.45 am            Alone to Leppings          Laneterraces and         West Stand,   because I have

been Inspector in charge of this end on a fairly regular basis since 1 9 8 5 .

I   hold    a    set    of   keys    to the    padlocks    on   inner   gates   and   the main   exit/

ingress         gates   A,    B     and   C.    Information      of     capacity   crowd,   therefore

padlocked six pen gates (one upstairs,                    five in terrace pens)       to wall in the

open position.           Checked that two West Stand            'wing' emergency exit gates had

bolts      'shot' with gate in closed position but gates NOT padlocked.                       Checked

storerooms and tunnel gates beneath West Stand (including switch gear room).

Quick physical check of terraces and elevated section for unwanted articles.

12 noon                 Turnstiles open.              Officers and stewards in position.                       Build up

gradual      and   friendly.            Well     behaved.       Made constant            checks      of snack bars,

programme        sellers        re     security.        Supervision         of        pen filling       unnecessary.

Officers, stewards and turnstile progress okay.

Between      1.30 pm and 2.00 pm.                   Approximately six men with Liverpool accents

at   Gate       'C' .        Steward        on gate    called       men.        Produced small         wallets       with

'yank' gate open but I anticipate and held firm. I slammed                                          it shut.     Repeat

performance ten minutes later.                      No entry.

and elevated section.                  No problems.

Approximately           2.40     pm.        Young     Police    Constable         with     'stupid     and legless'

drunk    wandering           about     in concourse          at rear A-G         turnstiles.           Did not know

where     to    go.       Took       him    to   Police      Room.     Had       to    support      drunk     all    way.

(Police Constable 1719 or 1715 or similar).

2.45    pm              Checked        watchleaving         police    room,      radio      message,         "Get some

more    horses          up    here"        (or      similar). Auto          -    assumed Leppings            Lane end.

Unknown        officer       said,     "Sounds       like    its     getting      busy     at   your    end    Harry".

Returned       to Leppings Lane end via route                        under North Stand.               Getting busy.

Concourse       rear      11-16.           Climbing over       wall    above      gate      'B' .     Joined Police

Constables         at     'B'    gate       entice     down.         Fans       distrustful.           Waving       their

tickets.         Inspector        John Bennett had climbed onto turnstile roof to deal.




                                                                                                                            18

Aware    of     the     crush outside       11-16       turnstiles.               Coming through          very    slowly.

Stepped        away    from    turnstiles        to    watch            Inspector Bennett         but     two    o r three

times      I    was     pulled      by    Liverpool             people      who    had     got     inside       who    were

complaining about the crush outside.                             "You should be out there.                  People are

gonna get killed".

Through the gate in the wall                  between the two concourses at the rear of two

sets of turnstiles.                I became aware of a movement of people.                               From previous

experience I knew it was too much for turnstile flow and there were too many

for waiting friends responding to a kick off or crowd cheer or similar.                                                   I

stepped        through      into    the   concourse             behind A-G.          (Not    sure       whether    pulled

again by fans).

Twice called on radio using allocated call sign 'India 7'-

I seemed to recall that all the turnstiles had stopped.                                          Men were screaming

trapped         in    them.        Gate   'C' was open and                 people were coming           through.       The

terror           in     the turnstiles communicated                         itself    to me       and     brought      the

seriousness of the situation to mind.

I went out through gate 'C'.

I remember           standing alongside          Inspectors               Graham Delaney          and Bob Purdy and

Sergeant John Morgan pulling people out of the crush on turnstiles A-G.                                                   I

feared some would be killed.                  Some were reluctant to come.                         I think they had

got   so        close    tothe      turnstiles they              had       the single intention            of    passing

through.        I shouted at some, and as many as possible I pulled under the                                          iron

bar   that      is a continuation of the wall housing gate                                 'C'.        The crush quite

suddenly        eased.         I    saw   gate        'B'       had      been    opened.         The    queues     became

controllable          and     containable     again.              The      two    turnstiles      nearest       gate    'C'

appeared to function again.                  Sergeant Barry Sorsby on his police horse came

up to railing and using the horse as a barrier we were able to filter out of




                                                                                                                              19

this agitated crowd fans who produced tickets.                          I told the otc-ai-ds on gate

'C' to take the stubs.

By now I have no idea of time or what is happening outside.

By word of mouth information passed,                     "Inside - Pitch invasion".              Went to the

pitch via rear of police control box and down the first steps                                   in the South

Stand.     I saw no players or officials on the pitch.

The invasion appeared to have                     spread as far as the penalty            spot.        I got on

to the pitch and had got near                     to the goal post when I noticed those on the

pitch were        not running towards opponents end or away from Police Officers.

Some were holding themselves,                  others lying down.        I looked towards the fence

holding    back     fans       in    the      Leppings       Laneterraces.     Police        Officers      were

standing    on     the    fence      and       leaning    over. Through the        gaps   in     the    legs I

could see the faces of fanspressed against the fence.                              I realised they were

stood up dead.            The gate to this pen was                 opened. I   think      it was number 3

gate.

Automatically        (or it seemed)           Police Officers formed a double line up to the

gate and formed a chain gang to pass out casualties.                           When there was no one

at your end of the line to pass on the casualty, you carried it on to the

pitch.      Police        Constable        2417    Pete Rotchel     and I    carried      the    unconscious

body of a 14 years old boy,                   dressed in a blue tee-shirt and blue jeans, on

to the     pitch.         I   felt    his    heart    beat   but   his breathing       was      so   extremely

shallow that I thought he was dead.                      We prepared to do mouth-to-mouth when I

realised     he     was       in    fact    breathing    himself.      We    did   not    interrupt       this

natural breathing and monitored his condition very closely, keeping him warm

and protected.            I remember as I was kneeling over him that I was kicked in

the back.     I seemed surrounded by the click-whizz, click-whizz of cameramen.




                                                                                                                  20

People    came       with   a board         and    this    boy    was    carried      away.       More       came    with

another board to carry away the young woman being attended to next to us.                                               I

remember intervening as they were going to place her on the board nails up.

I turned      and     saw     behind me       a    fireman       apply    cardiac      massage         to a male       in

early    thirties.          He   then       gave    oral    resuscitation            and    I knelt         beside    the

casualty to do cardiac massage.                      As the fireman sat back he signalled me not

to continue.          We checked for vital                life signs,         there were none.               I covered

the casualty's face with the front of his sweater.

I heard someone say,             "They're charging".               I looked towards the Spion Kop and

saw   people     on     the    field moving          towards       it.        They    were    not      running.        It

looked as though a confrontation was imminent.                                 I went beyond the half way

line and made uniformed officers form up in a line.                                  There was a line across

the   width     of    the     pitch.        This    halted the progress               of the Liverpool              fans.

Some of them were crying.                   Some were       frustrated.          Some       were angry.         It did

not help to hear the mass                   of Notts fans behind chanting and goading.                               They

seemed unaware of the tragedy.

4.20 pm               This was the first lull in the sequence of events since I left

the police room.              I looked at my watch, it was 4.20 pm.                         I became aware that

my radio was still working.                   There were public address announcements and the

ground slowly emptied.

5.00 pm               Given hot        drinks.       Mustered serials            in North Stand and spoke

to officers distressed by experiences.

About    5.30    pm     I     went     to   gymnasium       which       was   being        used   as    a    temporary

mortuary and I assisted in the collation of details of the dead.

11.00 pm              Went off duty from the gymnasium.

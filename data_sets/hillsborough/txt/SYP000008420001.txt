        Our        crew went           to    our       post       at      about       2.30        pm.        I remember             looking

        around         the       stands          at    t hi s     time       at    the       supporters.                 I particularly

        remember            thinking             that       the     standing            area       at    Lappings             Lane     End      below

        the        west     Stand       was       not       as     crowded         as    I had          seen       it    on    previous

        occasions            when Liverpool                      h av e    been       playing           or    other       teams        with      l ar g e

        followers            such       as       Manchester               United        at    such       a    late       time.         Shortly

        before         3.00       pm    the       teams          came      out     onto       the       pitch       and       the    supporters

        around         the       ground          cheered.              The      cheering           subsided             and    the     whistle         was

        blown         for    the       start          of    the     match.

        As     usual        police          officers             were      standing           around          the       perimeter          of    the

        pitch,         I think          there          were       2 or       3 at       each       end and          each       side,       I c a n ’t

back        to    the       football           pitch        to    look      for    rny f i r s t        aid      bag    which        I had

left       out        t he r e .     I walked           onto        the     pitch       and       by    this      t i me    there           were

just        one       or    two     policemen           on       the    pitch,         all    the       fans      had      gone.            I could

se e   a     lot       of    police         officers             sitting         together          in     the     North       Stand

being        spoken          to     by a n o t h e r        police        officer.            I thought             it w a s       some       kind

of     briefing.!              found        my    bag       and     returned           to    the       First      Aid      r o om a n d

joined           my     colleagues.,              i    remained           there        until       about         6.00prn w h e n            I left

the     ground             with     colleagues              in the        S t . Johns         A m b u l a n c e .I was         extremely

shocked           and       distressed            while          I was      assisting             with     the      injured         and

trying           to     revive       the       deceased.               1 have       never         before         been      involved            in

anything              of    this     nature           and    I have         only       ever       seen     one      dead      person

before           and       that     was     an    old       lady       in the      home       where        I work.            I did          not

s ee    any       acts       of     violence           by    the       fans      during       this        incident.                I must

admit        that          1 found        it     very       confusing            and    shocking.

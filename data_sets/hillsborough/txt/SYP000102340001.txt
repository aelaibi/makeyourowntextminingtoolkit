On Saturday 15 April 1989, I was on duty on the occasion of the FA Semi Final
between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                My duties were the same as last
years Semi-Final match between the same teams.                 I was Logistics Officer at
Claywheels Lane, Traffic Section.


My main responsibility was the feeding of serials 22-64.                  259 officers were
to attend after kick-off and 155 officers                after half-time. Hot meals were
provided by the Catering Staff.


I was also responsible for ensuring that only authorised police vehicles
parked on the garage forecourt and a good deal of my time was spent at the
front of the building.             I saw Liverpool coaches parking in Claywheels Lane
from      early morning      and    saw the Liverpool      fans making     their way along
Claywheels Lane towards Penistone Road North in, what appeared to me to be,
a good natured way.


Well before 3 pm Claywheels Lane was filled with Liverpool coaches and
between 2.30 pm and 3 pm there was only the odd car came along, the occupants
asking if there was somewhere to park.


From the front of the Traffic Garage I could see the junction of Claywheels
Lane/Penistone Road North.             In the 15 minutes up to 3 pm I could see many
supporters making their way to the ground.               During the 30 minutes leading up
to 3 pm I also heard reports' over my radio of trouble in the Gate Inn, The
Fox, and the Five Arches public houses.


Just after 3 pm I heard a call over the radio for all officers to attend
inside the ground.         I saw a group of officers approaching the Traffic garage
and went down to meet them to direct them                to the ground.   Several officers
had obtained a hot meal from the catering                van and      were aboutto sit down at
tables in the Traffic garage.               These officers were also sent back to the
ground.     At that time it was thought that it was a public order problem.


I   was    assisted   at     Claywheels     Lane   by   Sergeant   2264   Hewitt,   Training
Department,     and   from    the    time   that   problems   began   to occur until    late
                                                                          110

evening I kept a log of all calls to the Traffic Section for assistance.
Requests for motor cyclists to open routes to the Hallamshire and Northern
General Hospitals were passed to Superintendent Brougham.        A request was
made for the two Force coaches to transport relatives to Hammerton Road from
the football ground.   The handwritten log was handed to Inspector Sewell at
8.45 pm that evening when I delivered the collected radios to the police
room.


As officers were released from the ground during the afternoon they returned
to Claywheels Lane.    It was apparent that many were in deep shock and very
distressed.   An enquiry was made     of   the Barnsley and District General
Hospital regarding possible treatment.     The advice given was to talk if they
wished, to let them sit quitely if they wished; but not to leave them alone.
I assigned PC Jessop, E2 Sub-Division, who had come on duty as the result of
a radio appeal, to sit with them and to make a note of their collar numbers.
From this a list was later prepared for the information of the Force Welfare
Officer.


During the late afternoon several Liverpool fans called in at Claywheels
Lane requesting to use the telephone to contact relatives.      I saw at least
one fan who was still suffering heavily from the effects of drink.     He kept
repeating "we are not to blame for this".

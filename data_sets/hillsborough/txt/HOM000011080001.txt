HILLSBOROUGH

As I mentioned to you yesterday afternoon Lord Justice Taylor's
interim report into the Hillsborough disaster was published at
11 am this morning and should now be available at all HMSO
bookshops.

The following pages comprise a press statement by the Home
Secretary and a Home Office circular to all chief constables and
others introducing the report and urging them to act on the
report's recommendations without delay.




                                                                 F J SMITH

                I am the above         named     person and         live at the above address wit h my

               wife.     I have      resided here        for     17 y e a r s .

                I have    lived      in S h e f f i e l d all    of my       life,    through my chi 1dhood                       I came

                through the         ranks   of the Boy Scouts,                St Johns Am bu la nc e Brigade,                       Air

               Train in g Corps and finally did my national                            service with the Royal                        Air

               Force.     I have always          been a trained first aider and                         regard myself as a

               keen volunteer.

                I am a time served                        engineer and have served                      in this         trade

                since    I was      15 years     of age.        Without app ea ri ng           to be boastful                I would

                say that     I am at the         top of my tree wi th in the                                 industry.

                I am    presently the                              for a company              called

The    company       is A me r i c a n owned.

T h r o u g h our agents we supply equipment                   to Fire Brigades          throughout

Europe,        m i li ta ry o r g a n i s a t i o n s , international    rescue and any other

e m e r ge nc y    response    group.

Back    in 1982 one of my            interests was CB           radio.     Part of this was a

group     called REACT         (Radio E me r g e n c y Act io n Citizens Team).                 In brief we

used to monitor            the eme rg en cy     channel       <9) and were often           called    in to

search for          lost    children,    assist with m o t o r w a y accidents and the                   like.

T here were about 80 such volunteers,                     at    its best      in the S h e f f i e l d

area.     UK wide there were m any thousands.                    U n f o r t u n a t e l y as CB became

more    p o p u l a r , the u nd es irable      element       s p o i 11 it for the      rest and        radio

discipline went out              of the window.       The o rg an i s a t i o n gra du al ly d ec lined

1eaving a hard             core group of about 40 of us who still wi sh ed to serve

the    community        in some way,      and also       to return to the di sc ip li ne d

s t a nd ar d which we set originally.

We dec ided as a group to form an o rg an i s a t i o n which we                        christened

BECQN     (Becon E m e r g e n c y C o m m u ni ca ti on s N e t w o r k ) . The word B E CO N was

init ia te d to        reflect    the fact      that the B e a c o n was       the first         recognised

means     of      communication.      We decided that CB was               no longer       the    best

means     of      radio t ra ns m i s s i o n and a p p li ed to the Home Office                for a PMR

(Personal Radio System)               and we re granted our             own w a v e b a n d .

The    early growth of B EC ON           is well     d o c um en te d   in the     pamphlets       that       I

have    h anded to DS M c C O M B I E .

To bring          us up to present       our o r g an is at io n has about 30 members.                   E very

member      is a trained         radio   operator.       50    percent are trained and

q u a l i f i e d first aiders a nd 5 are trained to use the thermal                             cutting

equipment,          a gain the    literature      that    I have handed to DS M cC O M B I E

explains          our mo de rn day uses.

w or k e d with Police Cadets at events                    like the M ar a t h o n and motor

rallies.

Although      I have never          had a formal         meeting as such with a senior

P olice Officer.         I have had       informal         c on ve rsation at meetings           when

planning events          like the marathon.              As far as       I am aware       the m a j o r i t y

of Police Officers            know the a v a i l a b i l i t y    of BECON.

In the      past   I have     had    contact the following Police Officers,                         Mr

              Inspector B R A D L E Y , S up er i n t e n d e n t P RATT and          latterly Mr

the Police Public Rel at io ns Officer.

I have also        offered the use of our o rg an i s a t i o n to the S Yorkshire

Fire and Civil         Defence Authority,            E m e r g e n c y Planning Unit.         You will

see a letter         from them dated the             11/4/89      (110489)         in reply to a letter

sent      by me on the 7 of M a rc h          1989       (170389).     Our    proposal     was    to show

a video to the a u t h o ri ti es         to underline what we had available.

I know for a fact           that B E CO N appears           on the S Y or kshire Police

E m e r g e n c y Computer.    It shows what we have available.                       I personally went

to Snig Hill a couple of years ago and had                             it confirmed to me that we

were      on the   computer.        I think    I had gone along              to change a phone

number.      I can't     remember who         I spoke       to but      it was whoever        was    in

charge      of the     control      room at that tim e. Fr om the vehicles                   that we

presently have a v a i la bl e          speaking about           the    15.4.89      (150489)     thats 7

Land Rovers,         1 mobile       control    truck and a first aid                 caravan,    each

w ou ld    contain a basic first aid kit,                   we do not        carry oxygen or         ’minute

m e n ’ equipment.       In reality our first aid facilities would not have

been any greater,           in fact      less than the St Johns Ambulance Brigade.

On the day of the H i l l s b o r o u g h disaster,              as    I saw       it unfold on the TV

my   ’t e a m ’ were    on stand to for about 3 . 20 pm (1520).                      I was e:< pe ct i ng a

call      from the Police Control             Room but       it never        came.

On the      13th of April        1989    (150489)        8 members      were on duty at the               ski

village,      not far from the H i l l s b o r o u g h ground.               The    communications

               truck and a couple                 of Land Rovers were         there.

               I w ould say that our main                    role   in a major      disaster would be

               communications,              possibly between hospitals               in the event      of T e l ec om

               lines being            tied up.

               We have        never a ct i v e l y taken        part    in mock     excercises with the Police

               Fire     or Ambulance Services.                 We have taken        part    in displays and

               d e m o ns tr at io ns      i.e.    eme rg en cy services      shows,       open days   etc.

               B E CO N has never been              called out      to a major       incident.    We've    been out

               help the Fire Brigade                 on the moors with a scrub fire and once                   by the

               Police       to search for a m en ta l l y            retarded      child,    who had gone missing

               In reality,            on the      15.4.89     (150489)     I had the equipment ava il ab le             to

               f acilitate           the   removal       of the fencing at H i l l s b o r o u g h within minutes

               Ha vi ng     said that        it would have          been dependant         on what time    I was

               called.       On the day my equipment was                   probably superior       to the Fire

               Brigades.            The fact      that we were       not   called out on the day has

               s e r i o us ly demora li se d our org an is at io n to the extent                 that we are

               considering            ’winding      u p ’ and donating       the    equipment    to the Red Cross

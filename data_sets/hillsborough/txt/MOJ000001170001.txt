        Dear Sirs

        ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

        We refer to our telephone call this morning in relation to the Hillsborough case. We
        made you aware that we act on behalf of Mr Bernard Murray. You already have an
        application for leave to apply for Judicial Review lodged by Winckworth Sherwood on
        behalf of David Duckenfield and which has the number CO/856/99.

        You are aware that it is intended to lodge an application for leave to apply for Judicial
        Review on behalf of our Client, Bernard Murray, and that it is intended that the two
        applications should be consolidated and heard at the same time.

        We have met with Leading Counsel this morning. We have just about finished the
        drafting of the application and the Affidavit and exhibits are also at an advanced stage
        of readiness. We expected to be able to courier all of the papers to London on
        Thursday. For these purposes Winckworth Sherwood will act as our Agents and they
        will attend early on Friday morning at the Crown Office with a view to issuing the
        application. You have indicated that you will in some way ensure its link- with the
        Duckenfield application.

        You are putting the matter in the list for Thursday 11 March 1999, We look forward
        to receiving from you the formal notice of the time and Court for this matter, We have
        suggested that if there is to be an argument as to the grant of leave to apply then that
        might occupy between two to three hours. It is expected that appearance will be by Mr
        Michael Harrison QC and my Simon Myerson, both of whom are of Park Court
        Chambers, Park Cross Street, Leeds, telephone 0113 243 3277.

        Yours faithfully                                                                               \ W                          .

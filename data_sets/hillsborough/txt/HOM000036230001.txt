HILLSBOROUGH: LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH

Mike Granatt and Brian Butler from CD met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith yesterday
to discuss media handling arrangements. Mr Butler minuted the Home Secretary
and commented:

          "The judge's view is that the submission will not be made public and all
          he will submit to you will be his report. This could be seen to be at
          variance with your comments in the House that the evidence will be
          published. You may want to speak to the judge about this".

2.    The Home Secretary has asked for further advice on this point and I would
be grateful if I could have this for the Friday box if at all possible.

PHOTO CALL AND BRIEFING BY LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH

The Home Secretary has seen your minute of 9 July. He commented that it was
a very helpful note and asked me to pass on his thanks.

2.     The Home Secretary is entirely content for a photo call. However he is
concerned about interviews or briefings at this stage and would want to be
closely consulted about any such proposed arrangements.

3.   I am minuting Mr Pugh separately about the issue of public evidence who
may wish to speak to you further about the issue you raised.

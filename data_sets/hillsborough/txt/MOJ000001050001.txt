                Dear Gillian

                HILLSBOROUGH INQUEST

                I refer to our recent telephone conversation and am enclosing a separate note
                of the problem that now faces me in relation to release of documents.

                I would be grateful if you could give some thought to this matter and perhaps
                take an opinion from the Home Office, Legal Department.  Your urgent
                attention to my query would be greatly appreciated.

                I look forward to hearing from you.




               Yours sincerely




               C P Dorries
               H M Coroner

Dear Peter,

Police Committee                   fleeting

It may be helpful                   for the Chief Constable to have available the
attached extracts                   from the final report of Mr. Justice Popplewell
in respect of the                   1985 committee of inquiry into crowd safety in
control at sports                   grounds.

You will see that. the extract makes some very clear, and I think
helpful, points a.aout the responsibilities of the Police in relation
to crowd control at sporting events.

It is fair to say that the Popplewell report focused very rruch on
events occurring Inside the ground, but I do not think that that
substantially lesfe ens the force of the conclusions.


Yours sincerely,




Peter C. Metcalf

(iJ Stewards and Policing
  4.20 A num ber o f clubs have been impressed by the presence of stewards jfrom visiting clubs who look
after their own supporters. This is a practice which has much to commend itj One witness reported that at
O stend a serious confrontation between the Belgian police and Liverpool supporters was defused by the
presence o f Liverpool stewards.

 ' 4.21 In some police forces it has been possible for one or two officers to travel with fans when they go
away and thus assist the “ home policc” in identifying trouble-makers. In ot ler cases home stewards have
been able, at away matches, to stand a t the home turnstile and ensure that their own supporters d o not
infiltrate the opposition terraces

   4.22 A number o f clubs have shown me the handbooks which have been is,sued to their stewards. I have
seen also cards issued to police officers with instructions as to their duties iin the ground. The handbook
for Bristol Rovers, for instance, was written pursuant to the conditions o f th eir Safety Certificate and was
approved by the police. It is a thoroughly comprehensive and sensible docurr ent dealing both with general
m atters o f stewarding and with the question o f evacuation in the event o f ar emergency. It is to be hoped
th at all other clubs will have done the same.

   4.23 In my Interim Report I recommended that the Green Guide should 5e amended to read: “ All exit
gates should be manned at ail times while the ground is used by the public a ltd be capable of being' opened
immediately from inside by anyone in an emergency.” 1 Leicester City Footbai11 Club have a system o f exit
doors worked on a magnet system which are automatically controlled from a central office. Ipswich have
a similar sort o f system. Understandably there is concern that if my Recc mmendation were applied to
them they would be required to have a steward at each gate and that this w'ould vitiate the whole scheme,
It was not my intention that this Recommendation should apply to exits whic l are automatically controlled,
if these types o f mcchanisms are acceptable to the responsible local authoritip:!S.

(ii) Powers o f Search
    4.24 In my Interim Report I said that I was minded to recommend th a t , in England and Wales, the
 police be given the unfettered right o f search before entry into football g r■ounds, by statute.2 1 there set
 o u t the problems relating to police powers o f search which are contained in the Police and Criminal
 Evidence Act 1984 which comes into effect on 1 January 1986.

    4.25     The disquiet arose bccause, by Section 1(3) o f the Act, a constabl    : only has power to search a
 person o r a vehicle, or anything in o r on a vehicle, i f he has reasonable growmds fo r suspecting that he will
fin d stolen or prohibited articles. A prohibited article includes an offensive W<:;apon.

       4.26    The passage of the Bill through Parliament gave rise to considerably controversy about the extent
    and nature o f police powers. On the one hand there were those who expressed disquiet about what were
    called colloquially the “ sus laws" and those who wanted to give the police almore effective weapon against
    crime. It is not part of my function to comment on the arguments nor on the result. N or do I wish to
    make any observation about the Act, save in relation to sports grounds (ana particularly football grounds)
    with which I am concerned. The wider implications are not for me to consider.

      4.27                                                                      place for very large n u m b e r s of
               Football grounds are in their way unique in that they arc a regular
    people to meet. Some o f those who attend football do so intending to caus : trouble. Every Saturday, for
    about three-quarters o f the year, about half a million people go to footl) all matches. Thus football is
    different in kind, nature and purpose from any other activity o f the commu ■lity.

    .. 4J28 The “ reasonable ground for suspicion” safeguard in the Act, which is :here for the general protection

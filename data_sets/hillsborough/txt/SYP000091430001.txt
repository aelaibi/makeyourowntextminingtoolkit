           I am a married man & live at the above address with my family,                  I am

           employed on a part time basis as a Steward at Sheffield Wednesday

           Football Club.     I have been doing this for about 8 or 9 years.



           On Saturday 13th April       1*?8$^M50489) I was working at the club as a

           Steward and my duty was to cover the^s^r park at the rear of the North

           Stand.   Due to rny position I was not aware of the incident in the

           ground, all    I knew was the match had been stopped but I d i d n ’t know

           for what reason.



           At about 3.25pm    <1525)    injured people started to arrive         in the area

           behind the North Stand, whe re tfrs^F i rst Aid Station is 1o c at e d.          11

           was only then that    I realised s o m e t h i W i m a t a r had happened.   I then

                                                                                                    S3569

               realised that some of the people were actually dead.                        The whole scene

               suddenly be came sheer pandemonium.



               I was in charge of three other stewards & I liaised with the Police

               Officers       I could find t-flask for their instructions as to ambulances

               coming in and out of the c a r p a r k .            With my colleagues we tried to

               keep the access           clear and this en'N^i led movi(\ng some bodies out of the

               The man I can remember was white, aged about 24-23 years,                       he was quite

               fat, about 5 / IQ 11 tall,           short dark brown hair,     he was clean shaven.         He

               was wearing jeans & a dark top,                 I can't remember    if it was a shirt or

               T shirt.        He had no visible          injuries that 1 could see other than he

               had a blue/grey colour to his face.



               I cannot remember who I helped carry this body with.



               The only other body I can remember anything about was a young lad we

               carried but his face was covered & I c a n’t remember anything else

               about h i m .

               I eventually left the ground at about 5 . 3 0 pm (1730) when all the

               bodies were in the gym & all the seriously injured had been taken away.

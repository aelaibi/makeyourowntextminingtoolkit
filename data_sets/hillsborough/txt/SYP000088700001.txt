               have    been so empl oye d for 6                  (six)    years.

              On Saturday           15th April          1989     (150489),        I was   on my day off and spending

               some    time at the                                                                 I was wat ch in g

               I watched         it up until          the time       it was       reported that       there were

               fatalaties,         as a result              I teleph one d the N o r t h e r n General

               Hospital       and off ere d my assistance.

               I ar r i v e d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y     1530 hours         (Fifteen thirty hours).

               As soon as         I arrived,          I as si st ed to unload the amb ul an ce s as they

               ar r i v e d at the doors,             I was engaged on this for about twenty minutes.

               As we we re emptyi ng the a m b u l a n c e s , Mr W A R D R O B E , Con su lt an t                    in

                acc id en t and em e r g e n c y was as se ssi ng the                    people as were memb ers                            of the

                medical       records office.

                Mr W A R D R O B E dict at ed where              each individual               sho uld be taken.                Once          I

                was    relieved of my duties                    at that     particular           point,   I went          to wa r d 60

                on level          D, and m ov ed        the existing          patients          to other wards            that were

                ava i l a b l e    to a c c o m m o d a t e    them.

                After     this       task,     I went         to my own Dep ar tm en t           to assist wit h supplies.

                After     this,       I went      to assist         in the      plaster         room wh ich had been

                s u b s t i t u t e d as a te m p o r a r y mortuary.              I guess        the time w ou ld have                       been

                about      1700 hours.

a W *r
                Four of the bodies sticto-fn my mind,                            the first one being;

                A) A white male,               be tw e e n     12-13 y e a r s of age,           dark short      hair           neatly

                cut   .
                                           He was wea ri ng what a p p e a r e d to be the new Liverpool

                shirt w hi ch had “Crown" across                       the front,         a l s o blue denim jeans a nd

                trainers.           Whether       he had one or two on I d o n ’t know,                     but         I w ou ld             be

                more      likely to remember                  if he only had one.                He had a small               frame a nd

    'A'         quite      light      in weight.

                P ri or   to their          removal       th ey.were       numbe red by a P o l i ce wo ma n

                Inspector and a P o l i c e w o m a n Sergeant.

                B) White          m a l e ,a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2 3-25 y e ^ / s , he       had a drip       in place in

                his    left       arm.    He had short mou sy h/own hai r                        wh ic h was    cut above

                a n d ar o u n d his ears and neatly sVyled,                        he    was wea rin g a ear- rin g                         in

                his    left       ear.    He had about a afays growth                     of      facial   hair. He was

                w e a r i n g a Li verpool          officiair "Crown" shirt,                    light blue jeans.                     I
                                                                                                                   PAGE

             distinctly        recollect      that he was wearing              b r a n d / n e w white Terry

             To wl i n g    socks.    I also     remember        he had    in l^fs posses sio n £6 0       in £20

             Bank    of En gl a n d notes,       a small        box of m a r c h e s , a n d a ticket    stub.            He

             was also wearing          trainers.             I do not   recollect       the   colour.

             C)            White   female,    about       13-14 years      oA a g e , collar     length and m o u s e y

       y     brown     in colour      h a i r , it w a s cfiXi ts/ s t r a i g h t .   She was quite thin and

             wea ri n g a             bra,    and               pants

             D) White male,          18-12 stone          in weight wi t h a beer         belly.     I guess         he

             wo ul d be a b o u t 4 0 - 4 5 y e a r s .      He was u n c lo th ed and had no valuables.

             Th es e are the only ones                that   I can describe        from all     the ones       I

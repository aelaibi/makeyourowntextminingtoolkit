HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER INQUIRY

1.    David Belfall of the Scottish Home and Health Department has passed
to me your le tte r of 23 May because we have agreed th a t, because of this
Departm ent’s responsibilities in Scotland for the safety of sports grounds
legislation, we should have the co-ordinating in terest within the Scottish
Office for the issues embraced by your In q u iry 's term s of reference.
2.    At this stage, our view is th at th ere is nothing on which the
Scottish Office Departm ents would want to offer a w ritten subm ission.
However, we are making arrangem ents with our opposite num bers in the
Home Office and the Departm ent of the' Environment to receive copies of
th eir submissions and if th ere is anything we think we can usefully add
to them from a Scottish p erspective, we will certainly do so. We would of
course also be glad to respond to any special questions you may have
about Scottish asp ects.
3.    At Grade 7 level, the point of contact is Mr T elfer Blacklock and at
Grade 5, Miss M argaret Maclean. Both are located in New St Andrew's
House, Edinburgh (telephone nos GTN-7188-4484 and GTN-7188-4494
resp ectiv ely ).

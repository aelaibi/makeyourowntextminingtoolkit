        From      sometime              around mid-day                       (1200)          to a b o u t          1 .30       pm     (1330)       there       wa s

        good      friendly              spirits.

        After       1. 3 0       pm      (1330)       I was             approached                by a n u m b e r             of     supporters           who

        Also      at       this         time     I noticed a                  number           of      supporters                in the S S t a n d            were

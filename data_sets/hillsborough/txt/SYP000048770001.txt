Cheshire,




Dear Madam,


REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

I refer to your letter dated 5th February 1991, regarding your request for copies
of                Ian WHELAN’S video and photographs.

The policy on the release of information is as follows

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West Midlands Police
back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.

The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions(in conjunction with the
Police Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.  I now have to look to South
Yorkshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in responding
to your request.

At the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
release any information to any party.  This is based on legal advice that has been
given which indicates that information should only be released on the order of a
court which could include that of the Coroner.

I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained at the
present time I must decline your request.

Yours faithfully,




j. neivyu j u h l d ,
Deputy Chief Constable
                                           Sheffield

Dear
Thank you for your letter of 5 February 1991.
I am asking the West Midlands Police team to reply to your letter
but I fear that, speaking for myself, I have no facilities for
making copies of the video and much less producing edited versions.
I am sorry if this will be a disappointment to you.
Yours sincerely

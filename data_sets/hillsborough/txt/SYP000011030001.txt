Dear Sir,
I am writing this letter as I feel I owe it to all those fans
who died or who were injured in such tragic circumstances at
Sheffield Wednesday's ground on April 15th.

Firstly I would like to relate to you my experiences at the same
ground last year in the semi-final between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest. My 11 year old son, his friend and his
father and myself obtained tickets for the Leppings Lane part of
the ground. To get into this part of the ground, after passing
through the turnstiles, we had to pass through a narrow tunnel
beneath the West Gate stand. There were many, many fans heading
for this tunnel and it became very congested many yards before
entering the tunnel. There were no pplice officers or stewards
to control and marshal the fans through this tunnel and once in
the tunnel the congestion obviously greatly increased.

Now although the tunnel is relatively short it took some time to
actually get through it. Inside the tunnel there was jostling
and pushing and many people were stumbling. My son during this
time was being severely crushed and had difficulty in
breathing. I'm 6ft 2" and weigh 16 stone and had extreme
difficulty in pushing people away from him but fortunately I
managed to hold on to him.
Eventually we moved out of the tunnel but if anything the
situation became worse and the pressure of the crowd behind
became worse, causing many fans to stumble and fall down the
steps only to disappear under the crowd. Even once through
the tunnel it was impossible to move sideways as the
momentum of the crowd continued to push us forward. We were
forced to duck under metal barriers or suffer even more
crushing. Finally we were forced right up against the
barriers which prevent the fans from getting on to the
pitch. During the match we had to constantly bear the
crushing force of the crowd swaying forward from behind. It
would not have been so bad if we had been able to move
sideways, away from this central part, but it was so packed,
and the constant pushing, jostling and surging of the fans
made this prospect appear even more dangerous.

                                   1   SOUTH^OR^SrpOUC r _ ||


                                           2 7 APR 1989
                            -   2   -




During the game some fans actually collapsed or fainted and
were passed over peoples heads towards the front of this
section of the ground. We were by the gate in the barrier
fence just behind the goal and witnessed the following:-

  Some fans tried to open this gate but it had been
  padlocked. Some fans attracted the attention of a
  policeman or steward, I can't remember which, but he
  appeared to be totally unaware of the situation. As a
  result these fans became extremely agitated and tried to
  force the gate open but eventually an official obtained a
  key, the padlock was opened together with the gate, and
  the distressed fans passed to safety.
   During the whole of this game we were very concerned for
   the safety of our youngsters but the police were only
   allowing injured fans through the gate. After the match
   finished we all vowed never to enter the Leppings Lane
   end ever again.
As far as I am concerned,, when there is a large crowd
entering this part of the ground, it will always be a death
trap. It must be on very rare occasions when Sheffield
Wednesday have enough visiting supporters to this part of
the ground sufficiently to fill it completely and I believe
they are not aware of how dangerous it can be. The whole
layout for entry into the Leppings Lane end of the ground
and the layout inside the ground is a major hazard when
there are lots of fans entering the ground.

Under the circumstances I have described to you and the
additional events which occured at this semi-final - large
crowds, gates being opened to allow more fans in, lack of
police and stewards to act as marshals who would guide and
control the passage of fans into the ground, apparent lack
of police communications, then it is not surprising that
today, innocent people were injured and even more
tragically, lost their lives.
At this semi-final we had tickets for the West Gate stand
which is built up over the Leppings Lane part of the ground
and it was from here that we were to witness the harrowing
and heartbreaking chain of tragic events.
The match had been started for about 5 minutes when we saw a
slowly growing number of fans trying to ascend the barrier
which is supposed to keep them off the pitch. At first we
thought that this was due to hooliganism and violence going
on unseen beneath us or even just a pitch invasion but as
the events unfolded, we soon realized that many fans had
been seriously injured.

Even so the police took a long time to open the gates in the
fence - were they reluctant to do so or were the gates
padlocked once again. Even when the gates had eventually
been opened the police were pushing fans, who had climbed
over, back through this gate into the ground where people
were still being crushed to death. The police on the pitch
seemed to be the last people in the ground to realise a
major tragedy had happened and confusion amongst them
increased. Some police were helping fans to climb over the
fence while just a few yards away other officers were
preventing fans getting over the fence by pushing them back.

Now everyone in the ground were dismayed and unable to
believe what was going on before their very eyes. People
lay all over the pitch, some appeared to be in agony, some
had collapsed once they got onto the pitch, still yet others
were carried, apparently unconscious to us, and laid down on
the pitch. St. John's Ambulance men, nurses and even fans,
were giving heart massage, mouth to mouth resuscitation and
all sorts of other first aid. Some policemen were also
trying to help but the vast majority were either spread
along the half way line or huddled in groups, apparently
bewildered and lacking any directives, as to what to do,
from their superiors.

During this time we did see one police officer spat at by a
Liverpool supporter close to the gate behind the goal but I
can imagine him being incensed because the police were
pushing fans back into the gate.

I also saw two scuffles between fans on the pitch itself but
it was against police officers who were just standing round,
seeming unwilling to help. I can understand the frustration
of these fans towards these particular policemen.

We saw angry Liverpool fans run up towards the Nottingham
Forest fans, the latter had been jeering and booing, the
former had been trying to save lives. We saw angry
Liverpool fans scuffle with a cameraman, he had been taking
pictures of the injured and dying, while they had been doing
their best to save them.
                            -   4   -




Even more astonishing events were to take place. It
appeared that when the ambulances eventually arrived they
had difficulty in getting to the dying and injured. Then
the majority of fans who were on the pitch, who had not been
seriously injured, but obviously suffering from shock, began
to rip down hoardings and use them as stretchers to ferry
the injured, and unknown to us, many dead. The fans carried
them from one end of the pitch to the other in a seemingly
endless relay. Again stewards and other people helped but
again so few policemen got involved as they still stood in
groups or in a line across the pitch.

Later, having learned that a gate had been opened,by the
police, to let fans in, it became obvious that this must
have been a major contribution to the tragic disaster that
occured. These fans headed for the satne tunnel I described
earlier and what was to happen is to me inevitable. I feel
great sympathy for the policeman who gave the directive for
the gate to be opened, in his opinion, lives were at risk
outside the ground and he took the action he considered the
best under the circumstances known to him.

The factors which have contributed to what happened as far
as I am concerned are

1)   Police stopping coaches well before the ground so that
     fans had a 20 minute to 30 minute walk to the ground.
     This could be a likely cause of the late arrival of
     fans and the consequent build up outside the ground
     just before kick off.

     We consider ourselves extremely lucky as our coach
     driver dropped us off as near to the ground as possible
     even though police wanted him to turn round and drop us
     off a lot further away from the ground, despite the
     fact this would have resulted in us arriving even later
     at the ground. We had a 10 minute walk to the ground
     and arrived at Hillsborough at 2.35 p.m. If we had
     been dropped off where the police wanted them we would
     have been arriving in the ground at the same time as
     those unfortunate supporters who were to be involved in
     those tragic circumstances.


2)   Police not taking immediate control of the fans and
     getting them to line up in an orderly manner. There
     appeared to be more police on duty miles away from the
     ground than there were directly outside it. This
     shortage of policeman immediately outside the ground
     must surely have resulted in total lack of crowd
     control.




                                                               0
                            -   5   -




3)   The entrance to the Leppings Lane end and this part of
     the ground itself is a death trap when large numbers of
     fans are trying to gain entrance.


4)   The ultimate responsibility of what happened must lie
     with F.A. Authorities. For the second year running
     they gave Liverpool fans the smaller part of the
     ground, even though they must have an average of 15,000
     to 20,000 more fans attending their home games. This
     was despite the fact that Liverpool F.C. appealed to
     the F.A. to either give Liverpool fans the other end of
     the ground and so more tickets or choose an alternative
     ground which would be able to accommodate their fans.
     The F.A. officials with characteristic lack of interest
     in the problems of the fans, coldly dismissed
     Liverpools claims.
     The people who deserve commending are the Liverpool
     supporters who so bravely helped their injured
     colleagues who lay dying and injured on the Pitch. The
     ambulance men, nurses, stewards and firemen who also
     put in tremendous effort. The Nottingham Forest fans
     for their behaviour after they became aware of the
     extent of the tragedy unfolding before them. And last
     but not least those few policemen who did try their
     best and the people of Sheffield for showing such
     generosity and help to those fans in need of it.

     My condolences and heartfelt sympathy goes out to those
     families who have lost their loved ones in such tragic
     circumstances caused by the negligence, incompetence
     and ignorance of the F.A. and other officials.

     From a very sad but very angry Liverpool supporter, who
     stood there and watched, helpless to do anything. I'm
     not a fanatical or completely biased supporter, what I
     witnessed on both occasions is the truth.


     Yours sincerely,

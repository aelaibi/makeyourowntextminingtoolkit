             We t r a v e l l ed to H i l l s b o r o u g h         ill                      own vehicle            leaving

             Winchester             just a fter     1000 am.               We did not            stop en route          to the      game

                  or    indeed expe r i e n c e     any traffic                  delays.         We a r r i v e d at a b o u t S.

             05        pm   (1405),      missed    the     signs          dir e c t i n g    us to the gro u n d            and ended

                  up in the Cit y Centre,,                we   therefore a p p r o a c h e d the                   ground   from

the N o t t i n g h a m Forest          end       (Spion Kop).

There was        no one dir e c t i n g           us as to a place to              park   but we    eventually

parked up        in a road off P en i s t o n e Rd near                    to a school,       I do not know

the    name     of this     road.            We   then started        to walk to the          ground with

large    numbers        of N o t t i n g h a m Forest          supporters,         I o b v i o u s l y took my

Liverpool        scarf     off.         En    rjKfte we       passed severalyffubs           (three)     they

were    full     of N o 11 i n g hajyr Forest S u p p o r t e r s Is i orfjfing and dr i n !•••:i ng .         Ihe

pubs were        so full      people were               spilling     out    onto    the   pavements.          They

were    noisey but g e n er al ly well                   behaved.         Some   people were       drinking

from    c a n ’s on route          to the         ground however           I did not      notice any off

Licences.

We a r ri ve d outside            the    'Spion Hop"           end of the ground at a bout 2.2 0                    pm

(1420).         We had     in fact           t ra ve l l e d to the       game with the       int e n t i o n of

p u rchasi ng a ticket             outside         the    ground.         We had been asking all              the

way    to the      ground     but       could not         find any o n e     to sell      us a ticket.

We w a l ke d    past the         ’S p i on Kop"         entrance     heading       to y&rds the L e p p i n g s

Ln entrance         durinq w h i ch time we                 p u rchased ,the / i r s t     of our    ticket

off a N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t         supporter,        we gave             ten pounds      for   it

There was a constant                stream of s up p o r t e r s a r o u n d us at all              times.

We a r ri v e d at the L e p p in g s             Ln     end about 2. 3 5 pm (1435)          and    c o ntinued

asking     people      if they had a ticket                    to sell.      We were       in the a r e a of

the    t u rnstiles at this              time and the           crowd was        starting     to b uild up.

We then deci d e d to have a walk along L e m m i n g s Ln where we                                found      two

separate        suppo r t e r s    who       sold u s tick           , we    paid ten      pound for       the      one

and thirty for the other.                         One w a y for      s t a nding    in the    terrace and           the

other was        for the West S ta nd                  si/Tting.     We had      considerable       difficulty

obtaining        our tickets            I got      the    i m p r e s s i o n there was    not m a n y spare

ones    going.        We than star t e d to walk                   back    toward/the        Leppings      Ln end

en route        selling     our original                 ticket.

We got back         to the t u r n s ti le s             by L e p p i n g s j/n about 2.4 5 _pm     (1445)       by

now the        crowd was         quite      large with            people    jostling and            pushing       to get-

through        the turns t i l e s         it w a s n ’t ag g r e s s i v e ,     they were         obviously

anxious        to get       into     the    ground.          It was     close      to kick      off       they were

getting        frustrated.

We    tossed a coin as               to who was            going    tojiave w hich           ticket       I won and

opted      for the seat.              We then joinjra the              queue       for the turnstiles.                   By

queue      I m ean a mass            of    p e o p l ^ taking       up the w hole        of the area             from the

t ur n s t i l e s    to the L e p p i n g / L n .

  I then noticed              t h r e ^ p o l i c e m e n on horses         in the middle            of the       crowd,

they were            obv i o u s l y having       trouble m a n a g i n g       this amount          of    people.

T hey were           trying    to    form a line across               the middle         of the       crowd

o b v i o u sl y to a l l ev ia te         the    c ongestion at the turnstiles,                      they were

telling        supporters           not    to    push forward         saying words           to the        effect     that

we w o u l d n ’t be able            to get       in at the moment.                O nly a few        people       took

a n y notice          of the Po l i c e         instructions.          I was       one of these            people.

My friend had gone                  his    own way by now.

I then saw one of the P o l ic e                     horses        pushing      t h r o u g h the    crowd towards

the turnstiles,               I f o 1 low e d > ^ n a b l i n g me    to get       close to the            turnstile.

T here were           not en o u g h P/n. icemen to m a n a g e             the    c r o w d , there m ust         have

been two        or three         t h ou sa n d    people trying            to get      in at this          time.

As    I got     towards        the    t ur n s t i l e s    the    pressure was         building          up,    it was

d i fficult          to move.        I do not know w h i c h           turnstile         I was head i n g          for

but    there was a g roup                 of about         four w ith a red sign above                    them     saying

West Stand.             At this       time       I noticed         people    climbing        up a buttress            of a

wall     to the        rigfrfc of the turnstiles as you                      face      them.        The y were

climbing        onto/the         roof      of the t u rnstiles             from this wall            where       there

w a s a Po 1 i                helping       them.          1 think the P o l i c e m a n had no choice                   in

help i n g    them partly becau se                 they w ou l d have           fell    off the wall             if he

h a d n ’t and also           I ’m sure         he was      trying    to a l l e v i a t e   the     crush at the

t r u n s t il e s after all          he    could not have            s t o p p e d them climbing               onto the

wall     in the first             p 1a t&k

I then went              t hr s u a n the     t u r n s t i l e and ha n d e d my ticket        in,    I was        given

the    stub back.              I have       handed this stub to the Police                    now p r o duced

Once     through the t ur ns t i l e              I headed for        the stairs        to thie Wyst, s t a n d ,

there were           no signs        or at      least      I d i d n ’t see any as to where                I should

go,    so    I a sked a P o l i c e w o m a n who           d i r e c t e d me up the    right        staircase,

by this        time the m a t c h had kicked off.

At    the top of the              stairs       I saw a S t e w a r d and a Policeman.                  This was

the    first        stew a r d    I had seen since arriving.                    I was    directed          to my

seat,       I therefore           had    no    problems      finding rny viewing             p o s ition     I took

my seat at 3 . 0 2 pm             (1502).

The m at ch was            now    in progress          I noti c e d a few suppo r t e r s about                fifteen

in total           standing       behind the goals             out of    the    pens.        T h e y must      have

climbed over the                 fence.

O ther      su pportes        were also         climbing       over   the fence        onto    the     pitch,

they were           o b v io us ly   problems        but    I did not     realise at first what was

happening.

The    people        climbing        onto      the   pitch were       coming     out    of/pens        three and

four w hi ch         I could see            clearly from my seat.               Therar was       obviously a

crush at           the    perimeter         f e n c e people    in the    pens / e r e       being     crushed.

In a m o n g s t     the     crowd      I saw a man w e d g e d ups i d&y/aown wit h his                   legs         in

the air above              everybody,          his trunk and head          being       out    of sight         in the

crowd,       he was        kicking       his    legs    trying    to get       free    but    he s e e m e d       to

d is a p p e a r    head first          into the       crowd.     He was       in pen three           near     to the

front about              three    to four       peole      back and about        three -- four yards                    from

the    exit        gate of the          pens onto the          pitch.     He was wear i n g           what     I

believe       to be grey flannel                 trousers,       he seemed to be a well                 built

person,            1 can only as s u m e         that      he had t r i e d to    climb over           the

               perimeter        fence and fell          head first           back    into    the    crowd.

              The    game     had now s to p p e d and the              players      had    left     the     pitch.

              S up po rt er s were       now    lying    on the         pitch being g iven a rtificial

               re s pi ra ti on and others were              helping         people     climb over         the     perimeter

              fence.         Another     group of supporters were                    pulling at the fence.                  This

              scene      c ontinued for a while              the N o t t i n g h a m Forest         fans were        chanting

              and shouting            they were     obviouslv/gfngry about                  the game being           stopped.

              A Police        cordon was        for m e d as/oss          the   pitch.

              The    scene was         one of g r e lt /c on fu si on more a n d more                 injured, people were

              on the       pitch receiving          life     support.

              I saw some Liverpool               fans     confronting           some Police         offiers        on the

              pitch,       they were      o b v i o u sl y a n g r y    I assume      by f r u s t r a t i o n    it looked as

              th o u g h they were        going     to start a fight w ith                  the Police           officers.

              The    crowd      crush must       have    been       caused by        people      entering         pens   three

              and four a l t h ou gh from where                I was         I couldnsee            this    entrance        points

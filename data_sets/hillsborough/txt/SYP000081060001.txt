                I am a single man,                     currently a serving soldier at Claro Barracks

                On S at ur d ay          15th April          1989       <15Q<89)          1 left Doncaster          traj/ff s tation

                We got on the t r a i n Lw i t h Notts Forest                              fans who were also           t ravelling         to

                Sheffield.               I saw several               lads who        I knew,     from      living    in D o n c a s t e r ,

                Most        of the fa/s were well                     behaved,        but some were          drjm king on the

              The    train arri ve d at S h ef fi el d at about            1.50pm       (1350)   as we got off

              the Notts Forest            fans were      escorted from the train towards              the buses,

              through a large gate at the end of the station,                                     „and myself

              w al ke d through the ticket              office,     and then got.          the buses with the

              We got off at P enistone Rd ou'Lsfide the ground and walked towards                              the

              ’Hop*       end of the ground.            We then split     up from the fans and walked

              a r o u n d to the    players      entrance where a friend was               to meet   us with

              tickets       for the game.



              rtl- 2 . 4 5 p m (1445) our friend had still not a r ri v ed and so we d ecided to
              walk    round to lappings Ln to see                 if we   could get a ticket.          On our

              way    round    in P e nistone Rd we met a y U c k e t         tout who       sold us a ticke'

                                        a mass   of    people at Jchs entrance.            I would estimate

              about 2 000 all           trying   to get     in



              The    fans were all L i v e r p o o l /s u pp o rt e rs and a lt ho ug h there was a lot of

              pushing       towards      the turnstiles,         I d i d n ’t see any fighting.

           and myself          then w al k ed onto Leppings           Ln and stood on the

bridge,     watching          the other       fans trying     to get    in.      S ud denly fans

started     running       out    from the ground,          from the two gates            near to the

turnstiles,        the fans were           screaming and hysterical.                  I saw one or two

fans    carried out by other               supporters.



1 saw one       person        lying    on a ambulance        s tr etcher    near to an ambulance,

w hi ch was     parked by the           railings    just     to the side        of the    turnstiles.

A press     photographer wearing                a yellow bib with          press on it,       started

taking     p h o t o ’s of the        person on the s t rsdTc h e r .       I believe       that    person

was    dead as a blanket              had been plaj          iver them.        Four Liverpool         fans

                         JL
              !    but as the phojf^grapher w al ke d on to Leppings Ln,                           they set

about    him again breakij^ his                 camera.    The    police    stopped the       lads

again,    and the        bloke w al k ed off



The    photographer was a white man,                    about 3 0 — 55 years with grey hair,               he

was wearing a cream suit.                     I c a n ’t remember what         the four fans        looked

like or what         they were wearing.



I saw several           fans    run from the ground and have minor                     scuffles with

the    police      officers      outside       trying    to get    them to go into the ground

to help the other fans,                 but    no actual     fights    took     place.

                                                                                                   SE532

             I never had the        chance    to enter   the ground and so still        have my

             ticket,        the stub end of the ticket         has been   lost   some time outside         the

             qround.



             At about        four o ’clock we walked around the ground and ente re d the

             ’S pion Hop'       and stood on the terraces watching           what was going       on at

             the L e p pings Ln end.         At about 5 o ’clock we were a sk ed by a police

             officer        with a loudhailer     to stay quiet and       be patient,   at this we

             deci d e d to     1eave the ground.



             Several        people were    carried out of the ground,        by the   ’S pi on H o p ’ near

             to the       north stand on boards,       but d o n ’t remember any descriptions            of

             the     people    or those who were      carrying    them.



             As    far as     I can remember,     there were     no fights   on the   pitch,     but   the

             police       put a line of officers across          the   pitch near to the S pion Hop,

             The Forest        fans were all      in a supportive mood,      a pplauding   the

             e m e rg e n c y services as    they rush on and off the        pitch.

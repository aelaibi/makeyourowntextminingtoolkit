HILLSBOROUGH : COSTS OF INQUIRIES BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE

Thank you for your letter of 25 August about which we have spoken.

We agreed that given the small amount of special grant involved it
might be reasonable to expect South Yorkshire to wait until normal
Parliamentary approval for the expenditure can be obtained. This
would be by way of a Winter Supplementary Estimate which would
probably be voted by Parliament towards the end of December.
                   Â©

Section B 108- 110<(sets out the procedures for seeking an advance
from the Contingencies Fund. You will see that the only criterion
for adopting this course is "urgency in the public interest."   If
exceptionally you decide that you feel it necessary to adopt this
course you will have to justify it on these grounds.

Before agreeing to the special grant I would be grateful to know
where you will be surrendering equivalent offsetting savings as
requested by the Chief Secretary's letter of 19 June.

                                                                      /

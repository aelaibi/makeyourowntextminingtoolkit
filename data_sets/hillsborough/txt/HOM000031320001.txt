             He did not attribute all the blame to a single cause or person, but in paragraph 278
             he made clear that:


                         “The main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control"


             4.    Lord Taylor made 43 immediate recommendations. His final report.in January

             place since then in safety at football grounds and in the policing of football matches
             have been based largely on those recommendations. Football in this country has
             been transformed since the Taylor Report. To a large extent that is due to his wide-
             reaching and soundly based conclusions.

                      finding answers to thdsi^questions.          ^

                      9.          "Fbece-wasi yff further iinvestigation^conducted^by the West Midlands Police,
                      supervised by the Police Complaints Authority, to establish whether there were any
                                                                   'fo
                      grounds for criminal proceeding^/ That inva&tigation aloo consider^ whether any
                      police officer should be subject to disciplinary proceedings.


                      10.         That investigation involved the taking of over 5000 statements and the
                      scrutiny of all the material which had previously been examined by the Taylor
                      Inquiry.          After that investigation ther evidence was sent to the^ Director of Public
                      Prosecutions, who concluded that no person should be subject to criminal
                      proceedings. jpThe Police Complaints Authority decided that the senior officers in
                      charge on the day should face disciplinary charges for ne^fecToTdute

      event, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield retired due to ill health in advance of a
      ruling by a disciplinary tribunal. The Police Complaints Authority later decided that
      disciplinary proceedings against Mr Duckenfield’s deputy should be withdrawn
      because the retirement of Mr Duckenfield meant that what, in effect, was a joint
      allegation of neglect of duty could not be fairly heard in the absence of the more
      senior officer.                                          _

      11.         itis/foell knowj^ that some of the families of those who died were unhappy
      with the verdict of the inquest. They later applied for judicial review of the coroner’s
      proceedings. During the judicial review proceedings the conduct of the inquest was
      subjected to close and detailed examination. ^ The \court ruled that none of the ^
      matters raised in the judicial review proceedings justified intervention by the court in
      the verdict of the inquest, ju^j •


      12.         The events surrounding the^disaster have therefore been subject to
      exceptionally thorough investigation on several occasions.              But concerns have




      issues which should be investigated further.
                                                                       T


      13.         Representationsj/have been made to me|s^|my^predecessorpto the Attorney
      General and to the Director of Public Prosecutions.                  A Granada television
      programme in December/dramatised the disaster and raised a number of issues
      which, in the view of the programme makers, Airessoted new evidenc^ tbout the
     -disaster.             Since^/that-timc further material has been submitted on behalf of the
      Hillsborough Family Support Group.                 Those representations have related in
      particular to video evidence of the disaster and medical evidence about the time of
      death of the victims.


      14.      ^Myllepartment, the office of the Attorney General and the Crown Prosecution
      Service have considered very carefully all the evidence which has been put forward




     c :\dos\pp0232pd.doc
 in recent months. We have been unable to find anything which we consider would
(^haveynaterially^affected the outcome of any of the investigations into the disaster.


 15.         Much of the evidence which has been put forward concerns matters which
 were fully addressed by t ^ previous investigations. For example, the Granada
 television programme suggested that there were ten unresolved questions about the
                                              tCitLdf                      utk)
 disaster.            I am^satisfied that         those ten questions wefe/fully considered by the
 Taylor Inquir^f aad(lri relation 10 eighfofther^specific recommendations were made.


 16.     [ \ have, not so far received any evidence which would lead me to conclude that
         k                           ‘f e e / Ltot
 a new public inquiry should be established.                        Similarly, the Director of Public
 Prosecutions considers that none of the material which has been made available
would justify fresh criminal investigations.                    The Attorney General takes a similar
view in relation to the possibility of applying to the High Court for a new inquest.

                                 By this     time       I was   standing at the side             of PC Alexander.           We were

                                 s upervising       them doing so.             Not man y    people     got    in this way.

                                 back from the turnstiles.

                                 We mana g e d to keep this gate shut                 for & or 3 minutes w h i c h seemed to

                                 panicking,        not    due   to     any fear of       injury but      p a n b e c a u s e they

                                 L e p p i n g s Lane    itself was totally blocked w i t h people.                   Whe n    I saw    it

        Some    control was          being ex e r c i s e d by people            being a l l o w e d      past the

        horses and through the gates a few at a time                                but gen e r a l l y there did

        not    seem sufficient              police     officers      to    control    a crowd of that            size.

        By 3. 1 0 p m the        crush had begun to ease                  in Leppings Lane and               in front

        of the turnstiles              to the West Stand.                 At this time we were               joined by

        We gained access             to the ground via a turnstile and f o l lowed PS Morgan

        along    the      back of the West Stand,                round the back          of the Police

        Control Box and into the South S ta n d lower seating. Whilst walking

         down the aisle towards the pitch I noticed that there were a

        c o n s i derable     number        of    people    on the    pitch but there was               no fighting

        and the       reason for the              pitch invasion was a crush of                 people       on the

        Le p pings Lane terraces.                    I looked onto the           terraces     to the         right of

        the goal at L e p pings Lane and a l t h o u g h they were full                          there       still

        seemed to be plenty                  of room for further            people.      When I got           onto the
                                                                                           r
        pitch I saw the            central         pen of the L e p p i n g s Lane       terraces was           very

        full.     People         had been         crushed against          the   perimeter      fencing and

        bodies were         piled on top of one anot h e r and a p p e a r e d dead or badly

        injured.

        Police     officers        had the gates            to all    the    pens open and were

        attempting         to free         the trapped       people and via the gates,                  and over       the

        perimeter         fence.       I     am a trained F^ir-st Aider.                It h e/f'e fore    stayed on

        the    pitch jjoi-tially                               injured as they were taken                     from the

        ter rajre s

        Once    the main bulk              of the     injured and dead nad been m o v e d onto                   the

        pitch and w e r ^ / i eg in ni ng           to be t r a n s p o r t e d to the back of the              police

        room,      I went        to this         location and a s s i s t e d     in treating          the    injured

        until    the      last    person had been taken to hospital.

         Fro m there      I a g a i n met up with my sect i o n and we were        stood down from

         the    ground.

         In my opinion the mai n         cause    of the original       crush outside      the ground

         was Liverpool       s u pporters   turning    up at the ground fom 2 . 5 0 onwards

         and not allowing          t hemselves   sufficient    time    to get   into the ground

         before    the kick off.        Also many     people were turning        up at the ground

         who ha d obv i o u s l y been drinking       e s p e c i a l l y the ones who turned   up

         late.     This was also       born out w hen     1 began to treat       injured    people     on

         t he p              was    obliged to get m u c h    closer    to them then and noticed

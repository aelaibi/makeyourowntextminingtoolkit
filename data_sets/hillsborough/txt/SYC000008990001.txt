X Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly

2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                     Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.

3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                           Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of
     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drags.
     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.
     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                     Cause of death
     care/self-neglect1).
   b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
     infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
     of the following forms be adopted:

      C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
      his/her mind was disturbed).
      C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
      induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
      C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
      C.D. was killed lawfully.

      Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
      further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
      arose.
   c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
     it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

      C.D. was killed unlawfully.
   d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
     complete the remainder of the form.

          Dear Sirs,

          Re; RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


          If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
          on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be notified in
          due course.

          I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
          inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

          Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
          under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
          witnesses who wish to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in considering
          this and in determining who I wish to invite to attend.

          Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
          to give you an opportunity to draw to my attention the names and other
          appropriate details of any witness or witnesses whom you would like me to
          consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
          attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
          names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
          to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

          I would be grateful if you c o u l d respond as soon as possible. If I have not
          heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
           submit.

 Dear       Sirs,
 Re:        JOSEPH DANIEL McCABTHY (deceased) Ko,27.

 As you are aware, the Inquest(s) arising out of the Hillsborough
 Disaster stand adjourned to a date to be fixed. You may also
 be aware that it had been in my mind to resume these Inquests
 on the 15th of January 1990.
 I have now been informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions
 has decided to have a criminal investigation undertaken on his
 behalf. In these circumstances, I have decided not'to resume the
 Inquest(s) on the date mentioned.

  I will review the matter further after the Director of Public
  Prosecutions has announced his decision as to what action U f ^ 7)
  he may wish to Tindertake.

  I am not in a position to say how long the Police Inquiry
  or the Director of Public Prosecutions consideration of the
  matter will take. I anticipate however that thereyillbe
  a substantial period of time before I am in a position to communicate
  on this matter further.
  I would be grateful if you could please ensure that this information
  is conveyed to members of the bereaved family so that they may be
  fully informed of the position regarding the Inquest^;.

   Yours faithfully,



   S.L.Popper,
   H.M.Coroner.

I refer to your recent conversation with Superintendent
Sleath concerning the release of the deceased persons from
the Hillsborough incident to their respective next of kin,
following the adjournment of the inquest.

After consultation with Professor Usher, I have no objection
to this course of action.

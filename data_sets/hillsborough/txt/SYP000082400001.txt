               I am a lifelong L i verpool                           fan and    I go        r e gularly to the home matches.

               This year           I have        held a season              ticket         for    the Kop at Anfield.              I go        to

               We set out           from home at about                   mid-day           to get to Sheffield.                We went         in
                                                                                                                PAGE

the fa m i l y       car,    my dad drove             u s ^ / ’We    d i d n ’t stop anywhere           en    route to

the    ground we went              strai g h t    uKrough to Sheffield.                     On the way we were

d ela y e d for about 3/4                lyur/'on the H62 , due               to    r o a d w o rks,   and again

when we were           getting        towards S h e f f i e l d we were              delayed due         to the

volume      of traffic,            and by       people      crossing         the    roads     in front        of all

the    cars,     trying       to get        to the       game.

I, didn't       see a ny bo dy d r i n king alcohol                   once we got          into Sheffield,               but

when we were about                 i/2 an hour           from the ground             I saw a lot of            beer

cans    lying about           in the street              on the main          road.        It looked as         if the

had been thrown out                 of     car windows         by people who              had been      caught       in

the traffic          jams.         I didn't       see a n y b o d y who        looked drunk,            the

a t m o s p h e r e ar o u n d was       good,    it was a nice w arm day and e v e r y b o d y was

looking      forward to a good match.

We a c t u a l l y got       into S h e f f i e l d at about 2 . 3 0 p m and we                  parked       on a

large     car    park       in a    park,       w h i c h was about 5 minutes walk from the

ground.         There were a lot                of Liverpool           and Forest         fans using          the    car

park,     but    there were          no     police a r o u n d the are a to separate                     fans       or

to o r g anise any form of                  crowd control.

The    gr o u n d was o p p osite           the   car     park so we all w a l k e d down tou^rds                         th

e n t r a n c e at   the L e p p i n g s       Lane    end together.

We got     to the entrance                 of the      ground a t / a b o u t 2.43pm,            and    immediately

we saw there was              no way we w ou l d gej^into                    the    ground before 3 o ’clock

It was     chaos outside.                  There werys thousands               of    people trying            to get

into Hillsborough,                 wit h    tuj^cjj^reues at a l l .          The    crowd was         spread       right

out    past the entrance                 gates    into L e p p i n g s Lane,           there were        people

the    turnstiles.             The    police      horses were          having         little       or no effect

because        they      couldn't        control       the    large    numbers         of    people       outside.

Eventually,            a couple       of minu t e s      before 3 o'clock               the    police          horses

gr o u n d    through       it.      Although         there were       both      police       officers and

stewards           standing       by the gate          nobody made any atte m p t                  to    check our

tickets at all

Once    we went          in througTi’ the gate,               I saw a tunnel            d i r ectly ahead.              You.

could see the              light at       the    other       side of      it,    and the       pitch.          Everybody

he a d e d towards          the    tunnel       and t h e fou y       of us went            into    it as well.

There        were    no stewards          at    the   t u n n e / dir e c t i n g    us to go a n y w h e r e          else.

Once    we a c t ua ll y got          into      the turyiel you had to                 carry on moving.

There        was    no way you        could stop or ti/fn a ro u n d and walk                           back    out

because        the     force      of the       number    of p e o p l e    beh i n d made you go forward.

It was        very dark        in the      tunnel       and    it dif f i c u l t      to know where             to    put

your     feet.         I was       also    getting t r o dd en yo n all the             time.           What     made       it

w orse was when you got                   towards        the end of the tunnel                there       is     a

barrier        dividing        the tunnel         into two halves,               the tunnel             also    slopes

away and           I was    s t u mbling       because       I couldn't         see whe r e . t h e       steps       were,

It was        difficult        to keep upright w hen you                   got       to the steps          because          of

the f act          that you        co u 1d n "t see t h e m .

At the        end of the           tunnel       I was met      by a solid               wall       of    people, the

pressure           of the     crowd beh ind           pushed me       into the         backs       of the       people        on

All    four     of us went        to   riafit hand side             of the terraces           into Pen number

pressure        of the     people      behind us forced me^arfid my brother                       forwards

towards       the front        of the     pen,    and my            rents    over to the         right    hand

side    of the      pen nearer         to the bac/.             I s t a r t e d off    in area       1H on the

From    the     time    I got onto        the terraces,             an d ended up at the front                of

pen 3,    it was an exc e s s i v e           crush.         My feet were on the ground all                     the

time    because        I am over 6 foot tall,                 but my elbows were              pushed     into my

sides.                 is shorter       than me and           I was w o r r i e d about        him all     the

time    I was on the           terraces.         It was       really hot on the             terraces arid we

both had        coats    on,     althoughI could breatl'/e fairly easily my biggest

w o r r y was    that we       could faint in the heat S^nd the crush, because if

you went        down you w o u l d be trampled                on,     X was w o r r i e d about

f a i nting     because     he    is quite       small       and he had a leather              jacket     on.

P e o p l e were   leaning        on          and pushing            down on his        shoulders        so that

they    could breathe            easier.       I managed           to move my      right arm and          I

g rabbed ho 1d of the             c o l 1ar of               s j a c k e t to try an d s t o p h irn f r o rn

being    pushed down.

I m a n a g e d to hold onto           him for about            10 minutes.           The   buckles      on his

shoes    had     come undone and           people were             treading      on the straps.           He was

being    pushed forw a r d wit h the sway of the                        crowd but he          c o u l d n ’t move

his    feet     because     of the      people        standing       on the straps          of his     shoes.

My other main w o r r y was             one   or other          of us      could be pushed a g a i n s t           the

crush barriers,            because you         c o u l d n ’t see them before you were a c t u a l l y

right against           them.      At A n f i e l d    the    crush barriers are              painted white

and are       quite high,         but these were             blue and were         quite      low.     We had no

F o r t u n a t e l y we both ended up betw e e n two barriers and d i d n ’t get

pushed against any              of t h e m .

I had been        in the       crush at the             front       for about          10 minu t e s       or so when

had to       let go of                   collar.         The    crush h a d n ’t got any worse                    during

this    time     but    it h a d n ’t got any easier                  either.           I had to       let go of

        because        between us there was a young                         girl       of about       12 years and

her father.            Her    father       was    trying       to    lift her          out    of the       crush but he

c o u l d n ’t because my arm was across                       her    shoulder.              I m o v e d my arm and

hel p e d to     lift her       up.        We    passed her          forwards          towards       the    front    fence

where a small           gate    had been opened.                    Whilst       I was       doing    this    I had to

let go of                     collar,       and when         J. turned a r o u n d to grab him a g a i n he

was    gone    I d i d n ’t know         if he was        on the ground or whether                         he had    been

m o v e d by the       crowd.

All    this    time     people were             shouting and screaming,                      some were       panicking

and others were trying                   to help by calming                 them down.

My a t t e n t i o n was      drawn to the             right    hand side          by the       sounds       of   people

who were against              the    front       crush barrier and who were                      in agony.           I was

t urned by the          crowd,       but when          I turned       back       to the       right    I saw that

there was a lower              level       in t h e crowd,           w \y* r e this      bar r ier had been and

people were        piled up on top of one anot h e r                         like dominoes.                 I think      the

W h i ls t all    this was          going       on,   there were           police       officers       s t a nding      on

the    front     fence s h o u t i n g at the            crowd to          push back.           Others       were

standing       by a small           gate    in the front             fencing,          the same       gate where         the

young    girl     had    passed       to,       and they were             opening       it o c c a s i o n a l l y to    let

a few    people        out,    but then they w o u l d               close       it again.           The y did not

seem to be doing m u c h to help people                             get    out   of the        pens.       T he y w ould

              but    they didn't              seem to be doing m uch else.

              All    the    time,    I was           really w or r i e d        because         I had    lost             and       I

              didn't       know    if he was alright.                      I was     looking ar o u n d all            the time           to

              try and see him,                 I was also          looking         for my      parents and for             other

              friends       who    I knew w o u ld be              in      the same area.

              Eventual ly,         the front           fence was           opened by the           police and more and more

              people       got out       onto        the    pitch.           As they got        out there was more              space

              and    it was easier              to breathe.                The vast m a j o r i t y of         people     were

              g etting      out over' the front                fence,         or    climbing       over the side            fence         into

              short    dark hair,              balding at the              tern/les, I w ould say he was                    in his
   vjS    ,
              late twenties          to mid thirties,                    h e / p o s s i b l y had a beard a l t h o u g h              I'm

         /V   not    really sure about                 that.       Oja/was w e a r i n g         blue denim jeans a n d a

              white    tee shirt,              he had a sligh t l y            cut face,          becuase       I could see              blood
  V           coming from his mouth.                        I didn't        notice a n y tattoos               or a n y t h i n g       like

              that.        There was           nobody w it h this man,                he was       on his own.            A p o l iceman

              eventually          came        over    to him and           checked his           pulse and then            put a piece

              of tissue         paper         over   his     face.

              After    a while my              parents       found me and we s tood on the terrace                              looking

              a r o u n d for            \,     We were       looking after a young                     lad of about          17,        18

              yrs who       had been           pulled out of the               crush.           He was    faint and we were

              slapping       his face           to try and stop him from fainting                              passing      out.          We

              s t a y e d w ith him until              his    brother         came a n d took him away,                   I'm not sure

              w here   they went.               During       this       time we      had seen                  climbing       over        the

              front    fence and              out onto       the    pitch.         As soon as we           saw that         he was

            okay we made        our    way out      of the ground and stood            on the        road      back to

            the     car    park and    w a i te d for him to join us.           We waitjg'gl for a few

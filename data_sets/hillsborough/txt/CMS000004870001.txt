Dear Tom

BRIEFING MATERIAL:   RUGBY UNION

We spoke on Friday when I suggested amendment to your proposed
material.  I enclose for the record the text of that amendment.

                                                   Yours sincerely




                                                   DAVID MOULD

IMPLICATIONS OF HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY FINAL REPORT FOR RUGBY UNION


Line to take

Provisions of the FS Act to require all seated accommodation and
giving powers of the LFA to review safety certificates do not
extend to sports other than football. The Home Office will be
considering what action is appropriate, including any additional
statutory powers after consultation with the RFU.

Background Note

Amend after paragraph (f) as below:

     "Primary legislation would be required to implement (a) and
     (f).
     On (a) the Home Office intends first to consult with the
     sporting bodies a representative local authority
     associations before consideration is given to introducing
     legislation or extending the FLA role on a voluntary basis.

     On (g) the Home Office intend to consult the RFU in respect
     of Twickenham and other designated rugby union grounds as
     indicated above.11

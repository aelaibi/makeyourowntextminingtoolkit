              Approximately               9.45am with         other        officers, paraded                 in         th e N o r t h    Stand

              At      11.15am       in c o m p a n y w i t h PC       174 W e l c h ,        I was       deployed           on P e n i s t o n e

              Petrol         Station.          This     location       is at          the    roundabout            at      the    end     of

              Leppings         L a n e , walking        away        from    the       stadium         to w y d s    Madsffiy Br i d gf;;.              ;

              particular            end   of    the     ground.



              To     begin with,          a    steady     trickle          of    fans       walked       past      uj; a n d      from      the
                                                                                                                   //
              outset         fans    were      enquiring       with        other       fa n s    if t h e y

spare.        The          fans       that       were     asking          for     tickets          appeared          to     be m a i n l y

Liverpool             supporters.




We   were        constantly               asked,         o nc e     again mainly              by L i v e r p o o l

supporters,                directions              to    local          public       houses.




As   th e    number             of    fans       began        to    increase,           I saw more             and more          fans

with    cans          of     beer      or       lager.



Whilst       standing                close       to a n       officer          who     was    in    possession              of a

rad i o ,    I heard a                transmission                 to    the    effect        that       a    pu b    that     had b e e n

used    by L i v e r p o o l           supporters              had       been wrecked,              but       this     1 ca n n o t

c o n f i rm .




I saw       some          f an s     more       than     once       walking          up a n d      d o w n , obviously             not

wanting          to       get      into     the       ground        early.




As   the     kick-off                time       of 3 . 0 0 pm a p p r o a c h e d ,          the    b u i 1d up        of    fans

increased             considerably.                     The    fans       that       I saw were              mainly       Liverpool

supporters,                as      most     of     the    Nottingham Forest                       supporters           were

alighting             from         buses        and     coaches         at     a nearby           bus    depot       and     were

directed          to       the       ground        on a       route       that       would        bypass       my     location,

although          there            were     a    few N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t           supporters.




During       the          last       30 minutes           before          kick-off,           the       number       of     Liverpool

supporters                going       down Leppings                 Lane       i n c r e a s e d at     what         I would       say wa

an alarming                rate.          I have         performed             d u t y at     football          matches          on

Leppings          Lane          on a n u m b e r         of    occasions             and     I have          never     seen     so m a n y

supporters                walking         down Leppings                 Lane      to    go    to    the       football         match.

There       was       a    very       large        and    constant             stream        of    supporters             which
                                                                                                                                         PAGE

seemed          to     stretch          as    far       as    the     eye        could       see     and      1 remember              thinking

to m y s e l f ,        and       commenting             to PC        Welch,           the    officers             at    the     Leppings

Lane     turnstiles                 were      going          to    have      their       work        cut      out       containing           and

controlling                 the     number         of    fans        that        were    pouring             into       that     location.




At    approximately                    3 . 0 0 p m we        were      instructed             vi a      a    r a dio     m e s s a g e , to

attend          at     the    Leppings             Lane       turnstile            a r ea.         We       went    d o w n as        a ser i a l

with PS Ashton                    in    charge          and       on a r r i v a l      at    th e      Leppings          Lane

turnstile              a r e a we       were       instructed               to    form a          cordon across                 the

entrance             in o r d e r       to    prevent             supporters            gaining             access.



I was        not       in    possession               of a        radio      and       did    not       know what           had       happened

inside          th e    ground.,          although            it w a s       obvious          some          sort    of     crowd        disorder

or    crowd          p r o b 1 em      had    occurred.                We w e r e       just       instructed              to    stop

people          entering            the      ground          for     the     time       be i n g .




The    supporters                 outside          with       tickets            were    obviously              very a ngry            about

t,h i s ,




After       a    short        while,          we      were        informed         that       an a m b ul a nc e          would         be

a 1 1 e n d i ng       to    convey          so m e     i n j ur ed peo p 1 e out             of     t he g r o u n d .          A sIno r t

time        later       the       ambulance             arrived and              was    allowed             through a           la r g e     gate.



A short          t ime       after        that,         s om e      Li ve r p o o 1s u p p o r t e r s b e g a n           w a 1ki ng        f ro m

angry,,          They        were       saying          things         to    us    to    the       effect          "WHAT ARE           YOU

DOING       HER E ,         YOU SHOULD             BE    IN SIDE.            THERE       ARE       BODIES          IN T H E R E "




A short          t im e      la t e r ,      it a p p e a r e d       that        we    had    received a message,

although             I did        not     hear        it,     that      we       should attend                inside        the       g r o u n d,

entering         by    the       Leppings             Land       encl.       As    we w a l k e d          through           the    gate,       on

the     right       had     side         and     into       what       I would            call       the     open area             behind

the     West     Stand,          I saw an ambulance                        and     ambulancemen                   treating          someone

inside        the     ambulance.                 At       the    side      of     the      ambulance              1 saw a man             laid

on    the     fl o o r ,    his        body was            b l u e , but        no-one          was    attending              to    him.        11

became        obvious           that       this       man was          dead.




We    carried         on w a l k i n g         and        into    the      open       space          behind          the West        Stand.

There       were      people           all     over        the    pl ac e .        Liverpool               supporters              were    very

angry       i n d ee d ,    they         were       shouting           abuse       at      us    and       there        were       several

bodies        lying        on        t he g r o u n d .




We    made      our    way           past     these        and        into      the       central          t u n n e l w h i c h runs

i nto    the     terracing               on    the W e s t        Stand.           Once         I came          out     of    the    tu n n el

and     stepped        on       to     the     terracing              I could         see       lar g e      numbers          of    fans    on

the     pitch and           the        noise        was     deafening.



I then        looked        down         the     terracing             towards            the    bottom where                 the    fencing

was     and    saw     bodies,             some       of w h i c h       were      laid         on    top       of    each     ot h er ,    in

a    heap.       Police          Officers             and       supporters            were       frantically                 removing

bodies        and     placing            them       on     the    p i t c h at        the       rear       of     the    goal.




I immediately               went         on    to     the       pitch      and     began         assisting              with       the

removal        of     bodies.             After          helping         to r e m o v e    several           of         t h e s e b o d ie s ,

I went        back     and           got h o l d    of a n o t h e r          man     whose           skin was          s t il l pink       and

h i s b o d y w a s w a rm .



1 got       this      man       to     the     p i t c h at       the      side       of    the       goal       and     commenced

mouth-to-mouth                  resuscitation                   and    cardiac            massage.              While        I was       doing

this,       several         supporters                shouted abuse                towards            me.

                                                                                                                                RH6




  After    a few m i n u t e s              -    I don't          know       how    long    ~ a     fireman attended                 and

  said    he w o u l d       take       over          as    he    had       special       equipment,          oxygen,         etc.      1

  left    this m a n         with       the       fireman and                returned       to     help with           more    bo d i e s .



  All    the    time,        fans       were          shouting          abuse       towards        Police       Officers.            They

  wre    obviously           angry.



  Police       Officers           and       supporters             were       ripping       the     wire      fencing         down    to

  make    removal           of    the       bodies          simpler          and    quicker.




  After    a while,              supporters                were    getting          so a n g r y    1 feared           there    may     be

  a major       crowd        controI             probIem.              We    were      instructed        to     form     a    cordon

  across       th e    centre          of       the    pitch       as       it w a s     feared     rival       supporters

  might    start        fighting.



  As    more    and     more       bodies             were       removed          from    the    pitch,       the      tension

  seemed       to     ease       and    things             returned          to    normal.         We w e r e    then        directed

  back    to    our     original                points       on P e n i s t o n e        Road    and   remained          there

  until    most        of    the       supporters                had    left       the    area.




  We    were    then        taken       to C l a y w h e e l s          Lane       and    from     there      b a ck    to D i v i s i o n

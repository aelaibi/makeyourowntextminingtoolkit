             I am e mp lo y ed by S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y Football             Clu b as head g r ou n d s m a n

             of the       club training           gr ou nd    in M i d d l e w o o d Road,     Hills bo ro ug h.        I have?

             held t h is ' ^M s i t i o n      for about         seven years.          Prior    to that        I was    head

             g r ou n d s m a n   f o r\ S he f f i e l d U n i v e r s i t y for e i g ht e en years.

             On S a t u r d a y    15 A^prN^l^^^S? I star te d work at H i l l s b o r o u g h                 football

             g ro u nd at 7 . 3 0 a m and went            to the office.               I remained there for about

             half an hour and then                 I w a l k e d up to M i d d l e w o o d Roa d training              g ro un d

             w it h                            my a s s i s t a n t and                                     a YTS   lad who

             was      helping me.

             I remai ne d up at M i d d l e w o o d R oa d until a bo ut                  10am.        My

             r es p on s ib i li t ie s    at the t ra ining          ground are        the m a in t e n a n c e and u pk e ep

             of all       the     playing      s ur fac es    there.

             At    10am that morning              I w a l k ed    back    to H i l l s b o r o u g h to move my        car and
                                                                                                           PAGE
                                                                                                           S 1036

then   I w a l k ed back to M i d d l e w o o d R oa d a rr iv in g at about                  10.3 0 a m w h e n         ]

had my breakfast.

I n o ti c e d on my way and wa y back                   that    there were        one or two         football

fans a bout      for the FA Cup semi                  final     b e tw ee n N o t t i n g h a m Fo re st and

Liv er po o l   that a f t e r n o o n     but    I thought        it was      c o mp a ra ti ve ly   quiet     to

what   it should have been even at that                          time.

I carried on wo r k i frg-^at the                training       ground    until      about     1.10pm w he n         I

locked the       premises          up a m k ^ s e t   the alarms.

As   I came     out    I saw at          least, IbG L iv er p oo 1       suppo rt er s      sitting       on the

wall   o u ts id e    the training           g round ."''''"Xliiost all        of them      were      dr i nki ng

beer   from     cans.         I w ou ld not       say they were          drunk or a ny th i ng         but     they

were   quite     s oc iable and           I had a chat w it h one of them,

I then w a lk e d down to the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football                   G ro u nd with                 and

          This       took about          half an hour as          the    police      d ir ec te d us down

Vere R oa d     into P e n i s t on e R oa d to get             in.

As we w a lk e d      from L ep pi n g s Lane           I saw twenty or thirty suppo rt er s

d ri nking m a i n ly soft           drinks.

I thought       how quiet          it was     for such a big game.

We e v e nt u al l y got       in the      gr ou nd at about          1.45pm.        I changed my w o rk in g

clothes and          put    them     in my    car.       I had a cup of           coffee     just     inside        the

players     entrance.             I went     into     the ground from P en i st o ne Road

entrance,       along       the    edge    of the       pitch to get        to '<mr office and               I saw

that   the Kop was           fa'trj^y full       of N o t t i n g h a m For es t     supporters.

I also    noticed          that    the    seating .area in the West S ta nd w a s ^ f a i r l y                 full

as were     the two         pens,     pens 3 arm 4,           of the     ter ra ci ng     in front       of the

West Stand.

I was a m a z e d that         the    te rr ac in g     on either       side    of these      two     pens was

fairly    empty.           I also     n o ti ce d that     the s u p po r te r s     in pens 3 a nd 4 were

L e p p i n g s Lane     end was       far    less.       F rom a r o u n d 2pm to 2 . 4 5 p m     I stayed

under         the S ou t h S t a nd    chatting wi ttvthe           police and other             officials.

down at about 2^5~aj»m.

I. didn't         notice a n y t h i n g     particular at        that     time.     I had a       chat with

one      or two of the L iv e rp o ol             s upporters     in the N or th S tand           until       the

w h is t l e went      for    play     to start at 3pm.

I was         seated on a b en ch w hi ch           I have m a r k e d on a map of the gro un d                     I

               'ers were      playing        the game      for about       one minute w he n           I. saw

po l i c e m e n |ht^li^mp s up po r t e r s       over    the fence       from pens 3 and 4 of the

L e p p i n g s Lane     end near       to the goal.           I could see that the s u pp or te rs

w ere        packed   in pens 3 and 4 S a nd whe n B e a r d s l e y             struck    the    cr ossbar         of

t e rracing        in these     pens.         They seemed to be getting more an d more

packed         in there.        It was a sea of heads               s pr eading     dow nw ar ds    both ways

from the tunnel              under     the yest Stand.

The      police were         still     pulling      them over       the    fencing    onto       the track and

there were more an d more                    on the track a re a and they were                   spewing        onto

the      pitch w hen an         Inspector         ran from     perhaps       10 yards      to the       left     of

the L i v erpool         goal   onto       the    pitch and the         referee then s t op pe d          the

game,

The      players went         to the h al f- wa y         line and      the s pe ct at or s were

spreading          into the     penalty area.              I st ay ed where        I was    for    the    time

being as a policeman                  said    I was    better     off     stopping    there.

The      referee      lead the        players      off up the tunnel and the N o t t i n g h a m

Fo r e s t     fans   started     to taunt         the Li ve rp oo l      fans    for stopping          the     game.

I saw a lot of            pol ic em en       come out from the            g ym n as i um area.      Som e       stood

across      the    pitch and others went                 to help     people         over the fencing            from

the Leppings Lane              end.

I   could tell         lots of        people were        injured a nd         I saw a man age d 2 0-30

years wit h a badly                broken     left arm        come out    of the          crowd a n d walk          off

towards      the gymnasium.               All    I remember was          that he was w ea ri ng               jeans

and dark        clothlti^.          He did not have a L i ve rp oo l                top on like a lot of

I saw a lot of           people        b e u v g carried off       on a d ve rt is in g        boarding        w hi ch

people      had    ripped down           from    r o utvd-'-'ih e ground.

An a mb u l a n c e    came    round to the L ep pi n gs Lane                 end as well         past me along

the     louchline.

.1 cannot       p a rt ic ul ar ly     des cribe a n y b o d y on the m a ke sh if t            s tr et ch er s who

was     badly     injured or         dead because         they had       coats over          their     heads.          It

was m a i n l y    police what           carried them out.

I was     not     s u bj ec te d to any violence              or a buse       but    I h eard some a buse              to

the     gr ou n d as    to what a         "shitty ground"          it was.

I d o n ’t recall        any       p ar ti cu l ar l y bad b eh aviour         by the       s pe ct at or s    on the

pitch but         I did see a few drunks on the                    pitch.           One    in part ic ul ar was

very     drunk.        He was age d          late 3 0 ’s,     had a big        beer belly?         dark       hair.

He h a d n ’t got a shirt              on,    just trousers        on.

I w a l k e d over and s t op p ed            by the     players    tunnel and was              looking        for

                       because       I was a bit         c o nc er ne d about        him.      There were

quite a few L iv e rp o ol             suppo rt er s     s ta nding a ro u nd the           players     tunnel

a nd one or two were                s ho uting abuse          towards     the d irectors         box.         One    of

them     shouted       "Why d i d n ’t we        get more tic ke ts ."

Whe n    it had died down a bit                  I w al ke d up to        get a cup of          coffee        and

have a cigarette              to    calm my      nerves.       I was talking         to

                                                and |                     lint i 1 the       ground was         empty,

I then      cleared the            pitch of all         the    litter    of    cups,      hanker chiefs

paper     napkins,       cigarette           packets and        things.

     *      I then     left    the g ro u nd about 6pm.     At   no time did I go   round the    back

            of the West S t a nd that afternoon.            I can't   comment as to why   this

            h ap pe n e d as   I wa sn 't   outside   to see how many   there were.

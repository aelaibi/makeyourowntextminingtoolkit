  NOTES
1 Modify this as necessary according to whether the
  inquest is held with or without a jury or partly
  with and partly without a jury.
2 In the case of a death from natural causes or from
  industrial disease, want of attention at birth, chronic
  alcoholism or addiction to drugs insert the immediate
  cause of death and morbid conditions (if any) giving                    Date             19
  rise to the immediate cause of death.
3 Omit this if the cause of death is one to which
  Note 2 applies.

4 a Where the cause of death is one to which Note 2
    applies, it is suggested that one of the following
    forms be adopted:
     C.D. died from natural causes.
                                                                          Re
     C.D. died from the industrial disease of

     C.D. died from dependence on drugs/non-dependable
     on drugs.
     C.D. died from want of attention at birth.
     (In any of the above cases, but in no other, it is
     suggested that the following words may, where
     appropriate, be added:
     "and the cause of death was aggravated by lack of                    Cause of death
     care/self-neglect’).

  b In any other case except murder, manslaughter,
    infanticide or stillbirth, it is suggested that one
    of the following forms be adopted:
     C.D. killed himself/herself (whilst the balance of
     his/her mind was disturbed).

     C.D. died as the result of an attempted/self­
     induced abortion.                                                    Verdict
     C.D. died as the result of an accident/misadventure.
     C.D. was killed lawfully.

     Open verdict, namely, the evidence did not fully or
     further disclose the means whereby the cause of death
     arose.
  c In the case of murder, manslaughter or infanticide
    it is suggested that the following form be adopted.

     C.D. was killed unlawfully.
  d In the case of a stillbirth insert 'stillbirth' and do not
    complete the remainder of the form.

Dear     Sirs,

Re:    R E S U M E D INQUESTS           19th N OV EM B E R 1990.



If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people w h o di ed at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m.      Details of venue w i l l be n o t i f i e d in
due course.

 I do not have to remind you of the fact that a c on siderable amount of
 evidence has already bee n taken, nor of the n a tu re and limitations o f a
 c o ron al investi gat io n w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not a d ve rs ari al but
 inqu is ito ri al in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

 Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
 u nder m y control, and in particular, it is m y respons ibi li ty to select the
 wi t n e s s e s w h o w i s h to give evidence. I am at p r ese nt engaged in c on si der in g
 this and in d et er m i n i n g w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

 Wi t h o u t pre judice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
 to give you an oppor tun it y to dr aw to m y a t t e n tio n the names and other
 a p pro pr iat e details of any witn es s or w i t n e s s e s w h o m you w o u l d like me to
 co n si de r callin g to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

 M a y I please ask yo u in c on si der in g w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names                  to my
 attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and li mitations of an Inquest.

 I also w a n t to make it absolut el y clear that the submission of a name or
 names for c o n s ide ra tio n is n o t hin g more than that, and that the de cis io n as
 to w h o to call to give evidence                             is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

 I w o u l d be grateful                if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
 h e a r d from you by                        nf Sentember I w i l l assume you have no names to
 submit.

Dear Mr. McGrath

                  Keith McGrath (deceased)
As far as I am aware, you are not legally represented in respect
of the Inquest into the death of the above named.
I am writing to let you know that although it has been in
my TMnd to resume the adjourned Inquest on the 15th of January
1990, I have had to review my thinking on this.
You will he aware that the Director of Public Prosecutions
has been asked t& look into the circumstances, and I have
decided that I will not he able to resume the Inquests for
some considerable time as I will have to review the matter
some time after the Director of Public Prosecutions has
announced what action if any, he would want to take.
 I will be in touch with you again regarding this when I am
 able to do so, but you should anticipate that there will be
 some considerable delay before I am in a position to say
 anything definitive.
 Whilst writing to you, I have had numerous requests for copies
 of post mortem reports from solicitors representing other
 deceased persons.
 Whilst the release of the post mortem reports presents certain
 difficulties I have decided that subject to certain safeguards,
 I am prepared to release a copy to solicitors acting for the
 bereaved, or where that is not appropriate or convenient, to
 medical practitioners.
 Should you wish me to communicate with your G.P. (or other medical
 practitioner) with a view to letting him have a copy of the post mortem
 report so that he may be able to go through it with you, I would
 be grateful if you could please let me know.
 It would also be helpful if you could set out clearly the name
 and address of the doctor involved.
 Finally, if you were to move house before the resumption of the
 Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please let me have a
 note of your change of address, so that I may be able to keep
 in touch with you as and when necessary.

 Yours sincerely
                                                   / <^L.]?b&ner. H.M.Coroner

Dear                 Mr McGrath

Be:                  K e ith McGrath                         deceased
I am very sorry to have to trouble you at such a very sad time as
this but you may wish to know what is happening regarding
the Inquest.

The Inquest now stands adjourned and I will be in touch with you
or your representative when it is possible to proceed. You should
however be prepared for a lengthy delay. This is very much regretted,
but unavoidable under the circumstances.

As it is not possible for you to obtain a death certificate until
after the conclusion of the Inquest, I enclose an interim certificate
of the fact of death, which may be of some assistance to you.

I also enclose the attached statement form which sets out the information
which I have concerning the deceased. It is important that the facts
are correct, and I would be most grateful if you could carefully check
the details, paying particular attention to the spelling of the names

described            by       Insp.        Phenix,          his       concern          centred around                  the      number        of

alternative                   route.          However           he w a s        quite clearly                 told     that      this      Was

going         to    be        the       route       and    not.in         so     many words             to     sit d o w n       and     stop

Being           the       only          supervisor             that       I could          see     I tried        to     contact           Match

    Control          to       find       out    what       they wanted                us    to     do,    now     that        w e .h a d

    entered          the       ground          and       had    our       dogs    out       with     us.         After        a    short        while

    we    were       told          to    leave       the       ground       and       wait        outside.            Still        without           a

    clear       picture             as    to w h a t       had       happened.              Rumours         began        to       spread        that

    people          had       been       k i 1 1ed at          the    L e p p i ngs        Lane     end     of    the      ground.

    However          no       official          confirmation                of    this       was     forthcoming.                   Many

    officers             stood          around       on    the       Penistone             Road North            on    the        central

    reservation                and       footpaths             wondering          what       was     happening.                   I radioed

    Match       Control             and    asked          what       they wa nte d            these       men     to     do.        Match

    Control          stated             that    they wanted                the    dog       handlers         to       take        their        dogs

around              to

    (15455.              We    remained             on    the    pitch          until       about        4.SOpm        (16205        to 4 . 3 0 p m

    position             on    the       central          reservation             because          of     the     pedestrians                  and

vehicles.                     We   therefore              commenced             foot       patrol        for a w h i l e ,          breaking

    Upon      hearing             this       we    decided          to    try and             get     closer            to    the       ground       to

    render         what       assistance                we    could.

 South Yorkshire Dog Handler.               This particular Police Constable wa,s

 concerned about the route to be taken "by the Liverpool coaohes, as

 desoribed "by Insp Pi;* n i x , his concern centred arcufcd the number

 of road ■works of a Major Nature that were being oarried out along the

 proposed route.               (He did state that he had only just been given the

 proposed route) and the delays this would create*                     He did suggest an

 alternative route.              However he was quite clearly told that this m g

 going to be the route and not i n so many words to sit down and atop

        People were already arriving for tho football match, and continued

to arrive in what appeared to be a steady stream thereafter.                        Most of

the fans I dealtwith being on the Middlewood Road side of the ground}

were Liverpool.            These’"fans all seemed to be well provided with beer

and lager.         The public houses along this main road were closed.                  However

public houses on-fee side roads remained open, it did not take long

for the visitors to discover this and a continuous stream of fans walked

away from the ground area into the side roads to these public houses.

       A steady flow of supporters began up Wadeslay Lane, away from

Middlewood Hoad, their destination was a public house,the Horse and Jocke

which had remained open*              This public house is situated at the top of

ifadesley Road, some fifteen minutes or more away from the ground*

        A steady build up of Liverpool fans began at this location.

Many were drinking fro® cans and bottles they had trought with them

as well as from glasses containing alcohol that they had purchased

from the Horse and Jockey,

       We decided to pay frequent attention to this location during the

time of our patrol and radio the information about The growing number

of fans gathering,to Match Control.             This would he approximately 11 15 am

the same dayi

       As the day progressed Middlewood Hoad "became thronged with vehicles

and people making progress along it in a vehicle very alow;                    In light

of this Pc Pearce and myself decided to pay closer attention to the

surrounding areas, the side streets etc.            General Patrol commenced

with the number of fans growing at the Horse and Jockey and an off

licence further down Wadesley Road towards Middle-wood Road, selling

alcohol to people as fast as they oould take it from the shelves.

       Most other parts of our patrol area in the surrounding streets of

Middlewood Road were relatively quiet*

       At about 2 40 pm the scene outside the 3 orse and Jockey gave me

cause for concern.             The fans without exception appeared drunk and were

■becoming .very loud and offending the residents that live there either

side and opposite the Horae and Jockey,             I again radiod Match Control

and asked them to send more offioers to the scene as in my opinion

we had to take some action to prevent the fans and residents coming to

blows.

       The surrounding area, grass verges, gardens and pavements, were

covered with, empty beer bottles, cans and spirit bottles*              Pc Pearoe

and myBelf got from our vehicle.             X would estimate the number of people

drinking outside the Horse and Jockey at this time to be in excess of

 200 all of whom in my opinion were drunk without excaption;

          We approached the main body of supporters and at this time were

 joined, by other officers ? between, us we began moving’ the fans on and

 dispersing the crowd.                They began walking down Waaesley Road towards

 the ground.            Many stopping off at the off licence to purchase aore

alcohol to consume,                We followed this group down towards the ground,

 the numbers being increased all the time &y other fans who had been

drinking in other hostelries in the surrounding area*

          I             again radiod Match Control to inform them that a large contin

of Liverpool fans (as they approached Wadesley Road and Middlewood

Road) numbering now in excess of 500 strong all again appeared drunk.

          Whilst reoognsing the offence of being                   drunk at.a designated

 sporting eventj the number of people drunk were 30 overwhelming that

nothing could be done about it;

         As I approached the junction of Wadesley Road and Middlewood Road

a solid mass of people were pouring towards the ground? this would now

 ce about 2 ;jO pm to 2 55 pm.                   Just before the kick off time I heard

concern being expressed Oy a Superintendent at Leppings Lane end of

the ground as to the number of late arrivals and the mounting crush

outside the turnstiles.                  He reques-caa more than once for oonideration

to be given to the kick off oeing delayed for at least 1? minutes to

allow time for tbsee supporters to gain entry to the ground.                            He was

told that the kick off could not be delayed.                        It was apparent to me

liatoning to the radio that tho oonoornlajing oxpsoauad by the Superintenc

was of a real nature.                His voice had all the tones of a man who was

              Upon hearing t&is we dsoided to try and got closer to the ground

to render what assistance we could*

              At about 3 10 pm we were told by Hatch Control to attend Gate *0*

at the Penistone Hoad end of the ground, we arrived at this location

to see that a number of other dog handlers were already there with their

dogs out and entering the ground through gate ’0 **                                                                      I got Pd Jake from

the van and entered the ground not knowing why, not knowing what

happened*

              I                  tried to gain information from Pc’s in the ground to ascertain

what had happened*                                  From what I was told X foimed the opinion that                                                         a

serious public order situation had arisen, culminating in an invasion of

the pitch*

             At this time nothing had come from Matoh Control.

             Being the only supervisor that I could see I tried to contact

Match Control to find out what they wanted us to do, now that we had

entered the ground and had our dogs out with us*                                                                      After a short while

we were told to leave the ground and wait outside*                                                                      Still without a clear

picture as to what had happened.                                              Humours "began to spread that people

had been killed at the-Leppings Lane and of the ground©

            However no official confirmation of this was forthcoming.                                                                          Many

officers stood around on the Penistone Road Forth on the central

when the announoment that the game had been cancelled was made,

        All the dog handlers then left the ground, I was still unsure

as to what had happened.

        Myself and Pc Pearce found it impossible to move our vehicle from

its position on fee central reservation because of the pedestrians and

vehicles*        "Je therefor commenced foot patrol for at while,                 "breaking

up a fight between 50 or 60 rival supporters on Hillsborough Park*

Eventually we re-commenced mobile patrol and were directed to patrol

the town centre where we broke several minor incidents involving rival

fans.

        At about 7 30 pm to were stood down and travelled back to our home

force still unsure of what had really happened*

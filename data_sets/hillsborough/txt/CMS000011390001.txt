Thank you for your letter of 22 May setting out your suggestions
about funding for ground improvements and the Taylor Report.


You will by now have seen the announcement I made in the House on
4 June about our plans to re-examine the all-seating requirements
at Third and Fourth Division clubs in the Football League. I will
also be   looking at the position of Second Division clubs with
very    low   average     attendances.       We    have      asked     a   number     of
interested    organisations     to   let     us    have   their views       and have
specifically asked them whether standing accommodation should be
permitted     only   at   grounds    with    a     maximum    capacity      of,     say,
10,000. We have asked for these comments within four weeks and I
will announce my conclusions as soon as possible thereafter.


I note your     suggestion that the Football Trust should provide
loans to clubs as well as grant-aid.                 I know that the Football
Trust   has   the    question   of   loans    in    certain    circumstances         for
Premier League clubs under consideration, although this would not
be in addition to the reduction in Pool Betting Duty monies which
you are calling for.


You suggest that these loans should be funded by the Government
or by the National Lottery. I would point out that the National

                                                                                       1
Lottery        will    not      be     in      operation         until       1994        and    it     is    not
possible at this stage to say precisely how the proceeds will be
used.     In    addition         you      will       be    aware      that        the    Chancellor          has
announced that he will extend the reduction in Pool Betting Duty
for an additional five years provided clubs have plans in place
to    finance       out    of     their        own    resources         the        cost    of    necessary
ground        improvements           to     implement           the    Taylor           recommendations.
Government          action        is      therefore          already         making        available           a
sizeable       contribution to the                    costs      of    implementing             the    Taylor
recommendations.               It is therefore incumbent upon football to make
its     own    contribution            to      improving        grounds       and        I hope        that    a
substantial         proportion            of    the       new money      going to the                 Premier
League        clubs    will       be      used       for    this      purpose           rather        than    on
inflated transfer fees and players' salaries.


I note what you say about all clubs being treated the same by the
Football Trust for grant purposes irrespective of their division.
This is a matter for the Trust. However I should point out that
within        the     grant-aid         ceilings          which       they    have        set     for       each
division the Trust is committed to taking full account of the
needs and resources of all clubs in considering applications for
grant.    They have             also      said that         should the             reduction          in    Pool
Betting Duty concession be extended then they will concentrate
the extra resources on the smaller clubs that are most in need of
assistance.


I do not accept that the August 1994 deadline for all-seating is
totally inadequate. My announcement of 4 June made very clear our
commitment to the principle and timetable for all-seating for our
top   clubs.        The    Football            Licensing Authority                 have        made    clear,
however,       that       it    is     incumbent          for    clubs       to    inform       it     of    any
circumstances          which prevent them from achieving all-seating by
that date.

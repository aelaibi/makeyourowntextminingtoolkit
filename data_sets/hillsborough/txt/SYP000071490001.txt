        He    came     out from the                                                and went         for    something       to eat

        and a pint of beer.                       We    then got        on a bus and went             to the ground at

        a bo u t    1.55       pm    (1355).           We got      off the bus about a mile                  from the ground

        because        it was         c on ge s t e d with traffic.

        As we were w al ki ng                 I saw no signs             of any     fights         in the fans      but     there

        were       some    singing and general                     joll i t y w i t h i n    them.        It was a nice          day

        and     e v e ryone was          in a good mood.                 I didn't         notice any signs          of

        were       trying       to do s o methi ng           about       it but they were             doing     the opposite

        really.           It was       just       impossible.            As    I say there was a large                crowd and

        the     horses were k n o c k i n g              people        over.

        I came        into      the    crowd and star t e d              to make my way along                the edge       of       it

        also       for a league            game earlier             this year.

C o m i ng    up to the end of the                tunnel       I noticed a downw a r d          slope    but     I

d i d n ’t notice        if the       crowd went         f o r w a r d any quicker       or not.        W hen    I

right        of this w i th my brother and friends.

I w a nt e d     to go over          to the      right    but    the    pressure       of the    crowd forced

me    towards a point w hi ch                I have      indicated on a grid as a b out C3.                      I

was    unable         by now to move          in any d i re ct i o n and         I was    turned at a 90

degree angle            to the       pitch and facing            towards    the S o u t h stand.          I felt

a ma n       put his arm s         on my shoulders and                I tried to get him to move

them.         I was     unable       to see any of the ground               because       of the    press        of

people a ro u n d me.              By this       time    I was    starting       to sweat and       beginning

w i t h the      pressure         on my    chest     to have      difficulty          in breathing.         At

around        this     time    I was a w are       that    the    game     had started by what            the

people a r o un d me were              saying and           doing      but I could see the         pitch.

Be ca us e      of the weight          of arms       on my back and neck               I was    being    pushed

off    balance and            I could feel         that my body was             tilting    over    to my        left.

I r e a l i s e d that        I was    going      down      and there was          nothing I could        do     to

help myself.             X was       shouting      and      s c r eaming at      people a r o u n d me to        push

back and give me               space,      but    they c o u l d n ’t do a n y thing       either       because

it seemed e v e ryone was                 shouting       the    same    thing.

I even                  fell      to the     ground and         did    in fact     land across      someone

else,        t he nN so me on e    fell across me.              I could see someones             head near to

mine,        he was     trying       to shout      out.        He was    panicking.        I told him to

take deep breaths.                   It was      then that       1 felt    someone       fall    across    me.

I remained            like    that    for at      least tw e n t y m i n u t e s      it felt as    if it was

longer.          The    crowd     started        to decrease a r o u n d me and           I felt    the     body

lifted        off me.         I then felt         someone       get    hold of me,       a man    in a red

jumpier,       who     pulled me       up.       I was    unable       to get    right    up because my

legs were          held down.         He     got me up e ve nt u a l l y and he           passed me to

s omeone      else.          The     one who       picked me up was a big fellow and he just

q a t stuck       in to help others.                     I was      ta-kefx to the          gate at the front and
                                                                    I I'M
I got     out     onto       the      pitch.        My      right leg had pins and needles                  in it.            I

c o u l d n ’t move         it.      A young w oman           came      over       to me and a sked        if I was

a lri g h t and        I told her about                my leg.          She       had a look at         it and m oved

it about        then said            it was alright.

Someone       gave me a drink                of water and by this                    time    there were      hundreds

of    people      on the          pitch.       I saw someone                I know and shouted him but               he

d i d n "t h ear rne .

When     I regained my senses                    and wal k e d        round the           pitch to try to find

friends       it got         to about        4 .3 0    pm    (1630).

I then a s k ed         if I could get                back    into      the       pen to go out.          I got    back

in an d went           to where          I fell       to try to find my trainer                    shoe.     I had one

missing,        the     right         one.      W hile       I was     looking a p o liceman             came over.           I

just     found my trainer as he said                          "What are you d o i n g ? ”               I said    !!I was

looking       for rny trainer.                  I have       just     found        it.“     He   let    it go at that

and    I walked         out       to a p r e - a r r a n g e d m e e t i n g       place.

to find out about                  friends       or    relatives.             One    gave me a number w h i c h           I

later      rang       but    I c o u l d n ’t get through.                   It was always         engaged.

W hilst     I was       in the         ground      I d i d n ’t -see a n y t h i n g w hich            I w ould think

w o u 1d be a crim i n a 1 offence.

I cannot        say that           I w i t n e s s e d anyone         dying a l t h o u g h      the    person who was

lying     b elow me          didn't move.             His    shirt was            ripped,    as th o u g h someone

had step p e d on him,                and     it was        showing         his    bare   chest.

Once     I got outside                the    ground         I met up wit h          my brother and a friend of

his and       I also         saw      the    friend,                                      I shou t e d to him and he

said he was alri g h t                and said that he had found the friends                               that    he was

supposed        to have           t r a ve ll e d wit h originally.

I had been s e pe ra te d               from my brother and friends                         at some      stage    in the

               Ini t i a l l y     I w a n te d    to move        over to the      right       of    pen 3 because,            having

               been     in there          before      I knew that          there was      gate at the           top w h i c h

              a l l o w e d acc e s s       b et w e e n    pens 3 and 2.

              L o ok i n g    back      on it,       it seemed to me that             the      police were more

               p re oc c u p i e d wit h       crowd        control     that w i t h a s s i s t i n g w ith the        problem.

               I saw more            fans    doing         goo d work    inside    the    pen than          I did    police.

              There was            no o r g a n i s a t i o n    outride    the g r o u n d either          by Police

               st e wards         or the     fans.          In compa r i s o n to the         same m a t c h    last year          the

               st a n d a r d s   this      time were           poor.

               In my opin i o n           I feel      that       the fans    should      have       been    c hannelled        up to

               the    turnstiles.            The     incident may have            been a v e r t e d       if they had have

               I stayed           overnight w i t h my brother and                 returned          home    on S u n d a y     16th

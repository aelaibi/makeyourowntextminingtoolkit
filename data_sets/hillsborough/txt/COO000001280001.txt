                parts in April and May 1990; and between N ovem ber 1990 and March 1991, involved over

                80 days o f public hearing. A further investigation1was conducted by the W est Mkdlarids
                police, supervised by the Police Complaints A uthority, to establish w hether there were
                any grounds for criminal o|r disciplinary proceedings.' That investigation involved fhe

                taking o f more than 5000 statements,           At a later stage in N ovem ber 1993, ,there was a

                 disaster, w h ich has been subject to a pmblid inqiury. ! H e endorses the recommei idatipn ojf a

                 role of the coroner after such a public inquiry s lou ld be limited.



                  15       Lord Justice Sm art-Sbith highlights in his ireport the exceptionally difficult task :
                  w hich the coroner had in conducting the raaitji me uest.1 It placed an unreasonable and, I ;

                  think, unnecessary burden on hii n wiicn the Taylc r Report had covered subs! ant ijd ly jh e
                  same ground. C ertainly I am clear th it H llsborou ;h proved that the system in its jpresent
                  form is unsuitable as a means of dealing w ith cjisasters of this kind. If no inquest had byen

                  necessary, the T aylor inquiry, w hich all have accepted as an excellent report, w o d ld then
                                                                                                              I
                  have remained unchallenged;as th e last w o td on thejcauses of the disaster.

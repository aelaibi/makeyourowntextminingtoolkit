                    I live at the above address with my wife and family.                        I have       lived at

                    t,his address for 3 and a ha 1f years.

                    At about    10.00am on Saturday 15th April            1989 I travelled to Sheffield

                    from Liverpool by motor car.           I travelled with

                                                and                       drove       ye went with the

                    intention to watch the Semi Final           of the F.A. Cup between Liverpool

                    and Nottingham Forrest.        I had a t i ck e t for the match for the

                    Leppings Lane Standi ng which cost me £6 .G Q p .             I went towards the

                    turnstile just inside the blue gate.                There was a lot of Supporters

                    inside where      I was and a Police Horse was          inside trying to control

                    the Supporters       into sections.    The Police horse stood on my right

         —i \ Cf    foot and broke my toe and a bone on my in s t e p .                    My foot was
           (A
                    bleeding and my shoe was split so I walked around towards the South

         Stand.    There were two Police Officers standing at a small             barrier

         and they told me to try and get back through the            crowd.     When I

         looked back I saw I would not get through as all            I could see was a

         mass of people.         The gate at the side just     past the turnstile was

         opened and I walked through I met up with                               and I

         eventually went to the tunnel and when I looked down the tunnel                 I saw

         it was full so I walked back.           I was standing on the steps waiting
                                                                  JZ oZ    '
         for the other two lads who        I went with when I saw Mi chae1 Dav id Ke 11 y

         come through the turnstiles.           He was on his own a id I spoke to him.            He

         said,    he was going     into the ground terracing and         iaid that he might see
                                                                     V
         me later.     I never saw him again after that.         This was at about a

         minute    past three.      I then went to the South Stand end of the West

         Stand and a steward told me to sit down on a seat near to the exit                  in

         the South S t a n d .    I remained there for the time of the disaster and the

         game being stopped.When 1 went          into the ground I did not hand my ticket

         into any official as        I was injured and a Police Officer saw my injury

         and directed me into the South Stand.

         I still have my ticket number          150489 which   I passed to

         Item No      ) (Exhibit No        ).   LL2 I     ITicket.

                   Further to yhe statement            I made on the 4 May 1989 (040589)                      .!. w o u l d


                   now like^/o say that^ 1 think the time I g ^ v e ,                       when I spoke to Michael

                   I have been shown a video            recording of the                  crowd outside the Leppings

                   Lane turnstiles.       I can identify myself on the video.                          At 00.11.35.06

                   I can be seen by the Policsf Horse as it stood on my foot.                               I can be

                   seen again at 00=11.40.09.                I would say that               I was   inside the ground

                   within five minutes of the horse standing on my foot.
                                                                                             /vC£//q
                   I was by the concertina gate               *C 5.      I was with                     and his son
                                                                                   ,

                   interviewed).     We were talking to/a policeman by a barrier near to the

                   gate about my injury.          He said % he gate was going to be opened.                           I

                   think he said for someone to be thrown out.

                                                                                      S560A

                           ;aid to the Policeman get him in when it opens, meaning

         m e , because of my injured foot

                    was opened and I wen]/into the ground

         As I walked in the gate, i^walked behind             turnstiles and         saw

          i chae 1 Dav id KELLY c a m e through the turnst i.1 e

         went off down the / u n n e 1

         I now realise 'tKat the time I gave of a minute           past three    (1301) was

         wrong        co    d not say what time    it was but I understand that the

         times can be worked out from the video film

         Once    I was inside the ground I saw the gate open again              This was

         about 3 minutes after           entered the ground   This was the 1ast t ime

         the gate was opened and everyc/e         came in and went down the tunnel

         now know that the gate was/opened this time at about            14,50 hrs    (1430)

HILLSBOROUGH LEGAL BILL


My original plan to meet this bill was to pay it from general expenses, and vire money later
in the year into general expenses from other subheads to meet the costs of various projects,
such as the Ascot Race Course inspection, as demand arose. Following conversations with
Mr Gange of Finance Division 1, it appears that using the general expenses subhead would
cause potential embarrassment for the 0 ffice with the Treasury. This is because general
expenses comes under non-pay running costs, and we have already told the Treasury that we
are exceptionally tight in this area.

2.     This means that we have to find the money for this bill of just under £37,000 from-
either other current expenditure or capital. The major subhead within this category is
expenses of fire research, but as we appear to hit that particular budget for practically every
other contingency I am reluctant to propose raiding it yet again. Mr Bolton would no doubt
agree.

3.     Casting the net wider, it may be that given the size of the College’s capital subhead,
and notwithstanding the plans that the Commandant has outlined for building new
accommodation blocks, there may be some room for manoeuvre there. Perhaps the College
could let us know their views.           '

4.     If this fails, then the research budget istheonly option left,short of going back to
Finance Division 1 and saying there is no provision tomeet this bill, soit will have to be
found from another part of the Office.

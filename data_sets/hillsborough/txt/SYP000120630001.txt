           S E M I - F I N A L , HILLSBOROUGH   1988



           During the semi Pinal football match between Nottingham Forest and

           Liverpool     played on Sheffield W e d n e s d a y ’s Football Ground.

           Hillsborough,        Sheffield,      in April    1988,   I was engaged with m y serial

           of 10 men on crowd control             duties at the Lappings Lane end of the

           ground from early in the afternoon until th end of the game.

           During the period prior to the kick-off,                 I recall   carrying out duties

           outside the Leppings Lane entrance.                  These duties   involved the

           searching of fans for cans,             bottles,     alcohol and offensive weapons,

           together with checking that fans had tickets and directing them to

           the correct      part of the ground.            At no time do I recall any barriers

           or cordons of Police Officers being formed to filter supporters                      in

           Leppings Lane.

           A few minutes        prior, to kick-off     I moved with my serial       into the

           centre tunnel        leading onto the terracing.           I remained at the rear of

           this terracing until          the game had ended and the supporters had

           cleared the terracing.

           Further    to my report dated 17.5.89          (170589)      regarding the 1988

           Hillsborough Semi Final to clarify the position in the centre                     pen,    I

           can recall     that the pen was very full at the start of the g a m e r

           supporters were standing         in the tunnel who could obviously not see

           the game,     these were directed back down the tunnel and around into

           the outer     pens.

           Throughout     the game     I remained at the       pen end of the tunnel    looking

           dawn the terracing towards the pitch.                As with most big crowds

^          forward surges did occur but I cannot               recall any noteworthy incident.

           I have also a recollection of          the pressure       in the centre   pen being

           relieved slightly by allowing          supporters      to leave the pen via the

           gates    in the fencing dividing       the pens.       This was one way traffic

           only police officers allowing          supporters      to leave the centre pen only,

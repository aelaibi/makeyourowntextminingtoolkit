I did        se e      police          standing             at       the    junctions.

Up on my arrival                      at    th e      ground                               and     I had          to    go       to    the      players

to     go    to       the    rear          of    the       South Stand where                       we     m et     a friend              of

got     our       tickets which were                            £6    for L e p p i n g s          Lane,          s t a n d i n g . We          then

trying         to      get       into       t he      ground.          There          was     no     orderly            queues.            I d i d n ’t

my way         back         to    the       ground          e n t r a n c / T I did               note      t ha t      whilst            I was       going

2.50pm.

I then         returned               to    the       entrance             to    the       ground         but      I d i d n ’t

                 At    this       time     he w a s        immediately                to m y      left.        He      t o l d me       he w a s a l r i g h t .

                 I didn't           notice          what       happened          to    him a fter            that.

                 Immediately              in f r o n t          of me        was      a youth          between           18 a n d 2 0 .T h e           first

                 time       I noticed           him       he    h ad      gone     into      u n c o n c i o u s n e s s . He w a s

                 facing          sidewards           toward          my     right,       his      head was             slumped          on the         person

                 in f r o n t       of    him.       His       face       was    red.       I tried          to     re v j/fv e    him      by    hitting

          his     face a nd          he       came     round       for    a few moments.                      I told

          him     to    stay awake               and    not    to    go     down         or    he w o u l d        have     had

          it.     I also          told        him     that    I would          look a f t e r            him.      I was       no w    beginning

          to     panick       myself,            thinking about                my    girlfriend and                   if

          I was        going        to    get       out.     I d o n ’t k n o w w h a t             happened          to    the y o u t h a f t e r

          t hat.       I ’m    not       sure w h e th e r         he w e n t       unconcious                again.       I would

          describe            him about             20 years,         he w a s       cle^n          shaven and             had

r\o   .

          c o u l d n ’t see w h a t             he w a s     wearirt%/ ibecause we                      were      packed        so



                    >xt t h i n g         I know was a y ou th who                        was       slightly          to    the       r ig h t    of me

          climb        on     top    of       the     people       in f r o n t      of me          he    had his          f oo t     stuck

          between my              legs        for a     few moments.                I thought             I would          have       to

          do     the    same        to    get       out.     I then att empted                     to    put m y      f o ot     on

          someones            back       in f r o n t       of me.       The    barriers                must    have       c o l l a p s e d at       this

          point        because           there        was    just     enough         to       lift       my    foot.       I then

          became        aware        that        there       was    r o o m to m y            left a n d           got     out a n d

          to     the    centre           of    the     fencing.          I asked          someone             where      the     exit       was     but

          he     didn't        answer.           I then       saw     the      tunnel          and       got    out

          through           it.     On    the       other     side       I sat       down          by    the    pillar         to     the    left.        I

          was     shaking           but       I c o u l d n ’t feel         any      pain.          The       events       I ’ve      described

          must     have        taken          place     over       15 or 2 0 m i n u t e s               but    I can o n l y          remember

          th e    instances              I ’ve      described.

          After        sitting           for     a while        I moved         to       the       outside         wall     where          I sat     and

          talked        to a n o t h e r         man.       I then went             by    the       police         b ox a n d       looked        onto

          the     pitch.          After        that     I went        through            the       gate       I had      come

          in a n d      saw a        line        of    bodies       surrounded                by    po l i c e .    I then          broke

          down.,        Eventually               I made       my way        back         to    the       van where          we all

          met     up a g a i n . W e          returned        to L i v e r p o o l        getting             back about            7.00pm.         1 /G ia .s

          now     beginning              to    feel     pain       in m y      ribs.

                    At    no    t i me     throughout            the     time       I was    in the       ground             di d      I se e a n y

                    fights       or      disturbances             or     see a n y        person       committing             a     criminal

                    offence        or      drink       any alcohol.

                    All    I can say             that       I think        would      be    of    interest          to       the       enquiry           is

                    firstly        th e w a y         in w h i c h      the    crowd was          handled          before           it got          to    the

                    ground,        I a t t e n d e d th e          same m a t c h         last    year    and       there was a                 c h e ck

                    on    each     persons            ticket       before       they       got    to    the    ground and                last        year

                    when       I got       to    the     ground         there       were    officers          p r e s e n t at

                    the    turnstiles             which        were      searching          people.       Also          last        year       there          were

                    people       outside          the       gates       teethe       ground       telling          us    to       go    into

c   <   t       h   e      ground          in so       dajng               allowing         people       to m il l           about.        Also          last

                    year       there       were       polLu^e a n d        stewards         on    the    inside          of       the    ground which

                    I did       not      see     this       y ea r ,    not    e v e n at    the       entrance          to

                    the    tunnel.          I think           there       should      have       been more          guidance              or    signs

                    which       I did       not       see    directing          people       to    the    sides.,             I also           think          t h at

                    there       should          have     been      police       on the       ground       side          of    the

                    tunnel.

                    I think        when         the    disaster           happened         the    police       on       the       perimiter              fence

                    d i d n ’t u n d e r s t a n d w h a t        was      happening         and       this    made          there

                    reaction          to    the       events       slow and          perhaps       making          it m o r e          difficult

                    for    people          to    get     out.      I think          the    police       may    have          been more

                    prepared          for a       public         order        situation          than a       distiister.               I was        not

                    aware       of a n y m e d i c a l         help      being       gi ve n .    I was       not       seen        by a n y o n e

                                                                                     I also       feel    that          the w h o l e          of    the

                    ground       facilities              including            ground       entrances          are       outdated and                 that

                    major       investment             should          be m a d e    to    provide       decent          facilities                 for all

                    supporters             not    o n l y at H i l l s b o r o u g h        but    also       at    other           grounds.                   I

                    also       wish      to a d d      that      I attended           to    cup    finals          at    Wembley and                 I

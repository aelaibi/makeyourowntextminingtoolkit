                  I live at the above address with my                            common       law wife and four          children,

                                                    , Sheffield.          I. have wo rk ed at the store for seven

                  rno n t h s .     On Sa t u r day 15 April.       1989       I was working at the shop.                   At

                  about      four        thirty and a quarter             to five,          I was asked to come to shop

                  •floor as a couple                of Liverpool         supporters were              in the store,      and he

                  was      concerned?          I saw two white           lads,    aged 2 0 — 2b years wit h deep

                  L iverpool         accents,        by the W i ne s/ Sp ir it s        trying        to open a wine      bottle,

                  I stood by them               it was    obvious    they had drunk a lot of alcohol                       as     I

                  could smell             it strongly      on their        breaths.           Three     other Liverpool          lads

                  came      in and joined the             other   two?       one a sked        to go to the toilet,              so   I

                  went w ith him.              On returning       to the ground               floor     I went with this          lad

                  to the managers              office as      1 could see the                other     four   lads    in the
                                                                                                        P AGt
                                                                                                        SI 901

              office,     with one of the         shop girls.       I found out       they had been a l l ow ed
        V                                                                                               -------
              to use     the   phone    in the office      to   phone   home.        I sent the girl,

                         back to the shop floor and             I stayed with the men.            While we

              were    in the office       1 felt      intimidated all      of a sudden as they kept

              touching     the      safe and asking     how much was       in it,     I wasn't    totally

              meant,     or not,       I thought      they may     be about   to       remove    the safe. All

              the men used the          phone and then      left     the store,       on reflection     I now

              think    the talk        about    the   safe was of a jovial             nature as all     ofthem

              had had a good           drink.     They all      left the shop          and   I didn't   see them

              go a nywhere else.

   Dear Sir,

   Hillsborough•Inquests•~ •Engineering•Evidence

   Thank you for your fax of 17th December.

   We are passing a copy to Mr. Noel Burne of Elrond Engineering for
   comment and our clients are more than willing to instruct Mr. Burne
   to attend a meeting with the HSE to discuss any points of difference.

   In the circumstances, we do not think it would;be helpful if we
   commented in detail on the specific points raised at this stage, but
   we do have one or two observations which may be relevant:


             1.        It is not quite clear whether the HSE accept that
                       there was a misinterpretation of the result of
                       the tests carried out on barrier 124A in 1983 and
                       1988.   It was suggested in submissions to the
                       Taylor Inquiry that there was a body of opinion
                       which would support the Eastwood policy of re­
                       zeroing after each test.   Elrond Engineering
                        indicate that there is no such body of opinion
                       and indeed we have not been able to find any
                       Engineer who would support the Eastwood
                       .interpretation.  We think it a fair assumption
                       that if the tests ihad been correctly interpreted
                       then the' barrier would have been replaced and a
                       newer barrier would have been unlikely to have




                                                                                                                     /.,. contd.

              collapsed.  We are not sure whether the HSE agree
              with this hypothesis.

        2.    Likewise, although HSE Report SMR/343/235/01 makes
              reference to the effect which gaps in barriers
              behind 124A would have on increasing the pressure
              on that barrier., no reference appears to be made
              to the effect of the lack of height of barriers
              136 and 136A, such that a leaning crowd behind
              those barriers would transmit force down the
              terracing very much as if the barriers were not
              present.


  Having made those points, we agree with your observation that the
  Elrond report was prepared for the purposes of civil proceedings
  which are of a wholly different character to the present Inquests.
  It is no part of the Chief Constable's case to cast blame on other
  persons, but it is part of his case to suggest that responsibility
  for this tragedy is rather more diffuse than was suggested by the
  Taylor Interim Report, so that the tragedy may properly be called an
  accident.  We, therefore, make point number 1 above, not in the
  spirit of passing blame on to the Club or its Consulting Engineer,
  but by way of emphasising that, in this case, a large number of
  different factors came together to create the conditions for tragedy.

  For our part, we would not wish to press strongly for the expert
  whom we instructed in civil proceedings to be called as a witness at
  the Inquests, because we think it preferable if the expert evidence
  comes from those who are seen to be entirely independent.  Having
  made that point, it does seem to us that if there remain major
  points of difference after a discussion between Mr. Burne and the
  HSE, then it might be fair for those points of difference to be
  explored before the Jury.

  On the assumption that Mr. Burne of Elrond Engineering will make
  himself available for a meeting, how should matters then be
  arranged?

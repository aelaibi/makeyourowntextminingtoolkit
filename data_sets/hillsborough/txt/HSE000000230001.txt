              THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER: FINAL REPORT: INQUIRY BY THE
              RT HON LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR

              1. As you know the final report of Lord Justice Taylor's
              inquiry into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster was published
              last week.  I attach a copy of his recommendations (Annex 1),
              and paragraphs 4-6 below set out those recommendations of most
              interest to HSE and their implications.  The main purpose of
              this minute is to consider the extent of HSE's involvement.   The
              question of our role in football has implications for what we do
              in relation to other sports grounds and more generally to crowd
              safety.

              Background

              2. You may recall that HSE was consulted in July 1989 on the
              proposals for setting up the Football Licensing Authority (FLA).
              We prepared a draft letter for the Secretary of State to send to
              DoE, putting forward a case for the new body to be housed within
              HSE (copy attached Appendix 2).  It quickly became clear that
              the new, Non-Departmental Public Body favoured by DoE also had
              the support of the Prime Minister's Office, and that the
              proposal was that this body should combine responsibility for
              safety with oversight of the Football Membership Scheme.  Our
              initial bid was therefore abandoned in favour of a less bullish
              approach by Mr Fowler, who made the point that there would need
              to be some kind of relationship between the FLA and ourselves
              (copy attached Appendix 3).

              3.  In the event, Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989
              allocated the running of the proposed Football Membership Scheme
              to a new body corporate, the Football Membership Association
              (FMA), and the safety responsibilities, together with some
              functions in relation to features of the membership scheme which
              required to be incorporated in the licence, to a second body, a
              quango to be called the Football Licensing Authority, so that
              the grounds on which the decision was taken in the Department
              not to put H S E 1s original case rather disappeared but there was
              no opportunity to reopen the issue.     Part I of the Act has yet
              to be brought into operation, by the Secretary of State for the
              Environment (by means of a Statutory Instrument).

Taylor Recommendations

(a )   Safety Certificates

4.   The report recommends a review of safety certificates
provided by Local Authorities for sports grounds.  In addition
it specifically recommends that some of the terms of the
certificate should be compulsory rather than voluntary; that
certificates should be reviewed by the Local Authority at least
once annually; and that there should be a requirement that each
certificate should be renewed annually.  Insofar as a licensing
regime makes an effective contribution to safety at sports
grounds, which is perhaps questionable, we would support these
recommendations.

(b )   The Green Guide

5.   Lord Taylor expresses the view that the Green Guide - the
booklet outlining advice on safety at sports grounds - may not
be followed as closely as desirable.  He recommends that the
Home Office should, as a matter of urgency, set up a body to
revise the Guide. We will be in contact with the Home Office to
ensure that HSE is represented on any review body, both in a
technical and policy capacity.

(c )   The Football Licensing Authority (FLA)

6.  Lord Taylor recommends that, if Part I of the Football
Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 (which is the
power to review the discharge of functions by local authorities)
should be brought into force giving the FLA the functions and
powers specified in the Act (see para 7).

Developments since the publication of the second part of the
Taylor Report

7. We understand the Government has shelved the FMA but will
proceed with the establishment of the FLA.  The FLA itself is a
non Crown body corporate and will consist of a Chairman and
members.  It may appoint inspectors, and a secretary and other
officers.  The functions of the FLA would be:-

       (i)  to grant licences to admit spectators to football
       grounds.  The licence may contain any terms and conditions
       which the authority thinks appropriate as well as
       requirements relating to seating, or to the exclusion of
       particular spectators or groups of spectators; and

       (ii)  to keep under review the work of local authorities in
       discharging their safety certification duties under the
       Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

8.  The safety responsibilities envisaged for the FLA in the
1989 Act may eventually be more wide-ranging than that Act
originally proposed.  Taylor recommends that, because the
Football Spectators Act 1989 applies only to association




                               -   2   -
                                                 Reference




      football, the inspecting and reviewing role of the FLA should be
      extended to cover not only association football but all grounds
      designated under the Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975.

      9. We also understand from the Home Office that while
      responsibility for the Act has primarily lain with DoE, with the
      collapse of the membership scheme the likelihood is that the
      Home Office will take over responsibility for the FLA.  The Home
      Office have asked us about our role and while we have not
      reverted to the line taken last July, we think that transfer to
      HO would make it more likely, rather than less, that proposals
      for HSE to take a leading part in the FLA would be met with some
      sympathy.

      10. However some preparations have already been made for the
      establishment of the FLA in that the full time staff post - G5
      level - has been trawled within the Civil Service - though by
      the DoE.

      11.  It would be possible to revive a bid for HSE to run
      licensing without an FLA.  But this seems to me to be a non
      starter.  Ministers could hardly kill off the second body to be
      set up under the 1989 Act.  Therefore what in practice we are
      faced with is either offering to staff the body, or working out
      how we can best help with technical advice and assistance and
      drawing up lines of demarcation.

      12.  It is also relevant that the Taylor Report did not entirely
      rule out HSE undertaking the role of overseeing the work of
      Local Authorities who issue safety certificates and licences
      under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.  In para 157 he
      said that it had been suggested that HSE could monitor spectator
      safety under the HSWA.  He pointed out that its resources would
      need to be increased, and referred to HO evidence quoting HSC
      and HSE policy on the avoidance of overlap, and the arrangement
      between HSE and the HO that we would not enforce on grounds
      covered by the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 197 5. (The HO
      evidence had been agreed by us.)

      13.  If the HSC or HSE cannot replace the FLA we could service
      it, i.e. by providing the staff.  We have not gone into the
      legal mechanisms involved and recognise that there is no precise
      precedent^ for this kind of relationship.   But agency agreements
      can be made with, inter alia, public authorities.   Thus it is
      possible to envisage HSE staffing the body.   We understand that
      some resources have been allocated by DoE from 1990-1.

      14.   The case for this is:-

            (a)  It avoids a proliferation of safety inspectorates
            (though the FLA itself would be an additional overseeing
            body), which is a more important aim if the FLA's terms of
            reference are extended to other sports grounds.

            (b)  The HO recognise that they lack expertise.  HSE
            through Dr Nicholson has played a key part in the Taylor
            Inquiry.  The HO want advice on the revision of the Green



                                     -   3   -

                                         Reference.




    Guide.  The HO will tend to rely on ex police and fire
    officers which will be relevant up to a point, but could
    lead to the partial view evidently taken at Hillsborough.

    (c)  From April 1990 the LAs will be responsible for HSWA
    enforcement in these grounds i.e. S.2 responsibilities.   We
    through the LAU will have to advise on that.  The FLA will
    be supervising other LA activities, though it must be
    pointed out that only in the Metropolitan Authorities will
    the same LA licence football grounds because it is a
    county function, not a district.  But the counties (fire
    and trading standards) are represented on HELA.

    (d) We are being pressed to take a greater interest in
    crowd control - a key issue here - in other contexts,
    notably pop concerts where the HO is looking to us for at
    least extensive help in drawing up advice to local
    authorities (the districts this time) who issue
    entertainment licences to such events and who will as from
    1 April enforce HSWA at these events.  At present we have
    no demarcation agreement with HO on pop concerts; the issue
    of some guidance is probably a necessary precondition.

    (e) Moreover the recommendations in the Taylor report
    dealing with communications, coordination of emergency
    services, and First Aid facilities and ambulances, cover
    the general principles of crowd safety and could be applied
    much more widely to other leisure activities, but also to
    agricultural shows, funfairs, stock car racing,
    discotheques and clubs and religious events, and other
    public venues such as railway stations and shopping malls.
    Recommendation 16 suggests police officers and stewards
    should be fully briefed and trained in crowd dynamics,
    although it is unclear whether this training is available
    in the UK.  The principles behind such training would be of
    use to us when considering general guidance on crowd safety
    and we will be in touch with the Home Office about this.
    Crowd safety expertise i.e. crowd management, crowd flow
    and crowd welfare is not yet well developed, but it is
    clear that while H S E 's expertise may be limited it is not
    to be found elsewhere in Government.

Action in Hand

15.  Dr Derrick will be meeting the Home Office soon to discuss
pop concerts, when the question of who leads in the production
of guidance will be raised.  (The HO deferred the meeting to
enable them to see and digest the Taylor Report.)

16.  On sports grounds the DOE, HO, ED and ourselves are to meet
on 14 February.  We can consider what kind of assistance the FLA
will need e.g. with the revision of the Green Guide and get a
better feel for how far they would welcome our involvement in
the FLA.  But we would not wish to suggest anything on the lines
of paras 11-14 above unless there was a reasonable prospect of
at least HSE being prepared to press for it.
                                                        Reference.




              17.   It seems to me therefore that we need a steer on the basic
              issue of whether HSE, recognising that a bid for the FLA itself
              is not on, should adopt an active role by trying to secure that
              we do the work (suitably resourced) or merely adopt an advising
              role.   It would be helpful to discuss soon.

A dv isory D e s iu n C ounc il
  5. T h e Football Associ ation and the fo otbal l League should establish an Advisory Design Council whose
functions should be:

         (a) to conduct and m a rsh a l res earch into the improvement and design of football stadia:

         (b) to di ss em in ate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in this field to members of the
             fo otbal l League and. on request, to oth er football and sports clubs in hngland. Wales and Scotland.

    N a t io n a l In sp e cto ra te and Review Body
  6. (a) If Part 1 of th e Football S pec ta tors Act 19S9 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and [towers therein specified (power to r e v i e w the
discharge of functions by local au th oritie s). If Part I of the Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
other ar r an g e m en ts should be made for the disc harge of the functions and powers in section 13 of the Act by the
app oi ntment of a body to exercise them.

      (b)       In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
should also be entrust ed w i t h similar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local au th oritie s of their
certifying and licensing functions in relation t o other s p o r t s grounds and sports en terta in m e nts pur suan t to the
Safety of Sports G roun ds Act 1975 and Parts III and IV of the l ire Saletv and Safety of Places of Spo rt Act
1987.

    M a x i m u m C a p a c i t i e s for Terraces
  7. W h e r e a viewing te rr ac e is divided into pens or are as which arc self-contained, the Safety Certificate
should specify the m a x im u m n um be r of specta tors to be admitt ed to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed "se lf -c on ta in ed " no tw ithsta nd in g that it has a gate or gates affording access to
an o t h e r pen or area and w h eth er such gate or gates be open or shut.

       8. Eac h figure for m a x im u m capacity should be assessed in accordance with C h a p te r 16 of the G re en Guide
    ("t he G re en Guide figure") subject to the follow ing qualifications:-

         (a)   th e m a x im u m density perm itte d unde r p a r a g ra p h s 221 and 222 of the G re en Guide (w hen the terr ace
               or viewing slope is in good condition) should he 47 not 54:
    (b) the m in im um figure specified in p a r a g ra p h s 221 and 222 (when the te rrace or viewing slope materially
        deviates from the rec o m m en d ed guidelines, so a s to constitute a possible ha zar d to individuals closely
        pac ked) should be 0 not 27:

    (c) in arriving at " th e G re e n Guide figure", proper and realistic allowance must be ma de for all factors
        which should reduce the perm is sible density including those specified in p a r a g r a p h s 220 to 224
        inclusive of th e G re en Guide.

  9. A rr a n g e m e n ts should be m a d e :-

    (a) to limit the num ber of spectators en te ring each self-contained pen or ar e a to the m a x im u m capacity
        figure asse ss ed in ac co rdan ce with R eco m men datio n 8 above ei ther electronically, mechanically, by a
        ticket ing arr a n g e m e n t , by counting or otherwise, and

    (b) to close off fu rth er acce ss to such pen or are a when its m a x im u m capacity is about to be reached.

   10. T h e m a x im u m notional rate at which spe ctator s can pass thr oug h a turn stile should be 660 persons per
hour, not 750 per hour as sta te d in p a r a g ra p h 47 of the G re en Guide. T h e m a x im u m rate for any par ticular
tur nstile m ust tak e full account of all cir cum stanc es including those given as e x a m p le s in p a r a g r a p h 47.


F illin g and M o n i t o r i n g Terraces
   11. T h e r e should be a writte n s ta te m en t of intent, agreed between the club and th e police, setting out their
respective functions as to c r o u d safety and control and iu particula r as to the filling of each self-contained pen or
o th e r sta n din g area an d the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or are a to avoid overcrowding. Any
variation of the document in respect of an individual m a tc h should be agreed in writing in advance.

    12. (a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or oth e r sta nding
are a (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
monitoring it) whose sole duty is to che ck crowd conditions in that are a for possible overcrowding or dist ress
th r ou ghou t the period the a r e a is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
oth er stewar d or police presence. He should have ready access to a police officer who can au th orise access
thr ough gates to the pitch u n d e r R e co m men da tio n 20 below.

        (b)        T h i s Reco m men datio n need not be applied to any self-contained pen or oth er sta nd in g area where the
spectator s present, or re asonab ly to be expected, d uring a particular match do not exceed one third of the area s

THE TAYLOR REPORT


1.   I attach a draft minute for you to send to other members
of the Executive. As I explained, the more we thought"about
the report and its implications and its connections with pop
concerts etc., the murkier things became. The draft is
intended, therefore, more as a basis for discussion rather
than a final product.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER: FINAL REPORT: INQUIRY BY THE RT
HON LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR


1.   As you know the final report of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry
into the Hillsborough Stadium disaster was published on Monday.   I
thought it would be helpful if I let you have a copy of his recom­
mendations, together with a synopsis of those parts of the report
of most interest to HSE and their implications.


Football Licensing Authority

2.   The first point worth noting in the report is Lord Taylor's
reply to suggestions that the HSE, not the Football Licensing
Authority, should be responsible for overseeing the work of Local
Authorities who issue safety certificates and licences under the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975. Although Justice Taylor does
not rule out HSE taking on this role (he points out that our
resources would need to be increased to fulfil this function) the
implication in the report is that the work should go to the FLA.
(The specific recommendation is number 6 in Appendix 1).

3.   You may recall that HSE was consulted in July on the propo­
sals for setting up the Football Licensing Authority (FLA). We
prepared a draft letter for the Secretary of State to send to DoE,
putting forward a case for the new body to be housed within HSE

                                1
 (copy attached Appendix 2) . It quickly became clear that the new,
Non-Departmental Public Body favoured by DoE also had the support
of the Prime Minister's Office, and that the proposal was that
this body should combine responsibility for safety with oversight
of the Football Membership Scheme. Our initial bid was therefore
abandoned in favour of a less bullish approach by Mr Fowler, who
made the point that there would need to be some kind of relation­
ship between the FLA and ourselves (copy attached Appendix 3).

4.   In the event, Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989
allocated the proposed Football Membership Scheme to a new body
corporate, the Football Membership Association (FMA), and’ the
safety responsibilities to a second body, a quango to be called
the Football Licensing Authority.  Part I of the Act has yet to be
brought into operation, by the Secretary of State for the Environ­
ment (by means of a Statutory Instrument). However, we understand
that plans are already in hand for recruiting staff for the FLA
(the Grade 5 post to head the FLA has been advertised at least
within the Civil Service by the DOE), even though the FMA and the
football membership scheme has been "put on the back burner".

5.   The safety responsibilities envisaged for the FLA in the 1989
Act may eventually be more wide-ranging than that Act originally
proposed.  Taylor recommends that, because the Football Spectators
Act 1989 applies only to association football, the inspecting and
reviewing role of the FLA should be extended to cover not only
association football but all grounds designated under the Safety
at Sports Grounds Act 1975.

6.    He also states that, "Should Part I of the 1989 Act either
not be implemented or be substantially delayed, the same functions
should be given to another suitably constituted body to cover all
sports grounds".   Given that the FLA has yet to be formally con­
stituted, you might wish to consider whether we should restate our
case for the Authority to be housed in HSE. The arguments we put
forward in Appendix 2 are still valid but, with the introduction
of the revised Enforcing Authority Regulations in April, the LAs,
not HSE, will be responsible for enforcing the HSW Act in sports
grounds. This development could strengthen our case. Any new
authority would have to introduce new administrative machinery to
ensure uniformity and consistency nationwide.   The existing HELA
machinery - which already includes representatives from LAs and
the fire service, but not the police -could take this task on
board.




                                2
7.   Our case is slightly undermined by the fact that we have
already formally handed over responsibility for enforcing specta­
tor safety in most grounds, by concluding a demarcation agreement
with the Home Office. Lord Taylor refers to, and quotes from,
this demarcation agreement. He makes the point that we are pri­
marily concerned with the safety of employees pursuant to the
HSWA, and as a result, we have not generally extended our surveil­
lance to include football spectators. He concludes with reference
to the Home Office evidence, endorsed by us, on the overlap be­
tween our legislation and their's on spectator safety.  If the FLA
are given the task of overseeing safety we will need to negotiate
a demarcation agreement with them.


Safety Certificates

8.   The report recommends a review of safety certificates pro­
vided by Local Authorities for sports grounds.  In addition it
specifically recommends that some of the terms of the certificate
should be compulsory rather than voluntary; that certificates
should be reviewed by the Local Authority at least once annually;
and that there should be a requirement that each certificate
should be renewed annually.  In so far as a licensing regime makes
an effective contribution to safety at sports grounds, which is
perhaps questionable, we would support these recommendations.

The Green Guide

9.   Lord Taylor expresses the view that the Green Guide - the
booklet outlining advice on safety at sports grounds - may not be
followed as closely as desirable. He recommends that the Home
Office should, as a matter of urgency, set up a body to revise the
Guide. We will be in contact with the Home Office to ensure that
HSE is represented on any review body, both in a technical and
policy capacity.


WIDER IMPLICATIONS

10. The situation vis-a-vis HSE and sports grounds is analogous
to that of HSE and pop concerts, which the Executive discussed
last December.  Sports Grounds are certificated and pop concerts
licensed by the local authorities (and indeed where, as at Wembley
Stadium, pop concerts are held in sports grounds both licensing
and certification systems can be applied). The main difference
between the two situations is that HSE has a demarcation agreement

                                3
                                                                     1




with the Home Office not to inspect for spectator safety at sports
grounds covered by the relevant H.O. legislation, but has no
demarcation agreement on pop concerts covered by other H.O.
legislation.



11.   The recommendations in the Taylor report dealing with
communications, coordination of emergency services, and First Aid
facilities and ambulances cover the general principles of crowd
safety. They could be applied to other leisure activities, not
only to pop concerts but also to agricultural shows, funfairs,
stock car racing, discotheques and clubs and religious events, and
other public venues such as railway stations and shopping malls.
Recommendation 16 suggests police officers and stewards should be
fully briefed and trained in crowd dynamics, although it is
unclear whether this training is available in the UK. The
principles behind such training would be of use to us when
considering general guidance on crowd safety and we will be in
touch with the Home Office about this. We believe that the lead
on crowd safety expertise ie crowd management, crowd flow and
crowd welfare lies with us, not the Home Office.

ACTION

12   I am setting up a meeting with the Home Office to discuss the
Taylor report and pop concerts.  On the latter, where we (and,
from April, the local authorities) have a clear responsibility to
enforce the HSW Act for the work activity, the Home Office would
appear to welcome our initiative for guidance, would provide
active co-operation and would consider endorsing joint guidelines
for HSW Act and licensing purposes. On sports grounds I hope to
sound out Home Office views on the Football Licensing Authority
and how far they would welcome our involvement. The question^ is,
as I have indicated, whether, if the omens see right, we should
press our case to incorporate the FLA (or something like it)
within HSE. We would also have to sound out the DoE. Partly, I
suspect, we will have to play it by ear - there will be no point
in pursuing this if the option is a non-starter.  I would be
grateful for any initial views you may have on our approach.
Perhaps I should add that this minute gives a simplified version
of the position;  It does not touch on the complexities of the
relevant pieces of legislation nor which tier in the local
authority does what.
Prosecution

14. The West Midlands Police Force is considering taking a pros­
ecution in the light of their investigation into the Hillsborough
tragedy, and will  be involving us in any discussions arising. We
may also be asked   to give technical evidence.  I will of course
keep you informed   of developments on this front.

Dear Ms Adlington

RE: ADLINGTON v. DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

Further to our telephone conversation of yesterday, I can confirm that the Crown
Prosecution Service is now ready to give voluntary disclosure of relevant documents
in our possession having considered representations from the South Yorkshire police.

This disclosure will be in accordance with the procedure noted in our letter of 31
December 1998 to you and which was copied to the solicitors for both defendants. It
will be evenhanded as between the parties and will not include documents subject to
legal privilege or public interest immunity.

We'consider that it would be right and proper to make a charge for this voluntary
disclosure based on the cost price of the service provided to this office by our
photocopying contractor. This would be a charge of 1.9 pence per page. However,
we have decided that the first £50 of charges to any party will be paid by us . A bill
for the remaining amount, if any, will be sent direct to that party from the contractor,
Alphagraphics.

I note your request in the last paragraph of your letter of 5 January 1999. I regret that
I am unable to advise the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire on any matter unless a
formal request has been made by him or those acting for him. That is not the case
here.

Please contact me to arrange a date and time for your inspection of our documents at
this office. I understand that Monday 11 January 1999 may be suitable to you.

Yours sincerely


George R Croston
Prosecution Team Leader

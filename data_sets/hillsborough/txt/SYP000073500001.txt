delayed by traffic jams about 20 minutes when we got off the motorway.

We had intended to start out much ear 1ier at about       10.00am but my

brother was late .

J. was wearing on the day of the match        lark brown and white roll neck

jumper over a pale tee shirt.       I was/wearing jeans and trainers. We

were    pushed for time so we di<d*r*l have any time to stop for any

reason.

We arrived in Sheffield at about 2.35pm and I think we parked in

Fereday Street, Sheffield.

We f o 1lowed the crowds to the Leppings Lane end of Hi 1lsborough

stadium.

As we walked down towards the stadium I heard people shouting for

spare tickets. That was by the t raff i c lights    in Leppings L a n e .

I d o n ’t recal1 seeing anyone drinking on the way to the ground.

It was a nice hot day so I bought 5 cans of coke from a shop for the

lads.               /

We arrived at jme ground at about £ . 4 0 pro the scene outside the stadium

was in cViao^f The re were thousands of supporters still outside

the ground.

               and his br other went off towards A turnstile because they

had tickets for the North stand.

As I approached the outer gates to the terrace turnstiles. I saw that

one of the two gates on the extreme right was closed. There was a

Police horse on the road and an officer on foot with a PoIicewoman in

the road as well.

We made our through the open outer gate and into the crush at the

turnstiles.

We made our way to the right and eventually got to a blue handrail we

were    crushed against the handrail.

We were    in the crush for about    10 minutes before we got to the
                                                                           PAGE

handra i1.

We were crushed against the handrail for about 3 or 4 minutes. We were

about 30*       from the turnstiles. People were walking    past us on our

right down the private road. We thought that they were going to the

s ta n d s .

A Police Officer on a horse told us to duck under the handrail and go

round as we would be able to get in their.

We had to push people away from us to duck under the rail. Once we

were under we walked freely tj) the side of the turnstile.

We then saw an open gate/which supporters were walking through. I
               T-                 ..... ■" '                  "
initially thought tha^f we would then find more turnstiles but I now

know that it was          exit g a t e .

We walked through the gate at just before 3 O'clock. There were a lot

of supporters walking through and towards a tunnel.

I d i d n ’t see any signs directing me else where so we walked into the

funnel.        It was a good natured atmosphere and we were singing as we

went down the tunnel.

We emerged still together         into daylight and asiwe had walked down the

left side of the tunnel w e emerged ipto p^n 4.         It w a s n ’t until after

the disaster that I realised that               was a fence running down the

middle of the pens.

I took up my first match viewing position quite easily.            It was crowded

but you could get through / i         could see that the players were on the

pitch and they kicked             just as we got into the pe n.

I took up my posi/,ij<m at a point M2 on a grid shown to me by the

Police.

Within seconds we started to get pushed forward as the pressure

increased. We started to lose                        in the crowd I grabbed him

back once. He is only small and thin so we held each others jumpers.

We were slowly forced apart and we lost

We moved forward in the crush I had had a cigarette            in my hand and I

lifted both arms up and I co uldn’t put my arms back down the crush was

so bad.    I could hardly breath. My brother was still fairly close.                 It

was so hot I was sweating         profusely.

Eventually I came up against a crush barrier.            I was actually crushed

against a man who was bent double over the crush barrier. My brother

was at the side of me.         I tried to push back and I tried to pull the

man off the b a r r i e r   by ho 1ding him round the waist. I co ul dn’t get him

up because the people         in front of the barriers were crushed back

against him.

Eventually the man in front of the barrier realised what I was trying

to do and tried to shoulder him up because he co uldn’t turn round.

I was trying to get him up for two or three minutes,            it seemed longer.

I recall the match was still going on when I eventually got him

upright.

The man was wearing a red Tee Shirt which had been pulled up over his

head his left arm was behind his head.

I pulled the tee shirt down (It may have been a Liverpool              strip).       I

then realised that the man had been bent over backwards over the

barrier as h& came up facing me, his back must have been broken.                 I        |

could see straight away that he was d e a d . His face was bluey red and

his lips were purple.

I seem to recall that he was about middle 4Q's            in age,   he had receding

jalonde hair and blonde moustache. He was wearing e ither jeans or grey

trousers.

When I had stood him upright this man was dead in the crowd standing

up and I was able to leave him.         I shouted to my brother that the man

was dead and my brother told me there was nothing more I could do and

to come over to him. At this stage I was crushed against the same

fear r i e r it was about    in the middle of the pen.    I shouted to the Police
                                                                           PAGE      5

on the track round the pitch that there was a dead man in the pen and

for them to let us out. The police were shouting to us to move back

but we couldn't. By this time the game been s t op pe d.

My brother managed to pull me to the right through the crowd and off

the barrier. As 1 cleared the side of the barrier           I caught the end of

it with my l e f t U ^ P -    This caused me sonfe slight bruising.   I could see

people climbing the perimeter fence,

At about this time I saw a young l/d pressed over the perimeter fence.

He was wearing grey tracksuit Nfcu»atoms. He had obviously passed out and

the Police    couldn't get him off the top of the fence because his

trousers had hooked onto the spikes on top of the fence.

I lost my brother again as I was pushed forward.

I was trying to make my way to the right to the gate.           I could feel

people under foot.       I know 1 was treading on bodies but I couldn't do

anything about it.

I was trying to get to the gate and my brother           called to me that he

had found a barrier.

He pulled me over to him.          It was then that I realised that there was a

fence dividing the terracing behind the goal.

We stood in front of the barrier for about           10 - 15 minutes.   Eventually

the pressure eased,          there were a lot of people on the pitch.

We managed to make our way back up the terraciwg and into the tunnel.

As we walked out there were police and supporters           carrying people out

who were    collapsed.

When we got to the back of the West f y A n d there were 1 or 2 bodies

with their heads covered.

We couldn't find                        and were very concerned for his safety.

We searched the crowd and looked at the bodies as they were brought

out. We couldn't find him so when the people had left we went back

4_own the tunnel and spoke to a number of Police officers.            They advised

         us to go round to the incident room.

         We saw him outside the ground a few minutes      later and he was alright.

         He had apparently got over the perimeter fence and into the North

         Stand.

         We eventually j.eft the area of the stadium at ab o u t,. 4.45 we got into

         the car and drove around trying to find phone boxes but we couldn't

         get through to home.

         I eventually got home at 8.30pm my injury         of a minor nature and I

         didn't need treatment.

         My brother rung me the following dav^Tnd told me that the dead man I

         I recall on the way to the Police Incident room I saw a tuck shop

         which had had the door kicked in and it looked like some goods had

         been stolen.

         I handed in my whole ticket at Anfield for a refund,

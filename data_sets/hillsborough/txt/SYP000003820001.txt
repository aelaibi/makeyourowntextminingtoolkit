            I    live     at      the a b o v e    address          w i t h m y wife.           I have       been       h er e    fo r 4 5

            years.          I do        not   support         any    football           team.

            On    Saturday,             15th April,           1989     (150489?          at    about    11am       ( 1 100),       I left

            my    house         and walked         up    to    the     shops       in M i d d l e     Mood R o ad        between

            H a d s l e y Lane          and R o c k l e y Road.            I went        past    about       four       groups         of

            footall         supporters            outside       these       shops.            There    was    about        four        or   five

            supporters             in e a c h g r o u p .       A ll     these         supporters       were       drnking         either

           .canned        beer      or    canned        lager.         Most       of    them    had    packs       of    f ou r    cans.

            The        supporters         were    walking           about     drinking          from    the    cans.

            I can        n ot    say which         team       these      supporters            followed.           The     fans        were

            not        drunk.

            I passsed             the    same     supporters           on my way          home      from     the    shops         at    14-. 3 0 a m

            (1130)        and      they were         in t h e       same    place        drinking       fro m ther           cans.

             At 2 . 5 0 p m    <1450?       same    date     1 was      standing       at     the   e n d of m y       road at       the

             Junction         with Lappings          Lane.         I had      taken a       c u p of     tea     up to    the

             police     officers           on d u t y at     the    barrier      at    this     location.            I looked

             across     at     the    entrance       to S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y    ground         in L e p p i ng s

             Lane.      There        was    thousands        of    supporters         outside       the       ground     trying      to

             aetin.

             I have     seen     the       crowd    s i t u a t i o n at   these      gates     at al l        the    semi     final

             matches        since     1980 an d      I have        never      seen    so m a n y    supporters           at    these

             gates     trying        to ge t      in a t    such a      late    time.         It w a s    packed       tight      with

             people     b ut    I was       too    far     away    to   see    th e   behaviour          of    individuals.

HILLSBOROUGH SCRUTINY

I am writing to ask your consent to the release of material considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith in
his scrutiny of evidence about the Hillsborough Disaster.

When the Home Secretary announced the outcome of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s scrutiny of
evidence, he undertook to release as much of the material considered in the course of the scrutiny as
possible, by placing copies in the House of Commons Library.

I am aware that when you met Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, he indicated that the discussion was in
confidence and that he would seek your permission before disclosing any of it in his report.

I would be grateful, though, if you would let me know whether you would be content for the record
of the meeting (copy enclosed) to be released. If there are any objections, it would be helpful if you
could let me know what they are so that we may advise the Home Secretary accordingly.

                                            Yours sincerely

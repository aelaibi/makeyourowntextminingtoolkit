                 YORKSHIRE/POLICE.

                 At 0800 am on Saturday                 IS April       1989 <150489)               I commenced duty at

                 Football       ground, Sheffield.

                 At 0930 am I paraded at Hillsborough    Football ground for the prematch
                                               "T

                 command of PPL FS9&9 HOpfcKINSON and Insp CHARLES /s Serial Commander.

                 Following the briefing I was deployed with my serial                                        to supervise the

                 parking and gff loading of the Nottingham                                  r/zt     Football Supporters

                 at the Bus Depot y/4r ds on Herries Rd, l Hi 1 lsj/orough.                                  These supporters

                 were then directsrd along Herries Rd to joyn Penistone Rd adjacent to
                                                                                   PAGE       2
                                                                                   S2742

the entry gates at the Spion Kop end of Hillsborough Football Club.

At approximately ,3 pm (1500) foil owi ng the di s pe rsaj^'of the last coach

load of Nottingham Forest Supporters my serial jfXarted to make our way

to Claywheels Ln for part         three of the ordaf in which we were to              be

on *S t a n b y * at Claywheels   Ln.   S h o r t l y t e r entering C l a y w h ee 1s Ln

junction off Penistone R d , we were jrflrected by Inspector CHARLES to

attend at the Leppings Ln turnsjAles and at this time I was unaware of

for what    reason.   Together w/th perhaps a further five Serials we

formed up on Leppings Ln/ n ear to Vere Rd to await further                 instructions.

A short time later we/were directed to the Leppings Ln turnstiles and

on our arrival a jrordon had been formed across them by other officers.

 A large number of      ’supp o r t e r s ’ were milling and pushing about and

they generally were      in a aggressive mood although at this time                I was

still   totally unaware of the reasons for them acting as they were,

apart from the fact that some were         in drink and that although the

match had started they were still         outside the ground.

My serial   eventually and hurridly e ntered the groujxf via Garte * C * on

Leppings Ln after some difficulty in getting t h o u g h             the surging

supporters.     On reaching the exit tunnel         to/the    centre of the West

Stand I saw people trying         to exit the tuiynel from the direction              of

the playing area.      People     were being    carried shoulder height and           being

laid on the area between the tunnel and gate               "C*.    It was   immediately

obvious at this time that some of the persons being

carried were dead and lots of groups of people were attempting the

kiss of life on them.       They were then taking people who were obviously

breathing without help away from the tunnel area to allow more                     persons

to be taken out and revived.        This was being done with great

difficulty as people       were still    crowding towards the tunnel            entrance.

 At this time a lot of them also became aware of the fact that                     *dead *

people were being removed from the ground,             and a deal of abuse was
                                                                                       PAGE     3
                                                                                       S2742

then directed at us the Police for a . l l ^ n f f n q        it to happen.     I assisted

in the removal of people to A m b u ^ m c e s which were               coming to gate    *C *

and also   in stopping supporj^rs from trying to have a go at other

officers who were k n e j ^ o n    the ground giving the kiss of life.

Fortunately for e y tfr y     idiot who wanted to interfere there were others

who pulled th^tfi away to allow the life saving to carry on.                      The mood

of a lot of the     'fans' was very anti          police.

I remained at this          area moving casualties and bodies until             such    time

as I could then go          through the t u n n e l , through the playing area gate

via pen three and           o the pitch.       At this time I was still unaware of

the full magneVdde of the problem but was aware that perhaps twelve or

so bodies Yy&A been taken out of the ground via the tunnel                     in the West

Stand anjf gate    'C * .

Following the exit of the crowds from the ground/1 was                      involved with

security at gate      'C* to prevent      reporters efre from e n t e r i n g .

Throughout the day I was         carrying my pej^op^l           issue radio and I was

unaware of any breakdown m          ra’B j f o ' ^ m i s s i o n s .   When I first entered

the ground at Leppings Ln and saW'the               people trying to enter/leave the

tunne1 area I was unaware of a/y Stewards                 in the ground although some

were evident later          on once ifhe main confusion had cleared.

I eventual ly finishing wo*r k at        7.30 pm (1930) when I was            released from

stand by duty at ClaywWee Is Ln.

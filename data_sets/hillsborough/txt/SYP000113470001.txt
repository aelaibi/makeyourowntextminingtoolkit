          the officers move           to prevent          this a c t i v i t y and thought            it proper

          The    climbing       from the        standing       to the       sealing area       ceased apart          from

saw that       the fans were             just    sitting       on the     pitch and were                 not moving

towards       other    enclosures.              Other       fans were     scaling             the    perirnter

fencing and dropping                onto       the    perimeter        track..

Members       of the     public around me who were                      less       than       "IOQ yards       from the

 incident      interpreted          this as a pitch              invasion and there were many

 calls for strong            police action to get                 the fans          back       into     the

enclosures.           The man sitting                beside me suggested                 putting        police     dogs

 into   the enclosure.              Beca u s e       the    police     officers were not                 just

a l l owing    but ass i s t i n g       the fans over           the    fence and out                of the

emergency gates            I realised that                 this was     not a pitch                invasion and was

d e finitely a matter            for      concern.

 I recall      that    the    football          players and officials                    continued the game

for an      inordinate        period after             I had     realised the              need for        the game

to be halted.            Fans were actua l l y               sitting     on the          pitch.         The    football

m atch was not helping                  the    officers attempts              to deal          with     the

s ituation        because     there were             cheers and surges and the a t t en t i o n was

         the     boy.         They        worked        with       a    member          of       the     public          to    resuscitate                  th e

         bay     for       some     time        and     appeared             to    have          been     successful                as       the     crowd

         which        had     gathered            round       turned             towards          the     stand          and     cheered.

          It    seemed        to    be       a    long       time       until         the s i n g l e S t . J o h n ' s              Ambulance

          chaotic          a l t h o u g h - there- w e r e            more       than       enough           police          officers              who     were

         doing        everything             they        possibly            could          to    deal        with       the     situation.

          1 thought           that,          as      there      were         so     many police officers                         on      the        pitch

         there        may     be    a      lack        of    control             a r o u n d the         back       of    the s t a n d         so,        at

         at     the    South        West         corner,        immediately                  behind           the     police            control

          tower.           There        were      other       police             officers           there?          none       of       whom        had     radios



        \ I    imagined           that     all       the     injured             would       have        been       brought             onto        t he

          just    the        spot       where        I considered                 the       ambulances              may       park       and        i wasted

          an    awful        lot     of    time        getting          the       landrover              moved        ■•••• t h e r e    were        nto k e y s

          his    jacket           pocket        walked        up       to    the     young          steward           who      was       wearing            nis

When       I next    looked around           there were       two    casualties at this                 point.

One male about 6 feet                 tall    and heavily         built,     SS--30 years,             laying on

a metal       stretcher.          He was      very o b v iously dead,,              I helped a

po I i cewoman and a rnernher of S t , J ohn ’s A m hulance                         i n the i ra11 empt s t o

revive him but was               struck at that         time fay the futility                of the

operation.           The O t h e r    casualty was        very much alive,              holding        his arm.

A n a rnb u 1a n c e arrive d a n d a f ter a 11 e rnp t i.n g resusc i t a t i o n f or a few

seconds       on the       deceased man the a m bulance                  crew s u g gested        putting         him

in the ambulance,               I helped them to do that and then told the group of

4-5 PC's at this             point     that    1 wa n t e d one      of them to a c c o m p a n y the

who    I ’m sure,         was wearing        the uniform-of          South Y o rkshire Police                 said

‘'I'll     go,     I know his        family.'’       I was amazed at this               comment        but    had

not time to follow               it up.

The    other      sligh t l y    injured       man got     into     the     same     amb u l a n c e   and the

ambulance          left.     There was         nothing.to        do at this        point     so   I

i ns-1 r uct ed t he PC *s to kee p the ar ea c I ear                     f o r ambu 1ances and wa 1 ked

along      the    service       road towards Leppings Lane                  to ensure        unre s t r i c t e d

a ccess for         the    e m e rgency services        w hich      I expected to arrive.

As    I turned a corner              of the service         road walking            towards L e p pings

Lane       I was met       by the     full    tragedy     of the         situation.        There were a

row of a mbulances              at this      point    beside     the      perimeter wall          of the

stadium,          numerous      people were       receiving medical                attention.          But at

least ten male             bodies were        laid out      in a t t e m p t e d    recovery       position

along       the    fence    beside     the     river and       no one;was      paying        them any

att e n t i o n whatsoever,           they     were   ob v i o u s l y   dead. Their         skin had         a

m o t t l e d blue    pallor and their            limbs were         completely         I imp.

There were          literally        dozens,    if not a hundred or more,                     police

officers at this             point     under ,the      control       of Chief        Inspector Purdy.                   1

in this situation.                 I continued to the end of the service                         road and

there e ncouraged           several         supporters who were            trying    to walk        down the

service       road that       they    could not         do so until        the e m e rgency      services

had departed.             1 a r ra n g ed a g r o up of       police     of f i cers,    w ho were        no t

engaged with anything,                into a cordon across               the m outh of the

j unction.

1 now found myself               outside      the    cordon and had felt of              little        use

i n's i d e , I decided       to    leave     the stadium         to telephone my wife              to

reassure       her that       I was    uninjured.           The    telephones       in L e p p i n g s Lane

were,       not unexpectedly,          full and had queues of                  people    outside.

As    1 w a 1k ed aIong Leppi n g s La n e the r e we re groups                   of L i v e r p o o 1

supporters        standing         around and        they a p p e a r e d very aggressive.               A

police       car was      driving     up and clown L e p pings Lane,              asking       via the P. A.

system,       for fans      to     clear     the way for ambulances.                i saw more           than

one suppo r te r k i ck out at the                  s 1 ow 1y pat ro 11 i ng    car .     i returned to

my    car    parked at the junction                 of C l a y w h e e l s Lane with N i a g a r a Road.

I decided that            1 w ould drive        to H a m m e r t o n Road,      telephone my wife

from there and assist                in any way         I could at the          police     station.
                                                                                           \

I arri v e d at the          police1 station to find               it much      calmer and. well

staffed than         I had anticipated.                 I tele p h o n e d home.        After     a short

t im e t h e t a 1 k w a s o f r e 1a t i v e s a n ci f r i e n cis b e i n g r e c e iv e d a t

H a m me r t o n Road.       I decided that           this was an area           in w hich       I could

o f f er u s e f u l .ass i s t a n c e .                                                  :      . .

T ogether with other               officers,        notably DC I Agar,          I helped       to transform

the    'new'    CID office at H a m m e r t o n Road              into a relative          reception area.

tn the early evening                friends and         relatives        began a r r iving at

H a m m e r t o n Road,    I don't      know how they nad got there                     or who    had

decided upon H a m m e r t o n Road as the                 point    of    reception.,          It quickly

became a p p a r e n t     that we w ould need a larger area for                         them to gather

and wait.         The H i l l s b o r o u g h Soys Club Hall             was   suggested?        the

As     a    postscript          to    this        report       about       the      incident,        I am    reminded          of

an     earlier          visit      to H i l l s b o r o u g h       Football         Stadium     in m y y o u t h        when

there         was a v e r y        large         crowd.

The match was a first                        division          league         game    between S h e f f i e l d

W e d n e s d a y and M a n c h e s t e r City.                  It was        the    last game        o f ■the season

L a ne .       I arrived           with      a friend          in g o o d      time    and     took    up my       position

on     the     terracing           behind         the goal          but,      before     the    start       of the       game,
                                                                                                                              R274

much     of    the      pitch,       but       it was       a very       uncomfortable               situation.               There

was     no    rpom      to m o v e       and     I r e m e m b e r , at       one 'time,         being      squased

energies           to   prevent          injury       and    quickly          became       totally         unconcerned

about        the    game,       I dreaded any                goals       or    near       misses      as    this       was

followed           by a s u r g e        of. p e o p l e    which       caused       me    to    be. s q u a s h e d

"PORT
Chief Inspector Norman George BETTISON
Force Headquarters, South Yorkshire Police



I am a Chief Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police and work at Force
Headquarters, Sheffield.  From time to time I attend a football match as a
spectator.  I had few commitments during the weekend of 15-16th April and so
obtained a ticket for the F.A. Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and
Nottingham Forest.

My ticket was for seat NN 28 in the South Stand uncovered enclosure.  (The
seats number 1 - 230 from West to East, my seat was therefore relatively
close to the Leppings Lane enclosure on the 13th row from the front).

The day was fine and sunny, I left the city centre about 1.20 pm in my car to
travel to the ground.  I drove from Bridge Street out of the city via
Westbar, Gibraltar Street and Langsett Road.  I had allowed for heavy traffic
but was surprised that there was very little problem until the usual
bottleneck at Hillsborough corner traffic lights.   I travelled through the
junction towards Hillsborough Football Stadium.   There were no hinderances as
I travelled down Leppings Lane onto Penistone Road and left into Claywheels
Lane.

I parked my car in Claywheels Lane, and walked towards Hillsborough Stadium.
The time would be about 1.45 pm.

Many people were milling around, but there were no large crowds as I made my
way to the Penistone Road roundabout and along Leppings Lane.

All the   way along my journey I was continually asked for 'spare' tickets and
'swaps'   by young male Liverpool supporters.  I politely answered the first
few but   the number of enquirers became so overwhelming that I simply walked
past or   shook my head.

My ticket was green in colour and showed admission by a South Stand gangway
closest to the South West corner of the stadium.  I consulted the schematic
map on the rear and the natural route appeared to be via Leppings Lane and a
service road which leads to the South Stand.  The ticket bore no mention of
colour coding - I assumed until a long time after the event that all tickets
were green.

I saw no reference to colour coded direction boards.  Furthermore, I reached
the South Stand service road and found the way barred by a serial of
officers, under the command of Inspector Harvey, ensuring the proper
segregation of fans.  I was allowed to pass through but an awful lot of
supporters were invited to walk round the block and enter the South Stand
from Penistone Road.  The point of relating this is to indicate that the
information provided on the ticket itself could have been much more
comprehensive and the direction boards more prominently displayed.
                                                                                £   lif -




I took up my seat and saw from the electronic clock behind me that the time
was 1.54 pm.   The ground was very sparsely populated. There was, however, a
quite densely packed area in the two centre enclosures behind the Leppings
Lane end goal.

I bought and read a match programme as I waited for the game to begin.   I
remember at one stage, looking across to the West Stand terraces and seeing
the supporters patting a multi-coloured beachball around the centre
enclosure.  The significance of this is that the crowd were not so tightly
packed as they were able to raise their arms and bounce the ball around.

The two teams came onto the pitch for a warm-up session. I don't remember the
time precisely but remember that it was early, perhaps 2.30 pm or 2,35 pm.
When the teams left the pitch I remember that the ground seemed more full.

About 2.45 pm, I can't remember precisely, I saw several fans from the centre
enclosures scaling the wall and climbing into the seating enclosure.  I
interpreted this as mischievous rather than arising because of overcrowding.
I saw about four or five police officers, one an Inspector standing in the
aisles of the seating enclosure close by the front of the stand.  I was not
surprised to see the officers move to prevent this activity and thought it
proper that officers should eject those who had managed to climb into the
stand.  I saw the Inspector, I was unable to identify him, take hold of one
such supporter near to the second aisle from the left as I looked at the
stand.  He escorted the young man up the aisle and out of the stand.  The
climbing from the standing to the seating area ceased apart from a very
occasional person.

There appeared to be sufficient officers on the perimeter track around the
gro und.

The two teams returned to the pitch at about 2.55 pm and I considered it
unlikely that the game would be able to start at 3.00 pm however the
preliminaries were curtailed and the teams were in position to kick-off
around that time or a minute afterwards.  The crowd in the South Stand were
all standing, I sat down before many around me and thereby did not see the
kick-off.  As people began to sit down there was a cheer from the crowd and
my attention was drawn to the 'players tunnel'.  I guessed that the
Nottingham Forest manager was taking his seat but could not see the subject
of this interest.

I saw very little football played because, seconds afterwards, my attention
was drawn to fans being allowed out of the Leppings Lane enclosure and onto
the pitch.  I immediately assumed that the centre enclosure had become
overcrowded and that the police there were transferring fans to another
enclosure.  I became concerned when I saw that the fans were just sitting on
the pitch and were not moving towards other enclosures.  Other fans were
scaling the perimeter fencing and dropping onto the perimeter track.
Members of the public around me who were less than 100 yards from the
incident interpreted this as a pitch invasion and there were many calls for
strong police action to get the fans back into the enclosures.  The man
sitting beside me suggested putting police dogs into the enclosure.   Because
the police officers were not just allowing but assisting the fans over the
fence and out of the emergency gates I realised that this was not a pitch
invasion and was definitely a matter for concern.

I recall that the football players and officials continued the game for an
inordinate period after I had realised the need for the game to be halted.
Fans were actually sitting on the pitch.  The football match was not helping
the officers attempts to deal with the situation because there were cheers
and surges and the attention was drawn away from the matter at hand.

I saw Superintendent Murray come from the direction of the police control
room and go to the perimeter track.  He went to the area behind Leppings Lane
goal and then walked very quickly, almost ran, to the linesman in front of
the South Stand.  He clearly wanted the game to be stopped.  I would have
thought the linesman could not have misinterpreted Superintendent Murray's
intentions and yet he simply ran away from him keeping up with the play on
the pitch.

My attention was now totally fixed on the Leppings Lane end of the ground and
I saw at one point that Superintendent Greenwood ran onto the playing area
and ensured that the match was stopped.

More and more people streamed onto the playing area via the emergency gates
at the front of the enclosures or by climbing over the fencing at this point.
The first indication I had of the extent of the problem was when two
Constables, one was PC Marsh of *F * Division, carried a young boy from that
area to the pitch immediately below where I was sitting and began to give
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to the boy.   They worked with a member of the
public to resuscitate the boy for some time and appeared to have been
successful as the crowd which had gathered round turned towards the stand and
cheered.

It seemed to be a long time until the single St. John's Ambulance appeared on
the playing area.  The scene was becoming more and more chaotic although
there were more than enough police officers who were doing everything they
possibly could to deal with the situation.

I thought that, as there were so many police officers on the pitch there may
be a lack of control around the back of the stand so, at about 3.25 - 3.30 pm
I left the starid~ and went to a point at the South West corner, immediately
behind the police control tower.     There were other police officers there,
none of whom had radios.    I imagined that all the injured would have been
brought onto the pitch and would be evacuated at this point, it being the
nearest access point for ambulances, I therefore looked towards making the
area a casualty station.     There was a police landrover parked in just the
spot where I considered the ambulances may park and I wasted an awful lot of
time getting the land rover moved - there were no keys in the vehicle.

At this time   a middle aged man with a stewards tabard rolled up   in his jacket
pocket walked up to the young steward who was wearing his tabard and
dutifully manning the gate at this point.  The older man said "Oi, get that
jacket off, some supporters just beat a couple of our lads up when they found
out they were stewards".

When I next looked around there were two casualties at this point.  One male
about 6 feet tall and heavily built, 28 - 30 years, laying on a metal
stretcher.  He was very obviously dead.  I helped a policewoman and a member
of St. Johns Ambulance in their attempts to revive him but was struck at that
time by the futility of the operation.  The other casualty was very much
alive, holding his arm.

An ambulance arrived and after attempting resuscitation for a few seconds on
the deceased man the ambulance crew suggested putting him in the ambulance.
I helped them to do that and then told the group of 4 or 5 PC's at this point
that I wanted one of them to accompany the body.  A young male constable who
spoke with a Merseyside accent, but who, I'm sure, was wearing the uniform of
South Yorkshire Police said, "I'll go, I know his family".  I was amazed at
this comment but had not time to follow it up.

The other slightly injured man got into the same ambulance and the ambulance
left.  There was nothing to do at this point so I instructed the PC's to keep
the area clear for ambulances and walked along the service road towards
Leppings Lane to ensure unrestricted access for the emergency services which
I expected to arrive.

As I turned a corner of the service road walking towards Leppings Lane I was
met by the full tragedy of the situation.  There were a row of ambulances at
this point beside the perimeter wall of the stadium, numerous people were
receiving medical attention.  But at least ten male bodies were laid out in
attempted recovery position along the fence beside the river and no one was
paying them any attention whatsoever, they were obviously dead.  Their skin
had a mottled blue pallor and their limbs were completely limp.

There were literally dozens, if not a hundred or more, police officers at
this point under the control of Chief Inspector Purdy.   I was in civilian
clothes without a radio and felt completely helpless in this situation.    I
continued to the end of the service road and there encouraged several
supporters who were trying to walk down the service road that they should not
do so until the emergency services had departed.  I arranged a group of
police officers, who were not engaged with anything, into a cordon across the
mouth of the junction.

I now found myself outside this cordon and had felT" of little use inside, I
decided to leave the stadium to telephone my wife to reassure her that I was
uninjured.  The telephones in Leppings Lane were, not unexpectedly, full and
had queues of people outside.

As I walked along Lepping Lane there were groups of Liverpool supporters
standing around and they appeared very aggressive.  A police car was driving
up and down Lepping Lane, asking via the P.A. system, for fans to clear the
way for ambulances.  I saw more than one supporter kick out at the slowly
patrolling car.  I returned to my car parked at the junction of Claywheels
Lane with Niagara Road.  I decided that I would drive to Hammerton Road,
telephone my wife from there and assist in any way I could at the police
station.

I arrived at the police station to find it much calmer and well staffed than
I had anticipated.  I telephoned home.  After a short time the talk was of
relatives and friends being received at Hammerton Road.  I decided that this
was an area in which I could offer useful assistance.

Together with other officers,     notably D.C.I. Agar, I helped to transform   the
'new' CID office at Hammerton     Road into a relative reception area.

In the early evening friends and relatives began arriving at Hammerton Road,
I don't know how they had got there or who had decided upon Hammerton Road as
the point of reception. It quickly became apparent that we would need a
larger area for them to gather and wait.  The Hillsborough Boys Club Hall was
suggested, the keyholder was known and so it was arranged.  All the Social
Workers/Helpers gathered there and received the friends and relatives of
supporters when we had obtained a formal report about a missing friend or
relation.

The system worked as follows.  Somehow(?) people who had lost contact with
friends/relatives at the time  of the incident were directed to Hammerton Road
Police Station.  The team of officers working with me would complete a M.F.JJ.
report and we would then pass the person making the report over to the Social
Workers at the Boys Club.

During the course of the evening/night our growing list of ’mi s s i n g ’ persons
was checked with lists of casualties at hospital and with lists of arrested
persons.  About 1.00 am the stream of friends/relatives ceased and, after
contacting Chief Superintendent Mole at the makeshift mortuary, I closed our
operation down.

The final duty was to drive to the mortuary and check the M.F.y. reports
against the list of deceased.  I handed all documents over to D.I. Charles
who was working at the mortuary and who said he would be working the
following day.  I left duty about 4.00 am on Sunday 16th April 1989.

As a postscript to this report about the incident, I am reminded of an
earlier visit to Hillsborough Football Stadium in my youth when there was a
very large crowd.

The match was a first division league game between Sheffield Wednesday and
Manchester City.  It was the last game of the season and Sheffield Wednesday
needed to win the game to remain in the first division.  It would be about
1971.
It was an all-ticket evening game and my ticket was for Leppings Lane.   I
arrived with a friend in good time and took up my position on the terracing
behind the goal but, before the start of the game, the terraces had become so
full that not only was I unable to see much of the pitch, but it was a very
uncomfortable situation.  There was no room to move and I remember, at one
time, being squashed against a barrier to such an extent that I was exerting
all my energies to prevent injury and quickly became totally unconcerned
about the game.  I dreaded any goals or near misses as this was followed by a
surge of people which caused me to be squashed painfully against the barrier.

By half time I had seen very little football and was thoroughly fed up with
the situation.  Half time was the first opportunity I had to move my position
and, after fighting my way through the crowd I found a more comfortable
position at the front of the south west corner of the Leppings Lane
terracing.  I had been in very large football grounds before and since but
had never experienced anything quite like the pressure that was created in
this crowd at Hillsborough.

I wonder, now, whether the terracing at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough
is somehow susceptible to retaining the pressure created in crowd build-up.

            The       mini-inquiry             team,       formed          to    assist       Hammond      Suddard           in    the

            1.        Potential          police          witnesses          for       the    future      hearings           have    been

            identified             and    circularised.

            2.        The    reports          of    Lord       Justice          Taylor       were    scrutinised             for    further

            points          of    contention.              Six       were       highlighted           (five      have       subsequently

            been       included          by    Counsel).

            3.        The    HSE    figure          of    2,000       plus       or    minus       107. f o r    persons          entering

            initiative             at    junior          level       not    reported          to    command          level.        It    was

            performed             exclusively             by    the    police.

            5.        Although          not    tasked          on    this       issue       the    inquiry       team       has    provided

traced          and     provided.                 The       articles          are      unremarkable.

7.     The       history           behind             the    request            for    extra       gates          in    the    radial

fences          by    the     police             was    recalled            by       Inspector          Calvert          who    was   then

the       police        member         of        the    Officer            Working         Party.            Passed       to    Hammond

Suddard.

S.    A    body        plan      has        been       produced            and       shown    to        PeterMetcalf.

9.    In a d d i t i o n         to    the        original            tasks          BelindaNortcliffe                        asked   the

team       to    provide           information                about         arrangements                at    the       temporary

mortuary             in a n t i c i p a t i o n         of    this         becoming          an    issue          in    the    ’'trauma''

cases.           A    number          of     statements              were        obtained          to    show          that    relative

calm       and       organisation                 (given        the        difficult          circumstances)                   prevailed.

On    11    July        1990       I met          with       Peter         Metcalf         and     Detective             Inspector

Cleverley             who    has       exercised              day-to-day               control          of    the       enquiries.          The

following             points          arose           from    that         meeting.

                                                                                                              Action

1.    Peter          Metcalf           is    not       sure      how       to    progress

the body         plan,        it      does        not       reveal         the       picture

he    expected.                  The       inclusion            of     references             to

where       persons          were           last       seen     alive           dilutes

the    emphasis             on     the      failed           barrier.                 Yet,    if

these       were        omitted,             it m i g h t       be     interpreted

by    the       other       parties              as    ’f i d d l i n g * .           He   asks

that       the       plan     be      photographed                 and      the                              David        Needham,

photographs               sent        to    him        so    that      he     might                          Plans        Dept,

discuss          further           with          Counsel.

2.    The       evidence           that          emerged         at    the       Inquiry

suggested             that       there           was    a    history            of    good

relations             between          the        Club       and      the       police.

Peter       Metcalf                is    particulary                   sceptical             about

the    relationship                      that          existed          around          1981,           at

the    time          of       a    crush          at    the       Semi-final                that

year.           He       would          be    interested                to       know       the

views       of       the          then       ACC       (Operations)                Mr       Goslin

who    (he       hopes)             might          have       some          damning          things

to    say       about             discussions                with       the       C l u b ’s

officers             following                that       crushing                incident,

i.e.       what          was       their          reaction?                 Were       they

annoyed          that             the    police          had,          on    their          own

initiative,                   relieved             the       crush          by    letting

people          on       to       the    pitch?              Did       they       express           a

view       about          the       effect             the    incident             might          have

on    the       selection                of       Hillsborough                   for    future

Semi-Finals?                       Is    Mr       Goslin          prepared             to                    Would     Mr    Hayes

provide          a       statement                in    relation             to     these                    please     make

matters?             -    self          prepared?,                to    Peter          Metcalf?,             initial        approach

or    to    a member                of       the       inquiry          team?                                to   Mr   Goslin

3.     Peter             Metcalf             is        re-reading            the        Inquiry

transcripts                   in    relation             to       evidence             provided

by    police             officers.                 In    order          to       challenge

any    of       that          evidence             at    the       subsequent

Contributions                      Hearings             it    is       necessary             to

notify          the       Court          of       that       fact       by 31          July       1990.

Peter       Metcalf                anticipates                a    short          list       of

officers             who          are    to       be    asked          to    ’c l a r i f y ’ a

part       of    their             evidence.                 For       example,             one     or

two    officers                   talk       of    having          a    responsibility

to    monitor             the       pens.              What       do    they       mean        by

monitoring?                       Surely          nothing          more          than       keeping
                                                                                                                               PAGE    4
                                                                                                                               R274A

             a    weather-eye              out.      If    this          evidence       goes

             unchallenged              (unclarified)                 then       another       party   DI    Cleverley          to

             might        adduce       that       the     police          accepted       a            await       list       and

             responsibility                 to    count        people       into       the    pens.   assign       for

             Peter        Metcalf          will    compile           a    list    of    officers      completion             before

             with     a    list       of    points        that       require                          31.7.90

             clarification                 and    forward           them    in    due    course.

             4.     Peter        Metcalf          will     probably             request       a       DI    Eggleston          to

             number        of    sets       of    photographs              compiled          from     be    put    on    notice

             the    hundreds           of    South        Yorkshire             Police                at    this    time

             photographs              available           so    that       he    can    serve

             these        on    the    other       parties.

             5.     Peter        Metcalf          was     informed          that       the            DI    Cleverley          to

             inquiry           team    would       revert           to    normal       duties         note    and       PC

                inclusion of references to w h e r e persons w e r e last
                seen alive dilutes the e m p ha s i s on the f a iled barrier.

Surely nothing more t h a n k e e p i n g a w e a t h e r - e y e out.     If
this evidence goes u n c h a l l e n g e d (unclarified) then another                     DI C l e v e r l e y to

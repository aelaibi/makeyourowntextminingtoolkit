 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED

 SOME OF THE POLICE SEEMED TO ACT IN A LAZY MANNER,                    REACTING SLOWLY TO THE

 INCIDENT.       THE AMBULANCES SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO THE INCIDENT.

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 ALLOCATION OF TICKETS BY THE FA WAS TERRIBLE - THE LARGER END SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 GIVEN TO LIVERPOOL.         THE POLICING WAS POOR BOTH OUTSIDE & INSIDE THE GROUND

 BEFORE THE INCIDENT.         BETTER DIRECTIONS IN THE GROUND WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE

SURGE DOWN THE TUNNEL.

CANNOT RECALL SEEING MANY STEWARDS AND NONE HELPING OUT,,

Q54

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT j f O U WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL. IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICAL INQUIRY?

THERE SHOULD HAVE fiTCEN MORE POLICEMEN AT LEPPINGS LN SORTING OUT THE CROWD

BEFORE THEY WENT/eNTO THE GROUND.                   THE STATE OF THE CROWD OUTSIDE THE

TURNSTILES WAS      YeRRIBL E ,       THERE WAS NO CONTROL. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE

HORSES IN THE A R O M 3 E T W E E N THE GATES AND THE TURNSTILES.                       THERE SHOULD HAVE

BEEN A POLICEMAN AT EACH TURNSTILES TO KEEP ORDER.

I ^ I D NOT KNOW THAT I COULD HAVE GONE ROUND THE SIDE OF THE WEST STAND.                                        ALI

KNEW WAS THE TUNNEL. AND GETTING DOWN THERE I WAS AMAZED TO FIND WE WERE

CAGED IN AND IT WAS DISGRACEFUL THAT THE CROWD COULD NOT MOVE SIDE WAYS.
THE CRUSH BARRIERS WERE TOO LOW AND THE BARRIER THAT BROKE WAS RUSTY AT THE

BOTTOM WHERE IT WENT.

THE DROP BEHIND THE!: GATE j$F PERIMETER FENCE IS NO f A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE IF

THEY NEED TO GET OUT QUICKLY YOU C A N ’T BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT 4FT OFF THE GROUND,

THE DECISION TO OPEN TfriE GATE "C * WAS RIGHT BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE GETTING

CRUSHED OUTSIDE BUT         /O N CE   INSIDE THERE SHOULD HAVE ORGANISATION TO STOP PEOPLE

GOING DOWN THE TUNNEL. BECAUSE IT WAS FULL DOWN THERE.                                              ^

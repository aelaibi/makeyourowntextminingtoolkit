            Club at their Hi 11 sborouqhrjpround./

            On Saturday 15th April           1989,. I went to "work at Hillsborough at                  11.30

            am.       1 was told to operate        the turnstile number

            I was at that turnstile at about 2.30 pm when a man approached me.                                  He

            said to me,       "Can I pay     to get in."

            I said "Have you got a           ticket."         He said,       "No."

            I said,      "You ca n ’t come    in."

            At this he just turned away and walked off.

            I c a n ’t remember     if he    had any money          in his hand.        This man was     a

            white male about 25 years old.                   He had longish hair which was mousey

               coloured.     I can only remember that he had a red and white scarf on.

               1 can not remember what else lie was wearing.

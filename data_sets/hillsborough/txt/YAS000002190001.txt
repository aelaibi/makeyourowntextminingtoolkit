                           states :


1.   I was born on 15th May, 1951
2.   I joined the Ambulance Service in May 1974, and my title is
     presently Leading Ambulanceman.     I initially attended a two
     week basic induction course at a local training school in
     Sheffield, and within ten months or so I attended a six week
     residential course at Keighley,       in order to obtain the
      "Millar" qualification in Ambulance Aid.         After twelve
     months duty I became a Qualified Ambulanceman.      Thereafter
     I became a Qualified Instructor for approximately ten years
     and approximately four years ago I was promoted to Leading
     Ambulanceman.     I am qualified in ambulance aid and this has
     allowed me to teach at Qualified Ambulance level.       I have
     lectured on various courses, including basic cadets, advance
     training and public relations work.
3.   Approximately three years ago I attended Banstead in Surrey,
     which is a Regional Ambulance Training Centre.     I undertook
     an Instructor Course for extended training, i.e. paramedic
     training.       This has allowed me to teach and practice at
     that particular level.     My practical experience in relation
     to extended training commenced in or about September, 1986.
4.   I was not on duty on Saturday 15th April, 1989.     I had been
     on night duty the day before.       In the early part of the
     afternoon my wife and I went shopping, and we arrived home
     at approximately 1530 hours.          After we had taken the
     shopping indoors, my next door neighbour came over to our
house and asked if I knew of the events at Hillsborough.               I
immediately turned on the local radio whilst my wife turned
on the television.           I then telephoned Control, informed
them who I was and my base and was requested to go straight
to Longley.      I arrived at my Station at approximately 1600
hours,    collected all my equipment,           and teamed up with
Ambulancewoman                      who drove our ambulance down to
Hillsborough.T        We approached the         football ground via
Herries Road ^Setrcii and then on to Penistone Road.              We had
been advised on the vehicle radio to report to gate 0, and
as we drove onto Penistone Road,               I jumped out of the
ambulance with all my equipment.              I immediately spoke to
David Jones and Paul Eason and asked them where I should
attend.     I was advised to go to the gymnasium, and entered
the ground.       On arrival at the gymnasium I liaised with
Alan Hopkins.      By this time all the seriously injured had
been taken away to hospital,          whilst only, fatalities and
walking   wounded were       left    inside    the   gymnasium.       I
therefore carried my equipment back outside the gymnasium,
and actually placed the same on the central reservation on
Penistone Road.       I asked Station Officer Eason to watch
over my equipment as Mr Hopkins had instructed me to collect
more   body   bags,    and    there    was    also   the   fact    that
Ambulancewoman                  had driven our vehicle away.          I
collected five body bags from various vehicles parked along
Penistone Road,    and when I returned to the gymnasium I
handed the bags over to Mr Hopkins.           I then returned to the
Penistone     Road   area   and became   involved with                    traffic
control, at which time I liaised with David Jones and Paul
Eason.     I actually began to control the flow of vehicles as
they came down Penistone Road,        and also other ambulance
vehicles which were exiting from the ground.                      A short while
afterwards all remaining casualties inside                        the gymnasium
had been taken away to hospital,           although there                   still
remained a large number of vehicles parked on Penistone
Road.        David Jones asked me to take two vehicles from
Penistone Road around to the Leppings Lane end in order to
pick up six fatalities and bring the bodies back to the
gymnasium.       When I arrived at the Leppings Lane end, I
noticed that the bodies were covered up with canvass and
against a wall.       I have no idea how the bodies came to lay
at this point.       Three bodies were loaded onto each vehicle,
with one police officer in attendance for each body.                           I
recall that Station Officer Higgins followed us in to the
Leppings     Lane end with other vehicles                to pick up the
remaining bodies.      We then travelled round the perimeter of
the road behind the South Stand turning left on to Penistone
Road,    and then back into the ground               at the point we
originally entered.         The vehicle was reversed up towards
the gymnasium door and I assisted with transporting the
bodies into the gymnasium.

                                                                              *
Sometime later, David Jones gave a general briefing meeting
to all ambulance crew who were in the vicinity of the
gymnasium,    and ascertained who was on which particular
     shift.                  Some ambulance crews were stood down although a
     nucleus of ambulancemen were retained at the ground.                  Mr
     Jones actually requested me to collect a staff car.              I also
     recall that approximately 10/12 ambulances had to be checked
     for fuel and in particular two vehicles were very low on
     fuel.                   I therefore took these vehicles up to Longley
     Station for refuelling and returned back to the ground as
     soon as possible with both vehicles.                When I returned to
     Hillsborough I replaced my equipment on to the vehicle that
     I had travelled to the ground with                         driving.
     A short while afterwards I spoke to Station Officer Eason
     and as I was not crewed up with anybody at that point in
     time, Mr Eason said I could be relieved of any further
     duties.                 I therefore drove the Renault vehicle (i.e. the
     vehicle which I travelled down to Hillsborough in), back to
     Longley, arriving sometime around 2030 hours.             After moving
    my equipment into the Station I signed off.

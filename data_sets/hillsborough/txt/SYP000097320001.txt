                          Dear Mr Hayes

                           Thank you for your letter of 29th April 1989*

                           With regard to your point (2), the request I have made to you is the
                           only instruction I have ao far received from Lord Justice Taylor,

                           It will be for him to decide whether he requires any subsequent
                           interviews, statements, etc. I hope this is of assistance to you.

                           I await your further response today.

                           Yours sincerely




                           ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE (OPERATIONS)

near    to       the    g r o u n d at      the      Nottingham Forest                       End.




From    where          I. was      positioned            I c o u l d see           up     from      the     roundabout             up    the

road    towards           the      r a i 1w a y     station where                 the     Liverpool            supporters           were

arriving.               There       was     by      now a      constant            stream          of    supporters           walking

from    this       direction             down       towards         the      ground.               At a     p o int a b o u t

halfway          up the       hill       I could         see       t ha t    a    l a rg e     number       of    people          were

standing          in the        street         outside         a    public          house.              I do     not    know       the

name    of       it,    but     I also         saw     that all             the     coaches         t hat      were     arriving

were    being          directed          to a       parking         area         n ear    to    t his      pub.

At a b o u t      2.OQpm        (1400)         the    -flow of          supporters                 wa s    becoming            more     and

more       on    the     edge     of     the    forecourt              of    the       Service            Station.               I became

aware       of a g r o u p        of     about       12 to        13 L i v e r p o o l           supporters            who       were

beginning          to a r g u e         with 2 Nottingham Forest                             fans.             I approached              the

group and          told        both      parties          to m o v e        on.            Although           the    atmosphere

between          the     rival       fans      was    hostile,              t h e re       was     no     trouble         and     everyone

else       h a d m o v e d away.               Police        Constable                Landers           and Police             Constable

K i t s o n a t this           t im e    had    gone        inside          the       service           station        to      try a n d

sort       out a v e h i c l e          which    had       been        parked          on    the        forecourt           without

permission.




Throughout             the     later      part       of    the m o r n i n g           I saw a number                  of      fans

walking          about       carrying          cans       of a l c o h o l        and       1 indeed           informed           several

of    them       t hat    there         was    a good        chance          they would                 not    be a l l o w e d        into

the      ground        if t h e y w e r e       drunk.             As       the       time       got      nearer       to      the     kick-

off      t ime    I s a w fans           drinking          from        cans       of       b eer     one      after       the     other,       as

if    to    be    trying        to      drink    t h e m all,           so     they         d i d n ’t h ave         to     leave       them

outside          the     ground         when    they went              in.                  There         were      s t ill      fans

enquiring          about        spare         tickets        at    t his       time.




At a bout         g .5 0 p m    (1450)         I noted and              indeed             commented           to P o l i c e

Constable          Kitson         t hat       there       were     still          a    l a rge       number         of L i v e r p o o l

fans       heading        towards         the     ground.               At     one         p o int      there       were       so m a n y

t ha t     not    all     of    them      could walk              on    the       pavement              and    they       had     to    spil l

onto       the    road.




At    about       3 . QOpm       (1500)        the S e r i a l         gathered             on     the     corner         of     the

junction Leppings                    Ln and Psnistone                   Rd.            We    were         g o ing    to     go    into

a    ra dio     that       there       was      a     problem           at    the    turnstiles              at    the L e p p i n g s L n

End.




Over      the    radio          1 could         hea r        a    lot    of    supporters              singing          and a Police

O f f i c e r ’s v o i c e       w h i c h was         saying           t hat a      l a rge        number        of    fans were

outside         the       ground       pushing            against            one    of    the       gates.             I then          heard

someone         shouting            over     the       fans           singing,       r e q u e s t ing       the       game       be     held       up

for    15 m i n u t e s         to a l l o w        the      f ans      outside          to    get     in.         I believe                this

request         was       turned      d o w n.            I then         heard       someone           saying          that       p e o p l e at

the    front         of    the      crush were               getting          injured and              that       one       of    the       g a tes

was    becoming            damaged.                 I then            heard    t hat      it was        going          to    be       necessary

to    open      the       gate      in o r d e r       to        relieve       the       pressure        at       the       front.             I

then      heard       the       order      to       open         the    gate.




After       a few         seconds         1 heard            that       all    available             officers           were          to a t t e n d

on    the     track arou nd               the       s i de       of    the    pitch,          at w h i c h we          started           to m a k e

our w a y       to    t he L e p p i n g s          Ln E n d .          1 never          heard anything                 else          on the

r a dio     after         that,      but w h e n we               got    to    the L e p p i n g s       Ln       end and

turnstiles,               I heard         t h at     ambulances               had    been        requested.                  We w e r e        t old

to    form a         cordon         outside          the         ground.            At    t his      t ime we          had       no    i dea

what      had    happened            in side.                There       were       s t ill     a number           of       f a ns     outside,

sorne of        them       drinking,            s o me       of       them    had    tickets           which       they          showed        to

us a n d a s k e d         if    they      could          go      in.



An a mb ulance             then a r r i v e d and                 stopped          just       inside     the       gate.               I then

saw a y o u t h           bei n g    carried           out        of    the    ground          to    the a m b u l a n c e .                X saw

the a m b u l a n c e       man      trying          to      resuscitate             him,        but    they       then          j ust      left

him and         went       back      to    get a n o t h e r            y o u t h who         I saw w i t h a           r e s u s c i tat o r

on    his     face.             We w e r e      all       then         told    to    go       j.nto the G r o u n d .                  As    we

walked        past        the    ambulance,               I could            see    the       youth     i n s i d e , he          l,.ooked a s

A s we      walked            a r o u n d a w all          into       the y a r d       behind       the W e s t        S t a n d we       were

confronted               by the         sight        of    people        lying        on    the    floor with             other       people

resuscitating                  them and a t t e n d i n g              to     injuries.              There        were     a    number          of

fans       also         who    were       walking          a b o u t , swearing             and    shouting          at    us a n d

Police         Officers             who     were      already          in the         ground.            I saw       one       fan

pushing            a Policeman              about         and     shout in g , 'IT'S YOUR                  F U C K I N G F A U L T *.

As    we    neared            to    the     tunnel         which       leads       o nt o    the     terracing            other       fans

which were               coming         out     of    the       ground        shouted        at    us,     i t ’s too          late       now

and      started          swearing.




As    I ent                                                                   s that        there     was      several          hundred

people         m                                                                I then made           my way         onto       the       pitch

via      one       of    the       pejyinieter f e n c e             gates       I think          it w a s     number          4.         I.

then       saw      people          l y ing     on the          grass       near      to    the    goal.           As     I entered

on t o     the      pitch          I ran       behind          the    goal      to w h e r e      I saw      peo p l e     passing

bodies         out       t h r o u g h a ho re            in the       fence       onto      the     pitch.             Further           along

I then         saw a          large       number          of    bodies        pil e d      up on     top     of    each        other .           1

could       not         say    ho w m a n y         there       was    as     legs      and arms         were      all     tangled             up.

1 then         saw       that       a man who             was     conscious           was    trying        to f re e       himself

from       the      bo d i e s .          So   along           with another             officer       who      had a r r i v e d w i t h

a    pair      of       step       la d d e r s ,    I climbed           up     the     fence      and     lea n t      over        the    top

of    the      fence.               Although          I could          reach       the      hands     of     the man,           I could

in the         bodies,             the w e i g h t        of w h i c h      held      him    fast.           I then        climbed

down       the      fence           and     started            to a s s i s t    with making             the      hole     in the

fence       larger.

had a w h i t e            band       on his         hat,      kicked           at    it f r o m          the      outside-              On

getting          the       ho 1 e l a r g e r        1 helped            to     carry a fan                  from    the       terracing

onto      the     pitch.                  He w a s     passed           to    us     by f ans           who       were    on    the

terracing.




1 saw       several             pol i c e       officers           on    the       terracing              behind         the    goal      who

were      being        pushed about                  and      hit       by s o me         f a ns     but      it was        not     possible

to    h ear      what        wa s     said.            T he    bodies           I saw        piled           up w e r e     all    j ust

behind          the    goal          to    the    left        as    you       stood        on      the       pitch       looking         at     the

stand      and        t h e y we re all              rig ht        at    the       front        of      the       terracing,            right

under      the        to p      of    the       fence.




The      y ou t h who           I had       been       pa ssed,          I helped            carry           to    the    side     of     the

left      goal        post,          but    there       was        no    r oo m      to    put       him      down       so w h i l s t       three

others          held       him       I helped          to     take       the       goal      net        down which made                  more

room.            I then went                back       to     the       hole       in the          fence          where     I assisted              to

carry another                   male       youth       on     to    the       pitch.               He w a s        passed       to me         by

f an s    from        the       terracing.                  The     y o u t h was          motionless,               but       very war m and

was      blueish           in    c olour.              On     finding           a space            to     lay him         down myself               and

another          Police          Officer          started           to       try and         revive           him.          I searched              for

a    pu l s e    but       could          not    find       one.             He a p p e a r e d         to    be d e a d .         Someone

then      came a n d            took       over      f rom us.                I think           it was            an a m bulance          man.

I was       then a s k e d            by a w o m a n P o l i c e              Constable              to      try a n d      find        s ome

oxygen          for    a     person         she      wa s     r e s u s c i t a t i n g , so            I found a medical                     person

who      was     going          around.              All      the       t ime      I could           see      people,          f a ns    and

officers          ali k e ,          trying       to    resuscitate                  people,            some       injured        people           who

began       to    breathe             again,         were      being          sick,        others            were    j ust      being

covered          up    by       clothing          because           there          was     no m o r e         to    be    d one    for        them.




All      the     time        peop l e       were       running           about        shouting               and    crying,         trying          to

■find p e r s o n s        they       had      lost.             I was       then ap pr oa c he d             by a m a n w h o          had

lost     his     young          son    so      I told           him where        the      injured would                be    taken and

pointed        out w h e r e          to    go      in o r d e r       to    find     out m o r e        information.                   I

then     saw     that a          l a rge       part        of    the L i v e r p o o l      supporters              began     to    surge

towards        the N o t t i n g h a m F o r r e s t                 supporters        who     had       been       taunting        them,,

so    I went       to      the    centre            of     the       pitch where         I met          other       members        from

Serial      30.            We    th en formed a                  l i ne a c r o s s    the     pitch and             stopped any

further        Liverpool              f a ns     from       going       towards         the    kop.            We    stayed        in the

centre      of    the       pitch          until         about        5.15pm    w hen,        in    company with Police

Sergeant         A s h t on,      we       returned             to    the    roundabout            on P e n i s t o n e     Rd North.




Whilst      in the          centre          of      the     pitch       I saw       several         scuffles           broke       out

between        the      fans      in the            seated area and                 I saw Police               Oficers        removing

persons        from        the    seated areas                   to    prevent        any     further          trouble.             Once

outside        the      ground         I never             saw any          further      trouble and                the L i v e r p o o l

fans    all      left       the a r e a.




At about         6 . 2 0 pm      (1820)          in our          Serial,       we w e n t      to       the R o a d T r a f f i c

Department            building             near       to    the       ground where            we w e r e       given

At a b o u t     7 . 1 0 pm      (1910)          we      received           information            to    stand       down     so we

returned         to     our T r a n s i t           van and           returned        to D o n c a s t e r      arriving           at

           to suggest           that    portable          barriers       were       p ositioned        between turnstiles

           10 and       11   , extending           back       towards    the     perimeter          gates.         This     only

           being       in position,,              This    is despite          the     fact    that     their       previous

POINT OF INFORMATION -
LEPPINGS LANE TURNSTILES

Believe it or not, at this late stage there is evidence forthcoming to
suggest that portable barriers were positioned between turnstiles 10
and 11, extending back towards the perimeter gates. This only came to
light following discussions with some of the officers concerned on
Monday, and particularly Sergeant Morgan and Inspector Ellis, who made
mention of the fact that they recall these barriers being in position.
This is despite the fact that their previous statements had made no
reference.

We have searched the photograph albums, and in Album DB20, photograph 7
(the photographs in this album being primarily .taken to show the extent
of the discarded alcohol containers) shows the feet of portable metal
barriers, which would tend to support the claim that they were in the
position described.

We have approached Inspector Sykes (officer in charge of this sector)
and he has no knowledge of these barriers; I am in the process of
having other officers from serials 17 and 18 seen, in an attempt to
clarify this situation.

I am advised by Mr. Mole and Mr. Beal that the police would certainly
not have positioned those barriers, but if they were in position it
would give an indication that attempts were made to channel fans
towards particular sets of turnstiles, i.e. effectively the concourse
area between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles was segmented into
3 parts - turnstiles 1-10 divided by the now portable barriers; 11-16
between those barriers and the steel clad fencing, and A-G from the
steel clad fencing to the fixed barrier.

I supply this at this moment in time so that you are not caught
unawares of the possible development, and will update you at the
earliest opportunity.

VIDEO TAPE -   1988

We have in our possession a police video recording of the
second half of the 1988 semi-final at Hillsborough between
Nottingham Forest and Liverpool.  The last 2 minutes of
this tape give excellent views of the crowds on Leppings
Lane terraces, and in particular pens 3 and 4.

It is my view that there appears to be no significant
difference in the packing on the terraces, on this tape
and the 1989 recording.

The recording of events inside the ground ends at the
final whistle and shows fans beginning to scale the
perimeter fence.  Officers can be seen approaching those
fans in an effort to deter them.

PC's Smith and Illingworth (Gates 3 and 4) were on the
perimeter track serial at Leppings Lane last year, and
quite clearly the pitch invasion will have conditioned
their minds towards the development of a possible public
order situation.   Indeed, PC Smith's statement makes
reference' to that fact.

The relevant parts of the tape are from 1642 to 1644.

It may be that you would want to introduce this tape as
part of the sweep-up in presenting the police account.

On a point of information, 9 of the 18 officers making
up Serial 1 (Perimeter Track Detail) last year, were
engaged on perimeter track duty this year.

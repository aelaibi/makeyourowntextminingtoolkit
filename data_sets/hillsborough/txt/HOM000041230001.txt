 AMENDED:-

 This made no difference, so during a quiet spell I changed the mains lead and aerial onto the spare
base-station, switching this to talk-through, as with the fitted base station. But the aerial lead was
not long enough for the base-station to be placed on the desk, so it remained underneath and a
motorola radio was used in the control room”, (p. 170) Changed to:-

  On arrival at the police control room I first changed the ‘tulip’ microphone for a ‘hand phone/first
mic taken from the spare W15U Base Station. The fault continued, so during a ‘stop’ in
communications I plugged in the spare W15U ‘Base Station’ to the mains supply and changed over
the aerial connection.

The fitted ‘Base Station’ had been working on ‘talk-through’. This is a ground to ground radio
facility, so one radio can communicate to another radio. Therefore I switched the spare ‘Base
Station’ to ‘talk-through’. Giving exactly the same communication as the fitted ‘Base Station’.

 The spare Base Station was situate on the floor underneath the bench. The box containing the
 spare Base Station’ has a physical size of 27 inches long by 11 inches high by 11 inches deep, the
mains lead and aerial lead are only of sufficient length to connect to the spare ‘Base Station’ in situ
and therefore I was unable to place it on top of the Control Room bench. This in turn meant that the
fist mic/hand phone, which is connected by a curly lead, only just came about the level of the bench
and the operator was obliged to bend down to use it. The loud speaker to the spare ‘Base Station’ is
incorporated into the set and therefore reception was at floor level.

A hand held Motorola personal radio was therefore used by the operator. This enabled him to stand
upright to transmit, the reception was via the loud speaker in the hand held radio itself and it gave
the Control Room equal opportunity for transmission.” (Pp. 170-171)

                   My day began        in HQ at 08.00.                F r o m there we t r a n s p o r t e d some                  radio

                   the    control    room,      I a t te nd ed the                  briefing.              On   completion of the

                   briefing     I remained           in the are a of the gymnasium,                               where the        issue of

                   the    radios was going            on.     My '-responsibility on the day was to make

                   myself availablir in case of                     communication                     problems.          I was    in

                   possession o ^ a radio w ith an ear                                  receiver       for the whole         duration of

                   the day.

                   At ferou/d 14.00 hours               I began to he^«*/the radio breaking                                  up^F'At

            r \ / /' f i r s V I a s s u m e d it to be interferen/e but when it continued

                   intermittently          I mad e my way oveor to                            the control        room.    jThiiT.beingf

                   a ’ro'und'14.20 hours to             14.30 hours.

                   I first     changed the t ulip mic.,                         this          made     no difference,            so during a

                   quiet spell       I changed the m ains                        lead         an d aerial       onto the spare base-

                   station to be          placed on the desk,                           so    it remained u n d e r n e a t h and a

                   mo t orola radio was used in the                             control            room.

            The time was now about               14.40 hours.        A fter    checking the system was

            working    correctly         I left the control          room but        remained at the bottom

            of the steps by the gate,               where    I st a y e d for the         rest of the afternoo

            Man y m e s sages were        coming    over the      radio,      I remember the request to

            open L e p pings Lane gate.             That being a r o u n d       14.50 hours,          I also

            remember a request            to delay the game,           as there was still a large

            crowd outside        (Leppings Lane         end).      Time     unknown.           After    1500 hours I

            remember someone askin g              for bolt      cutters and          a request         for a

            m o r t u a r y to be set up.         By this time        I was helping            in the direction

            of a m b u l a n c e s at the south end of the             stadium,        by the       control    room

            and the     removal     of    casualty out of that             gate.

E ND OF REPORT
 STATEMENT OF                    Andrew SANDERSON

 DATE OF BIRTH                   23.10.59

OCCUPATION OF WITNESS            Communications Assistant

ADDRESS & TELEPHONE NUMBER       South Yorkshire Police
                                 Snig Hill
                                 Sheffield



My day began in Headquarters at 0800 hours.      From there we trans­

ported some radio equipment to Hillsborough, this being spare equip­

ment to be left in the Police Control Room.      On completion of taking

this equipment into the control room, I attended the briefing.

On completion of the briefing I remained in the area of the gym­

nasium, where the issue of the radios was being conducted.      My

responsibility on the day was to make myself available in case of

communication problems.    I was in possession of a radio with an

ear receiver for the whole duration of the day.



At around 1400 hours I began to hear the radio breaking up.     At

first I assumed it to be interference but when it continued inter­

mittently I made my way over to the control room accompanied by

Chief Inspector Beal.    This being around 1420 hours to 1430 hours.



On arrival at the police control room I first changed the 'tulip'

microphone for a 'hand phone/first mic' taken from the spare W15U

Base Station.    The fault continued, so during a 'stop' in communi­

cations I plugged in the spare W15U 'Base Station' to the mains

supply and changed over the aerial connection.



The fitted 'Base Station' had been working on 'talk-through'. This
is a ground to ground radio facility, so one radio can communicate

to another radio.   Therefore I switched the spare 'Base Station'

to 'talk-through', giving exactly the same communication as the

fitted 'Base Station'.



The spare 'Base Station* was situate on the floor underneath the

bench.   The box containing the spare 'Base Station' has a physical

size of 27 inches long by 11 inches high by 11 inches deep, the

mains lead and aerial lead are only of sufficient length to connect

to the spare 'Base Station' in situ and therefore I was unable to

place it on top of the Control Room bench.   This in turn meant that

the fist mic/hand phone, which is connected by a curly lead, only

just came about the level of the bench and0the operator was obliged

to bend down to use it.   The loud speaker to the spare 'Base Station'

is incorporated into the set and therefore reception was at floor

level.



A hand held Motorola personal radio was therefore used by the

operator.   This enabled him to stand upright to transmit, the recep­

tion was via the loud speaker in the hand held radio itself and

it gave the Control Room equal opportunity for transmission.



The time was now about 1448 hours.    After checking the system was

working correctly I left the control room but remained at the

bottom of the steps by the gate, where I stayed for the rest of

 the afternoon.



Many messages were coming over the radio, I remember the request
to open Leppings Lane gate.   That being around 1450 hours, I also

remember a request to delay the game, as there was still a large

crowd outside (Leppings Lane end).   Time unknown.   After 1500 hours

I remember someone asking for bolt cutters and a request for a

mortuary to be set up.   By this time I was helping in the direction

of ambulances at the south end of the stadium, by the control room

and the removal of casualty out of that gate.



Summary

At 1400 hours approximately communications began to break up.    At

around 1430 hours after the radio 'Base Station' was changed, to

the best of my knowlede the radio system was working and remained
                                          O
working for the duration of the day and is still working today as

checked by Inspector Woodhead, 4.5.89 and Home Office Directorate

of Telecommunications Technicians.

I am writing in reply to your letter of 5 June to Tony Banks, with which you
enclosed correspondence from I                                 _              T
         , in support of recent calls for a new inquiry into the Hillsborough
disaster. I am replying to your letter, as this is a m atter for which the
Home Office has responsibility.

As you know, the Home Secretary has been considering w hether there is a case
for a further public inquiry into the disaster in the light of the many
representations which have been received. Concerns th at a number of issues
relating to the disaster remain unresolved received renewed attention following
the Granada television documentary drama "Hillsborough" last December.

The Home Secretary has had the opportunity to consider fully the material which
has been put forward, calling for a new public inquiry. He has decided, in all the
circumstances, that there should be an independent scrutiny to ensure th at no
m atter of significance is overlooked before a final decision is taken. As you will
know, he therefore announced in the House on 30 June th at there will be an
independent scrutiny by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, a senior Lord Justice of the
Court of Appeal. I enclose for your information a copy of his statem ent to the
House, which includes Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's term s of reference. You will
see that he has undertaken to make public the advice which Lord Justice Stuart-
Smith gives him.

It is our earnest hope th at the independent scrutiny will finally bring an end to
the uncertainty over the events of th at terrible afternoon.

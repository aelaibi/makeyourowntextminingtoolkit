            About       1 630      t hi s    date,     a mortuary attendant                   asked      if we        could assist

as     a temporary mortuary.

I obtained a               new     pad    of C a s u a l t y R e c o r d    forms       from POL          INS B E N N E T T a n d

s he    could        prevent        persons       entering          and also       transfer           completed         forms

f r o m me      to    the H o s p i t a l      C a su a l t y Bureau.

In     company with              the     remainder        of m y     detail,       I entered             the    Plaster       Room

where     I saw           that    there      were      10 bo d i e s .      Three       of     these      were    on

trollies            and    the     remainder          were    on the       flo o r.

We     then     systematically                started        to   strip     the    bodies          a n d as we     did

so     I completed a Casualty Record Form                                 starting          w i t h C a s u a l t y F o r m No

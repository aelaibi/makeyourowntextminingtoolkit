                            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Thank you very much.

                                        DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK Called

                                        Examined bv MR. GOLDSACK:

                    Q. Mr. Lock, for some years prior to your retirement from the
               BI      Police in 1985 you were a Superintendent based in FI Sub-
                        Division covering Hillsborough? - A. I was, sir.

                    Q. And is it for three years you personally were in charge of
                       policing there? - A. That is correct, sir.

                    Q. 1982 to 1985? - A.   That   is correct, sir.

               C    Q. Were you present at the   1981 Semi-Final? - A. No, I was not
                        sir.  I was in Headquarters at the time.

                   Q. Were you aware of the memo that had been raised in 1981
                      expressing Chief Superintendent’s Herold’s dissatisfaction
                      with stewarding? - A. I was aware of the original intention of
                      the memoranda.    I was very fortunate because my predecessor in
                 I    the post I occupied at FI was Mr. Chapman, and he had moved
               D|     sideways to become Detective Superintendent, so he was able to
                      liaise with me and brief me about many things appertaining to
                      the Sub-Di visio-n.    -




                                                        /   He talked about that.

      He talked about that as well, that in actual fact the
      Police had cone to an arrangement with the club that
      they would steward that particular end of the ground
     -and when Mr. Chapman and I visited the ground, and I
      remember very clearly the first large match and that
      was in the season before we were promoted, it was
      against Leeds United and there was a very high level
      of public anr.iety because of the actions of the Leeds
      fans at that time.   He went to the ground and we dis­
      cussed what we were going to do and, as Mr. Woodward
      said, there was an awareness of the level of limitation
      of the stewards and consequently it was decided the
      Police would do that and the system which was in fact
      adopted was the filling of pens on all occasions.
      There was not any disparity about the differences
      in the matches. "There was a difference in the level
       in which - the number of Policemen were used on those
      terraces.

0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      ilo dif f erence _in the way
     thev we're packed;, just the   number of officers? - A.
     That is right, sir.   If you   had a small - each game
     was categorised before each    season into A, B and C.

Q. What I was pausing for, I did not catch the names.
   You said you :went to the ground and there was a
   specific meeting about this, was there? - A.Ho,   I
   went to the ground with the Police Officers, my
   Chief Superintendent-Herald.

Q.    Yes.   And who else? - A. And Mr. Chapman.

0.    Chapman.   Yes. - A. We looked at the ground.

Q.    Presumably somebody from the club? - A. Yes.        We met the
      secretary, Hr. Chester.

 0. Chester.       Yes. This was when? - A. This was before the
    Leeds United game and there had been - it^was early on
     in the season - there had been a number of incidents
    which involved Leeds fans in other parts of the country
     and there was a high level of anxiety about the policing
     arrangements for that day and that was when it was
     emphasised to me the fact that although there had been
     this memoranda as a result of the 1981 problem that it
   . was not in f act .being .adhered to and that Police.were.....
     stewarding that end of the ground and that is the system
     which- pertained when Mr.. .Chapman was there and that is - .
     the system-which I carried on and I kn ow ’was carried~on
:   -bstiftjtIt- Mr                ..-.-Murray because when: Sbchatigede
     my roles I spoke to them about the policing at the
 - Leppi-ngs. La.oe- end of. the ground.

 Q. This game with Leeds United was when?- A. I think that was

     1982, My Lord.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   1982.   Thank you very much.

Q.        MR. GOLDSACK:   So although this was not reduced
     into writing it was a reasonably formal agreement between
     the club and the Police? - A. Yes.

Q. About Leppings Lane terrace in particular? - A. Yes, sir.

0. And so throughout the rest of your time in the Police
   Force is that what in practice you did, namely, you
   directed the fans on the Leppings Lane terrace? -A.
   It v?as incorporated into the Police order for each
   match.   It clearly stated the control bo:c would monitor
   and would direct in the way in which the pens were filled.
   The pens were not as they are not?.. There were only three
   pens, the South pen, the central pen,    that is 2 and 3 as
   it is not? - 3 and 4 as it is now - but there was the
   South pen, the central pen and the North pen and then
   the elevated section.

0. Mow, you retired early 1985 and you took up your part-
   time appointment with the club later that year.  Is that
   right? - A, I actually retired on the 28th of February
   but I ceased duty on the 22nd of February. 1934, because
   I had time owing and annual leave to come, so I did not
   work into 1985 and I commenced employment as the Security
   Officer at the club in August, 1985.

Q. In between those two I think you had written certain
   articles for the Police Review about policing at football
   matches? - A. I wrote several articles for Police Review
   and the-Sheffield Telegraph, sir.

Q. Would this be correct, Mr. Lock, that in at least one of
   those articles you t?ere fairly critical of football
   management in general, club management? - A. Which way
   do you mean, sir?

0 . In not taking sufficient responsibility for crowd
    problems. - A. There was an incident at Barnsley iust
    at the time I was retired when a      lot of    damage was
    caused by fans from Leeds United again and houses were
    damaged and the club completely refused to accept any
    responsibility ..for what, was going on outside the ground
    and in my article I did raise the question, what did the
    club think those.fans we re doing in that part .of Barnsley
    at that particular moment.                            '

 0. Did you also before taking up your employment with the
-   club--.-u&re y-ou >oL-the-view..that  very often st.ewaxds.^did-
    not do that which they should be     doing?    - A. It is a

                                                         D. LOCK

     difficult question, that, sir.  I can answer it really^
     retrospectively.  The stewards are generally well meaning,
     salt of the earth lads who go to the match because they
     are supporters of the club but of course their_limitations
     inasmuch as their knowledge of the lav; and their physical
     abilities are restricted by their ages.   Consequently we
     all have to acknowledge that the stewards can only do so
     much and this was another factor in deciding whether or
     not the Police should steward the away end of the ground.

0. Mr. Lock, you are quite right but in the article I have
   in mind which is iti the Sheffield Wednesday bundle you
   are at pains not to criticise, the stewards but you do
   make the point that frequently they do not do certain
   things and therefore in practice the Police have to do
   it and vou make the observation this is not acceptable?
   - A. Can you tell me which page that is, please, sir?

Q. This is document 23.      It comes after page 15.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     In?

          MR. GOLDSACK:     In the Sheffield Wednesday bundle, sir

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you.

0.        l'!R. GOLDSACK:  There is a double document at 2A
     and then there is your article covering two pages at 23._
     - A. I am sorry, sir.   I have not quite accustomed myself
     to the way these documents run.

0. They started out all right but they have had so many
   additions.  It is about 25 pages into the bundle?

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     What page is it?

          MR. GOLDSACK:      It does not actually have a page
     number.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Whereabouts does it come in the
     pagination?

           MR. GOLDSACK:     After page 15.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you.

          TEE WITKESS:   l am sorry, sir.         We are having    V:’:".

                                                     D. LOCK

It is page 65 of the Police Review.

     MR. GOLDSACK:      That is what the document looks like.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes.   Nov; we have got it.

     MR. GOLDSACK:  Towards the bottom right-hand of that
page, it is under the paragraph heading of escorting
visiting fans. - A. Yes, sir.

Towards the bottom of that page you say "My regretful
experience of stewards,and I must say it is through no
fault of theirs, is that they are usually less than
useful."   You then sake reference to a particular club
where they are not.   Then you say "Others do not and
frequently the Police take upon themselves to assume
stewards' duties.   This is not acceptable"? - A. Yes,
that is quite true, sir.

Was that your general feeling at the tine you took up
your position at Sheffield Wednesday? - A. 'Jo, it was
not.   I was talking - I should explain to you that I
visit at least two football matched n week.    I have_
always done.    I have been a football supporter and I
have seen numerous grounds in the country and looked
at them, the policing and the stewarding prob!-j.as. I
did n e t find that, sir, at Sheffield Wednesday.  We _
knew the limitations and obviously, as a Police Officer
in charge of the policing arrangements, I did make tr.ese
arrangements for how to steward the West end but I did
not find that the stewards - there are exceptions of
course - failed to carry out thair duties. We
particularly included in their instructions wiiat
they had to" do and v/hat the effects would be if
they failed to carry out their function.

You sav when you changed hats and went to Sheffield
Wednesday y o u " confirmed with your successors in the
Police that they would in practice continue to steward
the West terrace? - A. That is true, sir.

 Do we take it that at no stage up until the present
  time have you discussed that that should change? - A.
 I was asked to provide         additional stewards in respect
 of the Kop for the semi-finals in 1937, 1938 and this
 last year and in f a c t we..:-provided those additiaaal
  stewards. We followed the recommendations made by
 Hr* ' Calvert in. respect of the stewards1 instructions: v .
  and every time the Police came to the club with a
” reqxi'est,' and" there- wa s:mr re s t r i c t i o n financially -
  because we were not paying for the stewards, we

                         but we were never asked.

                   Q. I wonder, Hr. Lock, if you would have available a copy
                      of the latest Green Guide which is no doubt a document
                      you are very well aware o f? - A. It i s , sir.

                   Q. And if vou go, please, to Chapter 13, headed Stewarding,
              B       This would be a document that became available to you
                      not very long after you took up your position with the
                      club? -*A. True, sir.

                   0. Now,  the heading under paragraph 13, the rirst item
                      referred to, is that effective stewarding should prevent
                      overcrowding? — A. That is true, sir.

                   Q. In practice that must refer to the standing areas rather
                      than the sitting areas? - A. 0 ’ course.

                   Q .   What was your view when that new copy of the Green Guide
                         came out as to whether that was the ♦ i •
                                                                   responsibility of
                                                                    * ._____  _r ’_______ i _
                         stev;ards? - A. It  was  the responsibility         of the club.
                         The Green Guide clearly emphasises that. But it does
                         not say that we cannot use any other agency in achieving_
              D          that managerial objective and we knew what we were doing
                         in all of our stands with our stewarding levels, we knew
                         what we were doins .on the Kop with our stewarding             ‘6 levels

SDJ1                                                         D. J. LOCK

                     The document that came into existence — and we have
                     them at pages 451 to 7 in our core bundle — of stewards
                     duties and match day isntructions. Is it right that there
                     is no reference in those to overcrowding or preventing
                     overcrowding. A. You mean this document, sir?

                     Yes, amongst other documents- A. Yes, that is true, there
                     is no reference to stewarding.
                B
                     No reference to stewards having a responsibility to prevent
                     over crowding? A. That is true.

                         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Would not that have been appropriate,
                     though, for the Kop end? A. Yes, I suppose we could have
                     put it into the Kop end but the fact of the matter is that
                     on the Kop the main objectives of the stewards is to keep
                     the gangways clear and also the entry ways, and work in
                     conjunction with the police.

                     As I understood it you were saying that the duty to see to
                     over crowding, in effect, the club employed the police to do
                     that at the Leppings Lane end and were therefore within the
                     Green Guide? A. That is true, sir.
                D    But at the Kop end, as I understood it, the stewards accepted
                     responsibility for doing it? A. There were stewards and
                     police at the Kop end working in conjunction with each
                     other, sir.

                     There were no instructions for the stewards for that end?
                     A . No.

                         MR. GOLDSACK: Had you got any formal arrangement with
                     the police for that end? A. We used to speak to the police
                     liason officer, either Mr. Calvert or Mr. Sewell, and
                     according to the category of the match and the number of
                     stewards we were wanting we could come to the arrangements.
                     In the last match which caused this Inquiry, the 15th April
                     match, Mr. Calvert and I spoke about the stewarding and the
                     number of additional stewards required.     He came and saw
                     me during the pre-match build-up and we discussed the
                     deployment.  One of the things that he emphasized was that
                     he was aware that there was going to be quite a number of
                     Liverpool fans on the Kop, which was the Nottingham Forest
                     domain, and that he wanted to put them over an elevated
                     area near to the North Stand.     He was asking my stewards
                     to keep the gangway s clear ,„ to keep the entrances clear ,
                     and if they could identify any Liverpool supporters to
                     direct them over to the police.                           ;

                                              You say Mr. Calvert? A. Mrf-CalveTtV

                             is it not? A. That is right,       sir.

                             Do we take it from what you are saying, Mr. Lock, that at
                             no stage during your time at the club have you ever said
                             anything to any of the stewards that they should take any
                             part at all in monitoring for over crowding? A. The
                             stewards were perfectly aware — Mr. Thorpe-and his
                             stewards in the West Stand — were perfectly aware of
                         B   the police arrangements which were going on underneath
                             them.

                             Does that mean, Mr. Lock, that at no time have you said
                             anything to any steward to suggest that they should keep
                             a careful eye, or even a general eye, on possible over
                             crowding? A. We speak about safety generally and, of course,
                             we do mention the fact that if there is anything which is
                             unsafe that it should be brought to our attention straight
                             away, but specifically should they keep an eye on the
                             Leppings Lane terrace, no.

                             You heard this morning Mr. King asking Inspector Sewell
                             whether he accepted that all the police efforts on the
                             Leppings Lane terrace were directed to crowd control.

                             You disagree with Mr. Sewell? A. Vehemently.

                             Does that not suggest there  has been a total break-dovn
                             in communication? A. No, Sir, I am afraid it suggests that
                             Mr. Sewell is not quite aware of what was happening on
                             those terraces.  Can  I explain to you what the system
                             was?

                              Please do. A. When I arrived there — and I continued this
                              system — we had no benefit of television cameras and
                              consequently everything was by observation and radio
                              communication.      As a result of that we had decided, in
                              liason with the club, that we were going to police those
                              pens on the Leppings Lane end.          The matches, as I have
                              already explained, were categorised, and there is no
                              disparity between the matches, it was a question of levels
                              of policing.      If it was a 'c' match that would mean to say
                              that there would be a small number of people in the ground,
                              usually below twenty thousand.            Then the number of police
                              officers we required were few.          What I did was that I decided,
                              as it was a shared facility, to keep the Centre pen, which
                              is-th-ree and f-our now, sterile.        I would pack into -the „South
                              pen immediately under the police box, the.away fans. We
                              knew that the^ South pen .held just under two thousand- and: .
                              if we were going, through our intelligence, to receive only
                             •tfra-tr number , we -wbald-- put: them in therev; -If they- w-er-e-go-ing- •

                              use more officers but we would pack and we tried to pack
                              sequentially originally fans into first of all the South

                             pen and then the Centre pen.   All the time we were doing
                             this officers who were working on the track were looking
                             at the people coming in and many is the time we have had
                             to say: "Can you see if there is room down at the front?
                             Can we get any more in?" beca-use we were concerned about
                             safety. Many times Mr. Creaser I can recall on one occasion,
                             Mr. Sykes on another, used to come along to -my control
                             box and say to me:"How is it going on, sir, have we any
               B             more room? Come and have a look".   I used to look and it
                             was not a casual or even cavalier from the way Mr. Woodward
                             described it, looking over and doing other duties.   It
                             was a concentrated   effort ensuring that not only were the
                             people controlled properly but they were packed properly.
                             All of the time I was monitoring from information and from
                             observation what was going o n .

                                 When the pen became tolerably full I would say: "Close
                             the pen". The police officers would bring across barriers
                             and stand there and direct the fans into the other pens.

                        Q.   What you have just been describing is a situation of less
                             than full capacity.  During your time as a senior police
                             officer did you in fact have any full capacity games?
                D            A. Can I say that — and you are aware and this Inquiry
                             is aware — that the capacity of the ground has been
                             increased by the additional terracing on the Kop.

                             Yes. A. Our capacity was just over 50,000.  I cannot
                             recall our ever having a 50,000 gate. What you must
                             appreciate is that when I went there we were running for
                             promotion and we did not achieve that the first season.
                             The second season we achieved promotion and the third season
                             we were in the first division for the first time in some
                             considerable time.  We had in excess of 40,000 on many
                             occasions.  The difference between the occasions when
                             Manchester United and Liverpool came for the first time
                             were not very great to the difference between the semi­
                             finals which had gone over the last three years.

                    F   Q.   So you had occasion, did you, during your policing, when
                             the Leppings Lane end was full to capacity? A. Yes, sir.

                             On how many occasions? One or two? A. It was more than two
                             or three.

                             You are saying, are you, you had no problem on those occasions
                             in- m a k i n g sure there-was an even distribution of the crowd?
                             A. We have filled the pens, observed the filling, and
                             we have closed them.        Inspector Calvert closed the centre
                             gate of the centre pen on one occasion I can rec.aH- ...

                             On those big matches, Manchester United, Liverpool, you

SDJ4                                                              D. J. LOCK

                        in the past used to use a system of numbering.  You can
                        still see on some of the positions in the ground one,
                        Centre pen two, and three.  This was apparently on the
                        tickets.  The police asked for this to be discontinued
                        because it caused a problem in the packing of the pens.
                        When it was a large match you can imagine the difficulties
                        if people enter through the turnstiles and they have a
                        numbered ticket which shows entry number three and they
               B        are on number one or two side and there would be this
                        criss-cross.  As a consequence I am led to believe that
                        the police asked for those numbers to be taken off.

                        On the big matches, the full house matches that you policed,
                        did you in effect let the crowd find their own level on
                        the Leppings Lane Terrace? A. Yes, that was all we could
                        do .

                        You are saying that in your time there always seemed to
                        be a fairly even distribution of people? A. No, of course
                        not, because as everyone knows sometimes the centre pen is
                        the one which is the most popular and it fills the quickest
                        I have had to say: "Close off the centre pen".  I have
                        done it many a time; not once or twice.
               D
                        How did you achieve that? A. Because we had barriers outside
                        the back of the West Stand near to the entrance to the
                        Centre pen, and those barriers used to be drawn across and
                        police would man them and deviate the people to the ends,
                        the wings of the West Terracing.

                   Q.   Did you in fact have barriers near to that position for that
                        specific purpose, if it became necessary? A, Yes, Sir.

                   Q.   Were they there in fact for any other purpose? A. Not as
                        far as I am aware.

                   Q    Can I come to the recent semi-final. A. Yes, Sir.

                   Q    Were you aware of any problems at the 1988 semi-final?
                        A. Only I was told that the Centre pen — and of course it
                        was a full house on that day -- the Centre pen was closed
                        off by the police because the fact that it was so full
                        and they had to deviate them around. That was no problem,
                        that is what I would have expected with our system.

                   Q.   Help us please, who told you that? A. I think that it
                        was -Mr. Thorpe*, my steward at the West end of the. ground.

                   Q.   Can you help us as to when he told you?    Was it on the   J
                        day? A. It was on the day.

                   Q    That is obviously something you would expect him to pass
                        on- trcr you? A. Of course.              ;          .:•: '

      A. I think I discussed it with Inspector Sewell about the
      closing of the centre pens, and also Mr. Mole.

Q.    At that particular match? A. No, not at that match.

Q.    I ask that because you may not be aware that a number of
       senior officers who have given evidence here were apparently
       totally unaware that that had happened at the 1988 semi­
       final. A. That may be so, sir.

Q.    But you were aware of it on the day, from your chief
       steward? A. Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Would not you expect control,
       if it did not itself issue the instruction to close
       off the Centre pens, at any rate to be made aware that
       it was being done? A. I would have expected it, Sir,
       when I was in charge.

Q.l       MR. GOLDSACK: Would you have expected to inform
       control? A. I would have thought, Sir, that it was obvious
       for a start that the centre pen was getting full and that
       control might be the one that issued the instructions to
       close it.   If someone took some action on their own accord
       I would have expected the inspector in charge of the area
       at the West end of the ground to have said: "We have
       closed the ..centre pen". ' r      -

Q.      Coming to 1989 it was reasonable to suppose that that same
        problem might arise, namely that a time would come when
        you would need to close off thecentre tunnel? A. I cannot
      ' say that, can I? How can I say that it was reasonable to
        expect the centre pen? It might have been reasonable to
        expect any of the parts of the ground to be full.

Q.    I thought you said that the areas behind the goal was
      usually the most popular? A. Yes.

Q.    Therefore it was quite likely, was it not, that what
      happened in 1988 would have to happen in 1989? A. I
       concede that, yes.

Q.     Were there any extra stewards on duty at the 1989 semi­
       final to assist in persuading people to go round to the
       outer pens? A. Not to carry out those specific tasks,
       sir, because we did not do that.

Q.     Was there ever any discussion to the effect that perhaps
       that was a stewards job ratJier than the police? A. •N o , if
       the police had told us that they wanted us to do theit we
       w'oiil:

                   Q.   You would no doubt have a lot of routine matters to
                        attend to during the morning and early part of the after­
                        noon. A. True, sir.

                   Q.   Can I come to approximately two o'clock.  Between two
                        and three o'clock where would you be on a match such as
                        this? A. I could be anywhere, Sir.  Primarily I would be
                        in the control room because that is where people know where
             B          I am to be contacted but my duties could take me anywere
                        in the ground.

                   Q.   This year were you in fact in the control room at about
                        two o'clock? A. Yes, I was.

                   Q.   Where, of course, you can find out at the touch of a
                        button how many people are in the ground. A. I do not need
                        to touch a button.  I look at the display monitor from
                        the computer and it tells me.

                   Q.   What was the position at about two o'clock. A. If my memory
                        serves me right I think that there were about 24,000 people
                        in the ground at that time.

Q. Do you agree that at that stage the dis tribution was
   uneven in the sense that there were more Nottingham fans
   in the ground than Liv erpool fans?  A.    Yes, sir.

Q. And so what is your best est imate of the number of Liverpool
   fans still to come in at 2 o'clock?    A.   I can't say,
   sir.   I just cannot say.    I didn't look at that.   There
   was nothing to wor ry about so I had no reason to look at
   it and consider that.

Q. You say "nothing to worry about".                A.     Yes.
Q. If there were 24 , 0 0 0 in altogether but rather more Nottingham
   fans than Liv erpool fans, that suggested, did it not, that
   there were still many, many thousands of Liverpool fans to
   arrive.   A.     That was obvious that there were.

Q.    And you only had r e l ative ly few turnstiles          for them.
     A.   How do you say that, sir?
Q. You had far more t u r n s t i l e s for the Nottingham fans.
   A.   Yes.
Q. Did you at any stage this year on 15th April consider there
   might be a d i f f i c u l t y in getting everyone in for 3 o'clock?
   A.   No, sir.
Q.    How long did you remain in the Club Control Room for?
      A.    I can't say, sir.    I was in and out.  I had lots
      of things to do.   I know for a fact tht I received visits
     ■from Inspector Calvert, Superintendent Marsh, Superintendent
      Greenwood, Ken Evans, the former A.C.C. of Liverpool who
      was Football Liaison.
Q. Let us move then to some time after half two, perhaps twenty
   to three or so. Wer e you conscious of the number in the
   ground then?   A.   At what time, sir?

Q. Between half two and twenty to three.        A.   there were
   considerably more than before.        There was in the region
   of 38,000 I be l i e v e but I cannot be specific on that.

Q. Did you become aware at some stage o.f problems outside
    the Leppings Lane t u r n s t i l e s ?       A.   I had been in and
    out for about three or four occasions and I came in and

    s a w that there was an ope ning of the gate and severa-l ~
    hundred people had come through.                 I don't know how many
    because I didn't see the reason for the gate opening.

 Q. I think by w o r k i n g back you now know that was the first
    opening of Gate C.         A. That is true, sir.
                                                     D.   LOCK


Which enables us to time it.      Prior to becoming aware
that that gate had opened for the first time, had you
either seen on the m on itors or had anyone drawn to your
attention a large build-up of crowds outside the Leppings
Lane turnstiles?     A.      No.   Nothing specific, sir.   I
had seen that crowds were building up      but they appeared to
be orderly, as far as I could see.

Do we take it you had seen that on the monitors or had you
also been outside Leppings Lane yourself? A. No, I hadn't
been outside into Leppings Lane.

What was your immediate reaction on seeing-that that gate
was open?   A.   When the gate was open, I was frightened.

 What did you do?    A.     I immediately went out because
 there were a number of factors which I had to consider,
 not least of all was were the crowds forcing their way
 into the ground?    I didn't know whether that was so.
 I wanted to do a number of things so I did them as I
 came to them.    The first thing I did was, I wanted to
 reinforce the players'      entrance which was immediately
 outside of my room and      was open, wide open, and I had
 intended to put some additional stewards on there but
 the chap who was standing there suggested that we would
 be better off if we locked the door, so I went to the
 caretaker's office and arranged for the key to be taken
 to them.   This happened very quickly, sir.      I went
  through the complex by the players' dressing room and
  I went to the directors' entrance, which is a glass door.
' There were two stewards sta nding there greeting the people
  and handing out pro gramm es and outside there was a lady
  Police Officer, Miss Crottendon.      As I walked along, I
  called to Brian Barker, the Chief Steward --

 Can I just pause there.   You knew that Policewoman did
 you?   A.   I used to be her Superintendent.

 And it would not sur prise you if she got the impression
 you were agitated, from what you have said?     You have
 said you were frightened.   A.   I was not dis playing panic
 or agitation.   When I say I was frightened, I was frightened
 of what the result would be and I left, but I didn't run
 down the corridor in a panic.
  Did you pass any comment to Policewoman Crottendon?
  A.     1 did, sir.     To carry on in sequence, I radioed          r
  f o r Brian Barker- to provide two stewards to support those
  on the door and I went outside and I explained to Miss
:              What 1' ha^J-- s«eT>, that-the gate had^opern&d^a-nMi
  some people had come in, and I told her that I was afraid
v that- s'on^e-b-ody might, oonte .down and try and get ..i-ft.-an-d-i^f*—   ;..
 there was any pToblem for her own safety to step inside^and
 we could close the door.
, Did you tell her that there was still a large number of
  fans outside the ground?   A.   I may have done.
                                              D . LOCK


And that there might be difficulty get ting them in?
A.    No, d e f i n i t e l y not. I never made any comment about
that.    I was just concerned about her safety.

Right, carry on, please.          A. So having achieved that, I
went down the tunnel and I went on to the pitch and I saw
Graham M a c k r e l l and I told him what had happened.      I should
add, sir, and I omitted to add it when I started off, but
before I left the Control Room, I looked at the computer
and I saw that displayed for the North Stand were 2,000
vacancies, app roximately, and on the West end terracing,
2,500 vacancies, approximately again.           Our problem is,
of course, we don't know the disburse ment of those fans
across the ter racing, so I wanted to see where those
vacancies o c c u r r e d on the terracing.    I went down.      I
arrived on the pitch.          It was my int entio n to look and
observe and see where they were, and the first thing I
 noticed was that there were obviously places, seats vacant,
in the North Stand.          When I looked to the West end of the
ground, and I was approxiamtely equi-dis tant between the
players' tunnel and the terracing at that end of the ground
I could see that the West end was quite full.            The centre
pen was very full.          The two wings were showing quite clear
spaces of c o n c r e t e so there were vacancies and I realised
that if the Polce were going to carry out the arrangement
we had, close the centre pen, they w o u ld-ha ve to deviate
the fans a ro und to each wing of the terracing.           I then saw
Mr. M ac krell and I told him that the gate had opened and
I was going to see what was happening, and my intention
was to go to the gate, to find out what had happened, and
call in at the Poice Room as well, but Graham said, "Leave
it to me, I'll do that" and I left him then to return to
my room.
Did you have any further conversa tion with Mr. Mackrell
at that sta ge? A.   No.

To assist with possible identification, do you recall what
you were w e a r i n g ? A. Yes, I was wea ring a light grey
suit.
Was there a Club official wearing a blazer that day that you
recall? A.    The only person with a blazer on was Mr.
Glyn Kirton.

So you had no con versation at that stage with Mr. Mackrell
about n u m b e x s in or numbers still to come? A. No. r

So he goes off to Gate C to sort out what is happening,
where* did -you” go? — A. ~ -I went to return but -ife'*&tTuek -n*e- ■
as I was going to return             I had spoken earlier, I
said         -a number        of-.t-hings to do.- - Ofie ofrfehe- t h i n g s -
that I in fact did was discuss with the N o t tingh am Forest ~
Secretary the position where Brian Clough would be sitting.
As you are aware, he was barred from the touchline.              He
pointed out to me the seats where Mr. Clough and his
assistants w o u l d be seated and I thought not only as a
matter of cou r t e s y but as a matter for their awareness

     that I should inform Ins pector Harvey who was on the
     tou chline then and I had a c o n v e r s a t i o n with him,
     Sergeant Chapman.
          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:            I am sorry, we do not need
     to have absolutely e v e r y t h i n g that happened*. Can you
     try and follow what cou nsel is trying to elicit.

Q.         MR. GOLDSACK:    if you took, as it were, time
     off to attend to those mat t e r s of detail, are we to take
     it that having spoken to Mr. Mac k r e l l you saw no more
     cause for concern at that stage about the opening of the
     gate?     A. True,   sir, bec ause I had seen it closed
     again, of course.
Q. You had seen it closed before you left the Control Room?
   A. Yes.    When it was open there were people coming in
   and then it was closed.
Q.   A few minutes later         you went back to the Control Room;
     is that right?   A.           Eve ntual ly, yes.
Q. What was the next m at ter of s i g n i fic ance that happened
   then?   A. Well,      by this time, sir, the game had
   started and I went back to the Control Room and ss I               got
   into the Control R o o m . H a r o l d Gue st-wa s .on ;the radio trying
   to contact Police Control.             Apparently, he was also
   trying to contact them by lan d- l i n e and he said to me,
   "Doug, they have ops-ned the gates."
Q.'So that c o n v ersa tion with Mr. Guest is after the game has
   started.      You are sure it is after it has started rather
   than just players on the field?        A.   No, the game had
   started.
Q. So we can work out from that that it is, in fact, ten
   minutes or so after the gates were opened, because we
   know it was 14.52.     A.   Yes.
Q.    Is this the position, that you as the Security Officer
     were not aware for some ten min u t e s that the gates had
     actually been ope ned to allow people in.            A.   I am not
     quite sure if .I am ■r i g h t - h e r e . I am not sure if the
     game had started.      I must be clear.          I am not sure if
     the game had started.          Certainly, my Lord, the game had
     started when I got back to the pitch the second t i m e , -
     because I saw it sto p p e d by the Superintendent.

 Q. When you were t o l d by Mr. Guest that they had opened the :
   ~ g a t e s ,--inwhat tone-tff- v/rice di-d he ^tell-you? “A .• Well;,'T
     I can only describe it as disbelieving.
                                                            »

 Q. Was that also your feeling on hea ring thfe information:? '
    A.   it certainly was, sir.

 Q. What was your i m m e d i a t e r e a c tion ?  What did you do?
    A.   I went   down b e c a u s e I wa n t e d to see what a r r a n g e m e n t s
    the Police had made in the Con trol Room.              I tried to

      radio them, I couldn't get through to them at all.               I
      wanted to go down and find out, by going to the West
      end of the ground, what a r r a n g e m e n t s had been made to
      allow this large influx of fans to be moved around,
      b ec ause I knew how full the centre pen was..

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     So how long had you been in
      your Control Room from this return when Mr. Guest told
      you before you went out on to the pit ch?    A.   I walked
      in, my Lord, and he said to me, "Doug, they have opened
      the gates" and I went s tr aight out.

Q. I thought you said you tried to radio?               A.     I did, and so
   did P.C. Guest, he tried to radio.

Q.    You tried to do that bef ore         you went out?    A.      As I was
      going, sir.    I was w a l k i n g   along with my radio.

Q.           HR. GOLDSACK:       Can you help, just before we leave
      the Con trol Room. When Mr. Guest said that to you, did
      you get the imp ressi on he was saying, "They have just
      o pe ned the gates" or that they had been open some time
      or what?     A.    He said, "They have opened the gates"
      and I looked at the mo n i t o r and there was hardly anybody
      there, so I c o u l d n ‘t gain any i m p ressi on of time.
      People were walking thr ough C - G a t e . c

Q. You are trying to radio the Police Control and then     you
   are leaving to go whe re?       A. Down on to the pitch and
   along to the Police Con t r o l Room.

Q. With a view to spe aking to the senior Police Officer?
   A.   Yes.
Q.     Did you actually get there?             A. No.

Q.     Who did you speak to on the         way? A.       I saw Graham
      M ac k r e l l and he was with Glyn Kirton.

Q. What did you say to them?          A.       I said, "Graham, the Police
   have opened the gates" and he said to me, "Can we accommodate
   those?" and I said, "Well, we had 4,500 places vacant in
   the North Stand and the terraces.              -I think so" but I
   didn't know what the a r r a n g e m e n t s were with regard to the
   way they were being pus hed around.

Q.     Did you have any d i s c u s s i o n in the half an hour before
       the kic k - o f f with any one about the pos sibil ity of delaying
       the kic k-off ?       A.    No, sir.
Q.     Was it ever raised by a ny one in your presence?             A.     No, sir.

Q.      After- that c o n v e r s a t i o n with Mr. Mackrell, what did you
        do?    A.   I went to go along the pitch to see whe ther I
     >■ could discover what was h a p p e n i n g and I not iced at that
        time that there were people coming over the fence.              There
        was a large gat herin g of fans beh ind the Liv erpool goal
        and the teams were com ing off and as I neared I saw the

                           Q. So to assist with timing, your r ec ollec tion of this discussion
                              with Mr. M a c k r e l l is that it is just a short time before
                              the pla yers came off the field?         A.   Yes’.  I can't recall
                              now how long the m a t c h was on for.
                   B
                           Q. Six minutes.     A.      It must have been around that time, yes,
                              a short time b e f o r e the players came off the pitch.

                           Q. And almost i m m e d i a t e l y after that your a t t e n t i o n is taken
                              up with the events be h i n d the goal.         A.       I never arrived

                              years at the L e p p i n g s Lane end on the control and under
                              the control of the Police was not simply dir e c t e d to crowd
                              c on trol but was a c t u a l l y dir ected to crowd safety and to

                    Q. And you would expect that in every operational order for any
                       match? - A. Yes.

                    Q. And the typical sort of order which you might expect would be
                       the one we have already looked at this morning, but by all
                       means have a look at yourself, which is at document 21 in the
                       South Yorkshire Police bundle, Serial 9? - A. The format is a
               B       little different, but in general I think....

                    Q. We will pause and have a little look. - A. What do you want me
                       to look at specifically?

                    Q. Serial 9 in document 21.           Can you see it?   Leppings Lane
                       terraces. - A. Yes, sir.

                    Q. You see:  "Ensure pens are filled in accordance with
                       instructions from control” . That is the sort of thing you
                       would expect to see.  Is that right? - A. "Maintain order and
                       ensure pens are filled in accordance...."   No, we were more
                       detailed than that.

                    Q. Even more detailed? - A. Yes.
               D    Q. But you would certainly expect something like that at least? -
                       A. Of course, yes.

                    Q. When you then transferred to the club did you ever yourself
                       have sight of the operation orders of the Police for any given
                       match? - A. Yes, Graham Mackrell used to receive a copy of the
                       order.

                    Q.   Did he ever   show it to you? - A. Yes.

                    Q.   Did you see the operational        order for the Semi-Final of 1989?
                         - A. No.

                    Q. Was there any reason for that? - A. Yes.

                    Q.   What? -A. The Police did not provide         us with one.

                    Q.   Did you see the operational        order for 1988? - A. Yes.

                              MR. KING:   Sir, I am now at a. total disadvantage because
                         I have not got a copy of the 1988 one.   I d o n ’t think I have
                         ever seen one.

                             would ask you to read Serial 14 in that 1988 Semi-Final, which
                             is to do with the Leppings Lane terrace, and look back again
                             to Serial 9, the same duty in the League game in document 21?
                             - A. Yes.  I have looked at the differences.

                    Q. Do you see the omission as between the Leargue operational
                       order and the Semi-Final operational order of the express
              B        instructions as to the filling of the pens in accordance with
                       instructions from control? - A. I do, sir.

                    Q.       Does that come as a shock to you? - A. I must admit I am
                             surprised.

                    Q.       It comes as a shock? - A.      If you wish to say "shock".

                    Q.       On your evidence it ought to be kept in, should not it?      - A.
                             It should, certainly.

                    Q. When you read this in 1988 did you say to yourself, "There is
                       not a word in the operational order for the semi-final to do
                       with the filling of the terraces"? - A. No, sir, I did not
                       read it in that detail.

                    Q. If you had read it what would you have done? - A. I would have
                       questioned it if I had read it and noticed it.

                    Q. Do you understand even now why it is omitted? - A. According
                       to what Mr. Sewell said this morning quite a number of things
                       were omitted on oversight, so I d o n ’t really understand why it
                       was omitted.

                    Q. That as I understand Inspector Sewell’s evidence was not an
                       oversight, it was deliberate? - A. It may have been, sir, but
                       if it was it certainly was not drawn to the attention of the
                       club.

                    Q. Let me pursue this with you if I may.  It was deliberate, so
                       Inspector Sewell would say, because those plans which were in
                       the League game orders and which had always been there in one
                       form or another, were directed to ensuring for crowd control
                       purposes that individual pens which had been designated were
                       filled first, so the Police had an eye on away supporters.
                       That was the purpose of that planning and that system of
                       packing? Do you understand that? - A. So he says.

                    Q. And you disagree with that totally? - A. Not for the purpose
                       of crowd control.      For both purposes of crowd control and
                       s a f e t y I have, already explained the way in which we took
                     - particular.pains to ensure that the pens were filled correctly
                       and observation>■ and I used.- to say "Close them

                    Q.            LORD JUSTICE T A Y L O R :_ . When you were Superintendent
                             there, before you left -the -Police, were you i n !the • ’
                             corresponding role to the role held by Mr. Murray on this
                             occasion? - A. Yes, sir.
                H
                    q    .       MR. KING:     When you are filling individual pens one by

   one, presumably there has to a plan in advance of which
   particular pen should be filled first? - A. Of course.

Q. And that no doubt is put down in writing somewhere?       Those are
   the instructions? - A. Yes.

Q. Somebody therefore has to be designated presumably to ensure
   the filling of that particular pen first? - A. Yes.

Q. A specific system? - A. Yes.

Q. And you are controlling the filling at the point of entry, are
   you not? - A. At the point of entry on to the terraces?

Q. Yes, and in so doing you are not waiting for signs of
   discomfort or signs of people in distress.     You are actually
   controlling the numbers going in with a view to not reaching
   that point presumably? - A. That is precisely the object of
   safety, that you d o n ’t reach a point where it is too full and
   it   is unsafe for people.

Q. The only way you can monitor for overcrowding by observation
   is     to wait until you   see signs of discomfort, isnot it? Tha
   is     the only real way   you can do it? - A. You d o n ’t have to
   wait and see people standing on each other’s heads. You wait
   until you can see there is no room left on the terrace. You
   don't wait until-they are pressing down.    You then say, as I
   d i d , ’’Close the pen” .

Q. So are you saying you are expecting somebody to be
  / specifically designated to keep looking at a given pen in
    order to see whether or not the number has been yet ;reached
    which is safe? - A. There was an Inspector in charge of the
    West end of the ground, and he looked and walked around, and
    looked there.   There were serials placed, half used to go on
    the terraces and half used to be employed behind the West
    Stand.  I looked there and I designated myself to have a look.
    I could see quite clearly because it is the best view in the
    ground.   If you look from that box it is the best view of the
    Leppings Lane terraces in the ground, and I could see quite
    clearly whether or not there was any danger to anybody in
    those pe ns .

 Q. Would you if you had been in charge of a full capacity ground
    at that end of the ground have allowed a situation to arise
    whereby there was obviously a disparity arising between the
    end pens and the middle pens? -A. There can always be a—
    disparity, but you are saying a capacity crowd; . You do n’t -
.   allow the disparity to arise.  You stop it.   .      -,

Q. A capacity crowd is one which is going to fill the whole end?
   - A. Precisely.

Q. And you d o n ’t wait you say, I suspect, until you can see the
   middle pens are absolutely full and the side pens half empty.
   That is a situation you d o n ’t want to arise at all? - A. True.

                    Q. When did you personally in 1989 notice that exact situation
                       had arisen? - A. I noticed when C gate was opened, when it
                       went for the first time as I have just described, one of the
                       reasons I went down on-to the pitch was to see whereabouts the
                       vacancies which I knew were there, 2,500 on the Leppings Lane
                       end, were.  I went down there and looked and I could see that
                       the centre pen was full and there were spaces on the two
              B        wings.

                    Q. You did not have to go down to see that.  That was obvious
                       just looking across, was not it? - A. From where?

                    Q. Between the hours of half-past-2 and 3 o ’clock did you at any
                       stage have an opportunity to see the state of the Leppings
                       Lane end terrace? - A. Yes.

                    Q. From where? - A. From the pitch.

                    Q.   At what sort of time? -A. if I say I went down on to the pitch
                         3 or A times between 20-past-2 and the time I went down
                         because of the gate, that would be 10-to-3-ish, I went three
                         or four times.

                    Q.   During that time you must have been able to observe that the
                         central pens were filling up and getting very full and the end
                         pens were not, because that was obvious? - t\. No, it was not
                         like that.

                             MR. KING:   May I borrow a photograph which I know should
                        have been exhibited.  There was a photograph taken at about
                     2.59.

                              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Yes.   It was resting on there
                         yesterday.

                                   THE WITNESS:   Yes, it would'be at 2.59.

                              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   The one that was put in yesterday,
                         something like 212 if I am not mistaken.

                              MR. GLASGOW:   Sir, while that is being looked for could
                         I tell you that the other photographs we have given you this
                         morning, so you are not misled by them, are the 1988 game. We
                         promised to provide you with photographs of the 1988 game and
                         i did not want you to be confused.   They are still on the
                         balustrade in front of you.   The ones we gave you this
                         morning were pursuant to a promise yesterday of the climbing
                         over'the fencing in 1988.

                     G,. vfv? MR.;KfcNG- ,v One ;can:~ see at 2.59 the state of the. central
                         pens? - A . Y e s .

                    '~Q.':'rI'am   not going to ask^you1 about those at the moment, because I
                            have   no doubt you are going to say they did not look quite
                            like   that when you were looking between 20-past-2 and J.O-to-3.
                H           - A.   Correct.

                    Q.   D o n ’tlet us look at that. Let's look at the side pen which
                         as we look at it would be pen 6.   Yes? -A. Yes.

                    Q.   That is-at 2.59. - A. I accept that.

                    Q.   I d o n ’t think it would   be unfair to say it is half empty at
                         2.59? -A. Yes.
              B
                    Q. It follows earlier than that it must have been even more
                       empty? -A. Quite.

                    Q. So it must have hit you in the face, looking at that end, let
                       alone the central pens, that that side pen was not filling at
                       all? - A. When are you telling me I saw that?

                    Q. Between 20-past-2 and lO-to-3 at these various occasions when
                       you say you went down on the pitch? - A. No, the centre pen
                       was full.

                    Q. I am not talking about the central pen. - A. The other pens
                       were building up slowly, but I said to you and you can check
                       with the notes, that at 2.50 when I went down after the gate
                       opened that there was space on both the wing pens.

                    Q. Mr. Lock, just listen to the question. At some stage between
                       20-past-2 and.before .10-to-3 y o u J.boked .at that end of the -•
                       Leppings Lane end? - A. Yes.

                    Q. It must have hit you in the face, not about the central pen,
                       but that the side pen was not filling at all, hardly? - A. I
                       accept that.  D o n ’t condition my reply, please. I accept that
                       they were filling slower.

                    Q. If this is the state of pen 6 at 2.59 it does not take much
                       imagination to work out that it must have been even emptier in
                       the half-hour before? - A. I will accept that.     Well, I w o n ’t
                       accept it, no, because you c a n ’t say that to me because you
                       were not there and you d i d n ’t see it.

                    Q. Are you accepting that you did not identify a major difference
                       between the rate at which the central pens were obviously
                       filling and the rate at which the side pens were filling? - A.
                       Yes.

                     Q. Did you observe that? - A. I am accepting that I did not
                        notice.

                     Q. You did not notice that? - A. Yes.

                         .You-are .not now saying that the central pens weee-.full? . You,
                          did not even notice a disparity? -A. Of course I noticed a
                          disparity, but I did not notice such a disparity that I would
                         -b e !alarmed at what is going on.

                     Q. Are you seriously saying that to this Tribunal? -A. I am.

                               - A. I would have asked the Police what they were doing with
                               regards to the closing of the pens.

                          Q. Exactly, because if you noticed that disparity you would- have
                             said to yourself, "The Police are not doing their job
                             properly"? - A. Precisely.

                  B       Q. The job you say they had to do? - A. Yes, but I did not notice
                             it.

                          Q. Can I ask you about something else. We have heard evidence
                             from Inspector Darling that around 2 o ’clock he had a
                             conversation with somebody in the control room, the club
                             control room, as to the rate at which the ground was filling
                             up, and that someone  said to him, anobservation, that there
                             was clearly a major difference in effect between 1989 and
                             1988, and that whereas at that time the previous year there
                             were about 20,000 in the ground, now there were only 12,000.

                                    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        20,000 Liverpool.

                                    MR. KING:   Sir, the original observation was in the
                               ground generally, and then the observation developed that it
                   D           was the Liverpool fans.  It was in two stages, as I understand
                               it:

                          Q. First of all the general observation that the ground at abou:
                             2 o ’clock was not as full in 1989 as it was in 1988. Was that
                             person you? - A. No.

                          Q.' Did you notice that? - A. No.

                          Q. Let me ask you what you would have done if you had noticed it,
                             and I will put to what I will ask you you would have done if
                             you had noticed it.   If you had noticed this that at about 2
                             o ’clock there were some 8,000 fans less than there were
                             previously and that there were only 12,000 in the ground, and
                             the bulk of that shortfall it was obvious from the way the
                             ground was filling were at the Leppings Lane end, the
                             Liverpool end, would you have been concerned? - A. Yes, I
                             would have asked the Police, "Why is this happening?".

                          Q. What would you have been concerned about? - A. The fact they
                             might arrive late.

                          Q. Not only that, you only had an hour left? - A. That is what I
                             am saying, that they might have arrived late after the kick-
                             off

                          Q.   E v e n , .with* respect,_ they .-.arrived in the next quarter-of-aa-^-
                               hour you were going to be in difficulty, were you not? - A.
                               Yes.

                          Q. And that is not arriving late, is it? - A. No.

                      H   Q. So whoever it was who noticed that on the evidence, in the
                             club control room on behalf of the club, what would you have

                                                    D.J. LOCK


     expected them to do? - A. I would have expected the Police
     Inspector to have done something about it first, and he
     obviously did not, but I would have expected them to have
     drawn it to my attention if that conversation did in fact take
     place.

Q.   Never mind the conversation with the Police.   If you in the
     control room had noticed this and the person who noticed it,
     because you have club personnel in the control room? - A. Yes.

Q.   If they had noticed it what would you expect them to do? - A.
     Bring it to my attention so I could speak to the Police about
     it.

Q. And then what would you have expected the Police to do? - A. I
   d o n ’t really know because I d o n ’t know what reaction the
   Police would have had to that.        I d o n ’t know what the Police
   arrangements were outside the ground, sir, so you are putting
   me in a difficult position.      It is not that I am unwilling to
   answer but I c a n ’t.

Q. Are you aware - I am sure you are aware - of the number of
   turnstiles which were allocated to the Leppings Lane terrace?
   - A. Yes.

Q. How many? - A. Seven.

Q. For how many people? - A. 10,100.

Q. What rate do you say turnstiles can effectively in a crowded
  /game like this take people through? -A.  You are asking me
   questions which are really beyond my knowledge, but I
   understand from conversations with Mr. Mackrell that the
   Police were expecting them to come through, both the club and
   the Police, were expecting them to come through at a rate of
   about 1,000 an hour per turnstile.

Q. I think Mr. Mackrell yesterday said 800. - A. I will accept
   that.

Q. On that basis, with half-an-hour to go, if you are going to
   get everybody in, how full do you say, roughly, I d o n ’t want
   figures;   I d o n ’t want you to do it in your head;    roughly,
   how many do you think ought to be in the ground by half-past-
   2, for example, if you are effectively going to get the rest
   in in the last half-hour? What percentage would you say? - A.
   I donVt really know, because if I might d i g r e s s a second, my
   experience of Sheffield Wednesday is that people do tend to
- come late.     I accept we are putting them through the whole of
   the. turnstiles      They come through about 1,000 per hour.. •--•

Q.   What was your position with Sheffield Wednesday? - A. The
     security officer.                                   ~  ' '' '

Q.   Just give us some idea on a full capacity game of how many you
     expected would have to be in the ground with half-an-hour to
     go if you are going to get everybody through 7 turnstiles of

  that 10,000.  About how many? - A. Well, how,are you telling
  me are wanting to come in, because I believe that around 10-
  t o - 3 ....

Q. Would you just answer my question.  Listen.  There are 10,000
   people who have to get through 7 turnstiles. - A. Yes.

Q. Never mind about what happened on the day.  Just think, from
   your experience of the ground, a full capacity, to get through
   7 turnstiles in your experience what percentage of that 10,000
   must have already arrived by half-past-2 if you are going to
   have enough time in the last half-hour to get the remainder
   in, roughly how many? - A. Roughly I would have thought 6,000.

Q. That is over half? - A. Yes.

Q. It is in fact nearer three-quarters you need in the ground
   with half-an-hour to go if everything goes right at that rate
   of 800? Does that astonish you? - A. Well, you are asking me
   questions I am not really qualified to answer.

Q. Did it ever strike you as security officer with half-an-hour
   to go, just looking at the empty spaces, that there was no
   way, leave aside opening gate C or anything like that? - A.
   Are we back to what was on the day now or a hypothetical
   question?

Q. No.  On the day. - A. On the day at 10-to-3 I believe there
   was somewhere in the region of 4,000 people outside that West
   end.

Q. So it never ever entered your head with half-an-hour to go
   there were going to be problems? - A. The point is at lO-to-3
   there were 4,000 people somewhere outside.  They were not
   going to use 7 gates, because I have already told you there
   were 2,000 vacancies in the North Stand and 2,500 in Leppings
   Lane, and so they were coming through the whole of the 23
   gates.  They could have been accepted into the ground in 15 to
   20 minutes.

        MR. KING:    I have no further questions, thank you.

          MR. GOLDSACK:    May I just clarify one matter before the
    adjournment.   It is something Mr. Collins spoke of just before
    we adjourned last night.    It was the figures concerning blood
    alcohol results taken from the deceased, and he said that
    broadly it. was one-third , one-third and one-third.. May I be a
    little more accurate.    There were 44 of the deceased with no
  - discernible trace of alcohol, 36 between 0 and 80, and only 15
    over .80 . Of those 15,. two were over 150 and the highest, was
    177.   I'mention it at this stage because I think the press may
    be going to report it.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Thank you very much.       We will,
   break until 5-past-2.

            THIRTY-FIRST DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                 THURSDAY, 29th JUNE,   1989

                    (AFTERKOOH   SESSION)


                 DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK Recalled    '

            Cross-e::amined by    MR. JACKSON:

Mr. Lock, I hope you will forgive ne if in the sircth
week of this Inquiry I put to you some propositions
which you nay find childlike.  I do so because of the
nature of the conduct of this Inquiry. - A. Yes, sir.

     LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:    Not sure what you mean by
that, but still.

     liR. JACKSON:   Sir, may I make it quite clear what
I do mean??   I feel it is terribly, terribly important.
It will be nv submission for a number of weeks repeated
and extensive cross-examination has been put forward
seeking to support propositions that are untenable in
theory and are not supported by any of the evidence
given even by those who speak for the parties involved.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well now.. Hr . J a ckin, whv
donot you lust ask the witness   some questions?

     HR. JACKSON:  Mr. Lock, it is a simple proposition,
is it not, that the loading and distribution of terraces
combined both crowd control and safety problems? - A.
Yes, sir.




- A. Yes, sir.

It is well-known to anyone who has had anything at all
to do with the policing or stewarding of those terraces
that there may well arise dangers out of uneven dis­
tribution? - A. Yes, sir.

You as a Superintendent for years took it upon yourself
and the officers under your control to monitor and ensure
the even distribution? - A. Me did, sir.

There has been the use of the expression find their own
level and you in fact adopted it in a limited sense this
morning. -Do ir understand you to mean when you'use “The '
expression find their own level you meant they had a
choice of which of .the-a.reas of the terrace to initially
go to? - A. In a big match, yes, sir.
                                                                        D. TOCX

                        And that again is because of the lack of the crowd
                        control and segregation problem at the semi-final?
                        - A. Yes, sir.

                      0. Bearing in mind all the uatters would you now accept
                         as right that the crushing at the front of- pens 3 anc
                         4 was caused by the overcrowding of pens 3- and 4? - A.
                         Yes, sir.
                B
                      0. I ask you that in that way arid say it was childlike
                         because some weeks ago Mr. Mole would not accept that
                         proposition.  Hould you agree that any system, and I
                         put together the Police .ir.d the club for this purpose,
                         any system that allowed the fans to find their own level
                         in the sense of going into the pens unmonitored was
                         clearly dangerous?- A. Not in our experience, sir. Until
                         this incident happened, of course, in my time at the
                         ground I had not experienced any problem with regards to
                         danger to the crowds.

                      o, Forgive me, Mr. Lock.   I understood you to say that this
                         system, the system you used, involved monitoring, not
                         necessarily by turnstile count but by visual observation?
                         - A. Y es, it did, sir.
                 D
                      Q. Can you give any explanation at all why the years of
                         experience were .thrown away'  A. iloiie       si:

                      o, It seems unbelievable, does it not. that anyone, whatever
                         rank cr position, could sensibly suggest that 1C.C0C fans
                         could be allowed to evenlv distribute themselves safelv
                         on those terrac is? -A. No, sir, because    r.ac r.c c big
                         crowds both in the League and m semi-finals and they
                         had evenly distributed themselves.   I know there was the
                         1981 situation but we took steps to prevent that occurring
                         again by policing it.

                      0. Mr. Lock, that is exactly what I am talking about.   I am
                         suggesting, you see, that your evidence is totally accurate
                         and so sensible it bears no contradiction, that is that
                         the s ystem essentially should have been that someone should
                         have monitored the distribution of the fans. You did it
                         yourself?- A. Yes, sir.

                         What I am asking is can you give us any possible explanation
                         as to why those under Chief Superintendent Duckenfield seem
                         to have stopped following your sensible policy? -A. No, sir.
                         I was not aware they had stopped.               ........

                      0 . But you now are? - A.   am.

                      0 , ilr. Loc , it must have given you great concern, must it
                          not, to find on the terraces of the club who emoloved
                          you people criished to dffiith and a system that you

would have made it safer had been abandoned? - A. I was
very - well, I was appalled and I was emotionally dis­
turbed by what had happened, obviously, sir.

That is why I am asking you, Mr. Lock, if you can tell us
 any possible reason because I will 'suggest one at the end
 if you cannot.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   .Well, he has said he does not
 twice so why do not you suggest it?

     MR. JACKSON:   Quite clearly the safety of the fans
was of no concern to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield?
-A. Well, I cannot ....

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I do not see hoi.-; you can ask
 this witness that question, with respect, I-!r.*Jackson.
 I have got the flavour of your argument but this witness
 cannot be asked what was in Hr. Duckenfield's mind.

     MR. JACKSON:   Hr. Lock, may I ask you this then?
Is it conceivable to you that anyone who was sitting or
standing in that control room that day could have missed
the overcrowding in the central pens? - A. I was not
there and you are asking me to make a conjecture that if he
was sat there and the thing was running normally, they
were coming through at a normal pace, they were’ finding
their own level and then because of what vjas happening
outside,and I can understand Mr. Marshall's predicament,
a request is to open the gates and the system is being
overridden by the influx of so many people at that time,
I do not think that Mr. Duckenfield would have disregarded
the safety of those people.

Mr. Lock, we know there was something like a si:: or seven
minute delay between the first request forthe gates to be
opened and the eventual arrival of the supporters at the
tunnel entrance. - A. Yes, sir.

Do you find it surprising that no-one seems to have con­
sidered the effect on the crowd inside of the influ:: of
people through a gate? - A. This seems to have been missed
entirely, sir.  I was surprised that no request was made
either for the Police or the stewards to secure the entry
to that tunnel and to deviate the fans who were going to
be allowed into the ground  to do so.

Mr. Lock, may I move to two other matters?   First of all,
the monitoring of the crowds by the club control room.
- A. Yes.sir.

We understand that there were videos recorded by the club.
- A.. That is true, sir.                                 . -

They would have been able to tell us, would they not<, that
                                                                          D. LOCK

                       which was seen by the officers in the club control room?
                       - A. Host of our videos are concentrated on the 95 gates
                       a n d t h e v have static cameras and they are being recorded
                       for that alone.       Mow, within our control roon we also have
                       a facility which enables us to look at the_Police cameras
                       within and without 'the ground but to be able to do this,
                       we have onlv one nionitor, so we have a selection button.
                       Now, we do not record that material. That' is recorded in
                       the’Police control, so all I have recorded is the entry
              B        of fans through turnstiles and, coincidentally, t^e
                       entry - the gates being opened at C gate.

                     Q. T-Iell, Mr. Lock, is it sufficient to say this, that there
                        ou?ht to be available videos that would assist this
                        Inquiry? - A. Yes, sir.

                     0. Uhere are    they?- A. They were takenaway frcn our   control
                        room, sir.   and I cannot answer that question.

                     Q. Ue understand they were.  We understand^some were lost.
                        - A. That nay be a kind way of putting it. sir.

                     0 Yes, it was a kind way.   Until I hear the reverse. -.A.

                                                      D. J. LOCK

Q.     Can you tell the Inquiry what was the first occasion you
       learned that two videos which could have been of assistance
       had been stolen? A. May I just say this first, sir. After
     , the incident of the day and having spoken to Mr. Mackrell,
       it was obvious to me that we needed to secure those tapes
       because they would be needed for some type of Inquiry.
       Graham Mackrell agreed readily to this. We spoke to the
       technician, Roger Holdsworth, and said that it was essential
       that we preserved those tapes for possible evidential
       use and that he should remove them from the machines, the
       video machines.   I was present when he ejected them all.
       Unfortunately I had to go to the police headquarters to attend
       the police press conference that night and I did not return
       to that room.   I went to Graham Mackrell's office later
       to tell him what -had happened at headquarters and I collected
       my raincoat and brief case from there.

           The next mornign when I saw Roger Holdsworth, the Sunday
       morning following the disaster, he then told me that two
       to the tapes were missing.

Q.     Were they, by coincidence, tapes of the entry of fans at
       the Leppings Lane end? A. One of them unfortuantely was
       running a blank tape altogether.  It was a camera that
       we were not using and it was of no use whatsoever.  The
       other one was of the Leppings Lane end, yes, but it was
       of a distance shot and we had other cameras covering the
       same angle.  In actual fact if you could call it this Che
       one tape which was showing something was worthless.

Q.     May I turn to a different matter.  Have you had communication
     . over the last two years via Mr. Thorpe, from the stewards
       at the Leppings Lane end? A. I speak to him frequently,
       sir .

Q.    In particular about observations made by the stewards at
      the Leppings Lane end? A. In what particular respect?

Q.    In respect of what is described as the redundancy of the
      radial fences. A. No, I have never spoken to Mr. Thorpe
      about that.

Q.    Mr. Lock, do you recall whether or not you saw the
      operational order for 1987? A. I cannot recall, Sir.  I
      think that I would have done because if I had not I think
      that I would have commented on it.

Q.     The reason that I ask is that in the Sheffield Wednesday ..
       bundle at page 75, we need not turn to it, we have the
       operational order for 1987, but only part of itv We do
       not have the serial deployment. A. No.

Q.     That was the first semi-final since 1981, the first semi-
     - * fin-al— wit h t h e radial feaces in. pjositiom. A. Yes^.. it-vtas   -

Q.    We understand that that match, at that match, the
                                                D. J. LOCK

pens were filled in sequence. A. I cannot recall, sir.   I
know the police were filling the pens on that day and I
know they were very concerned because it was a Sunday
match. The kick-off should have been twelve o lclock and
there was a great deal of traffic on the motorway and road
hold-ups.  There were roadworks both north and south. As
a result the crowd were obviously going to arrive very late
and the Chief Superintendent asked for the* match to be put
back for 15 minutes. That was in fact carried out. The
police were still controlling and bringing the fans into
the ground as late as twenty to one because Mr. Moore
radioed through to me and said: "I have a coach load of
Coventry fans that have just arrived and I have to get
them into the terracing.   I propose bringing them along
the-touch line and putting them in that way". The police
were controlling it then, sir.

The reason I ask you about this is to take up a slightly
different aspect of my Learned friend, Mr. King's point.
You heard Inspector Sewell say that the police were looking
primarily at the pens from a segregation point of view
and you disagreed with that. A. I think that he answered
Mr. Glasgow in another way, sir.

Quite clearly when you were there, and as far as you knew,
even until 1989 the pens and their  monitoring and observat­
ion by the police was both safety and segregation? A. Yes,
sir.'.

When the pens were to be used in sequence the police put in
their operation order that they should be observed? A. Yes.

When they were to be filled by the fans themselves at a
semi-final that was missing from the operation order by
design? A. I do not know, sir, because I did not receive
a copy of the 1989 order.

We have heard that     it has been by Mr. Sewell. A.        Yes.

Thank you. A. Thank you, sir.

Just one matter, Mr. Lock, it        is right, is it not, page
six of your statement, I will        remind you what you said
there. That is the time that         you were talking about a
crash barrier that used to be        in pen three. A. Yes.

And the position was, as you probably now know, in 1986
that was removed. A. Yes, I do know.             = •.   e;

                          So that it was common practice to have two police officers
                          actually on the terrace within the pen directing the
                          people? A. At least, sir.

                    i.    Sometimes more? A. Yes.

                                            Cross-examined by MR. MAXWELL

                    v^.   Would you please go to page four of your statement , to
              B       *   the bottom, where you are referring to an occasion when you
                          were in charge as a police officer and you are recollecting
                          the largest crowd as 48,000, that is on the top of page.
                          A. I have got it here on page four, Sir.

                          You explain there that on that occasion you recall that the
                          "Crowd of fans arriving was such that it became obvious
                          that we could not get everyone into the ground in time
                          for kick-off", and you asked for the kick-off to be delayed
                          A. I did.

                          Was that because you f eared that there might be some public
                          order situation if you did not have it delayed or was it
                          that you felt sorry fo r them that they might miss a portion
                          of the match, or what?      A. I think all those emotions play
                          a part.    You want to g et  the people in safely. They were
                          becoming concerned, as    naturally   they do, that they want
                          to get into the ground    to  see the  kick -off. You do want
                          to gpt: theT. in.  You c ould have a piibl ic oraei situation
                          and fox ail those reas ons I asked the club secreti.; j u:.d lie
                          agreed to approach the referee and the match was put back
                          15 minutes.

                          On the 15th April, 1989, at about 2.50 you saw that there
                          were about two and a half thousand vacancies in the West
                          end terracing? A. Yes, sir.

                          Would you accept that at the Green Guide rate of 750 an
                          hour for each of the turnstiles A to G, which served the
                          West end terracing, it would have taken rather more than
                          some 22 minutes at least, to get them in. A. Yes, sir.

                    Q.    At 800 an hour 2li minutes. A. I accept that.

                     Q    Did it occur to you at ten to three that to ensure that
                          these fans saw the whole of the match it should be put
                          back, these fans outside, the four thousand odd that you
                          knew were there? A. Are you asking me that I should
                          override the police system, sir?

                           Did it occur to you to ask to have the-match put back?
                          A. The situation did occur to me, yes, but, of course,
                          'I ■ 'W as■ *n g 3^‘Consu- 1 1 € ;3 n d ■ X —d i d n o t lcnowi :in f ^ c t 1 h £ ?£.-.
                           the police were asking for                the     match to be put back for
                           15 minutes.         Unfortuantely         at     that  moment the .first time

                            I reviewed the tape afterwards I did not know the reason.
                            From then on I was so busy that I never had the opportunity
                            to speak to the police.  By the time I got back into my
                            control room it was in my mind to ask whether the match
                            was to be put back but by the time I got back of course
                            the gates had been opened and the incident was under way.

                      Q.    It is an unfortuante coincidence of all th'ese events
                            that prevented you mentioning what was in your mind,
                B           was it? A. It was what happened, yes.

                                       Cross-examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT

                      Q.    I think you told us that you were a keen football supporter
                            in addition to your professional experience of football. •
                            A. Yes, sir.

                      Q.    I notice that in the article to which we have referred
                            — we need not look at it again — you were concerned for
                            offering constructive criticism and I think a number of
                            ideas for bringig money into football to improve facilities
                            at ground. A. Yes, sir.

                      Q.    I imagine you have experience or have visited a number of
                            football grounds of various sizes. A. I have, sir.

                      Q.    Of course, Sheffield Wednesday were at the top of the
                            football entertainment industry, it is one ol the laipent
                            £rjunas in the country. A. Yes, sir.

                      Q.     And one of the largest home crowds and there are many
                             many grounds with much smaller crowds, smaller physically
                            'and running much smaller crowds, if I may put it that way.
                             A. Yes.

                      Q.     Can I ask you a little bit about terraces.  It is right,
                             is it not, that when one views terraces at other football
                             grounds very frequently the entrances are at the side or
                             in the middle or even at the bottom. A. In all those places,
                             sir.

                      Q.     In all those places. So the configuration of the Leppings
                             Lane central pens, with the tunnel at the top — and we know
                             the configuration, as you appreciate very well — cannot
                             be said to be typical of terraces up and down the country.
                             A. I know grounds of a similar design, sir.

                      Q.-    Of course, but.also with entrances in different places and
                             feed-ins, concourses much smaller leading into the main
                             entrance before you get to the terrace. A. of course, they
                             are all different because of the geography of the area

                      Q.     It may be an obvious point and I will not press it further

        but tell me this: In your experience of other grounds are
        there many other grounds where police in effect stewar
        the away terraces? A. Yes, I have seen it occurring on
        numerous grounds.       I cannot recall — and I stand corrected
        if someone says that they do it at a particular gr0“^ * *
        cannot recall a ground where I have seen stewards actually
        p a c k i n g crowds, iven at Wembley. The police quite frequently
        a?raig! - I have seen it at Leeds United, and the police
        have a similar control to the one we have in Sheffield
        Wednesday.        I have seen it in the Barnsley area, I have
        seen it in quite a number of grounds.

Q.      Thank you.   You ha.e described how you used “ "onitor
        the crowd actively with you or your subordinate officers
        out and about and actively considering whether there was
        room in the particular parts of the Leppings Lane terraces.
        A. Yes, Sir.

Q.      You have told us that. A. Yes, Sir.

Q.      I forget, did you have close-circuit television in your
        room? A. No, we did not.
Q       Do you think that there is a danger for the police controller
        not even deliberately but just instinctively to regard the
        close circuit television as a magic eye which tells him
        everything without going outside? Can that be a ganger,
        do vou think? A.. My experience both-as a p-,•     c*^er
        in the security r.ie at Shffield Wednesday             th-*e
        is a controller who has got to remain in the control box.
        Other senior officers do go out and feed back
        and I do not think they regard it as a magic e y e , I think
        they regard it as another means of receiving and being
         able to assess the crowds and inforamtion.

         That is it, it is an assistance, it is an aid. A. It is.
 Q.
         To be able to use — can I put it this way -- your street
 Q.      wisdom, your sense of the crowd as an experienced officer,
         it is far better to go out and look at them or, indeed,
         w a l k through them. Is not that right? A . Of course, you
         may then find that there is not actually anyone in contro
         in the control room.
 0       We have a ground controller and' a Police Commander and
         I think we have that at every semi-final we have heard
         about. A. Yes, and we have the senior officers going out
         and doing what you want them to do.

    0     I t h i n k that we have heard that Mr. Mole in particular
          as the P o l i c e Commander, not the Ground Commander, was
          v"ery: 'active in being out-and about .-and would only visit
          the police control box on occasions. That does not

Q. One other matter.        You have des cribe d to us how you saw
   or were told that the gate had opened - in retrospect,
   Gate C's opening for the first time - and you went out
   hurriedly and did the things you told us about and then
   e nc ounte red Mr. Mac k r e l l and I think you said Mr. Kirton
   was with him.      A.       That was the second time, sir.

Q.   And you had a c on versa tion.        Now, Mr. Mackrell was your
     boss, in effect, was he not?           A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   And you had various things of importance to tell him, am
     I right in thinking that in effect you drew Mr. Mackrell
     aside to have this c o n v e r s a t i o n with him? A. I didn't
     have, to, sir; he was on his own the first time I spoke
     to him.

                          By LORD JUS TICE T A Y L O R :

Q. Can I just, before Mr. W o o d w a r d asks you questions, clarify
   this?   You were asked about Police stewarding the away
   terraces in other gro u n d s and you said, "I can't recall
   a crowd where I have seen s t e w a r d s packing crowds." Is
   that right?   A.   That's right, sir.

Q. If you actually talk about s ee ing someone packing a crowd
   in. what are you a c t u a l l y s ee ing? . I understanH that the
   Felice make a d e c i s i o n if they are doing the stewarding
        when a p a r t icul ar pen is full and shut it off and switcn
   to som ething else, but short of that, it is not like
   pac k i n g oranges into a box where you put them in by hand.
   What do you act ually see when somebody is, so to speak,
   packing the crowd in?                A.   If I can go back, my Lord,
   to a time when I was very young and I used to attend the
   Sta mford Bridge Stadium, just after the war, and I can
   recall the stewards s t a n d i n g in the gangways and telling
   people to move down and start to put them to the front
   of the gangways.           Now, those were the days before any
   l im itati on on a t t e n d a n c e s and I have been in the ground -
   I was there when M o s c o w D y n a m o played and there was 104,000
   in the ground, a t e r r i b l e c r u s h i n g situation, but those
   s te wards were pus h i n g p e o p l e down to the front and so
   I agree it is not like p a c k i n g oranges into a box ---

Q.    It is not far off.    A.    But they were encouraging people to
     move down and pus h i n g them into the lower reaches of the
     terracing, and I have not seen that happen now for years.

Q.     What_it comes to is the p h r a s e that we have heard all too
      many times - find their own level subject to someone deciding
      when the moment has come to shut it off.          A.     Well, I
     'think -thTtjiigh -exper.rencer.and seeing what the p o s s i b l e — " —
      dangers are, yes, my Lord.

Were you not Safety and Security Officer?             A. No, sir,
because in a c c o r d a n c e with the Green Code I could never
be the Safety Officer.            I hadn't the authority to be able
to a u t h o r i s e any alterati ons.   Obviously I com me n t e d on
any dan gers I per ceive d.
So a d e s c r i p t i o n of you, Mr. Lock, as Safety and Security
Officer or Safety and Security Consultant to Sheffield
Wed ne s d a y wou ld be inaccurate, would it?       A.   Yes, sir.

You wrote,    I think, a number of articles.              A.    I did, sir.

But the Inq uiry s h o u l d not be under the impression, should it
that you had any r e s p o n s i b i l i t y for safety? A.   I neither
was inv i t e d to or a t t e n d e d any Safety Meetings or any visits
to the gr o u n d on S af ety Inspections.
But did you have any role which might come under the label
"Safety" in r e l a t i o n to Hillsborough?       A.   In its loosest
term, sir, all our ste wards are responsible for safety,
and that is i n c o r p o r a t e d in the instructions to stewards.

So you r e g a r d e d y o u r s e l f as a steward, did you?    A.     I
reg arded m y s e l f as a man of all purposes, sir.
If we look, for example, in the Club's bundle at page 61 -
I just want to. be clear about what your role was, do you
follow?   A.    Yes . -
Page 61, tnere is an article there entitled, "Playing Safe
at S h e f f i e l d " whi ch I think you wrote. A. Yes, sir.

You wer e the author of that and I take it that you not only
wrote it but you saw it in the Police Review?    A.   I did,
sir.
You see what it says at the top, "Playing Safe at Sheffield,
D o u g l a s Lock, former Sup erintendent with South Yorkshire
and now S af ety and Sec u r i t y Consultant to Sheffield."
A. Well, of course, that is the editor's licence to put
w h a t e v e r he likes jas the lead-in, sir.

 Would you have a look, please, at the second column of
 the a r t i c l e ? A. Yes, sir.
 Do you see about half way down a section dealing with Mr.
 J us tice P o p p l e w e l l ' s report and then a bit which reads,
 " S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y rec ognis ed its responsi bilit ies in: i

 You w r o t e that-,^iiid you not?: A.                 Yes..

 This is not e d i t o r ' s licence, those are your words.
 A . They a r e .
 "Since I had e x t e n s i v e kno wledge of the Club and ground

      c o n t r o l 1 or d i r e c t i o n of the Chief Steward of Hillsborough?
      A.        Well, there w a s n ' t such a person, sir, when I was a
      Police Officer but I d i d n ’t regard myself as being under
      the control of any of the She ffield Wednesday staff.
                                                                                 D . LOCK


             A     Q.   You did not?     A.    No.

                   Q.   You speak of an agreement.          A.      Yes.

                   Q. So that ne do not m i s u n d e r s t a n d what you are saying, when
                      was this agreement mad e?            A.      Well, I saw Dick Chester,
                      the then Secretary, when          I joined the staff at Hammerton
                      Road Police Station and I visited the ground as I explained
              B       earlier when the L e e d s United match was about to take place
                      and it wasn't a w r i t t e n agreement, it wasn't like a mortgage
                      agreement, it was a verbal agreement.               It was being carried
                      out then.
                   Q. What date are we spe a k i n g of its commencement?                A.     1982,
                      sir.
                   Q.   And who made it - you?         A.        Partly.

                   Q.   Did you have a u t h o r i t y to make agreements on behalf of the
                        South Yorkshire P o l i c e ?     A.    the Chief Superintendent,
                        Mr. Herold was with me as well.

                   Q. You say you partly made that agreement. Did you have any
                      authority to do that?   A.   Of course I do, sir.

                   Q.    What was it that you agreed to?               A.   Because I was the
                        delegated y O / f i c l a i o f theti Chief Constable ... ... •

                   Q.    What was it you agreed to? A.              We agreed that we were
                        going to police - - -          Well, in actual fact I was rubber-
                        sta mping an a g r e e m e n t which already existed.

                   Q. So you played no part in the making of any arrangement?
                      A.     Of course I did.           I have just said that.   I rubber-
                      stamped what was alr eady in agreement.           The agreement which
                      was in effect in pla ce at the time I took over was that
                      the Police were doi ng the stewarding, if you want to call
                      it stewarding, but I wou ld say they were doing the crowd
                      c on troll ing and saf ety aspects at the West end of the ground.
                      That was being c a r r i e d out by Mr. Herold and Mr. Chapman,
               F      my immediate p r e d e c e s s o r and I rubber-stamped that agreement
                      when I went to the Club on that occasion and carried on
                      doing it and it was sub sequently carried on by Mr. Freeman
                      and also Mr. Murray.

                   Q. This would be in 1982, would it?                A.        Yes, sir.

                   Q. Was Mr. Ch e s t e r the Secretary then?             A.      No, it was
               G      Mr. England then.
                   Q . So the -agreement was made with who?                A.      With Mr. E n g l a n d ^

                   Q. Not hing to put in wri t i n g ?       A.      No.

                   Q. Did the Club tell you what it expected you to do at the
                      L ep pings Lane end?         A.   No, I have just said the Club did
                      not direct the P o l i c e operation, it was” rather the reverse.
                      I can recall o c c a s i o n s when I have closed terraces much

                                                                        D . LOCK


                          to the chagrin of Mr. England.
                     Q. Let us move on a little bit, if we may, in time.    I suggest
                        to you that there never was an agr eement that the Police
                        would steward.   A.   The agreement was shown to be in
                        fact because we did do it.

               B     Q. It may be, Mr. Lock, that the Club did not do things and
                        the Police in some man ner found the mselves carrying out certain
                        roles.   A.     If there had been no agreement, sir, and the
                        Police had e xp ected the Club to have stewards, they would
                        have quickly told us.
                     Q. You see,you wrote an article about which you have already
                        been asked which is found in the Club bundle at page 2 (b).
                        Sir, the document that comes immediately before page 16.
                        A.   Yes, sir.
  f                  Q. And there you said, on the third column of that page,
                        an article that a p p e a r e d on 16th August, 1985, "My regretful
                        experience of ste wards, I must say, is that through no
                        fault of theirs they are usually less than useful.          Some
                        clubs, including C h e l s e a have efficient, experienced,
                        physically able s e c u r i t y stewards, others do not and
                        frequently the Pol ice take it upon themselves to assume
                        steward^ d u t i e s ." .A.     Y e s :   .• .    ,



                     Q. Is t h a t w h a t you are saying had h ap pened at Hillsborough?
                        A.    No, I am sa y i n g what Justice Popplewell said as well.

                     q   . Let us move on to what Hr. Justice Popplewell said.       You
                           must have been very interested in that report.       A.   I
                           certainly was, sir, because I had written an article
                           previous to the re p o r t outlining some of those proposals.

                     Q. And one of the t h i n g s you will have noted in his report was
                        his o bs ervat ions on the Police Control and the Police
                        position and his obs e r v a t i o n s at page 31 in the Report -• we
                        do not need to look at the Report;               the Inquiry will have
                        the opportunity of r ea ding it and it will serve no purpose
                        to go through its detail - but what was being addressed
                        was the his toric al fact that it has somehow been assumed
                        by clubs the r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of cpntrol of what goes on
                        inside the gro und h ad passed from them to the Police.
                        A.    Yes.
                     Q. And a r e c o m m e n d a t i o n that had the effect of saying, amongst,
                        ot h e r things, that the lines must be more clearly drawn
                        and clubs must u n d e r s t a n d their responsibilities.
                        A. True , s i r .                                    i          ;
                      Q. And that led to the Green Guide, did it not, to the review.
                           A.'r Yes,   'the-revised Green Guide.         ;                    •-•••-   -

                      Q. Which you must have looked at rather carefully.             A.    I did.
                 H    Q. Given what the Green Guide said, if the situation was that
                         the Police had been doing the stewarding, did it occur to

                      that s o m e t h i n g ought to be done to regularise the position?
                      A.    The s i t u a t i o n was regularised, sir.          We had the
                      agreement.           If you turn to the Green Guide and you look
                      at 197 it says quite clearly there that when there is a
                      high Police p r e s e n c e in a football ground the responsibility
                      of the s t e w a r d s should be agreed with the Police, and they
                      were agreed, not wri tten down, no, but nothing was set in
              B       stone but it was certainly agreed.                   I know because I was
                      there and I have served at that ground as Security Officer
                      through two su c c e s s i v e Chief Sup erint enden ts and two

Q. Let us look at this section.  This is section 13 you have
   referred to in the Green Guide. - A. yes, sir.

Q. And you have selected paragraph 197.            Now, this section at
   page 56 begins:

              ’’Effective stewarding should prevent .overcrowding in
              sections of the ground” .

          - A. Yes, that is generalisations.

Q. But we begin with a generalisation on page 12, do we not?
   There is a whole section on management responsibility? - A. It
   is certainly true, sir, but it also says in paragraph 6 , if I
   might quote that:

              ’’Deviations from individual guidelines are possible
              without necessarily detracting from the overall safety of
              the ground**.

Q. You regarded that as entitling the club to devolving
   stewarding responsibility upon the Police, did you? - A. If I
   might make an analogy with another aspect of football, Kenny
   Dalglish has got responsibility for the club’s results, but he
   c a n ’t play the game on his own because he has not got the
   necessary manpower, and the club has not got the resources nor
   the facilities nor the trained persons to do that particular
   function at that end of the ground.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think we are getting into
          argument.
      1
Q .            MR. WOODWARD:   May I just move to one other matter.          In
          the section on stewarding, section 2 0 0 , it says:

               ’’Management should appoint a chief steward responsible
               for co-ordinating responsibilities of all stewards” .

          - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Would that be you that had that role? - A. I think you could
   call me that, sir.

Q. How did you co-ordinate the role and the activities of the
    Police with the rest of your stewards? - A. I d o n ’t co­
    ordinate the Police, sir.       I am not able to co-ordinate the
    Police activities.. I speak to the Police liaison Officer.                I
    speak to the Police. Chief Superintendent.         I speak to the
    Police on the day.       I visit their box.     I walk round the
• . ground .and speak to the individual sector c o m m a n d e r s " I speak
    to my chief stewards.       I have a radio link with my chief
    stewards.      I answer -aft-of the.tr calls for help'^and~do
    whatever I can from any of those people to assist in the
 - ''smcroEth Tcnanning^function of -the ~stewards ; That-, is .hosr-I'zcofc- ~ v.
    ordinate them.

Q. What role did the stewards perform on the Kop? - A. There was
                                  n
                                                            D.J. LOCK


      a specific role there.  Mr. Calvert asked me about that in
      particular.  First of all, they were to keep the gangways and
      entry ways clear, and because we knew a large number of
      Liverpool fans had obtained Nottingham Forest tickets the
      Police had decided to put a segregated area of Liverpool fans
      on an elevated area in the Kop, and they asked my stewards if
      they would deviate any Liverpool fans they saw to that area.

Q. Did your stewards control and direct members of the public on
   the Kop to achieve an even flow of people to viewing areas? -
   A. You could say that.  I have just said that, sir.  They were
   directing people over to where the Police had segregated them.

Q. But that would be to send Liverpool people away to the area
   that had been reserved for them? - A. Yb s . That is directing
   and control.

Q. What about all the other people? - A. It is not possible, as
   my Lord has said, to pack people like oranges in boxes.

Q.    But you had the task of safe dispersal of spectators on the
      terraces, had not you? - A. But we were doing that.

Q.    How did you do that on the Kop? - A. We were directing people
      away from the entrances and the gangways, and specifically we
      were directing Liverpool fans to an area segregated for their
      purpose.                               .

Q. Were you monitoring through your stewards the safety of
   persons on the Kop? - A. I think that goes without saying.                    We
   would have been receiving information.

Q :   Who had given your stewards the instruction to do that? - A.
      The Police gave them a briefing. I was not there. The Police
      gave them a briefing at 11.15 a.m.

Q. But your stewards were under your control and responsibility.
   Did you do anything to ascertain whether they had been told to
   ensure the safe dispersal of spectators on the terraces? - A.
   They are under the control of both me and the Police.   In
   fact....

Q. I am sorry, that is not an answer to the question.  Did you do
   anything to ascertain whether or not they had so been told? -
   A. No.

Q. Mr. Lock, I suggest to you that your evidence concerning
   discussions with Mr. Chapmaa are just not accurate?-     * -
   Incorrect, sir.

Q. You say there was a meeting at which Mr. Chapman was present
    betweetr-^you -and' Mr-.'^Chester-prioT to the L-eeds- mateh- I W 1982?"
    - A. Not only was there a meeting, I was very fortunate as I

Q       Was there a specific meeting you recall when this agreement
        was discussed? - A. Mr. England, I am sorry, not Mr. Chester.

Q. Well, with Mr. England and yourself and Mr. Chapman? - A. I
   went down to the ground prior to the Leeds United match with
   M r . Chapman, because he was concerned both, as a new Detective
   Superintendent in respect for crime for that match, because
   there had been a high incidence of crime with Leeds followers,
   and I also went with the Chief Superintendent, and we agreed
   to carry out what they had been doing previous to my arrival,
   and that was to steward the West end terraces.

Q. I suggest there was no specific reference in any discussion
   you had with the club' and Mr. Chapman concerning the
   stewarding of the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. There was, sir.

Q. Were you present at any of the briefings that Mr. Calvert
   carried out? - A. Which briefings, sir?

Q. Of the stewards? - A. On our training nights?

Q. Yes. - A. I arranged them.           I was present at all of them.

Q. Were you present at the briefing that Mr. Sewell gave? - A. He
   attended one.  Sergeant Goddard attended the other one.

G. In 1988?       - A .   I beg your pardon.   He did attend twioe then,,
   yes.

Q. Were you present on those occasions? - A. I was.

Q. It has not been suggested to the Police witnesses that they
   gave your stewards or gave any indication to the club at that
   time that the responsibility of stewarding on the terraces,
   the West end terraces, would be theirs? - A. I am sorry,
   what was the question?

Q. Do you recall any suggestion on the occasions of any of those
   briefings that the stewards should do their ordinary
   stewarding but the stewarding on the West terraces
   was to be a Police responsibility? - A. No, because
   that was the understood thing.      They never told the
   stewards they were taking o v e r . -

    Q
   Are you saying that it went without being said? - A. Can I
   digress a short while and tell you the format of those
, 'training evenings. * ^ introduced the people w h o .were coming,
   the Fire Officer, the St. J o h n ’s Ambulance man and the Police
 - Officer.   Then^they gave their piece.     In accordance with
   popplewell the Fire Brigade told them about the emergency
   equipment T first-ar<r by--St. John ’s Ambulance, and the Police -
   told them about emergency evacuation procedures - full stop.

    Q    Were you present when any of the Police Officers, apart from
         those who gave evidence today and yesterday, gave evidence? -
         A. No, sir.

Q. Were you aware, although in the nature of this Inquiry it is
   important to observe matters will not be decided on what was
   put or not put, but it has not been suggested on behalf of the
   club that there -was any agreement or arrangement that the
   Police had with the club concerning the stewarding of the
   terraces? - A. There was agreement, sir.

Q.   Mr. Lock,  may I move on to some other matters.  The club, as
     you wrote  in your article, had the facility for monitoring by
     reason of the video cameras at various positions, and it had a
     control room? - A. That is right, sir.

Q.   Who was in control in your    control room? - A. I   was, sir.

Q.   You were.When you were not there   who was in control in your
     control room? - A. P.C. Guest.   It was a joint role, agreed by
     Chief Superintendent Mole.

Q. Just a moment.  Whilst you were there you were in control? -
   A. It was a joint enterprise.

Q. What was a joint enterprise? - A. If there were any questions
   asked with regard to any problems, if it was something which
   pertained purely to the club I would deal with it.      If it was
   a policing enquiry such as "We have got      b   parked out in
   the car park in the-wrong .scot.; ; Its number is'.,.." then ' - . ■
   Harold Guest would deal with it.

Q. So are you saying when you were not there Mr. Guest would take
   over your role? - A. He did not need to take over my role.  I
   had a radio with me, and if anything was happening I could
   hear it.

Q. Were you monitoring by means of the television and the
   computer the entry of supporters, you, the club? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. If you were not in the control room who was doing it for
   the club? - A. I was in the control room frequently. I had to
   go out to do my job, and Mr. Guest has enough experience and
   he has been there now with me for the last four years, to be
   aware if there was anything which needed to be done either
   through the Police control or me, to do it.

Q. In the article which you wrote which I have asked you about
   already, "Playing safe, at Sheffield", pages. 61-62 ,there, .are .
   two pages 61 - in the bundle, you write in relation to the
   television equipment:                   .

      ^   "in-«y-edn-trol I am helped by a Police Of f icer^snd-
          television computer engineer".

     - A. Yes.

Q. Was that a club employee, the television computer engineer? -
   A. He has a contract with the club.

Q.        He     is a club responsibility? - A.Yes.

Q.         "Together we watch and record the entry of allsupporters". -
          A. I am not technically capable of being able to do any of the
          repairs or anything that needs doing.

Q. Of course not, Mr. Lock.  Would you look at the top right-hand
   column? - A. Which page, sir?

Q. Page 61. - A. Is it "Football's last chance", sir?

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     "Playing safe at Sheffield", page
          61 in my bundle.

q     .        MR. WOODWARD:    Beginning at the bottom     of   the central
          column:

               "By careful monitoring of the digital read-out we can
               begin to close down turnstiles as we approach sector
               limits.  This facility also enables staff to warn Police
               to transfer supporters to other parts of the ground where
               accommodation is available"?

          - A. Yes.

    Q. So .that would, be something that the .ciyb .would be doing in..,
       order to tell the P<5lice and" direct tftS Police? - A.
       Frequently.    To assist the Police in their control.    Obviously
       if you have fan s... .

    Q J   In their control of what? - A. Of the people who are outside
          the ground.

    Q.     Those who had not     yet entered? - A.     Yes.

    Q.     Did you know that      there was trouble    outside at the Leppings
          Lane end in April,   1989? - A. When?

    Q. At any time before the kick-off? - A. I arrived back in the
       room and I saw the gate C had been opened, and I saw a Police
       Officer on a horse having some problems closing the gate, but
       I never heard any calls for help or anything else.  I did not
       see anything happening outside there.

    Q. Let us look at the evidence a little bit. Do you
       remember round about 2 o'clock Mr. Darling coming into
       t h e control room? - A. Definitely not. ;   - •  .    rv               -


    Q.     Are you saying he     did not come? -A.        N o , Iam saying I.d o n 11
           remember him coming in .                            •    --iu

    Q. And during his visit there was observation at that time that
—      tTier'g'',tvere 12 ,OOO in the ground whilst in *1988 therei^ed-been-
       about 20,000? - A. I think at 2 o'clock there was 24,000 in
       the ground.
                                              D.J. LOCK


Do you remember a discussion, Mr. Lock, at about 2 o ’clock
time? - A. No, sir.

That the numbers were down   on 1988? - A. With me?

Any discussion in the control room? - A. No. I am not saying
Mr. Darling did not come in and discuss it with somebody, but
certainly not whilst I was there.

Your stewards have radios? -   A.   Some of them      have.

Did any of your stewards out at    the Leppings       Lane endhave
radios? - A. One of them did, Stuart Thorpe.

Would you expect Mr. Thorpe to keep you in touch with what was
happening around the turnstiles and out at the approach to the
turnstiles? - A. No.

Would you not want to know   that? - A. For what reason, sir?

Would you not want to know it for any reason? - A.I can see
on the gates them coming through.  I can't see a reason, no.

You can see on the gates - I   am    sorry? - A. I can seethrough
my cameras what is happening   at    the gates.

You can see from your cameras what was happening out there? -
A. At the turnstiles, yes/;   7 •
                                .       '          ; ! * /': •

If there had been any difficulties at the turnstiles would
have expected Mr. Thorpe to bring that to your attention? - A.
No, because he could not see them.  He was in the West Stand.

Would there be any means of turnstile problems, excessive
people coming without tickets, people trying to get in without
paying, jumping through, any means of you being told of that?
- A. Several, sir.

What? - A. First of all the Police would tell me. Secondly, I
could see, because in our control room not only do we have the
cumulative totalisator for the numbers coming through the
gates but also we have an infra-red ray which runs over the
top of the turnstiles and accounts for anybody leaping over.

Were you aware of what the evidence, of your turnstile
operators is on that? - A. Subsequently.

Another conversation:  do you remember seeing Mr..Chapman     and
Mr. Finnegan by the tunnel, the players' entrance? - A. I     saw
Sergeant Chapman, Mr. Finnegan and Inspector Harvey once,     -and
I saw Sergeant Chapman on his own once.                        •

      was°there then.    I spoke to him after C gate.

   been a matter of some concern to you, would not it? - A.
   Of course.

0 .What would you have done? **A.^ I would have asked the Police
    what they were going to do about it.

Q. It follows from your answer to the question about whether
   or not the conversation took place that at no stage did
   you ask the Police what they were doing? - A. That is
   true, sir, because I did not know what was happening out
   there.
    0.. May I ask you about another conversation? - A. Certainly,
        sir.

   there greeting people and handing out prot,~._inmes
   and Miss Crottendon was outside.    I went outside and I
   told her that there had been an entry at C gate and that
   I was concerned that some of the fans may come down and
   try to gain entry at either the players' entrance or
   the directors' entrance and if there were any problems
   for her own safety that she should step inside and
   close the door.

                     Q. Did the thought of the kick-off being delayed cross your
                        mind? - A. The time had passed for that, sir.. They were.           .

     said the Police have opened the gates the crowd were in
     the ground.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   Did the thought of the kick-off
     being delayed occur to you? - A. Then?

0. At any tine. -A. Yes.

Q. When? - A. The first time the gate went.

0. What did you do about it? - A. Nothing.

0. Well, why not? - A. Because I had not the opportunity.

0. You had a radio? - A. I have already stated I tried to
   reach Police control and I could not get through.

0. What were you going to say if you had got through? - A.
   I was going to say - I do not know what I was going to
   say precisely.   It was going to be something, what are
   we going to do about delaying the kick-off? Are we
   goinc?
   0    o to delav
                 * the kick-off? #It was not mv decision.
   1 could have made the suggestion.

0. So round about the time of the               gate having been open
   the first time you did have in               your mind the question
  -of .the k i c k - o f f _beJ.ag; .delayed?   -ql. .•I .think,I .aasuerea--*—

0. Well, did you have a telephone line in your control bo::?"
   -A. I left the control.  I said the reason why I was
 7 unable to do anything was I left the control to secure
 ' the doors, to see where the vacancies were on the pitch,
   to call at C gate, to see the Police, to call in the
   Police.

                                             D. J .   LOCK

If we stand back, Mr. Lock, and look at the whole of your
evidence is it this: That you, in your capacity as
Safety and Security Officer, were unaware of any problem,
overcrowding or peril building up on the terraces?
A. I saw that the centre pen was extremely full when I
w — t down on to the pitch after fc f gate had opened and
I spoke to Sergeant Chapman.   I mentioned to him that
it was full and the police would no doubt be deviating
them around because I saw that the wings were empty.

You told Mr. Chapman that, did you? A. I spoke to Peter
Chapman about that.

You have a clear recollection? A. Sergeant Chapman, Sir.

You have a clear recollection of saying to him what?
"No doubt the police will be deviating the fans around
to the wings"? A. No, I did not say that.  The centre pen
was full and that the police would be deviating them round
to the wings.

You said that to him did you? A. Yes.

 Did you get any response from him? A. I do not know. He
 might have said yes but we certainly did not enter a debate
 because I was on my way then to go back in.

•••Vha t'                        seridu^ thinf * ;was> vfc          «
   A. I also told ninf that the gate had been nrieaed and 1 n :xc »
    this for a fact., that once the three or four hundred had
    been allowed in the police had secured the gate again and
   -that the police were in control of the situation.

 How did you know that? A. Because I saw it on the television
 screen.

 You knew that the police were in control of the situation
 because of your ability to observe what was happening out
 on Leppings Lane? A. No, not Leppings Lane, outside 'c '
 gate, which is inside the ground complex.

 You have spoken of how much you were aware of. Did you have
 any trouble with your radio communications that day?
 A . No.                         /

 Did you discuss with Mr. Mackrell your thoughts that the
 game should be delayed? A. No, I think that I have answered
 that, Sir, no I did not.

 Any reason why not? A. I never saw him in time to be
 able to bring that to his attention.  When I saw him I
 was telling him that 'c' gate had gone and he went off
 to see why.

 Who was running this event? A. Which event, sir?
                                                                                       D. J. LOCK

This semi-final. Was it the club? A. No.

Who was running it then if not the club? A. From what
aspect?

Who was running it, who was responsible that day for the
running of the event? A. Well, the F.A. were there and they
were supervising with regards to their functions. Mr. Mackrell
had arranged through the police for the attandance of the
crowd and the designation of the ends, I was looking after
the stewarding and controlling, as I have already stated,
and the police were looking after the police operation.

 Thank you. A. Thank you, sir.

                              Cross-examined by MR. GLASGOW

     I wonder if I can make this plain for everyones benefit.
     I am sure that your statement is being treated in the same
     way as everyone elses in that it is not read in full but I
     am sure that can be treated as your evidence in chief
     without my going through it at any greater length. Just
     one matter: when you came out of the club's control room
     after the first burst you told the Inquiry that you were
     frightened by what you had seen. A. Yes, sir.

     You had also seen on the video screen the police force,
’■    w   i   t   h   -   .   -   j   c   a   i   r   t   r   d   i    ^   o   f   J        j   r   a   t   t   -   te
     s ir .                                                           .....        "    '

 Do you accept that you may have given some account of that
 ,incident to the three police officers to whom you spoke?
/A. I may have done, sir.   I agree.

     We know that you dispute using the words: "It is hell out
     there".  Do you accept that you may have said something
     to them in relation to that incident that conveyed what
     you had seen outside 'c' gate? A. I may indeed, sir.

     Thank you very much.  I have no further questions. I am
     so sorry, there is one mistake and I knew there was a
     reason for asking whether your statement had been put in
     in full.  I think that there was one mistake in your
     statement that you wished to correct and I apologize for
     not drawing it to your attention.  A. Yes, sir, it was on
     page six of my original statement, the third paragraph,
     it talks about the gates in the perimeter fence.

     The whole sentence reads: "The gates in the perimeter
     fence are closed but not locked during matches as far as
     I am aware.  The gates are so designed the latch can be
     easily opened from inside the pen and the position is that
     the gates would normally be manned outside by stewards
     and police officers".  What is wrong with that? A. It is
     wrong in fact that the stewards never man the fence gates,
     the perimeter gates.

                     Q.   Are you aware of the fact that at a time when you were in
                           the police force and before you joined the club there had
                           been a time when stewards were on the perimeter? A. Yes,
                           there had been.

                     Q.   And there was a request by the crowds that they get out
                           of the way and just leave the police there? A. Yes.

                     Q.   But your statement to that extent is inaccurate?
                B          A. It is.

                     Q.   Thank you.       I apologize for taking that out of order.

                               MR. GOLDSACK: Thank you, Mr. Lock. A. Thank you, sir.

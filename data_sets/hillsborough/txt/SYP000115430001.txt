            was     our duty       to escort          the Liverpool           fans    from the       train station              in

            Halifax R oad          to L e p p i n g s Lane.

            At    1130 hours we            left      Niag a r a and was        s hown the       layout      of

            Hillsborough           football          ground.     After        that    together wit h C o nstable

             particular a t t e n t i o n           to Halifax Road.

             I could see         large      number      of Li v e r p o o l    fans walking          ar o u n d drinking

            from     c^rts of alcohol.                I also    saw     large       number    of fans       purchase           tins

of alcohol            from the G a t e w a y S u p er m a r k e t                in Halifax Boad.                    There was

also a large              number     of    fans      sitting        on the           grass        emban k m e n t            outside

H al f o r d s w h i c h was        next    to Gateway,             consuming             the alchol                they had just

There were            no d i s t u r b a n c e s and       the     fans were well                   behaved,             it was

similar            to a carnival          atmosphere

At    -1400 hours the              f ootbaUJ<«<pec ial             t r a i n arrived,               carrying

approximately 500                  fans.     They were             directed            from the train                    station

onto    the         pavement       in Hali f a x Road-              As         the escorts m o v e d off                       I took

the    position           to the     rear of the             escort.              Again       these       s u p p o r t e r s were

well     behaved and no              disturbance                en,route          to the          ground entrance,                      at

L e p p i n g s Lane.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y     "14 i5\js*efZTr s we a r r i v e d at Leppings                         Lane,       the        supports i

from the football                  special     moved            towards          the turnstiles.                    At       this time

1    could see a 1ar ge m as s of                    pe6 p 1e t ry i ng to ge t J r h rough the

turnstiles.               I could also         see        supp o r t e r s        cJ^j^ribi ng up the wail                      into

the ground.               Inspector        Hand~Davi.es            i n s^nicted myself and Constable

R immer      to      clear      the area of L i verpool                       fans who were              hanging             ar o u n d      m

groups        on the        pavement and            iry ^ h e     road.           Wherever          I looked             I could

see    people         drinking       alcohoU         f r o m tin        cans.

Myself and C o n s t a b l e Rimmer                  star t e d     to         clear    the        pavement and                 road of

s u pporters          asking       them to go          into       the         ground.         Most       did move             towards

the t urnstiles              but    quite a lot            ignored             our   requests            and    needed to be

to 1 d several            t :imes to move           on.      Those            that we r e y 'd r i nk i ng we r e

r equested           to   put    down the i r        dr :i.nks and             go t^wards           the    turnst i 1 es .                   We

c o n t i n u e d this       exerc i s e    clearing            the a r ^ a between the                    entrance               of

L e p p i n g s Lane and           the    junct i o n wi. th/6at chbar Lane,                            I noti c e d that

almost       all      the    s u p p o r t e r s were      coming             from the d i r e c t i o n of Catchbar

Lane,     when        I was      informed t h a t v t h e y w o u l d be                coming           from Hali f a x Road.

At some            time   there was a s m a l l .d i s t u r b a n c e when N o t t i n g h a m Forest
                                                                                                                      PAGt
                                                                                                                      R'4.70

fans     came      into L e p p i n g s Lane,             from C a t c h b a r L a n e .

These yo u t h s were               d i s pe r s e d and     left      the area.

At a p p r o x i m a t e l y    1433 hours           it was       becoming a p p arent             that    the

s i t u a t i o n at    the     turns t i l e s was          becoming         u n c ontrollable.           I m oved

towards         the t u r n s t i l e s      to help the          other M o u n t e d officers.               By this

time     the     crowd had spil l e d out                  into L e p p i n g s      Lane.     It was        just a sea

of    people       s qu a s h e d    together,           it took       some    time to get my horse

thro u g h the         crowd        to the     other M o u n t e d             i-e-erif, w ith the         other

M o u n t e d officers          we formed a cordon of 7 horses                             across     the entrance,

which      leads       towards         the    turnstiles.              The    idea being       to stop any more

reaching         the    turnstiles            due to the          solid mass          of s u p p o r t e r s already

trying         to get     into       the ground.             In L e p p i n g s     Lane > n e r e    was a Police

Landrover          fi t t e d wit h        public address              syst e m ^      I could see an

Inspector          s t a nding       on the     bonnivtf^Tsk i ng the               crowd to stand           back and

stop     pushing.            Nobody        seemed to take any notice and soon wit h all                                     the

noise      the     Inpector          could not           be heard.           I was also asking             the    crowd

to wait         until     the       other     fans       had got       into    the ground.            Some    listened

others         kept    on pushing against                  the horse,          they seemed           intent      in

getting         into the        ground at any              cost.        The y started         to^Torce        their way

past     the     horses        some     crawling          under     the      horsesomers             forcing      gaps

between        each horse .             They    simply        i g no r e cHf^ery thing         I said.

It was at          this      time      I saw the          blue    gates       for    gate    "A*     the N o r t h stand

Open,     I could not               tell     if they had been forced open or opened                               from

i n si d e .     Th is gate          re m a i n e d ope n f o r a p pr o x ima t eIy f i v e mi nut e s , I

then saw the            gate        being     closed.         1 could now see that                   the   crowd at

the    t u rnstiles was              now thinning            out,      the j?frowd on the            other    side       of

the    cordon were             allowed       to trickle           BjrCt the horses and                towards         the

turnstiles.             At     no time       did     I           any    other       blue    gates     open.

I could now hear                the PA system from                  inside the          football       ground asking

the L i verpool           supporters           to stop        pushing         forward and          relieve       the
                                                                                                                             P AG E   4

           pressure from            the front.

           1    was    then     instructed         by     Inspector          H a n d- D a v i e s   to   close     the

           turns t i l e s and to           remain        outside       them      in company with C o n s t a b l e s

           •1300r 384 4 and 5855.                  Whilst        there       I then h eard ttie- P A             sys t e m asking

           the L i v e r p o o l , s u p p o r t e r s    to    leave    the foot                   ,               is message

           was      repeated several             times.          At this        stage       I saw other M o u n t e d

           officers and foot men                   being        sent    round to the N o t t i n g h a m Fo r e s t           end

           so they       could get          into the           ground.

           After      some      time    1 s t a r t e d to see Liv e r p o o l             supp o r t e r s   come out of the

           ground       crying a n d screaming.                   I then        saw supporters             being     carried out

           some       conscious        others      unconscious.               The     eme r g e n c y v e h icles were        now

           a r r i v i n g at    the    ground,          we m oved our          horses       out of the way and

           posi t i o n e d o u r s e l v e s    in L e p p i n g s Lane.

           A fter      seeing     Inspector H a n d - D a v i e s            we were        instructed        to    patrol    the

that the situation at the turnstiies was becoming
uncontrollable.       I moved towards the turnstiies to he*p.
the other mounted officers.         By this time the crowd ha$|
spilled out into Leppings Lane.          It was just a sea of
peopie squashed together,        it took some time to get my
horse through the crowd to the other mounted officers*;;
with the ether mounted officers we formed a cordon of
horses across tne entrance, wr.ich leads towards the
turnstI ies. The idea being to stop any more reaching thj
turnstiies due to the solid mass of supporters already
trying to get      into the ground.     In Leppings Lane there

         I could now hear the P.A.      system from inside the
football ground asking tne Liverpool supporters to stop
pushing forward and relieve the pressure from the front.


         I was then instructed by Inspector Hands-Davies tor
close the turnstiles, and to remain outside them in
company with Constables,        1300.   3644 and 5855.     Wh i 1s t/::||||
there I then heard the P. A. system asking the Liverpool;
supporters to leave the football pitch.           This message'
repeated several      tinses.   At this stage I saw other mo;
officers and foot men being sent round to tJje Nottin<
Fores: end so they couid get into the ground.


         After some time I started to see Liverpool support
cone cut of the ground crying and screaming.              -I then saw;
supporters being carried out some conscious ethers

positioned ourselves       in Leppings Dane.        V»v       *


         After seeing Inspector Hands-Davles we were
                                            •

instructed to patrol the area around the ground.


         At   18.30 hours I returned to Niagra, to box the
horses up and attend a de-briefing.

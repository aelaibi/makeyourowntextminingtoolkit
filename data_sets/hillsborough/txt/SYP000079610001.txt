           On S a t u r d a y the      15th of A p r i 1 I was         d e p loyed to work at Sheffield,

            Once at S h e f f i e l d    I was    instructed to work             double crewed w i t h^PQ//l333

            a S o u t h Y o rkshire Dog Handler and we used his dog van wit h him driving

            and      I was the      passenger.

            We w o r k e d as a mobile          patrol ar o u n d      part    of the Football G r o u n d w hich

            i n c 1uded Leppi ngs L a n e .        Dur i ng the        course of the morni ng and

            a f t e r n o o n up to    1430 hours we made many                patrols      of the area and also

            took     up static        points.

            One      of our m ain static         points was a garage              forecourt       on ^p'fipings Lane

            at the furthest            end from the Football             ground.
                                                                                                       PAGE       2
                                                                                                       S2387

Whilst     parked at this          point    I observed thousands                of Liverpool

S u p p o r t e r s walking    to the m a t c h along L e p pings Lane.

I can say that they all                 seemed    in good spirits and              I saw no trouble

whats o e v e r at this end of Leppings Lane a l t h o u g h                    I did see       numerous

supporters        drinking       from beer       cans and       plastic      bottles.       A

lot of the fans were              singing and did appear                to be drunk a l t h o u g h       I did

not a c t u a l l y speak to any of them.

It was    shortly after           this    that    I thought       to myself        that all      the

su pporters would not             be able to get          into the ground            in time     for the

kick    off.      It seemed that          they had all          left    it to the       last minute and

ex p e c t e d to walk straight           in.

Prior    to    1500 hrs we        drove    down the       road nearer         to the Leppi n g s Lane

turnstiles.          I could see hundreds            of fans       pushing to get           to the

turnstiles        and   I was     not aware       of how many fans were between them and

the    gates.

There were        numerous       radio messages          being    passed an d        it was     obvious

that there was a crush near to the gates.                              I heard a S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

instruct       someone    to open the gates              but    it seemed several minutes

before    it was done.            I was aware       by this      time    that    people were        being

crushed but this was              only because       I         could hear it on the        radio.         I was

not    close enough to see for myself.

Once    the    gates    had been opened the              crowd thin n e d out but a g a i n            I was

not    close    enough even to see wher^, the gate were or how m a n y                             people

ran in.        I had seen quite a 1o X of fans                   climb into the ground over a

wall    near to the turnstilejK

Once    the m a j o r i t y of           ‘ans had    cleared we           remained outside          the

ground keeping          late     comers away from the turnstiles and off                         the    road

so that       em e r g e n c y vehicles    could get through.

I did not go         into the ground or deploy my Police                        dog I remained          in
                                    /

                                                                                              S2387

              abandoned   I remained on L e p p i n g s Lane while   the   crowd   left   the ground.

              I noticed that    they were    very, hostile   towards   the Police.

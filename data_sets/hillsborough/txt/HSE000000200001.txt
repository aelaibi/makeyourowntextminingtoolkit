        1.   In my minute of 13 February, I outlined some of I l L a V ifents
        for and against bidding for some form of control over the new
        Football Licensing Authority (FLA) and/or its Inspectorate.    I
        also pointed out that much might depend on the outcome of a
        meeting on 14 February between HSE, DoE and Home Office
        representatives, at which we would get a feel for what, if any,
        HSE involvement they might welcome.

        2.   I understand that at that meeting it quickly became apparent
        that DoE (which currently has oversight of the FLA) has already
        had a number of bi-lateral discussions with the Home Office, and
        are about to relinquish responsibility for the FLA in the Home
        Office's favour.

j       3.   It was equally apparent that the Home Office are prepared, if
        not keen, to have the additional work and would not welcome any
        interference at this late stage from HSE.  I would not, therefore,
        recommend any further action on our part on that score.

        4.   However, the meeting did suggest that further work might need
        to be done on the question of demarcation between the Home
        Officers enforcement regime and ours, particularly when local
        authorities take over HSE's HSW Act enforcement work in sports
        grounds on 1 April 1990.  Because the current demarcation
        agreement is between HSE and the Home Office it will effectively
        lapse on 1 April.

        5.    Tomorrow I am chairing a HELA meeting at which HELA members
        will be asked if they wish the agreement to continue.   However
        even if HELA think this generally desirable they would not
        necessarily be able to speak for the local authorities they
        represent.   As far as we know, there is no precedent for a
        demarcation agreement of this kind between local authorities
        collectively and another enforcing authority.   Informal soundings
        suggest that HELA is likely to be very suspicious of entering into
        any agreement which circumscribes local authorities1 enforcement
    /   powers.^ However, 'if we are to avoid an embarrassing proliferation
        of enforcing authorities within sports grounds, we will need to
                                                                   1
♦




    steer HELA and the LAs towards some sort of agreement (perhaps
    along the lines of a less formal "Memorandum of Understanding"
    issued in a circular)  which at least recognises the boundaries of
    each enforcing authority's powers.  This is clearly a subject that
    will need careful handling on the LAU front.

    6.   I propose in the light of the HELA meeting to prepare a paper
    for the MB on 21 March, and think that further discussion can wait
    until then.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER : FINAL REPORT


1.   I attach a draft minute, prepared by _________ for you
to send to recipients of your previous minute.   It is in­
tended to keep them up-to-date and prevent any premature
discussions.  It proposes an MB paper for 21 March.   However,
as it refers to the HELA meeting tomorrow it becomes out-of-
date if not sent today.    It would, therefore, be helpful if
it could go this afternoon.

THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER: FINAL REPORT: INQUIRY BY THE
RT HON LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR


1.   In my minute of 13 February, I outlined some of the arguments
for and against bidding for some form of control over the new
Football Licensing Authority (FLA) and/or its Inspectorate.   I
also pointed out that much might depend on the outcome of a
meeting on 14 February between HSE, DoE and Home Office
representatives, at which we would get a feel for what, if any,
HSE involvement they might welcome.

2.   I understand that at that meeting it quickly became apparent
that DoE (which currently has oversight of the FLA) has already
had a number of bi-lateral discussions with the Home Office, and
are about to relinquish responsibility for the FLA in the Home
Office's favour.

3.   It was equally apparent that the Home Office are prepared, if
not keen, to have the additional work and would not welcome any
interference at this late stage from HSE.  I would not, therefore,
recommend any further action on our part on that score.

4.   However, the meeting did suggest that further work might need
to be done on the question of demarcation between the Home
Office's enforcement regime and ours, particularly when local
authorities take over HSE's HSW Act enforcement work in sports

                                1
grounds on 1 April 1990.  Because the current demarcation
agreement is between HSE and the Home Office it will effectively
lapse on 1 April.

 5.   Tomorrow I am chairing a HELA meeting at which HELA members
will ke asked if they are prepared to ratify the agreement on
behalf of the local authorities which they represent.   As far as
we know, there is no precedent for a demarcation agreement of this
kind between local authorities collectively and another enforcing
authority.   We have no guarantee that HELA will want to go along
with the current agreement either in principle or in practice and,
if they do accept it, whether they are content for it to be in its
present, rather general language, or if they will demand something
sharper.   Informal soundings suggest that HELA is likely to be
very suspicious of entering into any agreement which circumscribes
local authorities' enforcement powers.   However, if we are to
avoid an embarrassing proliferation of enforcing authorities
within sports grounds, we will need to steer HELA and the LAs
towards some sort of agreement (perhaps along the lines of a less
formal "Memorandum of Understanding") which at least recognises
the boundaries of each enforcing authority's powers.   This is
clearly a subject that will need careful handling by the LAU.

6.    Finally there is also the less vexatious question of the FLA
itself.   Although we have not explored this, either with the DoE
or the Home Office, there may be some merit in asking for a place
for HSE on the Authority, so that we can monitor and have some
influence over policy decisions which might affect our own policy
responsibilities.   The Authority will consist of a Chairman and
not less than 4 and not more than 8 members, all to be appointed
by the Secretary of State.   I have no strong feelings either way
about whether this is worth pursuing, or if there is a suitable
candidate we might put forward, but should be grateful for your
views.

7.   I propose in the light of the HELA meeting to prepare a paper
for the MB on 21 March.

THE FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY INSPECTORATE

Further to my recent     telephone conversation with             |I
confirm that we have    arranged to meet here at 10am on Wednesday
14 February in room     N17/14.   I will arrange for passes to be
available at entrance   door 5, North Tower.

I understand that in addition to yourself and                 Doctor
Barnett from your local authority division may also be attending.
In addition to                 and myself from DOE,              and
            from G 2 , H o m e Office will also be attending. As you
know responsibility for the FLA is likely to be transferred to
the Home Office in        view     of   its functions post Lord Justice
Taylor's final report into the Hillsborough disaster.

As I agreed with ______________ there are three main issues to
discuss.  Firstly, to explore the respective roles and possible
areas of practical overlap between the HSE and FLA inspectorate
in relation to safety matters at football grounds. This may
require discussion of possible liaison arrangements between ^the
HSE and the FLA.   Secondly, you might be able to advise on any
initial training which the FLA Inspectorate might need.  Thirdly,
you might have some thoughts on how best to ensure, apart from
through guidance circulars, that local authorities are consistent
in implementation of their responsibilities under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act     1975 in relation to designated    football
grounds.

I look forward to meeting you next Wednesday.

Yours sincerely

THE FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY INSPECTORATE

Further to my recent telephone conversation with              I
confirm that we have arranged to meet here at 10am on Wednesday
14 February in room N17/14.     I will arrange for passes to be
available at entrance door 5, North Tower.

I understand that in addition to yourself and               Doctor
Barnett from your local authority division may a lso be attending.
In addition to            and myself from DOE,                  and
            from G2, Home Office will also be attending.    As" you
Know responsibility for the FLA is likely to be transferred to
the Home Office in view of its functions post Lord Justice
Taylor's final report into the Hillsborough disaster.

As I agreed with                1there are three main issues to
discuss.   Firstly, to explore the respective roles and possible
areas of practical overlap between the HSE and FLA inspectorate
in relation to safety matters at football grounds. This may
require discussion of possible liaison arrangements between the
HSE and the FLA.    Secondly, you might be able to advise on any
initial training which the FLA Inspectorate might need.  Thirdly,
you might have some thoughts on how best to ensure, apart from
through guidance circulars, that local authorities are consistent
in implementation of their responsibilities under the Safety of
Sports Grounds Act 1975 in relation to designated football
grounds.

I look forward to meeting you next Wednesday.

Yours sincerely

THE FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY INSPECTORATE


1.   I enclose for your information and comment a copy of a
letter I have received from the DOE.          |has not phoned
yet; could you let me know if you would like to be involved
in the meeting.

2.   I would be particularly interested in howf far you think
HSE should get involved.  We will by all means\be as helpful
as we can in describing our expertise and the relationships
we have with l.as, and our policy on overlapping legislation.
But would we wish to be consulted (cf para 6) before advice
is put to the Secretary of State about accommodation or
seating capacity, or (cf para 7) about the safety certifi­
cates issued by l.a. under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975. My impression is that both Home Office and DOE would
welcome HSE's involvement and are well aware of the lack of
expertise around.  It depends more on whether HSE wishes to
offer or accept an invitation to give help.

THE FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY INSPECTORATE

Further to our recent telephone conversation I enclose an outline
°   ^ e functions of the Football Licensing Authority.     I hope
this will be of help in identifying any areas of overlap with HSE
responsibilities.

As I mentioned, I would like next month to discuss with you and
      ^ ° H esgue Dr Barnett what, if any, liaison arrangements
should be set up between the FLA and yourselves, and whether you
might be able to advise on any initial training which the FLA
Inspectorate might need and how best to ensure that local
authorities are consistent in their implementation of their
responsibilities under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.

j       Ph°ne early next month to arrange a mutually convenient
date for me to see you and Dr Barnett.

I would be grateful if you could provide Dr Barnett with the
enclosed copy of this letter and attachment. I am also copying
 h s letter to David Mould at the Home Office, in view of his
letter to you of 8 December.

THE FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY



q+-=+-q 4 .   Football Spectators Act provides for the Secretary of
gv      T°        ^   a F°otball Licensing Authority (FLA) (Section
uhii k!        7 J5®, .
                      a non_departmental public body, whose members
      Hrm,~a£P n J      y the Secretary of state, in consultation with
emnl    ™ Secretary and the Secretary of State for Wales.      It will
employ a small administrative staff and an Inspectorate.

r‘         ,Membership   is
                        likely    to   include representatives  of
                      the police, of the fire service and the
      e e r profession.  The Inspectorate would be drawn from the
rocnnn          sources.       in    addition  to   its  licensing
below             6 FLA may also have safety powers as set out


Licensing Responsibility

              designated football matches.       it will be an offence
   aami*, spectators to a designated match without a licence or to
contravene the conditions of the licence.           Before granting  a
  cence,   and in monitoring a club's performance under Its
  cence,   the    FLA       has   to have regard   to   four sets   of
c rcumstances, which will be reported on by its Inspectorate:

    (a )   whether   the club has Installed adequate machinery and
           established   adequate procedures   to ensure that    only
           members of the national football membership scheme or
           spectators authorised by the scheme (see para 4 below) are
           admitted to designated matches.  The scheme will allow for
           requirements of the scheme to be suspended in an emergency
           and the FLA will therefore also need to consider the
           emergency procedures before granting a licence; •

    (b)    whether the club is carrying out the duties set upon   it by
            the Football Membership Authority under the scheme;

    (c)    whether  the  club's   equipment,  procedures    and   other
           arrangements are such as may be reasonably      required to
           reduce the risk of offences at matches;

    (d)    whether the club has met any other requirements which the
           Secretary of State has notified to the FLA.

        0rp Sed sPectators on .the terms laid down in the scheme

I am grateful to you for the suggestion that the Health and Safety
Executive might help the new Football Licensing Authority in dealing
with safety matters at football grounds. My understanding is that
the HSE is not directly involved in the operation of safety
certificates by local authorities under the Safety of Sports Grounds
Act. But if a new national authority takes on powers in relation to
that Act, it would clearly be sensible for it to develop a
relationship with the HSE.

The present position on the Football Spectators Bill is, as you say,
that the amendments proposed by Nicholas Bidley in his letter of
10 July were made to the Bill in Standing Committee last month. The
Bill now provides for a Football Licensing Authority to license
football' grounds in relation to the membership scheme and other
matters. We have the power to extend the authority's role into the
area of safety of football grounds, subject to further Parliamentary
approval of a commencement order. We have said that we will look at
this possibility when we receive Lord Justice Taylor's final report
on Hillsborough at the end of the year.
If the Football -Licensing Authority'does" take on safety powers,                              I
will ensure that its chairman and members are aware of the
importance of a good working relationship with the HSE.

I am copying this to Douglas Hurd and Peter walker.

Dear Trevor

REPLY TO NORMAN FOWLER RE: HSE INVOLVEMENT IN SAFETY

You asked if I could give you a lead for your submission and/or
draft reply.   Firstly I would draw your attention to the Home
Office evidence to the Hillsborough Inquiry, a copy of which was
sent to you.  This sets out in paragraph 12 the interface between
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 (the 1975 Act) and the
Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 (the 1974 A c t ) .

You might be able to paraphrase paragraph 12 along the lines that
Home Office understanding of HSE role in spectator safety at
sports grounds has been limited.       This is because although
section 3 of the 1974 Act is wide ranging the Executive's policy
is to avoid duplication of enforcement.     HSE do not therefore
attempt to enforce the 1974 Act where other specific legislation
- in this case the 1975 Act administered by local authorities-
applies.

My understanding is that HSE might be willing to monitor local
authority performance as far as the issue of safety certificates
is concerned and on safety generally.   However they would expect
a commensurate increase in their resources if they were to take
on this task.   They would not, as I understand the position, be
keen to take on both licensing and safety functions of the FLA.
You might also say in any submission to your Minister that any
move to involve HSE in the administration of the 1975 Act would
need prior Home Office consent.      Even so, maintaining links
between the FLA safety functions and the HSE make sense.

I hope you can glean something from all of this for your
submission and draft reply.    If you are still in any doubt
I suggest you have a word with                 of HSE who I am
sure will be willing to help.  ---------------

                                        Yours sincerely

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS:   BILL AND SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


1.   You will recall that, 2 or 3 weeks ago, I circulated a letter
from the Secretary of State for the Environment to the Lord
President of the Council, copiedLto Mr Fowler, proposing giving
overall responsibility for sports ground safety to a new Non-
Departmental Public Body, to be set up under the Football
Spectators Bill. The Executive discussed this quickly, and
Mr Hodgkins minuted Mrs Caldwell on 13 July with a draft
indicating HSE's willingness to take the safety responsibilities
envisaged for the new NDPB, if additional resources were made
available. .

2.    It quickly became clear that DoE's proposed new NDPB had the
support of the Prime Minister's office, and that it was firmly
planned that this body should combine oversight of the Football
Membership Scheme with responsibility for safety.   Clearly no bid
from HSE for the safety responsibilities alone was going to
succeed, and the draft supplied by Mr Hodgkins was therefore never
sent.   However, HSL supplied a short letter for Mr Fowler putting
on record HSE's position, and this is attached for information.

HILLSBOROUGH - SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT


1   .    Thank you for your minute of 11 July.


2.      As I understand it, Recommendation 9 of the Popplewell
         Inquiry,   following the Bradford fire, was meant to make sure
        that HSE and LAs were liaising properly with Fire
        Authorities.     The background was that an HSE inspector had
        visited Bradford City Football Club, had copied his report to
        the Fire Authority, and the Fire Authority had not read it,
        but had filed and forgotten it.     The implication was that a
        better system of cowimunication might have alerted someone in
        authority to the litter under the stand, and thus prevented
        the fire.


        HSE implemented the recommendation with letters between the
        then Director of RPD and a Home Office Grade 2 ("the Martin-
        Morris correspondence"), which set out the responsibilities
        of HSE and fire authorities.     There was no discussion of HSE
        involvement in the issuing of a safety certificate by Local
        Authorities, nor does the Popplewell Report, read in full,
        suggest there should be.     Nor have we since then, so far as I
        know, suggested to Home Office or anybody else that HSE
        should be involved in issuing safety certificates,      (although
        I presume we would not necessarily refuse to give advice on a
        specific matter where we had technical expertise,      if we were
        asked).     And I do not know of any discussion between
        ourselves and Home Office on any of these general questions
        other than fire, on which               tfill no doubt
        advise,
4.       I did not know of any doubts about the Safety at Sports
         Ground Act covering crowd control.   I think Local Authorities
         certainly see this as their business, working with the police
         in case it turns into a law and order question.   What SPD D
         are exploring on overcrowding is the very general question of
         good practice and how effectively this has been disseminated;
         but that goes well beyond sports grounds.

         MANAGING SAFETY IN SPORTS GROUNDS
         1.      As I mentioned briefly to you on 14/7/89 in Bootle, the Health and
                  Consumer Services Department of Sheffield City Council has written to
                  APAU suggesting that it would be beneficial for sports grounds to be the
                  subject of an (APAU) central approach. Their letter (copy attached) does
                  not specify what they have in mind and I propose to seek clarification
                  from them informally. I understand, however, that they have identified a
                  need for a co-ordinated approach to safety management at sports grounds
                  by their owners, sports (primarily football) clubs and their various
                  agents and the need to influence consultants, such as those advising the
                  3 Sheffield stadia, who operate on a near nationwide basis.
         2.      I would wish to be able to respond positively to this request but clearly
                  this is a complex situation on which you have the policy lead. Is there
                  scope for investigating the issues involved under the auspices of HELA
                  and with assistance from the LG and Entertainment National Interest Group
                  at Preston?
         3.      We would need first to clarify the legal/enforcement position vis a vis
                 LAs and OGDs and have due regard for whatever emerges in the Hillsborough
                 Inquiry Report. Although some aspects are likely to be outside HSE’s
                 expertise there are others - in particular the general principles of
                 safety management, organisation and arrangements - where we might
                 usefully contribute. An audit of what actually happens at football
                 grounds, in Sheffield or elsewhere, could at the very least provide
                 better factual information on which to make policy decisions and might
                 possibly inform future guidelines on the general management of safety at
                 sports grounds under HSW Act S3.
         4.      APAU would welcome views on how to proceed.

          Dear Sir

          SAFETY IN SPORTS G R O U NDS - C E NTR AL APP ROACH

         Firstly, may I thank you for your understanding in releasing ___________    to
         assist us in the preliminary in vestigation into the tragedy of the 15th
         April last.          c o ntribu tion was invaluable to the Department and the
         Authority.

         On the subject of Safety of Sports G r o u n d s , it is our opinion that it would
         probably be b e nefic ial for Sports Grounds to be the subject of a Central
         Approach, and this Aut hority for its part would be willing to support and
         contribute to such an approach.

         Should y ou wis h to discuss this matter                   further    then do not hesitate                 to         /
         contact me on the number shown.                                                                                      //

 FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL AN D SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


 You asked for advice on the Secretary of State for Environment's
 letter to the Lord President of 10 July proposing amendments to
 the Football Spectators Bill,     one of which would give the
 licensing authority under the . Bill extra tasks relating to
 safety.  It is proposed that the licensing authority be set up as
 a Non-Departmental Public Body (NDPB).

 The Health and Safety Executive's view is that there is a good
 case for any new body with overall responsibility for sports
 ground safety to be housed within the HSE; it would require extra
 resources but be cheaper than a new quango.
                                                                         1
 However, the amendments- had-to be tabled earlier than planned and
 the Prime Minister's office has indicated that she is content
 with a quango (PPS's letter of 13 J u l y ) . I therefore suggest the
 Secretary of State need go no further than putting on record
;HSE's existing role and expertise, and pointing out the need for
.liaison between it and the new NDPB.

A draft reply is attached.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL AND SAFETY.AT SPORTS GROUNDS

Thank you for copying to me y o u r . letter of 10 July to John
Wakeham.   I understand you had to bring forward the tabling of
amendments and that the Bill does now provide for a safety role
for the licensing authority.

I am writing to put on record the contribution that can be made
by the Health and Safety Executive, although of course you may
already be bearing HSE's expertise in mind, since it already
enforces health and. safety in sports grounds not covered by the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

The   HSE  has   a   large  and   experienced   inspectorate,   and
specialists have just given evidence to the Hillsborough inquiry
on the strength of crash barriers etc in the ground.         It has
well-established liaison arrangements with local authorities,
which are i t s : enforcing agents for much health and safety
legislation.   I believe some kind of relationship between. HSE and
the new NDPB will be necessary, and would be beneficial.

I, am, copying this letter to the.xecipients of yours.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


In responding to your minute of 12 July,
emphasised that a policy decision whether to seek involvement
should precede consideration of resources implications.


My own inclination is to be cautious. Whether or not a new NDPB
makes sense is not our problem! - while it isn't self-evident how
we gain from taking on this safety function, as we might eg from
an incursion into the "environment" area.   As I read the papers,
the function is subsidiary to overseeing a national membership
scheme which would, to say the least, be novel for HSE. If the
safety function could be taken over on its own, the difficulty
might be less.


Presumably if you do decide to pursue this you will be seeking
Executive (prior to Commission) clearance very quickly; please
keep us in the picture.

    DoE PROPOSALS FOR A NEW SPORTS GROUND SAFETY AUTHORITY


    1.   I attach a draft reply for the Secretary of State to send to
    Mr Ridley.  It suggests that HSE would be well worth considering
    as the overall sports ground safety authority.

    2    You will note from the attached letter that FI, to whom I
    faxed the papers yesterday, are not enthusiastic about HSE
    becoming involved here.  I have not discussed this with Mr


    3.    On resources, the draft simply says that it should be cheaper
    for HSE to take over the work than to set up an entirely new
    authority, although HSE would clearly need extra resources.   DoE
    seem to envisage it costing up to £500,000 for the NDPB to do the
    work.   RPDB have seen the papers, although nobody with detailed
    knowledge of the resources position is currently available below
    Mr Eves.

    4.   Mrs Caldwell is expecting something by fax around the middle
    of the afternoon, and will talk to           about it.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


1. Thank you for your minute of 12 July and the correspondence
you attached on the above subject.


2. I think it is worth bearing in mind that the local authorities
will be inspecting sports grounds for a number of reasons. For
HSWA , licensing and food hygiene purposes. As far as HSWA is
concerned LA inspectors are independent of local politicians.


3. The creation of an independent NDPB seems unnecessary when HSE
could easily fit the role that is envisaged. It must also be more
cost effective to use an existing enforcement agency rather than
create a new one. It is independent of Ministers but accountable
to them. Its tri-partite structure and proven track record should
meet public concerns. Its legislative and reasonable
practicability approach would I have thought provided an ideal
means of reconciling membership scheme controls with safety. As
you point out in your minute we also have the necessary technical
expertise available within HSE including experts on fire matters.
I would have thought however that any system which is set up
should permit local liaison with the fire authorities etc. to
reflect provision of water hydrants, access by fire tenders.


4. If the responsibility is given to HSE we could make
arrangements within the Enforcing Authority Regulations to allow
LAs to enforce the Act on our behalf. Uniformity and consistency
can be ensured thorough our existing HELA machinery and we could
set up a SCHELA working Group to make sure that this worked
efficiently at a practical level. There is a well established
successful record with the HELA system that could be applied
easily to the provisions envisaged by DoE.


5. On the licensing aspect I wonder whether a licence under HSWA
would however be appropriate given HSE's policy of using it only
in circumstances which represent high and special risks.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS'    BILL AND SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS


1.   You asked for advice on Mr Ridley's letter of 10 July to the
Lord President of the Council, copied to Mr Fowler, proposing
giving overall responsibility for sports ground safety to a new
Non-Departmental Public Body, to be set up under the Football
Spectator's Bill.

2.   I have discussed this with ray fellow Executive members.    We
believe there is a good case for any new body with overall
responsibility for sports ground safety to be housed within the
HSE.  The attached draft letter for the Secretary of State sets
out our reasons.  Broadly, we believe HSE already has much of the
necessary expertise and is experienced in working with Local
Authorities and inspecting general safety systems and policies.
It is already responsible for sports grounds which do not require
a certificate under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1974.    We
believe it would be cheaper to give the responsibilities to HSE
than to set up a completely new public body, whose duties would
inevitably overlap with HSE's, at least to some extent.   Finally,
we see presentational advantages for Government in giving
responsibility for safety to a body which is acknowledged as the
principal public authority on this subject.

3.   As you know, HSE has distanced itself from any general
responsibility for sports ground safety in the wake of the
Bradford case, since there was no doubt that the Home Office, via
Local Authorities, were enforcing more specific legislation in
this area.  However, our general technical expertise is highly
relevant to many of the risks involved, and HSE specialists have
recently finished giving evidence to the Hillsborough Inquiry.
While we could not do more within our existing resources, if there
is the political will to finance a supervisory safety authority,
we believe HSE would be a natural home for it.  Although the draft
leaves open which Department HSE should answer to on this
question, I think the Home Office, which is responsible for the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, would be the natural choice.   I
would envisage an Agency Agreement of the sort we already have
with several Departments.

4.     I attach a draft along these lines for the Secretary of
Sta t e .

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS'   BILL AND SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS
                              k

Thank you for copying to me your letter of 10 July to John
Wakeham.


I was very interested in your proposal to set up the licensing
 "thority under the Bill as a new Non-Departmental Public Body
sNDPB), and to give it extra tasks relating to safety.             Like you,
I am hesitant about creating a new public body of this type, and
think we should consider an alternative approach,            which should
also prove a little cheaper.


The Health and Safety Executive is the main public authority
responsible for health and safety.             It reports, via the Health and
Safety Commission,   primarily to myself, but also answers to many
other Secretaries of State on different issues.              I suggest it
might be a very suitable body to have overall supervisory
responsibility for sports ground safety,             for the following
reasons:


     a)    the HSE already has a large and experienced
           inspectorate,   with expertise in engineering and
           construction.    HSE specialists have just given evidence
           to the Hillsborough inquiry on the strength of crash
           barriers etc in the ground.


     b)    HSE already works regularly and harmoniously with Local
           Authorities on health and safety.             LAs are enforcing
           agents for much health and safety legislation,            and a
            well established structure of committees ensures
            consistent standards.


     c)     HSE is well used to inspecting and monitoring the safety
            policies and systems of large organisations;        it has a
            unit devoted to this.


     d)     under its existing general powers, HSE will already
            enforce   health and safety in any sports   grounds not
            covered   by the Safety of Sports Grounds   Act 1975.


     e)     I see presentational advantages in giving the overall
            responsibility for sports ground safety to a large,
            respected and independent body, whose prime concern is
            clearly with safety in all its aspects.


In addition, while the HSE would certainly need extra resources to
take on this new work,     I would expect this to be a cheaper option
than setting up a completely new NDPB.


I therefore suggest we should explore the HSE's being given the
responsibilities you envisage for the licensing authority under
the Bill,   answering to the Home Secretary or to yourself.         I would
be happy to discuss this    further in a meeting or     among officials.

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL

While I have no objections to the proposals for an overseeing
body as described, I do not see any way that the description fits
HSE.

The politics are clearly to use inspectors recruited from the
ranks of ex-police or fire services, reporting to another of the
same ilk so that they will all feel comfortable with each other.
That would fit ill into the HSE set up.

We could not use existing inspector staff, and the calls on our
specialists (building/engineering) would stretch their existing
resource very considerably without any guarantee of being able to
make up numbers by recruitment.

To set this up within HSE in respect of a single sport seems to
me quite unsuitable, particularly if at the same time we are
continuing to carry out ordinary S.2 inspections under HSW at the
same grounds for existing purposes.  Better leave this strictly
to others in my view.  I have consulted Area 18 who agree with
this line.

 FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL


 1.   The attached papers reached me this morning from D.E.      They
      describe DoE proposals to set up a new Licensing Authority to
      oversee the way Local Authorities grant safety certificates
      to sports grounds.      The proposed new Authority (see Annex B)
      will be a Non-Departmental Public Body, and will have its own
      inspectorate.


 2.   HSE has deliberately kept a very low profile on football
      ground safety, with other departments taking the lead else­
      where.      However, if a new NDPB is to be set up, I think we
      should consider making a case for its being based in HSE.         We
      are a respected safety authority, with expert staff in the
      engineering and building professions, which DoE think impor­
      tant (Annex B para 4).     We are used to liaising with Local
      Authorities, and to inspecting the systems etc*, mentioned in
      Annex B para 1.     Giving the job to HSE avoids needing to
      create a new NDPB.      Obviously we would need the resources
      currently on offer to set up the new Unit.


 3.   I would be grateful     for views - by phone if necessary - by
      lunchtime tomorrow, Thursday, and am sorry for the short
      deadline.

 Timlm

Ihe start-up date of the licensing authority will, of course,
oepeiM on oar decision as to whether to proceed with extending
its powers in the way l am proposing, when we have seen Lord
    stii                8® report? and on Parliament's approval both of
extending the authority "s powers and of the membership scheme
xtself in the light of any comments that Taylor nay make. We have
a c k n o w l e d g e Uiat the earliest that the membership scheme can now
be implemented will be the early months of the 1990/91 season, On
the assumption that we decide to give the licensing authority
              P®w®rs<» * would expect it to begin operation once
Parliament has given its approval in the light of the Taylor
report, ii tf<aaL/ in 1S90, fee prepare for inspections in the
interval between the 1989/90 and 1990/91 seasons.

k iii§3> i* J _*1         implications _ _ the licensing authority
 %s    NDPB the licensing authority would be subject to the usual
financial controls, including corporate planning, which apply to
such bodies. These controls would provide the mechanism for
monitoring performance and value for money and for policy
evaluation. The Football Spectators Bill provides for some or all
of the costs of the licensing authority in respect of its
runctions under the national membership scheme to be recovered
through fe      targed to football clubs for the issue of licenses.
1 also propose that some or all of the costs of the licensing
authority ^in respect o£ its safety functions or of its role in
relation to all-seat eh .*f..cammodation should be recovered in this
way, 1 will consider further what proportion of the authority’s
costs should be recovered by the licence fee, in consultation
with the Home Secretary and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.
Recctpf ; u,u!i      by the authority would be treated as revenue
surrenderable to the Consolidated Fund and the authority's
expenses would be met by grant in aid for which 1 would need to
seek PES cover.

 In my letter of 28 September 1988 seeking the Committee 's
apprm             Part I of the Bill, I estimated, the cost to public
fun<              1 licensing authority as some £250,000 a year and
perhaps H^OO,000 in the first year. Given, the extended, powers we
now propose, 2 estimate the total annual cost of the licensing
authority and its inspectorate would be between £500,000 and
/■     ,' ',k1 a year. This includes salary and ancillary costs
including accommodation? travel and subsistence and a consultancy
b             The inspectorate will be the equivalent of nine full time
staff members and the administrative support Is likely to be five
s t r o n g T h e first year in which the costs will arise in full will
be 1990/91 but there will be some preparatory costs in the
present financial year for which we do not have budgetary cover.

           The .licensing authority

          1. §»« propose to give the authority powers to enable it to
          monitor the way in which local authorities Issue and enforce
          safety certificates* The object would be to ensure a consistency
          of approach as between on© authority and another in setting
          standards for ■J.n/ety, and that local authorities hav** effective
          systems in place to satisfy themselves that ground operators
          fully comply with       the   terms  and   conditions  of   safety
          certificates.    The    licensing   authority    after   necessary
          consultation would, have power to require an individual        sal                     '»,


          authority to make changes to a certificate and to its
          arrangements for ensuring otwpliance with the certificate*

          2. It is important that a local authority opposed in principle to
          the football membership scheme envisaged by the Bill should not
          be able to use its safety certificate power to fruatrat* the
          membership scheme* Equally it is important that the licensing
          authority should not approve arrangements for the membership
          scheme which are not compatible with safety. Guidance on the
          relationship between the authorities could be provided by Hone
          Office      IE, perhaps in the form of a joint circular,

         3. There ia nevertheless a risk that there will on occasion be a
         genuine difference of opinion between a local authority and the
         xicensing authot i.uy Miout how to apply the Guide at a particular
         sports ground. Under ts      .>vrer proposed, the final decision on
         any changes to the terms and conditions of a safety certificate
         d            ie licensing authority will rest with that authority.
         But since the local authority will still have the statutory duty
         to issue and enforce safety certificates,.we would make provision

                   Struct '‘iv


                     ■ In order to c a n y out its functions the licensing authority
                   would need to h a w an inspectorate. The Hone Secretary has
                   pointed out that there would be strong misgivings by the
                   Association, of Chief Police Officers and the Chief and Assistant
                   Chief   Fire Officers*      Association at the idea that the
                   professional competence of the police and fire services in making
                   their input into the content of individual safety certificates '
                  should be supervised by the licensing authority* To secure the
                  confidence of Interested parties both the authority and its
                  inspector? *u „ „a therefor© need to include suitable people front
                  the-         and £ u » services. We also think that the engineering
                  <*nd building professions would have to be represented on the
                  authority and the inspectorate teams since both make an essential
                  contribution to the content of safety certificates,

                   3, *m therefore propose that a snail licensing authority should
                  be set up on which the Interests I have Identified should be
                  represented under a lay chairman. Appointments would be at the
                  level of retired Chief Constable and his equivalent. The
                  inspectorate would comprise of tews of inspectors, and 1 think
                  we would require three teams or their part time equivalent, on
                  w*\lch the same interests would      represented. Appointments to
                  the inspectorate .would be at Chief Superintendent level.

                  6. The team of inspectors could ba expected to spend some 4 days
                  on a ground inspection, including p     sinary work on plans and
                  the 1,1    certificates, reappraisal and report in the light of
                  the on site inspection and travelling, m envisage that grounds
                  should be inspected annually but that the authority would have
                  discretion about the nature and extent of each inspection,'it may
                  decide that a full inspection is only required at less frequent

 Co rectify them or so arrange matters that no risk to the public occurs.                        The

 Working Party consists of representatives froa the Police, Fire Service,

 Building Surveyors and the County Council - it considers in detail various

 matters (such as the Spion Kop developtaent at Sheffield Wednesday Football

 Ground) and also any outstanding items from the bi-annual inspections.                        The

 Workj.n0 Party is effectively a C 0 " 0 rdinati.ng body vhich attempts to ensure that

 a balanced and consistent apjfroach is maintained to current issues at the Sports

 Grounds.          Any recommendations it makes are subject to approval by this Panel.

 The Health and Safety Executive

 Recommendation 9 of The Popplevell Cc as i tt e e’s Interin Report read as follows

 “There should be urgent consultation between the Health and Safety Executive and

toe Fire Authorities and Local Authorities as to how be 3 t to co-ordinate and

comn&micate their inspections and reports".                Bearing this in mind the local

office of the Health and Safety Executive was invited to participate in the

administrative system for safety at sports grounds.                    This invitation was

declined*           The Executive will apparently take no direct part in the

Certification             system*
i-n view of this problem the Hose Office was contacted and the position

explained; it appears that negotiations are under way between the Hone Office

end the HSE about P o pp l ew e ll ’s recommendation but as yet there has been no

useful outcome.


In tnese circumstances the Council could keep the Health and Safety Executive

informed of all developments in Sheffield and to invite their comments on them.

It would then be the responsibility of the Executive to decide whether or not to

respond.

            I am Police Constable 3138 Geary of the South Yorkshire Po l ic e ,

            presently stationed at Rawmarsh.

            On Saturday       15th April     1989 <150489),        I was detailed for duty at

            Hillsborough football ground for the semi final match between

            Liverpool and Nottingham Foest.

            I was    incLdiiejf in Serial 52,        the serial Sergeant being PS 969

            Ho d g k i r N / m , with DI C            charge.       We were briefed by senior

            officers at Hi 1Isbo rough footblal g round at approx 9 am that date.                   At

            10.45 a m , along with yther members of the serial                I commenced duty at

            Herries Road coa^h /parj/, /f upervising the arrival of Nottingham Forest

            coaches.       As supporters * t      off the coaches        it was evident that some

            of them had been drinking,           but there were few signs of unruly

            behaviour,       the mood in general being good.             Due to the lack of toilet
                                                                           PAGE
                                                                           S2274

■facilities, and the       number of fans arriving many were being advised to

use the wooded area        across from the coach park to urinate if

ne ce ss ar y.   Thjgj^a-^did not appear to be any problems   caused by this .

By approx'''2.41? pm t/iat date, a 11 the Nottingham Forest coaches had

arriv^eK,G r o r t a n s    had dispersed    from the Herries Road area.

           wgy*€et off,    in company with other serials who had also been on

dutv^tfiose b y , to walk to Claywheels L a n e , to take jLjhot meal.     En

route as a result of a message received by PI Charles, we were

diverted to Leppings L a n e .      On arrival at Vere r oad , the officers who

were on route, approx 5 serials         in all, were lined up in their serials

and told to stand by for further instructions.           We waited for a few

minutes then were instructed by DI Charles to enter the ground.               I was

not aware at this stage what the problem was          inside the ground,

but I had seen an ambulance approach the Leppings Lane end of the

ground, with its blue beacons flashing,         whilst   I had been standing on

Vere Road.

As I entered the enclosure at the back of leppings Lane stand,             via

Gate C,    I saw that a cordon of Police officers had been formed to my

left leading up to the g a t e .      An ambulance was also parked on the left

just before the entrance to the enclosure.

I saw that the enclosure was full of people, milling around,           shouting,

in a general      state of panic.     I pushed my way through the crowd

towards the tunnel entrance,         getting separated from other members of

my serial, and looking round in attempt to ascertain what the problem

was that we had been sent in to deal with.

I saw that in the enclosore,         there were police officers,   ambulancemen,

and St J o h n ’s ambulance volunteers amongst the crowds of fans.          I then

saw approx three or four people laying on the floor in the enclosure

being attended to by the afore-mentioned groups of people.            I saw

"police officers     coming out of the tunnel entrance carrying people,          or
                                                                             PAGE     3
                                                                             S2274

aiding others who were obviously injured.               The tunnel entrance was

getting blocked by groups of Liverpool            fans trying to get back into

the ground from the enclosure,            and I could see that the officers were

having difficulty coming out of the tunnel due to the blockage.

I went to the tunnel         entrance, and started to pull fans away from the

entrance to clear a passage for the officers.               I could see that some

of the people the officers were bringing out were obviously dead,

although officers,        ambulancemen, St J o h n ’s    volunteers and fans were

making attempts at resuscitation.             I continued to keep fans away from

the entrance,      and gave assistance to those who were injured,         directing

ambulance staff to where they were.             On two occasions while I was

kneeling on the ground at the side of an injured man,              I was grabbed

hold of by my anorak by a fan wearing Liverpool              colours, who called me

a "Fucking Mu rd er er ” and said that he hoped I d i d n ’t sleep that night.

A number of fans were abusive and aggressive              in this manner, and

skirmishes broken out in various parts of the enclosure between

Liverpool     fans.    Other fans were trying to stop these fights and were

helping the Police and ambulancemen in any way possible.               Some fans

were hysterical which seemed to aggravate the situation.

Whilst    in the enclosure,         I was not near anyone who was in radio

contact,    and did not know what the situation was           inside the ground

itself.     Police Officers         in the enclosure were asking each other     if

they knew what had happened,            no one knew^-

I was then approached by PS 969 Hod^ffinsorTVho was in company with PC
             y
1974 Jones.       PS Hodgkinson informed me that we were going through the

tunnel onto the pitch.

As I left the enclosure             I would state that I had seen approximately 15

dead bodies      in total brought/out of the tunnel.          As we entered the

lower terrace via the tun/e//tjhe noise in the ground was deafening

 small groups of people standing about, appearing dazed.               We went onto

 the pitch via Gate 3.            I saw that there was a large number of police

 officers on the pitch in front of the terrace fencing.               A cordon of

t police officers had been formed across the centre of the pitch.                I saw

 that there was a small number of casualties on the ground in various

 places on the pitch being treated by ambulance and police officers.

 The mood of the crowd in the upper terraces of Leppings Lane stand

 appeared aggressive by the way some of the fans were acting,                but there

 also seemed to be a feeling of frustration among some fans who were

 unable to help from their position.

 I saw then that some of the fans on this terrace were starting to rip

 advertising hoardings down from the front of the terrace.

 My first reaction was that these hoardings were going to be used as

 missiles.       I then realised that they were being handed down to the

 lower terrace to be used as stretchers for the casualties.

 Along with other officers I helped to stack the hoardings on the

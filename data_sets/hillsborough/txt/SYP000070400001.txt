              I w ould      say       I had been waiting at                   that    point     for about 5 or           10 m i nu te s

but as we went            t h ro ug h    the exit       gate we were walking                 normally.       At

this    time my small            g roup was        still    together.

As we got        into            gro un d    I could see,          by the     opened         exit    g a t e ,a few

pol ic em en a n ^ t e w a r d s .          They were a c t u a l l y      inside Jme          g round.      The

a s k ed me for my ticket.                  Once    inside    the entrance             I could see a tunnel

      front     of m r thro ug h w h ic h          I could see the           pitch.          We made       our way

to that       tunnel

I did not see any d ir e ct i on signs w hatsoever.

As we got        into the        tunnel,       it was      crowded     but   not u nc omfortable.                 As

we    reached near         the end of the                                                                   ht and

that    I was     being        forced along         1                              o r ce pushed

into    the terraces and                forced me to the           right     of the dividing               fence and

4own    into     pen 3.         I was     l it erally taken down from the                     top of the

terrace       to wi th in a few feet               of the fences at           the front.             The    surge

then stop pe d and             1 looked      round.        I then saw,       about        two yards        to my

right,     also        just a few feet          from the      front     fence,         Graharri R O B E R T S .     He

looked at me and smiled.                     Fro m that      time    the     crush behind me grew and

grew.       I could not move and                I could not         breathe.           P e o p 3.e were

sc re am in g    for the        front    gate      to be opened but all                the    police were

saying was        go back.              1 noti ce d a few         people about me whose               heads were

s l um pe d but were           being     held up by the            crush.

T h e n , at some        point,         Ifainted.        W he n    I came    to    Iwas      lyi ng .on the

,floor amongst          others.          Two    l^ds g r ab b ed me and           by          this    time the      crowd

had    pulled back and a gang wa y had opened                        up so     I was         taken back       u p the

terraces,        out t h rough / h e         tunnel     w h i ch was    empty,         to some       toilets.

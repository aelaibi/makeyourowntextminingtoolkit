              CHIEF CONSTABLE

 In accordance with the requirements of Regulation 7 of the Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985, I hereby inform you of
 a*           COMPLAINT_________                                                                     which has been made against you.

 NATURE OF *           COMPLAINT


              On Saturday 15 April 1989 at Hillsborough Football ground, Sheffield, a
              disaster occurred in which 95 people died.

              Trevor Hicks of________________________________________ Middlesex,
              has made previous allegations in relation to your duties at the ground.
              He has now made the following further allegation;
              That he, Mr Hicks, with regard to his previous complaint against you
              of making a false statement, in that you were deceitful and intentionally
              misled senior police officers and the public, (SEE REGULATION 7 NOTICE
              OF 3 AUGUST 1989 SERVED BY MR COOPER ACC NORTHAMPTONSHIRE) now further
              alleges that he questions whether Mr Walter Jackson A.C.C. was unaware
              of the real circumstances relating to the opening of the gate. Mr
              Hicks can see no reason why you would not have told Mr Jackson the
              truth and therefore considers there may have been collusion between
              yourself and Mr Jackson concerning this point.




  You have the right to consult a friend at all stages of the investigation and service of this form does not necessarily imply
  that disciplinary proceedings will follow. It is served to safeguard your interests.

  You are not as the Regulation explains, obliged to say anything concerning the matter, but you may if you so desire, make
  a written or oral statement concerning the matter to me or to the Assistant Chief Constable. (The Chief Constable has
  delegated his authority under Regulation 15 of the above Regulations to the Assistant Chief Constable).

  YOU ARE. HOWEVER. WARNED TH A T IF YOU MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT TO ME OR TO THE ASSISTANT
  CHIEF CONSTABLE. THE STATEMENT M AY BE USED IN A NY SU B SEQ U EN T^SC IPLIN A RY PROCEEDINGS.




                                                                                              I nvestigatipgjQfflcer

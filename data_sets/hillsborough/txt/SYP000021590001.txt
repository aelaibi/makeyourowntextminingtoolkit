                                         OF



I    live    at                                       Liverpool              My date of birth is

                ind I am employed as a driver by                                     I am a man of no

criminal     convictions and have supported Liverpool Football Club                         for many

years.



I am a season ticket holder at Liverpool F.C. and obtained a ticket for the

semi final game at Hillsborough between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.                           The

ticket I obtained/ and which I still have in full/ was for the Leppings Lane

end of the ground.



Five of us went to the game/ in my brother-in-law's car.                           I was the driver/

we     set   out   from   Liverpool      at   about    11.30am.        We    drove    on the M62 to

Manchester and then took an A Road to Sheffield.                       There was a slight traffic

jam just outside Manchester/ which probably held us up for 15 or 20 minute®:

In addition/ my nephew was a little travel sick/ but the jam was nothing to

cause concern.           After the major roundabout into Sheffield/ all the traffic

converged and formed a single line.                   There were Police/ but they were not

directing us/ they were just parked up.                 I just followed the line of traffic.

I parked the vehicle at about 2.15pm.                      I parked on a main road leading to

Hillsborough/ I suppose about a quarter of a mile away.                           It was roughly were

I had parked the previous year.               We walked from the car to a chip shop/ which

is quite close to the ground.                 Got some chips/ ate them.              I did not finish

mine/ I threw them away because time was getting on and we wanted to get in.

We joined the queue at about 2.35pm.                    I threw the chips away because the

crowd was so dense that I could not possibly eat them.                            Myself and my group

were headed for turnstile B.                  It took a good five minutes to get from the

    road through the perimeter gates.              I could only see one mounted Policeman

    controlling    the    crowd   and    in   my   view/    he   could      not   control   the   horse

    properly.      The horse was circling and seemed to me to be panicking.                         The

    Officer was screaming and shouting/ he also seemed to be panicking/ and did

    not seem to be in control.          He was not directing people.



    It seemed to me that the Officer on the horse somehow was trying to make the
                                                -   2 -




queue    into a curve      torelieve some of the pressure/ but people were coming

from behind him and        he could not cope.             I don't know whether he    had a radio

on him.      At    this stage/      ie.   2.35pm/      I cannot recollect seeing any other

Police.     Outside the turnstiles into the ground there are railings, so there

is sane sort of channelling but it was impossible to define lines of people

at different turnstiles.            By the time I was in the queue for my particular

turn, I had lost two of the group, although this was not significant/ because

it has happened before/ there was alot of crushing but nothing which caused

any undue concern.         It was a big        crowd and           a big game.I normally stand on

the KOP at Liverpool in any event.



I   remember      the   Officer    on   the    horse      seemed    to   be trying to close the

perimeter gate and there was one Officer on foot / on a different part of the

gate.     They were both trying to close the gate but could not because of the

pressure of people.         Myself/ my mate and some others turned round and helped

the Policeman to close the gate and we were shouting at others to get back.

This would be at about 2.40pm.                I remember the Tanyo saying something to the

effect that Liverpool supporters should not panic because there was plenty of

roan and they would all get in.               My mate said to me that we should get out of

the crowd and wait for a bit/ since I had my niece with me.                      We pulled out of

the main body of the crowd and waited by a little bit of wire mesh.                           The

gates by this time had been forced open again/ they were not locked/ and the

pressure of the weight of people had forced them open.                       The turnstiles were

on our left as we walked across the back of the ground and there was a gate

on our immediate left/            just behind the turnstiles/ which was open.               There

were three stewards and two or three Policemen on it.                         We just walked in.

 Before this, I can say that two or three more mounted Police appeared on the

 scene.     Nobody asked for our tickets.                 I still have my ticket/ including the

 counterfoil.       As I walked in, I said to one of the stewards thathe/ or they/

 should get outside        to     sort things out.          The steward        said "We were told just

 to stay inside the ground."



 We     walked    through the central tunnel onto the terracing.                    There was no
                                    -    3 -


difficulty walking through the tunnel/ we got past one or two people/ went to

the left.   Suddenly there was a surge of people from behind/ one of my mates

got lost.   I tried to take my niece as far over as I could.     I sensed that it

could be an awkward afternoon.     The previous year there had been crushing/

but I had been in one of the outside side terraces at the Leppings Lane end.

My brother-in-law had agreed that we should go in the central terrace to see

if the crushing was not as severe.         I got to a wall at the back of the

terracing but the crushing was bad.       A lad/ I don't know who he was, said

that we would not be able to see anything.       My niece by this stage was white

and I said to this lad that I wanted to get her out.       By this time the match

had just kicked off.   It took at least five minutes to get the short distance

from where I was originally standing back to near where this wall was.        The

wall is probably only about four feet long and is by the tunnel where people

came into the Leppings Lane end.



There were Police in the stands looking over and we tried to pass her up to

them.   One of the Officers was a P.C./ the other was clearly a higher rank/

because the P.C. look at him and the higher ranked Officer looked down and

said "No/ you'll have to stay where you are."       Alot of people around me were

saying "Take her up will you/" and I cannot recall my exact words/ but I am

sure that I was abusive to the Officer.        I managed to get my niece on this

wall.   I cannot recall anybody else being passed up at this stage.

(aged 11) was scared and asked me to stand by the wall.         People were still

coming in and we were getting pushed.     I got back to the wall and I looked up

and saw a lad and I said to him just take her will you.      This fella looked at

me and said I can't because the coppers won't let us and I said just "fuck

the coppers/ take her will you."        This lad took her up.     The lad who had

helped me then pushed me onto the wall.        I looked up/ a Police Officer — the

Police Constable I mentioned earlier said "You're not coming up."         The lad

told him I was with the little girl/ and I then said said just fuck him pull

me up/ and I got up.     The Police Officer had walked away.       By this stage/

alot of people were climbing up.         I then began to help other people up.

Eventually I made my way back to the car.
                                    - 4 -




In my view the blame is with the Police.    They failed properly to provide any

crowd control, adequate to suit the circumstances:     I didn't see any evidence

of drunkeness, or violence outside the ground.       Obviously there were people

who had had a drink, but it was only to improve the spirits as they went to

see a game of football.



Additionally, after we got into the ground, before going through the tunnel,

there was nobody inside directing people either side of the central terrace.

I also think that the penning at the end is a contributory factor because

there was not roan for people to fan either side, if there was a crush.     I am

not certain whether the perimeter fencing did any real damage, because in my

view, the crushing was too severe for anybody to be able to climb out at the

front.    The pressure from the back would have had to be relieved to enable

people to have the space to get over at the front.



If I can be of any assistance, I am prepared to attend an Enquiry.

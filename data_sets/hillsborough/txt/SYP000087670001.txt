           I live at the above address and have been a supporter of L iverpool

           Football Club all my life.
                                               rvia
           I apt my ticket through my brothej^John,          it was for the No r th ^Jetand at

           H I 11 sborough in Sheffield and cost £14 and was for the FA Cup Semi

           Final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on 15th April             1989

           150489.

     to    On the day of the match in the morning       I got another ticket for the

           game through a mate,     it was for £6 for the standing area of L e p p an gs
                                                                       fy/bQ4'W94Jkj &3
           Ln of the ground.      I decided to take my young nephew John GIlyflOOKEY to

           the game with us.

           At about    10.00 1000 that morning with my brother John I went to J o h n ’s

           house to get him to come to the match.       In fact he was out but John

           and I went to the local swimming baths to pick him up.
                                                                                         PAGE        2
                                                                                         S3193

             We all travelled to Hillsborough in a 12 seater mini bus which is

             owned by my brother John who has a coach company.

             We left Livei^pool at about      11.0 0 a m / 11.3Qam 1100 1130 and drove direct

             to Shef f ig g d .   In the bus were me and my brother John and a lad called

             Rod ,JQ[y£Y, who it was intended would look after John at the ground as

             he Tfad a terraces ticket as well.       There were others on the bus but

             none of them as far as I know had anything to do with my/nephew John.

             The journey to Sheffield took a long time due to hea^y traffic and

             congestion on the roads.       We had no long stop on the way but I think

             we stopped once to use a toilet.        As far as I remember we got to

      I      Sheffield at about      1.45pm - 2.00pm 1345 1400.         We parked quite a way

             from the ground.       I d o n ’t know the name of the road but it was in a

             housing estate about      10/15 minutes walk from the ground.         We had some

             refreshments where we parked and then together walked down to the

             ground.

             I would like to say that on the way to the ground in the bus and as we

             walked,    I saw no bad behaviour by the fans          in any way.   I saw no

             excessive drinking or rowdyness.        I also remember that I saw very few

             Police.     Our bus was not stopped and searched as I was not checked on

             the way to the ground to see if I had a ticket.

             I have been to the ground before^so had no difficulty in finding where

       ^   \/to   go.It was about 2.40pm ><t40 and as we got to the Leppings Ln it
                                    X 7
 V°          was just chaos when we arrived.   I did not see any Police Officers
      St
             outside the ground,      just a mass of fans trying to get in, they were
V'
             not formed into queues or anything.         It was just a solid mass.           I did

             .not see any mounted Police Officer outside the g ro un d.

             I went to the left hand turnstile as I assume that Rod JOLLY took

                                                            er

                                                                I

                                                            e
                                                                                   PAGE      3
                                                                                   S3193

     I had my ticket taken by the operator.           I did not see any Police

     Officers    by the turnstiles entries and the outside or the insi de-

     I went to the walkway to the stand at the entrance.              I saw one of two

     stewards who directed me to where I should sit.             I got to the seat at

     ^bout 2.55pm 1455.       The match started.      I was watching that and did

     not realise there was trouble at the Leppings Ln end.              I had a good

     view of the Leppings Ln terrace but I did not know what was causing

     the trouble.     It was people coming out the pitch a nd I thought at

     first    it may have been a fight,     but that would fcrsCve been unusual as

     the Liverpool fans don't fight amongst themselves.

     The only thing I really saw was p e o p l e i m b i n g    over the fence and the

     Police a t first were trying to stop/ihem getting out.             The Police then

     must have realised that somet/hino^serious was happening as P o l i c e ,

     fans and everybody was pul 1|ng/people out of the pe ns .           The fans were

     then getting the advertising boards down and carrying people off the

     pitch.

     I stood watching what was going on till about 3.40pm 1540 when I left

     and went back to the bus where I met up with iny brother John.                John

     and I then went to the local Police Station, after we had returned to

     the ground.     We had gone to an area near the gymnasium where we were

     told by a Police Officer,       I cannot identify,     that a 10 year old boy

     had been taken to hospital.         It was after this we went to the local

     Police Station and eventually were taken to a sports club to wait for

     information.

     At about    10pm 2200 that evening John and I were, asked to go to the

     gymnasium to try to identify John.          As we>4rrived we were shown a

     number of photographs on a display boa/d.            I straight away saw the

     picture of J o h n .   I know it had o n J l X a number between 8 0 / 8 9 .   As soon
J3   as I saw the picture 1 broke dow/f and so could not go with John any
                                                                            PAGE     4
                                                                            S3193

         outside.

         We then waited in Sheffield till J o h n ’s father Ronald arrived to

         identify his son.     I suppose we left Sheffield at ^bout 5.30am 0530 to

         return to Liverpool.

         I would just like to say that I believe         one of the things that

         went towards causing the tragedy at Sbeffield was that the Police did

         not appear to be organised either /inside or outside the ground.       It

         was very different to the sameyri(atch last year which I also attended.

         On that occasion al l^the j ^dfches and cars were directed and you were

         not allowed near the ground without a ticket.

                                                                           SIGNED

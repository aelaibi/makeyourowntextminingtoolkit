Sir Murray



A small experiment here. Both screens show the sequence in the
Leppings Lane pen 2 from about 14.18 onwards - the pictures which
Trevor Hicks thought were very significant when he found them on the
Yorkshire TV tape - but which are also on the police tape TB2.

The large screen has these pictures as they appear on TB2. The small
screen has them as they appear on the Yorkshire TV tape, as copied fo r
us by Mr Hicks.

The experiment is to run them both together and compare. Two points
emerge

                 the film is (of course) the same, showing that the mysterious
                 Yorkshire TV material which excited Mr Hicks was on the
                 police video TB2 and available to Taylor and the Coroner
                 all along;

                 the Yorkshire TV version is noticeably sharper than the TB2
                 one. But I donâ€™t think we can deduce from that that the
                 police were trying to disguise the quality o f the tape because

                       the two tapes stem from the same source, and YTV got
                       their tape from the police in the first place; and

                       the police tape has (I believe) been copied more times
                       than the YTV one, reducing its quality.

            TWENTY-NINTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

               TUESDAY, 27th JUNE,       1989

                    (AFTERNOON    SESSION)

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, I hope you have received now
the memoranda from Mr. Bownes in the form of, I think
it is, five sheets.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I think it is coming up now.

     MR. MAXWELL:      Sir, can I just explain what it   is that
you are receiving?

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes.   Thank you.

     MR. MAXWELL:    Three of the sheets are headed by a page
marked delay and the other two are headed safety certificate
conditions schedule.

     MR. COLLINS:   Those behind me have only received
three sheets.  I do not know whether that is general or
whether we are being discriminated against.

     MR. MAXWELL:     There should be a total of five.

     MR. COLLINS:    Being discriminated against. I have
got five but I just wondered whether anyone else had
three sheets only.  I am told the five may have been
divided into three and 2 but I am not sure.

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sound engineering principle.       Sir,
do you have the five sheets?

     LORD JUSTICE  TAYLOR:   I have got three and two
which takes one back a very long time.

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, yes.  What they consist of,
on the sheet marked delay, is a commentary on the
matter of delay and that is attached to a chronology
of what are called and explained in the body of the
first sheet exceptional events arising in Mr. Bownes'
workload and running parallel with that chronology
is a chronology set out under the heading safety
certificate condition schedule and the chronology
is divided up into six month blocks each and it is
hoped one can look across from the blocks in the
chronology of exceptional events to the corresponding
block in the safety certificate conditions schedule.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Yes.   Thank you.

                                                                D. BOWNES

                              DAVID BOWNES   Recalled

                         Examined by MR. COLLINS   (Cont'd) :

         Q. Yes,  Mr. Bownes, perhaps the convenient thing to do would
            be to incorporate this into your statement, would it, as
            really part and parcel of it? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. Mr. Bownes, we were dealing just before lunch with the
            change of the working party to the advisory group,
            advisory - I have forgotten the name now. - A. Group, sir.

         Q. Group.   I was right, yes.  And you explained about that.
            Now, you were then going on to explain about the future
            administration.  That, I think, appears, does it not,
            at page 418 of our bundle and 129 of yours or does that
            deal with both, both the change of status of the advisory
            group and the future administration? - A. Yes, sir, it
            deals with both.

         Q.We have dealt with the advisory group.  Can we go on to
            the future administration and can you tell us of the
            salient details of your understanding of the system
            after this was agreed? - A. Yes, sir. Basically it was
            similar to the old system in that there were some
            guidelines issued to the various officers indicating
            the areas in which they would have a particular
            responsibility, if you like.  I think that is dealt
            with in full detail in the report.

         Q. The areas of responsibilities are those set out at
            the bottom of the first page or, rather, the .... - A.
            That is correct, sir, and over the page on 3.

         Q. Yes.  What I still want to know is the question of the
            decision making and that you set out on page 418.   You
            say there is also, under delegations, also a further
            question to be dealt with at this stage and that relates
            to the day to day decisison making required for the
            running of the certification system? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. "At the moment decision making powers rest with the panel
            but this is a highly impractical arrangement which needs
            to be reviewed urgently."  Can I just pause there?
            That sentence suggests that you did not in fact have
            any decision making powers before this proposal was
            put into effect? - A. I do not think that is right, sir.
            The previous report that I mentioned earlier on dealt
            with the continuation really of the working party system
            as it was effectively and I believe that gave delegated
            powers  to deal with it.

         Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Which report was that? - A.
              It was the May, 1986 report, sir.

                                                      D. BOWNES

          MR. COLLINS:   313, I think.  Effectively he is
     referring, as I understood it, to 316A, the panel being
     asked to note the broad outlines of the administrative
     system organised by the County Council and authorise
     its continuation for the time being:

Q. Is that correct, Mr. Bownes? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. You went into that but all I am noting is that sentence
   on page 419 which reads, "At the moment decision making
   powers rest with the panel but this is a highly imÂ­
   practical arrangement which needs to be reviewed urgently,"
   if that sentence is taken at face value and if the
   reader believed what he was reading it would indicate
   that you had no powers to make decisions at that stage
   because the powers had only been delegated to the panel?
   - A. No, sir, I think that is really referring to the new
   administrative system in that sense.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE  TAYLOR:   Would you look at page 122
     in your bundle? - A. I have it, sir.

Q. Well, (a), (b) and (c) there sum it up, do not they?    In
   the meantime following delegations be approved.  All
   powers delegated to the General Purposes Panel.  Right?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then emergency procedure powers under Section 10 go to
   head of Administration and Legal Department.   Well,
   that is issuing prohibitions, is not it?- A. It is making
   application to the Court for a Prohibition Notice.

Q. That is right.  And (c); Power to authorise officers under
   Section 11 is inspections, is not it?- A. Yes, sir.

Q. So so far as any decision making about what is to be
   approved by way of a change in layout is concerned,
   (a) is what applies, is not it, General Purposes Panel?
   - A. I would point out that report is in March of 1986
   before the Council actually became the certificating
   authority.

Q. Yes.  Where is something different now? - A. In the
   second report, sir, at point ....

Q.        MR.   COLLINS:  Your page 127, our page 317, I
     think? -   A. Yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: < Well, you derive it from (a)
     there, do you? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.        MR.   COLLINS:  Mr. Bownes, forgive me, I do not think
     that can   possibly be right, can     it, because    come on to
     our page   419, your p a g e >130 and that sentence which reads
                            77



                                                    D. BOWNES, J . W

     quite clearly -at the moment, i.e., as of now before these
     provisions are put into effect, decision making powers
     rest with the panel but that   is highly impractical? - A.
     Yes, sir, I thinkKthat was a reference to the, if you
     like, decisions that   involve the change of capacity,
     for example, at the Kop.

Q. It does not say that  and, indeed, it is wholly consistent
   with the history, as Lord Justice Taylor has pointed out to
   you, that you should have believed that at that time, i.e.,
   September, 1987, decision making powers in general rested
   with the panel? -A. I do not share that interpretation,
   sir, I am afraid.

Q. Well, with respect then, you do not write what  you mean,
   do you? - A. I think it is important to appreciates that
   I knew perhaps what I was talking about at the time but
   perhaps did not translate it entirely accurately into
   words.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Well, I am sorry to intervene
     again but I do not see how a rather bland   and vague
     expression in (a) on your page 127 can be said to change
     what can be read at page 122.   How does it change it? - A.
     Well, sir, it authorises the continuation for the time
     being of the old County Council administrative system.
     It is not drafted in the same terms as the previous
     delegation, sir.

Q. Well, what was the County Council's system, that an
   officer in your position should have the decision
   making power?  Where do you get that from? - A. Effectively
   the working party operate in the way it did.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:  You told us earlier you did not know
     how it worked.  That was half the trouble? - A. Yes, it
     was half the trouble, sir, yes.

Q. If you did not know how it worked how could you know
   that it worked to give you delegated powers? - A. I
   took the view that the CountyCCouncil in.writing to clubs
   or whatever making comments had the power then,rdf you
   like, to make the decisions.  Effectively the working
   party could be said to have made recommendations which
   were then firmed up in the form of letters to the clubs
   or whatever.

Q. Can we just see what your thinking may have been at the
   time?  Could you be good enough to look at page 381 of
   our bundle, please?  This is a note of a meeting held in
   Match of 1987.  Now, about half-way down - this is a
   Fire Service Department note of a meeting apparently
   held at the Town Hall.  Is that right? - A. No.  It
                          78


                                                   D, BOWNES

   says meeting held at Division Street conference rooms.

Q. Where is that?  Is that the Fire Service? - A. It would
   have been at the time, sir, I think, yes.

Q. And it records your presence and various other of the
   City? Council and a number of Fire Service. Right? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. You remember this meeting,   do you, Mr. Bownes? - A. Yes,
   sir, I think so.

Q. About half-way down, discussion on areas of responsibility
   and ground inspections, which presumably is relevant to
   what developed into the memorandum that we have been
   looking at m September? - A. Yes, sir.   What followed
   after this meeting was in fact an exchange of corresÂ­
   pondence about this situation.

Q. It says, "On areas of responsibilities Mr. Bownes did not
   want to be tied down to individual references and even
   indicated that his department could not act independently
   but must refer all matters to the Council Committee
   responsible for the Safety at Sports Grounds Act."
   Now, it looks as if you were then saying that you yourself
   could not make decisions, you had to refer everything
   back, does not it? - A. Sir, I think the discussion
   really was there about the future administration of
   the system rather than the present one and it was an
   attempt to discuss what role the General Purposes Panel
   should have and what role officers should have.

Q. Well, for the future you did not want to have to refer
   everything back.  What that appears to be relating to
   is the present, i.e., you cannot now act independently,
   you have got to refer everything back? - A. I would say
   not, sir.  I think that is referring to broad discussion
   about the future.

Q. I see.  It goes on, "Whilst all others present would
   prefer definitive areas of responsibility, allowing
   there must be some overlap, Mr. Bownes preferred to
   refer back to the future meeting following further
   consideration of the matter."  That is to say that you
   were not then accepting definitive areas of responsibility.
   You thought further discussion was needed? - A. Certainly
   further thought, sir.  That, indeed, did take place.

Q. You then refer or it is recorded you referred to the recent
   Lords decision on ground inspections.  Did that refer to
   the Bill that was then presumably going through which
   became the 87 Act? - A. To be perfectly honest, sir, I
   do not know.  I do not know what that refers to at all.

Q. You cannot help on that? - A. No.

                                                  D. BOWNES

Q. This would mean a much more thorough examination than
   the present system of bi-annual inspections.  Did you;
   believe that, that your future system would be more
   thorough, annual inspections? - A. I must admit the
   wording is a little difficult.  I do not really know
   what it is getting at there.

Q. Well, the difficulty is you did not apparently take a
   record of this meeting? - A. Sir, what happened following
   this was that detailed letters were sent to individual
   authorities dealing with the future administrative system.

Q. But, you see, this is the only record we have and since it
   refers to your thoughts I thought in fairness to you I ought
   to ask you to deal with the matters in case any false
   impression may have been given?- A. Yes.  I think the
   matters were dealt with fully in correspondence subÂ­
   sequently.

Q. I see.  Did you think it would mean a more thorough
   examination than the present system because that was
   not said in terms, I think, in the correspondence? - A.
   I do not know, sir, to be quite honest.  I think in
   principle an annual inspection is preferable to a bi Â­
   annual inspection in that it can be more detailed, no
   question of that, whereas a bi-annual inspection might
   not be as detailed.

Q. I totally fail to follow that, Mr. Bownes.  It depends
   how detailed you choose to make the inspection, whether
   it be bi-annual or annual, does not it? - A. Yes, sir.
   I think an annual inspection tends to focus minds a
   little better than a bi-annual one does and an annual
   inspection is a common occurrence in all other licensing
   areas rather than bi-annual.

        Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What has happened at other
             grounds in terms of the Certificate may merely reflect
             that nothing had changed there.   A.   In terms of the
             drafting of the Certificate, I am referring to, sir.

        Q.   No, in terms of the ground.   A.  Yes,            sir,    it could be
             interpreted that way, certainly, sir.

        Q.         MR. COLLINS:   As I understand your evidence this
             morning, you at no time appreciated that there were factors
             in the ground which cried out or - I will not use emotive
             words - that there were factors in this ground which
             required there to be some sort of a reconsideration;    there
             was a change of circumstances.    A.   As I believe I said
             this morning, sir, I think it is appropriate to review
             C ertificate conditions after a period of time so that the
             interested Officers can have a look at them and decide
             what, if anything, needs to be done.    It would be true
             to say that I was not aware of any changes that would
             need to be made at that stage as such - any major changes.

        Q. And you were not aware of any problems that were arising
           in relation to the capacity of the pens at Leppings Lane?
           A.   Not at all, sir, no.

        Q.   And   you were not aware of any need for any sort of updating
             of the Certificate to deal with that specific matter?
             A.   To deal with that specific matter, no, sir.    In fact,
             I wrote towards the end of 1987 to the various Officers
             asking them if they had got any comments on the stadia
             generally in Sheffield and that exercise I would have
             assumed would have brought to the surface any problems
             that were outstanding.    I believe letters ---   The Fire
             Service letter is dated 3rd November, 1986 in fact.    I
             am sorry, it was not 1987, it was 1986.

                   MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, these have all been put together
             in the form of a small bundle of corresp on de nc e which
             was also handed out this morning, some   of which appears in
             other bundles but I think the majority does not.        jt is
             a bundle of c or respondence from the Sheffield City
             Council to various parties.

                    LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:      Is that this?

                    MR.   MAXWELL:     No,   those are photographs,      sir.

                    LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR.      well,   there is other stuff
             with   it.

                    MR. MAXWELL:   It is the        "other   stuff",   sir.     It is
             part   of the other stuff.

                                                     D.   BOWNES



              MR. COLLINS:   I must confess it would have helped
         if I had been given this, but there we are.   I am not
         blaming Mr. Maxwell in the least.   It does help in
         examining witnesses if one has the material to enable
         one to do so.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What is this bundle exactly?
         It just appeared here this morning.   It has got some
         reproductions of photographs.   I am told they relate
         to Bradford, is that right?

              MR. MAXWELL:   No, they do not, sir.     I am sorry,
         I cannot see what you are looking at, sir.     Those are
         photographs of Hillsborough immediately before it was
         refurbished for the 1966 World Cup Marches.     They show
         the Leppings Lane end and we thought they might be of

c        historical interest at least in showing how far that Kop went
         up at that end, and you can also see the tunnel as it used
         to be and the lay-out of the crush barriers as they were
         after that refurbishment, as they would have been before
         Dr. Eastwood did his work.

               LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:     I see.    Thank you very much.

    Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Can I just flick through this very
         quickly with you* Mr. Bownes.   The first letter, October,
         1986, deals with the Kop development and is written to
         Eastwoods, is that right?   A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.

    Q.   And deals with the question of plans        largely,      I think.
         A.  Yes, sir.

    Q.   And then we have the 3rd November, 1986 letter which we
         have already referred to asking for the Fire Service
         comments as to the condition of United and Wednesday.
         A.   Yes, sir.

    Q.   Then the letter of 18th February, 1987, which is in our
         bundle at 374 which deals with the Fire Service comments
         and then we have a letter of the 19th March to the Club,
         19th March, 1987.   A.   Sir, could I just point out that
         is, in fact, a draft letter.   The actual letter to the
         Club went out on 22nd April.    It is included there to note
         the comments of the Fire Service.

    Q.    And the letter   that in the end went     out is in our bundle and
         is page 383.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:             I am sorry, I must say I find
         this extremely unsatisfactory.               We have had bundles of
         documents and we have been through them and now, in the
         middle of the hearing we have got to faff about trying to
         fit some letters in which have jJst surfaced today and I,
         for the moment, am not finding it at all convenient to
         dot a b o u t to t h o s e t h a t are in t he bundles, those that
         are not.       It is very unfortunate that this was not
         produced earlier, I am afraid, Mr. Maxwell, is it not?

                                                      D.     BOWNES



          MR. MAXWELL:   Yes,        I think it is,   sir.      I think what
     has happened is that ---

          LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:       We have been going     for some
     weeks now.

          MR. MAXWELL:     I think Mr. Bownes found that there
     was a further file in his office which the Police had not
     taken possession of and in this bundle are documents that
     arise from that.    I think that is the e xplanation as to
     why they were not available at the outset.

          MR.   COLLINS:     Sir,    it is thoroughly      unsatisfactory.

Q. Can I go back     to 374, the letter of 18th February, 1987.
   Unfortunately     our bundle has an incomplete copy of that


           MR. COLLINS:    Sir, you will note that we have a
     letter which runs to 4 pages, that is through to 377.
     If you ,would be good enough to look at the bundle that has
     just been handed in, you will see there is an extra
     page, and a rather important extra page, because it deals
     with specifically the question of the sliding gates,
     where the Fire Service are saying that they accepted the
     sliding gates but wish to point out that it is the view
     that doors required for escape should open atwards,
     it is recommended that notice be given to the Club to
     the effect that when any such sliding gates are to be replaced
     then the replacements must open outwards, even if this
     involves structural work to recess the    open in g to avoid
     impinging over footpaths which, of course, is wholly
     consistent with Paragraph 64, I think it was, of the
     1986 Green Guide, and they then deal with the method.
     So clearly the Fire Service did specifically consider and
     deal with that matter although, unfortunately, I was not
     aware that that had been the case when I was putting the
     matters to Dr. Eastwood whenever I was doing so.

          Sir, this obviously is a page -- I do not know how
     it has come about that the page is missing from the
     document we have in the bundle.   It must have got itself
     detached in the bundle from which we got the letter.    I
     am not quite sure where that came from.

          MR.   MULLER:    The full      letter is in the Fire Service
     bundle.

          MR. COLLINS:   It is my fault because I have been
     working from the core bundle.   Fortunately, it is .not
     a matter which is central.

Q.   Then we were going on to the letter of 22nd April.           You
     have got the draft of the 19th March which became the
     l e t t e r of t he 22 nd and the letter of the 22 nd is indeed
     the next in this little bundle, or a copy of it, our page 383;
     right?        A.    Yes.
                                87



                                                   D.   BOWNES



Q.   Then we have a letter to the Police - we are back now to
     November, 1986 - in which you ask the Police for their
     comments;  right?   A.   Yes, sir, it is very similar
     to the Fire Service letter.

Q.   You get the reply from the Police of 6 th January, 1987,
     in which they say both stadia, so far as the Police are
     concerned, conform or meet their requirements.    A.  Yes,;
     sir.

Q.   Then a letter of 3rd March, 1987 next.  A.   To the
     Council's Building Surveyor, sir, asking the same question,

Q.   Yes.   Memorandum from him in his turn of 24th June,
     1987, effectively saying, "Well, if you want me to do
     this, it is going to take some time."   A.   Yes, sir.
     I think he was referring to a full survey of both stadia.

Q.   Yes, and that memor an du m is in our bundle at page 386.
     Then we go on to the Building Surveyor's comments, if I
     am right about that, of August, 1987.      A.  Yes, sir.

Q.   13th August,   1987,   and those are in the bundle ---

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Apart   from identifying      them,
     what   are we getting at?

          MR. COLLINS:       I am not sure we are getting        anything
     very much, sir.

Q.    Then we have seminar notes which I do not think we need
     go through, save that you were there.    A.   Sir, if I
     may, I think the point was that I was asking them, the
     Fire Service and the Police, if they had any comments
     at all basically.

Q.    Indeed, that is really what this all boils down to.            You
     were seeking i nformation from them.  A.    Yes, sir.

Q. We then come to the first draft C ertificate which you sent
   out, page 387 of our bundle, in July 1987, is that right?
   I know we have got a bit out of date order but that is the
   first -- new draft conditions which you had prepared.
   A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.

Q.   And effectively that follows, I think, as you saw it, the
     best of the conditi ons in the Safety Certificatess that
     you had seen copies of?    A.   Yes, sir, I tried to draw
     all the best bits, as I saw them, together and then
     obviously put them to the Officers who were experts in
     these areas for appropriate comment.

Q.    To cut a long story short, we go on now to 483 and we
     see your --   481 is the covering letter.   In April,
     1989 we see your final revised conditions.     A.  Yes,
     sir, which took into account the comments that had been
     made earlier, except where specifically noted there.

                                                         D.    BOWNES



      Q.    So far as you were concerned, it was your belief, was it,
           that this draft in early April of this year - the end of
           March, beginning of April of this year - took on board
           all that needed to be dealt with in relation to Sheffield
           Wednesday ground.     A.  Yes, I certainly hoped it did,
           sir, yes.

      Q.   And it included in it - in fact it sas to cover Sheffield
           United as well - but it included in it a number of
           appendices;   is that right?   A.   Schedules, sir, yes.

      Q.   Schedules, I am sorry, one of which, of course, was the
           schedule which dealt with the capacity.   A.   Yes, sir.
           Schedule 3, page 506.

      Q.   This, in fact, is another copy of it, and that schedule
           as we can see, of course, increases the Kop to 21,000
           but so far as the others are concerned simply repeats the
           figures that were in the old Certificate.   A.  Yes, sir.
           I am sure you will have noted that the previous draft
           Certificate conditions did not include detailed schedules,
           This was the first time they had been prepared for the
           particular ground and therefore I am sure that comments
           would have been welcome on those areas.

      Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am sorry, you are sure -
           what?    A.   I am sure that comments would have been
           made on these particular numbers had they been necessary.

      Q.        MR. COLLINS:     Are you saying that the old Certificate
           did not include a schedule like this?     A.   No, sir, the
           first draft C ertifi cate did not include these schedules as
           such because they were not ground specific at that time.
           This was the first attempt to make them ground specific.

      Q.   But as I understand it you had taken on board by then and
           you had asked for in--put on everything that ought to be
           there.   A.   Yes, certainly.

      Q.   And yet no-one seems to have appreciated, and you
           certainly do not seem to have appreciated, the need to
           specify the individual pens.  A.   No, sir, I think that
           is quite right.   Comments have now come back in respect
           of these new conditions, though I have not had chance to
           read them yet.

      Q.   That is,   of course,   since the disaster.    A.      It certainly
           is, sir,   yes.

      Q.   So far as the general conditions are concerned, as is
           clear and indeed as is referred to at page 493 in a Police
           memorandum you have deleted the old 4 5 and 6 which
           required Police liaison, in effect, or the Club to liaise
           with the Police in certain specified departments.
           A.  Yes, sir.   That refers to the letter at page 496 which
           I believe caused the Inquiry some concern the other day.

      Q.   That   is right   and then you wrote back the letter at 496,
                               89


                                                 D.   BOWNES



     the last paragraph of which says you are conscious of the
     very important Police role in connection with the safety
     of spectators, therefore have taken two steps to ensure
     this role is properly recognised.   A.   Sir, I think
      you have got the letters in the wrong order.   496 is
     dated 30th March, 493 is dated 13th April, sir.

Q.   Yes,   I know.   A.   I am sorry.

Q.   But you were rightly saying that 496 was the letter which
     sought to deal with the Police concern about the omission
     of the old Paragraphs 4, 5 and 6.   A.   No, sir.

Q.   To pre-empt the Police concern, if I put it that way.
     A.   It was a first attempt to explain, sir, if I can
     put it that way.

Q.   Because you say in your second paragraph, "You will notice
     there are no references as such to the Police within the
     Certificate."   A.    Yes, sir.

Q. And then you go on, "I have carefully considered this
   matter and have come to the conclusion that the conditions
   which purport to delegate the Council's functions to
   outside bodies are u ne nforceable as they are beyond the
   powers of the Council."     Tell me, was that your view on
   advice or your view independently of advice or what?
   A.    On advice, sir.

Q. On advice from whom?    I d o not want to identify the
   individual but what status?     A.  A solicitor in the
   Department, sir.    I should say that the Police have now
   responded and made various comments that they would like
   specific c onditions including where it is possible to do
   so  .
Q.   Yes, and thus the situation existed at the time of the
     disaster.   A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.

Q.   No-one having identified the problem and nothing    having
     been done to put an effective Safety Certificate    into
     p osition since 1986.   A.   If the problem is in   relation
     to the capacities at the Leppings Lane pen, then    that is
     right, sir, yes, a ccording to the file.

Q. And no-one appears either to have considered the impact
   of the turnstiles, their position and lay-out in relation
   to spectators coming in and going on to the Leppings Lane
   terraces.   A.    I would have expected the appropriate
   adviser to comment on that should it have been necessary,
   but I think the appropriate adviser would probably have
   been the Police in this.- circumstance.

Q. What about the direction signs at the Leppings Lane end?
   A.    Once again, sir, as far as the operational side,
   if you like, of the Safety Certificate is concerned,
   which deals with realty-what happens on a match day, then
   the Council would have to receive advice.    N6'w, I would
                               D.   BOWNES



expect advice to come from a number of different sources -
the Club itself, possibly.  The Clib has in the past related
various matters to the Council which it considered important.
Also, if there were particular difficulties one might
expect supporters to make comments.    Also, obviously as the
Police are there on the day and do, I understand, deal to;
some extent with the control of spectators, if they had
anticipated or appreciated any difficulty, I would have
expected to receive comments from them.    Signing is not
really a difficult or expensive task and I would have
thought there would have been no difficulty in making
appropriate arrangements if they were felt to be necessary.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Collins, if you or one of
your juniors could identify for me the letter from Dr.
Eastwood referring to reduced capacity as a result of
the alterations, perhaps it could be done behind you.

     MR.   COLLINS:   It can be done behind me,       yes,      I
am sure.




                                    /Q.   Mr.   Bownes,   may       I ask.
                             91

                                                   D. BOWNES


Q. Mr. Bownes, may I ask you this generally.  This was, of
   course, thrust upon you as a result of the abolition of the
   Metropolitan Council? - A. The function was transferred to the
   Council, yes, sir.

Q. You, the Council, and I am not referring to you personally at
   the moment....

          MR. TOULSON:   I have the page your Lordship wanted.   I
     think you have in mind the letter at page 86.   169 in the core
     bundle and the sentence at the top of page 170.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you.   That is what I was
     looking for.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Mr. Bownes, you the city, had no expertise
     at all in connection with safety at sports grounds before this
     was thrust upon you? - A. That is wrong, in fact.  The
     Building Surveyor of the Council had been involved in the
     safety of sports grounds since its inception in 1979 as far as
     Sheffield Wednesday went.

Q. What did that extend to, the Building Surveyor's
   responsibility? - A. I think you have seen the schedule of
   responsibilities that was put forward in the bundle somewhere.

Q. Let me put it this way.  Your Department had had no overall
   concern for safety? - A. It had none at all, sir.

Q. And effectively you and your Department had to learn all about
   it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were already considerably stretched.  You had a great deal
   to do in licensing other matters? - A. It is certainly a busy
   Department, sir, but there was, at least I perceived at the
   time, room to accommodate this function.

Q. Without the need for any extra staff or any extra assistance?
   - A. That was my feeling, yes.

Q. And you depended really upon the advice of others, namely, the
   Fire, the Police and your own Building Department, together
   with some input from the Consumer Health side? - A. Yes, sir.
   A licensing authority generally speaking does not have
   expertise itself within its own organisation to deal with all
   matters.  For example, public entertainments licensing, it
   relies on advice from others, the professionals, the Fire
   Service.

Q. Did it occur to you at any stage that it might be desirable to
   instruct someone like Dr. Eastwood, that is to say an
   independent engineer, to have a look and advise the Council
   specifically on the safety of sports grounds? - A. I think it
   is right to say the Council has its own engineers.

Q. All right.  Did you put your own engineers on to the problem?
   - A. I think that is referred to in the Building Surveyor's
                               92

                                                    D . BOWNES


     memorandum and my memorandum to him.

Q. Did you specifically think of briefing your in-house engineers
   or anyone to go and take an independent appraisal of the
   sports grounds which you were then being put in charge of? -
   A. It could not really be an independent appraisal if it was
   done by in-house surveyors, sir, who had probably been
   involved before.

Q.   All right.   Did it occur to   you to put anyone....

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     It would be independent of the
     club, whose financial interest was to manage it? - A. Yes, but
     the same engineers who had been doing it were independent of
     the club, the Council's own engineers, and they had been doing
     itsince 1979.

Q.      MR. COLLINS:       So   youtook   the view that if,there was
     anything which needed to be dealt with it should have been
     spotted by the Council's engineers in any event who had been
     dealing with it since 1979? - A. If it was a matter within
     their particular skill, yes, sir.

Q. But did it not occur to you that it might be desirable to have
   someone take an independent look, and by independent, I mean
   independent of those who had been dealing with it hitherto? -
   A. No, sir, it did not.

Q. It did not occur to you that that might be desirable? - A. The
   thought had not occurred to me, sir, to be perfectly honest
   with you.

Q. May I finally go to the point I hope I anticipate may have
   been in my Lord's mind when referring to the letter of Dr.
   Eastwood at page 169-170 of our bundle.  The reason I have not
   referred to it is it was before you time, but nonetheless it
   would have been on the files and you would have read it.   You
   would have been able to read it had you wished? - A. Yes, sir,
   I think that is a fair comment.

Q. How much did you actually read these old files? - A. I was
   handed some 8 files altogether, relating to Sheffield United
   and Sheffield Wednesday.  I think we have to remember it is
   not only Sheffield Wednesday we are dealing with here.  What I
   did was try to get a flavour from those in as much detail as I
   reasonably could in the time allowed.

Q. I think one could make the point if you had read these files
   and come across, for example, this letter, you would have
   appreciated that there would be or was a possible effect upon
   spectator capacity when you removed barriers or put up fences?
   - A. Two points I would like to make there, sir.  One is on
   taking over the licensing function I think the City Council
   had reason to accept that the grounds were reasonably safe and
   all relevant factors had been dealt with by that stage.   The
   other point is I am not sure that for somebody like myself who
   did not know an awful lot about sports grounds, which I think
                             93

                                                  D . BOWNES


     is the truth and nothing less than the truth, that I would
     have picked up on reading that what it actually meant, to be
     honest.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am not blaming you for not
     knowing about sports grounds, but it does seem a very
     unsatisfactory situation, does not it, that responsibility for
     licensing a sports ground is given to a local authority whose
     officer in charge of it really knows nothing about the subject
     at all? - A. No, sir.   If you like in respect of other
     licensing matters I don't know in detail what the professional
     aspects of them are.   My job is to administer and co-ordinate
     really, essentially, and to enable the appropriate
     professionals to have their input at the appropriate stage.

Q. Somebody has to make the decision? - A. Yes, based on advice.

Q. You thought you were delegated that power? - A. Yes, the
   decision is made based on the advice of the appropriate
   specialist, sir.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   If you don't know what to ask them to look
     for you are not necessarily going to get the right advice, are
     you? - A. With this letter I imagine it would have been
     circulated to all the interested parties, and i am sure if
     they felt it necessary they would have made a comment.

Q. Is what you are really saying this, the working party which
   became the advisory group passed all these things and seemed
   to think all was w e l l , and therefore there was not any need
   for anyone to worry, so far as the city was concerned? - A.
   No, sir, that is not right.      In relation to - I think what you
   are saying effectively is that the Council did not take any
   action at all when it got the safety certificate function.

Q. It left it to the .working party and to the advisory group, did
   not it? - A. To some extent it should leave matters which deal
   with professional judgment to the professionals and to obtain
   advice on it.  The Council did not, however - there are
   examples on the file in relation to another sports ground in
   the city, where things were not all right and which were dealt
   with very promptly, sir.

Q. Because you were told that by the relevant advisory group or
   working party professionals? - A. The appropriate
   professionals at the time, sir, yes.

Q. There was no independent appraisal by the Council as such.  It
   simply assumed, rightly or wrongly, the working party had got
   it right hitherto, and there was no cause for concern? - A.
   That the County Council had got it right, yes.  I think it had
   to assume that .

Q. Although it was apparent or obviously able to be made apparent
   from a cursory examination of the file that certain things had
   not been properly done in updating the safety certificate in
   certain respects? - A. I don't think that would have come
                             94

                                                    D . BQWNES


     from a cursory examination of the file, sir.

Q. And you knew you did not do it right in relation to the
   increase in the Kop? - A. I certainly know now, sir.

Q. You did not appreciate then? - A. I did not appreciate that,
   sir.

Q. Very well, Mr. Bownes, that is all I would wish to ask.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

Q. I would like to see how far you regarded the Council's duties
   in these matters, Mr. Bownes.  If in January 1989, at a time
   when Sheffield United did not have a safety certificate you
   had known they had been invited by the Football Association to
   consider having a Semi-Final played at their ground, would you
   have taken any action? Would it have concerned you? - A. I
   would imagine what would have happened in those circumstances
   is that the Police, who are closely involved in these matters,
   would have raised the issue then and appropriate action would
   no doubt have followed.

Q. Would the Police have known that Sheffield United did not have
   a certificate? - A. Yes, they know perfectly well, sir, I
   think.

Q. Say for example, not being we understand a great devotee of
   football, you had not watched the fixture list and you had
   been on leave in Apri l , you would have depended on the Police
   to have stopped a Semi-Final being played at Bramall Lane in
   April? - A. Sir, I cannot conceive of a Semi-Final being
   played at Bramall Lane without there being a great deal of
   publicity and involvement of the advisory group, sir.

Q. Would it surprise you in fact that the FA had asked Sheffield
   United to consider having a Semi-Final at Bramall Lane in
   April 1989? - A. I have no views on it, sir.

Q.   None at all? - A. None at all, sir.

Q.   Can I now go back to your take over.   We are all, I hope,
     suitably conscious of the fact that this is originally the
     responsibility of another authority, and the matter had
     been in their hands for very many years until you took
     over, but you did, of course, appreciate that you were
     taking on a responsibility? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You understood, did not you, that whereas there was an
   advisory guide from the Government, there was no compulsion on
   a club to follow the advice given in the Green Guide? - A. Or
   on the authority, sir, that is quite right.

Q. Or on the authority.    This was advice only.     Is that right? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. But you knew that once there was a condition in a certificate
                                 95

                                                       D. BOWNES


     there were very considerable sanctions against a club flouting
     the condition? - A. Yes, sir, if a club had breached a
     condition then there were criminal penalties.

Q. When you read the Green Guide did not it become obvious that
   some of the recommendations were somewhat more strict than
   others?  In other words, some were no open to interpretation
   through common sense and professional judgment.  They were
   plain, strong advice, whilst others might have been open to
   interpretation? - A. Perhaps you can give me an example, sir.

Q. Yes, I will come to the one I am going to give you.
   Stewarding:  have you got a copy of the Green Guide?            Chapter
   13 paragraph 195, just above that on page 56:

          "Effective stewarding should prevent overcrowding in
          sections of the ground, reduce the likelihood and
          incidence of disorder, help to disperse spectators in
          such a way as to reduce crowd pressure and provide the
          means to investigate, report and take early action in an
          emergency".

     Now, there can't be any question of professional judgment or
     common sense overriding the need to prevent overcrowding in
     any section of the crowd?   Would you agree? - A. Yes.  The
     judgment comes in in how many stewards you provide.

Q. Certainly.  That is interpretation, application, common sense.
   - A. Yes, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        And what you call overcrowding.

          M R . HYTNER:   Yes:

Q.   But the need to take some action is clearly imperative, is not
     it? - A. In what sense?  I am afraid I have lost you.

Q. The Green Guide makes it clear that there must be some action
   taken by stewards to do those things? - A. Yes, sir, indeed.

Q.   When you read the Green Guide and then you read the conditions
     in the 1979 certificate, did not you find it rather odd that
     the duties of the stewards did not appear to include those
     things at all? - A. As I recall from the certificate they
     include control and direction of spectators.

Q. In and out of the ground.          Would you like to look?   It is in
   your bundle at page 122.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Entering, using or leaving, I
     think, page 111, 9.2

          MR. HYTNER:     Yes, I am obliged.      It is his page 106:

Q. Look at the bottom of the page, 9.2:
                            96

                                                D . BOWNES


        "The duties of the safety stewards, fit and capable to
        carry out their duties, properly trained and instructed,
        identified by dress.  General duties, to carry out the
        following:  Manning of exits, control and direction of
        spectators entering, using or leaving the stadium,
        patrolling the stadium".

   Did you think that that was clearly laying a duty on the club
   to direct stewards to assist in preventing overcrowding in the
   sections? - A. I would have said the word "usingâ implied
   that, sir.

Q. I don't suppose you can say what was clear to the club.  it
   was your view, was it, reading that certificate, that it would
   have been a breach of the conditions of the certificate for
   the club not to have stewards directing the dispersal of
   crowds in the particular sections to prevent overcrowding? -
   A. I think that is a question of cases, if I might say so.
   You would have to look at a particular example to decide that.

        MR. COLLINS:    I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Hytner, but I
   wonder whether it is helpful to get this witness's view of the
   meaning of any provision in relation to the Safety of Sports
   Grounds Act or the Green Guide?

        MR. HYTNER:   Except that he was responsible for the
   certificate and the conditions.

        MR. COLLINS:   Yes, but he says he has not any knowledge
   or expertise in applying the matter.

        MR. HYTNER:    I won't pursue it further.   We will hear
   what the club says .

                 Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Q. Mr. Collins has taken you through and you quite frankly admit
   that by 1989 you were not aware of the importance of the
   changes in the penning system on the Leppings Lane end;    you
   were not aware of any discussion about the need for the
   alteration to the safety certificate.    Can we take the
   position as you s a y it was, that you thought everything
   depended on the figures given in 1979? Would you turn to page
   105 of your bundle.    There we see Schedule 2, paragraph 3:

        "The number of spectators admitted to the stadium and to
        the several areas of spectator accommodation within the
        stadium shall not exceed the figures specified in Part 1
        of Schedule 3".

   Clear, no question of opinion, professional advice or the
   like? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Turn to page ....   - A. Page 112, sir?

Q. 110 first of all, 28:
                           97

                                                   D, BOWNES


        "The holder shall make and keep the following records
        which shall be made available for inspection at all
        reasonable time to all authorised persons.  (1) A record
        of the number of spectators admitted to the stadium
        during the specified activity and to each area of
        spectator accommodation therein mention in Part 1 of
        Schedule 3".

   Now we turn as you suggested we might to the safety
   certificate as it actually was. - A. And still is, sir.

Q. Regrettably, yes.  Where do we find the figure of 10,100? - A.
   That will be the total of west terrace and north-west terrace,
   I believe, sir.

Q. In other words, we don't? - A. It is not stated there as
   1 0 ,100 .

Q. In fact, quite the reverse.  It is specifically stated and
   always has been as two separate, completely separate areas,
   7,200 and 2,900? - A. That is quite right, sir, yes.

Q. Would you tell me whether it became apparent to you, never
   mind whether the pens meant further alterations, whether
   anyone had ever applied their minds to the fact that the 1988
   Semi-Final was run in conditions that meant the club could not
   comply with the safety certificate? - A. I am sorry, would you
   repeat the question, please?

Q. Forget all about pens 3 and 4.  Did it ever occur to you that
   the 1988 Semi-Final had been run in conditions that meant the
   club could not comply with the conditions of the safety
   certificate? - A. No, sir, it did not.

Q. If we were to look at the 1989 Semi-Final we would again see
   that the way in which the turnstiles were used meant that the
   safety certificate as it was could not be complied with? - A.
   I am sorry, what was the question?

Q. Would you look at the plan produced yesterday by my learned
   friend, Mr. Glasgow.   My copy is the penultimate document in
   Dr. Eastwood's bundle.   208 in Dr. Eastwood's bundle. - A.
   Sir, what you are saying is that the allocation of the
   turnstiles was such that these capacities could not have been
   split?




                                /Q. Yes, indeed.
GO                                 98


                                                            D. BOWNES

     Q. Yes,   indeed. - A.   I was not aware of that,   sir, no.

     Q. You now know that the layout of the turnstiles meant that
        the areas , of 7,200 and 2,900 were just lumped together?
        -A. Yes, sir, it appears that way.

     Q. But it would have been apparent to you if you checked the
        figures for 1988? - A. I am sorry.  What would have beeisr:
        apparent?

     Q.   They were lumped together.    - A. Yes, sir.

     Q.   What action did you take? - A. None,     sir, on that.

     Q.Why not? - A. As far as the allocation of turnstiles is
        concerned, sir, that is a matter of operation ....

     Q. Forgive me, I do not want to interrupt you, but I am
        not concerned with the allocation of turnstiles.  Clearly
        that is a matter for others.  But the effect of the
        allocation if it contravenes the safety certificate
        would be a matter for you? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q.   What action did you take? - A. None, sir.

     Q.    Why not? - A. If there had been a, breach of the safety
          certificate I would have expected to have been advised
          about it.

     Q. Do you mean the club would ring up and say by the way,
        we intend to breach the safety certificate.  What are
        you going to do about it? - A. Not at all, sir.

     Q.   What do you mean? - A. I would have expected advice either
          from the Police o r , Sinstead, from the club to say that we
          have this problem, can we deal with it, please, which is
          the view the club has taken in the past.

     Q.   You are saying you are surprised to find the club did not
          ring up to say we are going to breach the requirements
          of our safety certificate on two .... - .A. No, sir.   I
          think what you have done there is twisted my words, if I
          may say so.

     Q. Forgive me.  I apologise.  Are you really saying you
        expect the club to ring? - A. The club may have felt
        it an appropriate thing to do, sir, if they thought
        there was a difficulty with the safety certificate.

     Q.Did you check whether or not they were complying with the
        safety certificate? - A. In respect of this capacity, sir?

     Q. This Inquiry is abouttovercrowding. - A. Yes,      sir.

     Q. The ability    to check pens.    I am eliminating all the things
                              99


                                                       D. BOWNES

     you did not know about.  I am merely restricting myself
     to things you did know about, 7,200 and 2,900.  What did
     you do about the attempts of the club to circumvent the
     restriction upon them? - A. I did not check that, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. .Jackson, I do not quite
     know what you mean by attempts of the club to circumvent.

          MR. JACKSON:    It would appear, sir, from my underÂ­
     standing of the position once the turnstiles A to G
     were to be used for the entire West terrace and North
     West terrace the requirements of the existing safety
     certificate could not be complied with.

          LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR: Because you   could not   limit
     2,900?

          MR. JACKSON:    I have forgotten all about the extra
     pens and whether or not they can be considered separate.
     I am merely suggesting when the plan to use A to G for
     the West terrace and the North West terrace the existing
     safety certificate could not be complied with and must
     have also not been complied with in 1988.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes.

Q.       MR. JACKSON:     Did you in fact check at any time
     the attendance figures submitted by Sheffield Wednesday
     in   respect of the 1988 ....  - A. I have not, sir, no.

           LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR: Well, it may have been complied
     with but if it was   it was by chance is what you are saying?

          MR. TAYLOR:   You recall I asked the question of
     Mr. Evans, it could not be complied with because we
     know the turnstiles A to  G were again used.

          THE WITNESS:   Sir,   might I make the point that in
     fact if the Council was wanting - well, if the Council
     decided positively to establish how many people were
     in a particular area, perhaps with the intention of
     proceeding against a club, it would have a very
     difficult task in doing so.   I have been involved in
     prosecutions of places of public entertainment involving
     capacity and the only way of accurately establishing
     capacity is in fact to count people in and out.    It is
     virtually impossible, I would have said, to do that in
     respect of football stadia especially where you are
     talking about these sort of figures.

Q.        MR. JACKSON:   I do not want to in any way seem to be
     rude to you, but do you really understand the layout of
     the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end? - A. I believe I
     understand the layout, sir.
                                                        D. BOWNES

And the use of them in 1988 and 1989? - A.           I confess I do
not quite understand that, no, sir.

     MR. JACKSON:     I have no further questions,         thank you.

            Cross-examined by MR. M U L L E R - â¢:

Mr. Bownes, whatever your personal position may be or
what you regarded it to be in relation to the safety
certificate and the advisory group this much is
absolutely clear, is not it, that the licensing
authority was of course the local authority, Sheffield
Metropolitan District Council. Right? - A. Yes, sir.

..And precisely how they carried out that function was a
matter for them? - A. Yes, sir.

And as far as the various members of the advisory group
were concerned, namely, the building surveyors, the
South Yorkshire CoianityOSâiyecService and the South
Yorkshire Police, their position is also absolutely
clear, is not it?   They were there to advise? - A.
Yes, sir.

And you took the view that they were there purely as
advisors, not to make decisions? - A. Yes, sir, that
is right.

And the position is therefore this, is not it, that
whatever advice they may or may not have given ultimately
it was your function to make sure that a decision was
made and whatever decision was made was made known to
the club? - A. What sort of decisions are we talking
about, sir?

About anything that the advisory group were concerned
withi - A. Yes, sir, if it was appropriate to do so.

If advice is given there is no point in advice being
given to you unless you do something about it? - A. Yes,
sir.

And it was therefore your job, and surely you understood
it to be so, to make sure that when you got the advice
if it was unanimous advice no doubt you could recommend
to whoever was going to make the ultimate decision to do
precisely what had been advised.  Right? - A. Yes, sir.
I think it is useful to bring in the building surveyor's
memoranda at this point of 2nd February where the matter
was put to the advisory group and the Police representative
dealt with it there and then.

The position ultimately at the end of the day is that:
it is your job, nobody else's job, to make sure that
                             101



                                                     D. BOWNES

     the decision of the local authority is passed on? - A.
     If it is appropriate to do so, sir, yes.

Q. And it is your job also to make sure there is a decision
   if necessary? - A. If it is necessary, yes, sir.

Q. I am obliged.  And it was your job to co-ordinate the
   work of the advisory group?- A. Insofar as it needed
   co-ordinating, yes, sir.

Q. If a meeting was wanted you were the one who had to
   organise it? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. If people wanted to know for their records  or you wanted
   to know for your records what had happened at a particular
   meeting it was for you to make minutes? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. But as we know, and I do not want to dwell  on it, there
   were many occasions when you did not make any minutes for
   publication^ ybu did not circulate any minutes on many
   occasions? -A. All the advisory group minutes have been
   written up and circulated, sir.

Q.   I think there were many occasions when you - either you
     had private minutes which you did not circulate.  I think
     you have already told lordJJusticeIlpylor? - A. Yes, I
     have said, sir, that I have made various notes of various
     meetings that took place, for example, in July of 1986.

Q. And obviously it was desirable if you were going to have
   minutes or to have any record of what happened at the
   meeting to make that record as quickly as possible
   so that action could be taken to save people getting
   into difficulties? - A. That is right, sir.  I can
   bring forward three meetings that took place in July,
   1986, which took place in a period of something under
   14 days which did not permit, if you like, proper
   writing up of those minutes in accordance with the
   previous system ....

Q.   Can I just ask you again, please, would you look at   the core
     bundle at page 418?  It starts at page 417.  That was a
     document you put before the Local Authority.   Is that
     right? - A. It was a report to the General Purposes Panel,
     sir, yes.

Q. And you were making various - your concluded recommendations,
   is that right? - A. Well, sir, it was setting out a number
   of items ....

Q. If you look on page 418 where you set out the areas of
   responsibility. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Now, before that document actually went off there had been

                                                                        D. BOWNES

                     some discussions with the advisory group, had there not?
                     You told us about one on the 10th of March, 1987, which
                     appears in the core bundle at 381 and there was another
                     one on the 16th of July, 198^, of which we have also seen
                     some minutes made by the Fire Service.  Right? - A. In
                     relation to this report, sir?

                  Q. In relation to the question of areas of responsibility.
                     There was discussion about that, was not there? - A.
                     Yes, sir, and I have explained subsequent correspondence
                     dealt  fully with the matters raised.

                  Q. Let's not deal with subsequent correspondence.  Let's
                     just deal with correspondence and the meetings prior to
                     that. - A. Yes.

                  Q. What you put down there was the building surveyor was
                     to be responsible for all matters relating to the structure
                     of the stadium, including crush barriers, walls, etc? - A.
                     Yes, sir.

                  Q. Of course the building surveyors were part of the Local
                     Authority? - A. Yes, sir.

                  Q. So you realised they were the competent authority to
                     advise on that matter? - A. Yes, sir.

                  Q. Do you recall that when these matters were being discussed
                     Mr. Grimshaw of the South Yorkshire County Fire Service
                     told you that what you had written under the responsibilities
                     for the Fire Service, namely, fire precautions, fire alarms,
                     means of escape, emergency lighting and stadium capacity,
                     placed the Fire Service in difficulties? - A. Sir, I think
                     I can perhaps answer this question fairly briefly.   On the
                     17th of August, 1987, there was a letter to the Fire
                     Service asking for their comments on this draft report, I
                     believe.  I have got a note on my copy of that, sir, that
                     at 2 p.m. - I think I may have got the date of the letter
                     wrong, sir - I think it was 2 p.m. on the 17th of August
                     that Mr. Grimshaw rang up and said that O.K., they are
                     happy with the report but if there were problems in the
                     operation of the new system then they would come back and
                     tell me, sir.

                  Q.Does not deal with the situation because there was a
                     meeting on the 16th of July, 1987.  Do you happen to
                     have any minutes of your own of that meeting? - A. I
                     do have some handwritten notes on the file, sir, yes.

                  Q. Are they available? - A. They are,   sir,   I think, yes.

                  Q. Is it possible to see them? - A. I think it is, sir, yes.

                  Q. While that is being sought can I perhaps put the situation
                     to you?  Did you appreciate that the Fire Service could not

                                                                   D. BOWNES

         deal with the question of capacities in their entirety?
         Did you appreciate that? - A. They saw the report, the
         draft report, and they approved it, sir.  I mean I cannot
         be any clearer, I do not think.

      Q. I am putting to you, you see, that what you have got set
         down there on page 418 .... - A       is what the Fire
         Service approved, sir.

      Q. Yes.  But they approved it subject to pointing out to
         you that the Fire Service could not deal with holding
         capacity because holding capacity was a matter for the
         structural people who would consider, as you have quite
         rightly indicated, for example, the crush barrier? - A.
         Sir, I have already said the)Firec Service approved that
         report and I have a note on the letter saying exactly
         that, sir.

             MR. MULLER:   At an earlier stage when the Fire
        Service was giving evidence about this matter reference
        was made by Mr. Seaman to notes that he made on the
        original document which was sent by the local Council,
        indeed, by Mr. Bownes.  I have now recovered that from
        the West Midlands Police and the annotations in relation
        to the very matter I am talking about will clearly be
        seen on that document.  Sir, perhaps I could put that ....

                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Which document is it that    ___

              MR. MULLER:   It is Exhibit 11 in the Fire Service
         bundle.  It reproduces effectively what appears at page
         418.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Right.  Well, you had better
         put it to the witness; as to whether that was what was said.

                   MR. MULLER:   Sir,    that is what I was proposing to

                                                          D.   BOWNES

       Q.   What was   said in relation to the fire service, that they
            could do  stadium capacity based on exit system and that
            as far as the building surveyors are concerned they should
            all be concerned in capacity based on area and crash
            barriers? A. Sir, can I ask you what document you are
            reading from?

       Q.   I am reading from a document which the fire service â     it
            was sent by you and I can show you the document.    It was
            sent to the fire service and the fire service, when they
            received   it,made notes upon that document. It was as a
            result of that the information contained on that document
            was passed on to you. A. I have no comment on it.    That
            was the document that I sent to the fire service.

       Q.   What I suggest happened is that maybe you, because you do
            not keep accurate records, have now no r ec ol lection of
            this happening.           It may also be â  and I do not necessarily
            criticize you for this â           that because of your lack of
            k nowledge in these matters you did not understand what
            they were talking about. A. No, Sir, I once again put to
            you â    and I can produce the letter now if it is of any
            assistance to you           -- that this draft report was submitted
            in full, including the list of responsibilities, to the
            fire service, the police, the building surveyor, and Health
            and Consumer Services.           I have a hand written note and I
            a pologize that it is not very clear.          It says on it:
            "Ron G. 2 p.m. 17th August, okay.           If problems with op.
            will come back".           I take it that means the operation of
            the s y s t e m , S i r .

       Q.   I fully understand that but what happened, so that I can
            make myself as clear as I possibly may, that before that
            there had   been a specific meeting on the 16th July in
            w hich that matter which I have just put to you had been
            discussed.   What you were saying at that meeting was that
            it is all a very broad indication. You were taking on board
            and indicating that you understood what was being said when
            the fire service indicated that they did not have the
            expertise to deal with crash barriers. A. Sir, if the fire
            service had felt that in any way this report was misleading
            or did not give a true reflection of what they were saying
            I am quite sure they would have said so in writing.   The
            letter specifically says: "As promised I now enclose for
            your attention a copy of the draft report which I have
            prepared for the panel".

       Q.   Can I ask you this, since you were devising the system and
            changing  the system from what it originally had been, did
            you think that the fire service were in a position to deal
            with all aspects of capacity? A. That would be a matter
            for advice from them, Sir.

       Q.   Did you, as a result of what you had discovered so far, think
            that they were competent to deal with all aspects of
            capacity? A. I knew at that stage that the fire service
                                         105


SDR2                                                   D.   BOWNES

              did deal with capacity in respect         of things      like night
              clubs, pubs, this sort of thing.

         Q.   This was not a pub.     A. Quite accurate,       Sir.

         Q.   They   do not have crash barriers    in public houses.         A.    No.

         Q.   Can I just ask you to please have a look at a document which
              has been provided to us today, I think by you, which is headed
              "Institue of Building Control Safety of all Sports Grounds".
              Is that a document which eminates from you? A. It is in
              r elation to a seminar which took place.

         Q.   Could you turn, please, I gannot give you which page it is
              because it is not paginated, but there is a part where it
              says "The Role of the Fire Service".   What is that document?
              A. This I believe is a summary of matters that were raised
  r~\         by the individual experts at this particular seminar.   I
  vâ '        do not think that it is a verbatim note by any means.

         Q.   It is not necessarily a verbatim note.           A.    It looks like
              a report.

         Q.   Of something     that actually was   said?      A.    It looks like a
              report .

         Q.   Looking   at the top page "Extensive Invovement". Do you see
              the top   of the page?  The Home Office requested the fire
              service to inspect all sports grounds and report. A. yes.

         Q.   When was that?    A.   I have no idea.

         Q.   Was that after the Bradford      fire? A.      I do not know,       Sir.

         Q.   What was happening there was they were was that they
              were asked to give a brief d escription of the ground, to
               state what the capacity was, what the existing means of
              escape were, and this is where their advice came,
               "The basic requirements to up-grade means of escape and
              fire risk to a reasonable standard to ensure life safety".
              A. Sir, that is what it says here.

         Q.       MR. COLLINS: I think that I can help Mr. Muller about
              this document.     If you look at the first of the typewritten
              pages a   little further back in the  bundle it is quite plain
              that this is a resume' of the address given by the H o m e
              Office r ep resentative to the seminar which this bundle of
              documents is concerned with, the seminar having taken place
              in October, 1987.     A. This bit here is my written note of
              what happened on the day.

         Q.                   You are recording the Home Office speakers
              and I think that what Mr. Muller has been referring to is
              the printed version which is a printed copy of what the
              Home Office effectively were saying or were expected to

SDR3                                                          D.    BOWNES

             say. A.     I assume it is an accurate    record,      Sir,   I do not
             know.

       Q.   That   is right,   is it? A.     I would assume   so,   yes.

                 MR. MULLER: You can appreciate, can you not, that
             in relation to means of escape of course the fire service
             are in a position to give advice about it. A. Yes.

       Q.   But that is not the only criteria, the means of escape, in
             assessing capacity according to the Green Guide, is it, the
             other vital one is the holding capacity. A. Perhaps you
             could refer me to the appropriate paragraph, Sir.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Cannot we take it there are other
             factors apart from escape? A. Yes, Sir.

       Q.        MR. MULLER: If you go down a little          bit further, where
             it deals with the West Yorkshire County          Council's safety
             team, which I suspect was one which was          being offered as
             perhaps a good system, do you see that?          Under Member of
             Safety Team, Sir?

       Q.   Member of Safety Team.   You have sub paragraph two and then
             (a) "Each discipline to be respon si bl e for carrying out
            inspections on joint visits and r ec om mending on those aspects
            on which they had expertise, (b) In the case of the fire
            service the inspecting officer was advised by the structural
            enginner building control officer of all structural defects
            including means of escape or fire resistance",    and it gives
            an example.   It made it absolutely clear there if you were
            present and heard all this that the structural engineers
            had a contribution to make even when it came to the
            q uestion of escape. A. I think it is absolutely clear that
            the building surveyor, for example, would have an input on
            certain aspects of the County Fire Service input, as would
            the police have an input on the Fire Service, the building
            surveyor, and the police.

       Q.   Do you not understand this, Mr. Bownes, that when it comes
            to calculating the holding capacity the Green Guide makes
            it absolutely clear that that can be affected by the position,
            for example, of the crash barrier, does it not? A. I would
            expect the question of capacity to be started off, if you
            like, with the fire service.

       Q.   How?   A.   On basic means of escape,    Sir.

       Q.   If someone starts it the       ultimate decision has to be made as
             a result of corollating       the i nformation which comes from all
             the different advisors,       does   it not? A. Yes, the ulti^a'te
             decision, that is quite       right.

       Q.   In this particular case I do not know if you have applied
            your mind to it at all but the critical question was what
            was the holding capacity because the time for escape gave
                                   107


SBU4                                            D.   BOWNES

            ample opportunity for people to get out even if there were
            far more people in than the Green Guide's holding capacity
            allowed.  Do you not even understand that? A. I think that
            you are referring to something that was happening in 1985.

       Q.   It is still applied in 1987. A. Yes.  If there were any
            questions of capacity, if you take it now, for example,
            in relation to  Owlerton the question of the Owlerton
            capacity was dealt with by the fire service and everyone
            else working together.

       Q.   If you have a look   so that   you have no doubt about   it at
            all.

            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Mr. Muller, if you are trying to
            e stablish that the fire service should not be thought to
            be the only body concerned in what is the proper capacity
   '        for the Crown I do nto think that you need press it.

       Q.       MR. MULLER: Sir, I will not pursue that aspect any
            further in those circumstances.  (To the witness) Can I
            then please ask you about this.  Would you please have
            a look in the core bundle at 374. A. I have it.

       Q.   As far as 374 is concerned that is a letter which we have
            seen several times and it was in response, was it not, to
            that letter which we have now got which appears in the
            additional documents which you have provided, namely the
            letter dated 3rd November, 1986. A. Yes, Sir, that is the
            fire service response to that letter.

       Q.   You were asking for general comments at that time, on the
            3rd November, 1986, from the fire service in relation to the
            conditions at both Sheffield W ednesday and Sheffield United,
            is that right? A. Yes.

       Q.   When you got that response,and    if we look now at your
            statement at page 20. A. Yes.

       Q.   You say, on 6th August, you make the comment in the middle
            the paragraph "No comments were received from the fire
            service or the police".  Of course, as far as that meeting
            is concerned you have not circulated any document minuting
            what had happened until five or six months after the event,
            namely 4th December, 1987. A. We are talking about the
            inspection of 6th August, 1987?

       Q.   Yes. A. And the building surveyor and Health and Consumer
             Services made a number of written comments.

       Q.   Yes.  You made the comment that no comments were received
            from the fire service? A. That is right.

       Q.   May I suggest to you that  because of the lapse of time you
             had forgotten at that annual inspection because what actually
             happened at that annual inspection was that a considerable

            amount of time was spent in discussing the letter of the
            18th February, 1987. A. Can I ask who with, Sir?

       Q.   With everyone who was present, including Dr.     Eastwood,   all
            the members of the advisory group, including     yourself.
            A. I am sorry. What is the question?




                               /Q. What   I am putting    to you is do

                                               D.   BOWNES



Q.   What I am putting to you is, do you not remember that far
     from there being no comment what had happened was there
     was already in existence a letter dated 18th February, 1987 -
     do you follow - which you yourself had asked for and there
     was detailed discussion at the meeting by all present of
     the contents of that letter and by the time you came to make
     your note of it and circulate it you had forgotten that
     that had happened.   A.   I would have expected the Fire
     Service to come back in response to any comments made on
     that inspection and say which items had been resolved
     and which were still outstanding.

Q.   But the position was, was it not, that they would just be
     repeating what was in that letter, a document which you had
     already got, and you were the person who was there to take
     minutes if there were to be any m inutes, were you not?
     A.   No, sir.   If the Fire Service had made those comments,
     then I would have expected them to deal with them really
     until the end, until they had finished with them.

Q.   Just bear withme.    It was not just the Fire Service that
     made comments about what was in the 18th February letter,
     it was everybody who was present, including the Club.
     Were you expecting everybody to write you a letter about
     what had happened?    A.   I was certainly expecting the
     Fire Service and the Building Surveyor and the Health and
     C onsumer Services, and the Police if appropriate, and
     certainly Building Surveyor and Health and Consumer Services
     did.

Q.   Do you think it is a possibility that if you delay making
     a report for many months you may forget what has actually
     happened at that meeting?   A.   Yes, of course, sir.

Q.   I want to move, please, to another matter.     We have
     already been through the question of the r e- dr af ti ng of
     the Safety Certificate.    Your initial draft that you
     sent to the Fire Service was a general certificate with
     general conditions which were intended to apply to all
     grounds in your area;   am I right?   A.   It was a first
     draft, sir, yes.

Q.   It may be a first draft.  Quite apart from your first draft,
     those general conditions were not directed specifically to
     Sheffield Wednesday, were they?   A.   Nor Sheffield United,
     sir, no.

Q.   They were general conditions which were going to be used,
     as it were, as the corner-stone for particular conditions
     for each ground in the area.   A.   That's right, sir,
     yes .

Q.   And after you had indicated at a very early stage that they
     were reaching, fruition, whatever expression you used, on
     frequent occasions your contact in the Fire Service, Mr.
     Binnington, asked you how it was getting Qn, did he not?
     A.   I am sure he would have reminded me on occasions,
     sir, yes.

                                                               D.   BOWNES



           Q.    And you told him it was getting on well, or words   to that
                effect.     A.   Well, sir, I would have said whatever was
                happening at the time, sir.

           Q.    Whereas in fact it was moving    incredibly   slowly. A.     It
                was moving slowly, sir, yes.

           Q.   Do you remember on one occasion when Mr. Binnington said
                to you that he wanted a better copy of the plan which was
                attached to the original Safety Certificate because all
                he had got was a photostat copy?      Do you follow?   You
                told him, "Don't worry about getting that plan because
                you will be getting a new plan very soon attached to the
                new Certificate" and that c on ve rsation took place very
                shortly after you had taken over.      A.   No, sir, I don't
                recall that conversation.

           Q . And, indeed as a- result of that, you never sent him a plan
               at all.   A.   Well, sir, I don't recall the conversation,
               I am afraid, I am sorry.

           Q.   Of course, anybody in the Fire Service as a result of what
                you were saying would be thinking, would they not, that
                any minute you were going to be updating the Certificate?
                A.   Sir, they have had the correspondence and they read
                that the way ---

           Q.   They could not read it any other way, could they?     The
                letters indicate it is imminent and what is more the various
                telephone c on versations with your contact at the Fire
                Stations indicated it was imminent.     A.   The letters
                certainly did, sir, and indeed the report does and I think
                I have dealt with that already.

           Q.   Certainly nobody would    get the impression that the matter
                was not in hand.   A.      No, sir.

           Q.   And, of course, ary updating of the Certificate   was a matter
                entirely for you, was it not?    A.     Yes, sir, acting, of
                course, with the advisers who would comment on any conditions
                that were being ---

           Q.   You were the one who had to decide      to do the updating.
                A.   Yes, sir.

                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I think we have    covered    that,
                Mr.   Muller, have we not?

           Q.        MR. MULLER:   Can   I just ask youtthen     about this:
                could you have a look,   please, at Document   481 which, of
                course, is a document which comes   into existence very shortly
                before this disaster.   This letter which you sent has
                got attached to it a Schedule 3, is that right?     A.    The
                draft conditions, I believe, are Schedule 3, sir, yes.

           Q . Which gpe specifically related       to Sheffield Wednesday and
               the capacities, is that right?         A.   Is this Page 489, sir?
                               111


                                                 D.   BOWNES

Q.   506.   Do you realise that when you sent that letter off
     to the South Yorkshire Fire Service you omitted to send
     that schedule?   A.   No, sir, I was not aware of that.

Q.   Even though   you had had a reply indicating that it was
     not there?     I think you had a reply dated 25th May.

            LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:     Where   is this?

          MR. MULLER:   I have just got it now in my hand.  I
     think it is not actually in the documents.   It has obviously
     been sent very recently.

          THE WITNESS:   Sir, if I had received that on 25th May,
     I have no doubt that what you are saying is correct but I
     think the Inquiry takes some precedence over dealing with
     that matter that was raised.   I mean, I would have thought
     that the Fire Service would have, if they had not got that
     schedule, would have rung up and said, "We have not got
     the schedule, can you let us have it, please."

Q.          MR. MULLER:      All I can put to you is,          and we can   see
     this   in the Fire    Service bundle --

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     If you: are only going to prove
     that he has not sent it and there has not been a reply,
     do we really need it?   We were actually sitting here at
     this time when all this   was going on.

Q.         MR. MULLER:  All I am    seeking to say is this, that
     as far as the Fire Service bundle is concerned which is,
     of course, only a photostat copy, the originals being
     with the West Midlands Police, it is quite obvious     from
     the photostat copoies that no schedule was     sent to the
     Fire Service, therefore any point I am making to you is
     that as far as you were concerned, you    were not drawing
     the Fire Service's attention to the fact that you were
     suggesting these capacities, so that they could not comment
     on it and say, "Well, that is wrong, the capacities should
     be otherwise."      A.    Sir, if there wasn't a schedule
     attached, it should have been.     it was a simple, clerical
     error.

Q. gut the fact is that without that schedule they would have
   no idea that you were getting it wrong, would they?
   A.   Without the schedule they couldn't comment, sir,
   quite right, and I have no doubt they made that point
   in their letter.

                   C ro ss-examined   by MR.   GIBSON-WATT:

Q . Mr. Bownes, one point.    From an answer you gave this
    morning, I think you are aware that the Popplewell Report
    expressed the hope that the Local Authorities Associations
    would get together and draw up a set of model conditions to
    be put in the Safety Certificates.    You are aware of that,
    are you not?   A.    Yes, sir.   It would certainly have been
    of assistance to me.
                               112


                                                  D.   BOWNES



Q.   I think in fact, as far as you are concerned, it would
     in effect have cut out the whole year from the summer
     of 1986 to the summer of 1987 in which you were engaged
     in trying to get together a set of model conditions for
     your area.   A.   Depending on how long it took them to
     achieve that exercise, yes, sir.

Q.   I am right in thinking, am I not, that no set of model
     conditions as far as you are aware has ever been produced
     or has even been produced today by the Local Authorities
     Associations.   A.   That is correct, sir, yes.

Q.   To get it complete, you in ;fact have produced to us as part
     of that seminar bundle this morning a set of conditions
     which was, I think, produced by the Building Surveyor of
     Bradford as one of the speakers to the conference.
     A.   Yes, sir, there is a form.

Q. Do you know where that came from?   A.   I don't actually
   know where it came from without reading the bundle, sir.

Q.   The point, of course, is it was not a r ec ommendation in
     the Popplewell Report, it was merely an expression of hope,
     was it not?      A.      Yes, sir.   Could I just add that the
     Association of Metropolitan Authorities is really what
     you might   d es cr i b e as an interest group, sir.    It is
     perhaps inappropriate for it to draw up model conditions.
     The view I had taken was that the Home Office was the
     appropriate one to do that, as it does produce model byelaws,
     model conditions and w ha t-have-you in respect of other
     licensing matters.         I raised that with the Home Office
     en a couple of occasions and the^ said that they were not
     intending to do that, sir.              -             . _ .
           - -         _
Q . Just to get it complete, Mr. Justice Popplewell did not limit
    it to the Associ at io n of Metropolitan Authorities;  he
    said he hoped they would get together with the Association
    of County Councils and the Convention of Scottish Local
    Authorities, the three of them to do it.      A.  Yes, sir.
    I believe that is Paragraph 381, sir.

          MR.   GIBSON-WATT:     That is quite right.

                    C r oss-examined   by MR.   CALLAGHAN:

Q. Mr. Bownes, prior to the inspection which             you attended on
   7th August, 1986, had you read the -----               A. Sir, I cannot
   hear you, I am afraid.

Q . The inspection of 7th August, 1986 which you attended.
    Prior to that had you read the Safety Certificate for the
    ground?   A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   Could you have a look at the Safety Certificate, please,
     page 111 of the core bundle. Paragraph 8.1 deals with
     the provision of a suitably equipped First Aid Room.
     A.   Yes, sir, I have the condition.
                                 113


                                                           D.   BOWNES



Q. Did you arrange for anyone to inspect the First Aid Room
   on the inspection of 7th August?   A.   Sir, I have some
   notes, if I might refer to them.   In fact, in 1986 there
   is no record of an inspection being made of the First Aid
   Room at Sheffield Wednesday.

Q.   Does that mean that you did not ask anybody to carry out
     that inspection?   A.   I certainly didn't ask anybody
     to carry out that inspection, sir.

Q. Did you regard such an inspection as being within the ambit
   of any of the other people who attended the inspection with
   you?   A.   The people who attended the inspection were
   the Fire Service, the Police and the Building Surveyor
   and I considered the point that perhaps they would not
   cover the First Aid facilities which is why the Department
   of Health and Consumer Services was brought into the system
   a little bit later on.

Q.   That was later,     was it not?        A.    It was    in 1987,     sir,
     yes .

Q.   But you made no arrangement       in respect      of the inspection
     of 1986?   A.   No, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Who was brought in later?
     A.   It is the Council's Department of Health and Consumer
     Services, sir, who deal with miscellaneous health and
     safety matters.

Q.       MR. CALLAGHAN:          Would you turn,      please,     to page 398
     of the core bundle.         A.   I have it,      sir.

Q.   That, I think, is the draft schedule defining the lead
     authority role which I believe accompanied the letter of
     14th May on the following page.  A.   Yes, I believe that
     is right, sir.

Q.   On page 398 the last section deals with the Director of
     Environ (mental Health and Consumer Services, which is part
     of the City Council, I believe?     A.   It is a Department
     of the council, yes, sir.

Q.   And in handwriting at the end of the paragraph on the right-
     hand side there it says, I think, "First Aid and Medical"?
     A.   Yes, sir.   I think that is what it says.   It is
     unclear.

Q.   That seems to suggest that it was accepted that it was
     the City Council who was to be responsible for First Aid.
     A.   Sir, if you look at the report of September, 1987,
     which deals with the r es po ns ibilities of individual
     D epartments or Officers, I think it makes it fairly plain.

Q. Would you turn       to page 411.    A.       I have it,     sir.

Q.   That   is a memo   to you   from Mr.    Moore   of the Health       and

                Consumer Services Department and under the heading,
                "Health and Safety General Point 2" there is a reference
                to the First Aid Room.   The paragraph says:  "The main
                first aid room requires to be supplied with adequate
                first aid equipment for the treatment of spectators should
                they become ill or injured within the sports ground."
                A.   It does, sir.

           Q.   And if you then   turn,   please,   to page 417.      A.    I have
                it, sir.

           Q.   That, I think, is your report.         A.   Yes,    sir,   it is
                the General Purposes Panel.

           Q.   If you look then at the top of page 419.            A.   Yes, sir,
                it refers to He a lth and Consumer Services        being respons ible
                for First Aid, sir, yes.

           Q.   The Council indeed wrote to the Club as a result of the
                1987 inspection and that letter appears at page 431.
                A.   I have i t , s i r .

           Q.   There is a list of comments attached which accompanied
                that letter and the second page of that list is at page 433,
                Point 4.2:  "The main first aid room requires to be
                supplied with adequate first aid equipment for the treatment
                of spectators should they become ill or injured within the
                sports ground."   A.   Y e s > that is what it says, sir.

           Q.   Do you know the ways in which the First Aid Room was deficient
                at that time?   A.   No, sir.   I understand - it might
                help somewhat - that the First Aid equipment was only
                actually present on the ground during specified activity;
                it wasn't necessarily present during inspection.

           Q.   Doess that mean that it was never inspected?    A.    What
                subsequently happened, sir, once this I think became clear
                to the Health and Consumer Services Department is that
                they talked - the Health and Consumer Services Department
                talked to St. John's, asked them what sort of equipment
                they would wish to have and then there were d iscussions with
                the Club and that e quipment was, I believe, provided, sir.
                That discussion I b elieve took place in the early part of
                1988.    I think it is also fair to point out that the
                Health and Consumer Services Department were somewhat
                hampered by the fact that there aren't any national or
                nationally accepted standards of First Aid equipment.
                There does not seem to be any guidance on what should
                be provided.    I have no doubt the Club was also hampered
                by that.

           Q. Did they draw up their own check list as to what might
              be suitable?   A.   Who, sir?

           Q.   The Health and Consumer Services Department.   A.  As far
                as I am aware, sir, there was simply an agreement between
                Health and Consumer Services, St.John and the Club to
                provide certain equipment and I regret I don't know what
                                          115


                                                                         D.      BOWNES



          that equipment         was.

     Q.   Is it something which you have followed up with that
          D epartment to see that thEt has been done? A.   That
          the equipment has been provided, sir?

     Q.   Yes.       A.        I believe    it has been provided,             sir.

     Q.    But you do not know what              it is?     A.       I don't        know what
          it is , s i r , no .

     Q.   I do not think you cap. help us any more on that point but
          could you return, please, to the Safety Certificate,
          page 111.  A.     I have it, sir.

     Q.    Paragraph 8 1 2 : "The Holder shall ensure that during
S'        every Specified Activity a physician employed or retained
          by the Holder is available to attend at the First Aid
          Room if required and that his whereabouts are known to
          those in the Police Central Control     Room at the Stadium."
          Have you ever taken any steps to ensure that that provision
          is complied with?      A.   I personally have not, sir.

     Q.   Has anybody at the City Council                 to your knowledge?
          A.   j.o my knowledge, no, sir.

                                C ro ss-examined       by MR.    G L AS G OW ?

     Q. Mr. Bownes, while you have got the Certificate in front
        of you, if you need to refresh your memory go to page
        117, were you aware of the fact that the C ertificate
        required specific areas of the ground to be covered by
        stewards?     Had you noticed that? A.   Yes, sir, it is
        set out i n ---

     Q.   I know it is set out.              I wondered         whether       you had noticed
          it before?   A.   Yes,            sir.

     Q.   You had?        A.      Yes,    sir.

     Q.   When you re-drafted - and perhaps I should, completely
          to deal with it - did you notice the fact that in the
          sections of the stadium to be covered there were no
          stewards required as a matter of the C ertificate on the
          terraces?    A.  I have to admit, sir, that I did not
          notice that.

     Q.   You did not notice            that.     A.      I didn't notice that.

     Q.   To be fair to you, when you came eventually to redraft
          the certificate, you did think that some provision ought
          to be made for control of the numbers entering sections
          of the ground?   A.  Could you refer me to the document,
          sir?

     Q.   Yes.   When you redrafted the Certificate, your redraft I
          think is most conveniently found at -- it starts with the
          letter at 387.   The only bit I was going to refer you to

                                               D.    BOWNES



     was on 390.   This, of course, was in the summer of 1987.
     You provided under Paragraph 10, as we see on 390, that
     the Written instructions given to the stewards should
     include, as the first one, "the preventing of overcrowding
     by ensuring crowd limits in various parts of the ground were
     complied with."   A.   Yes, sir, that is what it says.

Q. And was that a matter of conscious in-put from you or
   something which perfectly sensibly you had culled from
   a different c er ti ficate? A.  I believe, sir, that
   that actually is in the Green Guide, if I am not mistaken.

Q.   At anyvevent, was it something which you had given active
     thought to as being a possible problem at this ground
     or just a matter of good sense generally, wherever it had
     come from?   A.   I must have given it active consideration
     to put it in the conditions, sir.   These conditions were
     not ground specific at this time.




                                      /No.   Mr.    Bownes,   what.
                           117


                                                 D . BOWNES


Q. No.  Mr. Bownes, what you may be able to help on is when that
   was commented on specifically and fairly promptly by the Fire
   Service they raised with you the query of how this was going
   to be done.  Do you remember that? - A. Yes, I think it is
   fairly well stated in their letter.

Q. It is noted in 390 as we can see, and if you want it more
   legibly you find it on 409.  On 409 they were replying on 13th
   August to that letter of 7th July, and they say in respect of
   section 10(a):

          "Whilst specified in the Green Guide" (which is right)
          "it is difficult to imagine how this task can be
          controlled by stewards. This matter should be considered
          further".

     - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Does that refresh your memory? - A. Yes, that is what was
   said.

Q.   Was it considered further? - A. In the revised draft, which
     perhaps we could have a look at ....

Q. By all means.  You have to go well forward for the revised
   draft. - A. It is 500 or so.

Q.   499 is the relevant page.  We find it on 499 that your
     suggested solution to the problem there raised is simply   to
     alter the wording to read:

          "Under the direction of the safety officer or chief
          steward or authorised officer, prevent overcrowding".

     - A. That was my understanding, sir, but I think the Fire
     Service have made additional comments on that, but I can't
     recall what they are at the moment.

Q. Can you remember any discussion about it after it had been
   raised by the Fire Department? - A. No, sir.

Q. Specifically as to how this was physically to be achieved at
   this ground? - A. No, sir, I can't recall any discussion.

Q. Again, I wonder if it helps, when you went to this wonderful
   seminar with everybody, including the West Yorkshire Police,
   did you notice the fact that it was a matter specifically
   raised by the Police at that seminar that the control of these
   pens was part of the policing procedure at the ground? Do you
   recall that or did that pass you by? - A. I am afraid that
   must have passed me by, sir.  I can't recall that.

Q. If we look at page 4, and this is I appreciate a digest of
   what was said and not a report, you see the role of the Police
   is discussed in much the same way as the role of the Fire
   Brigade has been discussed which Mr. Muller was helping us
   with? - A. Yes, sir.
                           118

                                                 D. BOWNES



Q.   Do you remember the man from West Yorkshire telling everybody
     about the way the Police ought to do it? - A. Vaguely, sir.   I
     think my notes were the bits that I took real note o f .

Q.   A summary may help us.   We get it on page 4. Perhaps it is
     the quickest way of doing it to save everybody time.   The role
     is defined under the three general headings, (b) being to
     maintain safe and orderly crowd upon arrival at the stadia and
     to preserve that condition throughout the game. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Then the point I wondered might have concerned you is under
   the Safety of Sports Ground Act underneath.  If you go over
   the page you see on page 5, "Normal policing methods".  - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. I take it no further if your recollection does not go this
   far, Mr. Bownes, but do you remember that as part of normal
   policing methods the West Yorkshire senior Officers were
   talking about the use of pens?  It is the second matter after
   "Segregation":

          "The use of pens:  as part of the normal policing we have
          the use of pens, i.e. small segregated enclosures for
          supporters on the terraces greatly improves crowd
          control, etc".

     I won't waste time by reading it through.  We can read it for
     ourselves. - A. Yes, I accept what is written there.

Q. My question is this.   You had raised the problem in the summer
   of this year.   The Fire Service had very sensibly come back
   and said to you, "Yes, but how on earth are we going to do
   it?". You then go off to a seminar in all modesty to be
   better informed about these problems, and lo and behold the
   Police Officer from the next County gets up and talks about
   this specific problem.   I wondered if at least at that stage
   did it ring a bell to you to say, "My goodness me, this is the
   very problem we are talking about at Sheffield"? - A. Forgive
   me, sir, I thought you were talking about stewards to start
   with.   I have misinterpreted what you say.

Q. I am not trying to score points on that all, Mr. Bownes.   It
   does not matter whose responsibility it was.  It so happens it
   was discussed as part of normal policing.  That is not the
   point. What I wanted you to remember was whether or not this
   rang a bell with you as to whether or not we had got a problem
   of precisely this kind at Sheffield? - A. No, the question of
   pens I must say passed me by.

Q. Finally, Mr. Bownes, in fairness to you is it right to say
   when you did circulate your draft to the members of the
   working party you were told by all of them - taking them in
   turn - by the Police Force first, both in January and in
   October, that they were very satisfied with the co-operation
   of the club and the way in which it was dealing with its
   problems? - A. Yes, sir, the Police have certainly said that,
                           119

                                                 D. BOWNES


     sir.

Q. And that your own lead authority, the Environmental Health
   Officer, had said precisely the same thing at 413, actually
   saying he was impressed by the management? Would you like to
   remind yourself of that? I think it is 413 of the big bundle.
   The last line that is relevant:  "I was noticeably impressed
   with the level of ground management being maintained"? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. The question simply for you, Mr. Bownes, having had your ideas
   circulated and received the input from the members of the
   working party, did you think that there was anybody on that
   working party who was at all unhappy at the way in which the
   club had been behaving in relation to its safety functions? -
   A. No, sir.

Q. I am sorry, one very last matter.  the question of alterations
   being made.  I think you have said you regarded alterations
   which would have required a variation to the certificate to be
   put before the fully authorised committee, the panel? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. Matters of rearrangement which did not go to the root of the
   certificate you regarded as being fit for the working party? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. Would it be fair to say from your own attendance at those
   working party meetings you would not have been surprised if
   the club's officers had acted on the request of working party
   officers to carry out minor works around the ground? - A. It
   is a question of what you mean by minor, sir.

Q. Of course. - A. Painting, that sort of thing, I would not have
   thought there was any difficulty.  Have you got a particular
   point in mind, sir?

Q. I wondered whether the rearrangement of the barrier was one
   that concerned you as being something that ought to have been
   taken further or whether your reaction as the time was that if
   that is raised by the working party it is not surprising it is
   acted upon? - A. This is 144, sir?

Q. Yes. - A. Yes, in respect of that barrier at that time.    Yes.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What are you saying "Yes" to? - A.
     That it was a matter that I would expect the club to act on.

Q. On what was said at the working party? - A. What was said at
   that particular inspection in relation to that particular
   barrier, sir.

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   Were you aware of any other matters? I
     don't want to take time putting them to you if you don't
     recall.  Were you aware of any other variations to the ground
     that were done after meetings to members of the working party
     without them being formally referred to the panel? - A. I
                            120
                                                   D . BOWNES


     should think there were quite a few of a routine maintenance
     nature, sir, yes.

Q. I won't press it further.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When the question of removing that
     barrier was discussed was there specific mention of the fact
     it would necessarily reduce the number that could be
     accommodated in that pen? - A.   I would honestly say I can't
     recall if any mention was made of that.

Q. I think Dr. Eastwood has told us it did.

          MR. TOULSON:   He was saying it on the strength of the
     report he got from Strange, of   course. Sir, I will touch on
     that if I may in a moment.

                   Cross-Examined by MR. TOULSON:

Q. Mr. Bownes, I am sorry to come back to the working party, but
   would you turn in your statement to page 5 paragraph 18, where
   you set out the background under the South Yorkshire regime:

          "The County Council set up an 'Officer Working Party
          (Sheffield District)â which consisted of
          representatives of the Fire Service, the Police, the
          Building Authority (Sheffield City Council) and the
          South Yorkshire County Council Administration
          Department".

     Rightly, you don't include there the club or its engineers as
     members of the working party because they were n o t , were they?
     - A. No, sir.

Q. They would be present by invitation at the twice yearly
   inspection of the ground by members of the Officer Working
   Party when obviously matters would be discussed? - A. Any
   comment on matters really before 1986 would be speculation on
   my p a r t ....

Q. So be it. - A ....... but it is my understanding that club
   representatives were present on inspections.

Q. That is right, but not at other meetings of the officer
   working party? - A. No, sir, some meetings were conducted
   without club representatives being present.

Q. Coming on to the change under your regime, your statement,
   page 14, paragraph 46, records or leads on to the description
   of how in the next paragraph the advisory group came to be set
   up.  I don't want to go over what has been gone over before.
   Effectively that was going to be the same group but under
   another name? - A. Yes, with some slight changes.

Q. You were going to have on it, paragraph 49 page 15, the
   Building Survey.  He had been on already? Correct? - A. Yes,
   sir.

                                                        D. BOWNES



    Q. County Fire Service.     They had been on already. - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. Police:    they had been on already? - A. Yes.

    Q. The County Council could not be on any longer because they had
       ceased to exist, and you were in their place? - A. Yes.

    Q.    But before that change of name - it was no more than that -
         took place, which we see from your statement was September
         1987, you had been in the saddle for 18 months? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q.    And it was during that 18 months period that the inspection
         had taken place in August when the removal of 144 was
         authorised? - A. August, 1986, sir.

         Exactly.  Do I understand it right that during that 18
         months period you had been continuing with the old
         system, the officer working party, but with yourself in
         place of the now defunct County Council? - A.
         Effectively, yes, sir.

    Q. You told the Inquiry that you had your own engineer - when I
       say "you", the City Council? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. As indeed had the County Council beforehand? - A. No, sir.
       The County Council used the City Council's Building Surveyor.

    Q. I am so sorry.  At any rate, the hat may have changed but what
       was beneath the hat remained the same? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. He was in fact, Mr. Don Sheriff of the Building Department? -
       A. I think Mr. Sheriff attended meetings, sir, yes.

    Q. And he is a qualified chartered engineer? - A. I don't know
       his qualifications, sir, but I am quite confident he is.

    Q. If he was not there there was somebody else standing in his
       shoes? - A. Yes, I imagine so.

    Q. Under the old system, would you look in the core bundle page
       27.  I expect you have seen it before.  To avoid people not
       knowing what their respective responsibilities were there was
       an allocation of responsibilities, and if we look at
       "Terraces" on the left-hand side, "Structuralâ was a matter
       primarily for the building authority but with the Fire and
       Police to be consulted. - A. Is that the third one down, sir?
       It is a poor copy.

    Q. It depends how you count, but do you see the word "Terraces"?
       - A. "Egress from the ground", and it is below that?

    Q. Yes.  Over the page:  "Spacing of crush barriers;  strength of
       crush barriers", both building authority? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. "Estimation of safe ground capacity", Council? - A. Yes, sir.

                                                D. BOWNES


Q. After the new authority comes into power, page 418, "Building
   Surveyor;  all matters relating to structure of stadium
   including crush barriers, walls, etc".  - A. Yes, sir.

Q. So throughout, the licensing authority had the benefit of its
   own independent advice from the engineers in relation to
   matters of crush barriers and structures? - A. Yes, sir, quite
   right.

Q. When we come to the 1981 radial fences we know as a matter of
   history that the impetus came from the Police, the club
   agreed, the club's engineers prepared drawings and the matter
   went before the working party.  Turn please to page 153.  Here
   was the decision to introduce the radial barriers after
   discussion, and we see under (2):

       "Whilst there were drawbacks .... the working party felt
       increased control should result".

  May we look to see who were the people who were taking that
  decision.  When we look down at the people present there is
  nobody there from the club or its advisors, but you have got
  there represented each of the parties on the working party,
  including the engineer, Mr. Sheriff, from the Building
  Department? - A. Yes, sir.




                               /Q. And I am not going to.

                                                     D. BOWNES

Q. And I am not going to duplicate the exercise for 1985.
   L e t âs come on, if we may, to the 1986 meeting, inspection
   meeting, which was the first annual inspection you
   attended although you had been to the ground previously?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Turn, please,   to page 341 in the bundle.   - A. Yes,   I have
   it, sir.

Q. I think you accept, Mr. Bownes, whether you had power
   to do so or not you in fact authorised on behalf of the
   Council the removal of that barrier? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And, indeed, it was more than an authorisation, it was a
   request,, because it was not something the club were
   asking to do, was it? -A. The Police raised the issue
   and it was a matter of agreement really at the end of
   the day.

Q. Now, this document we have is a job list, is it not,
   prepared by Mr. Strange from Eastwoods noting the various
   things which the club was going to have to do after the
   raised inspection? - A. It looks like that, sir, yes.

Q. Perhaps we can just glance down.  Do we get an  indication
   of the detail with which the group had gone round the
   ground by, for example, item 4, seat 3, row 8, in the
   West Stand needs repairing? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. This was no mere perfunctory glance.  This was a detailed
   inspection? - A. Well, sir, there are a number of points
   raised.

Q. And so far as the radial removal - there were two radial -
   two fences, I am sorry, barriers, to be altered.   We are
   not directly concerned with No. 1.   That was in the
   corner of the ground.   It was a question, you agreed, one
   piece of barrier should be taken out and replaced by
   another? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. We are concerned directly with No. 2.  You have told the
   Inquiry that there was discussion - but you, do I underÂ­
   stand, do not recall any of the details of the reasons
   why the Police wanted it out? - A. Regrettably, no, sir.

Q. Do you recall this, that it was being put forward as a
   matter of some urgency because it was now the 7th of
   August and the season was going to start with a home
   game against Everton who were, I think, champions, and
    that was going to coincide with the opening of Spion Kop?
    Does any of that ring a chord with you? - A. That would go
    beyond my recollection, sir.  I am sorry, sir.

Q. Capacity, Dr. Eastwood has given evidence that Mr.       Strange
                          124


                                                    D. BOWNES

     reported back to him after this meeting when the Police
     raised this he had pointed out that this would result in
     some calculated loss of capacity which obviously the club
     were not keen to lose and that the view had been expressed
     and that the view had been expressed, however, there was no
     reason why that should be because the ground was going to
     be made safer by this.   Do you have any recollection or
     just no recollection? - A . I am sorry, sir, no.

Q. May I just ask you a question or two about capacity?
     When you had taken over this job and been presented with
     your eight files one would not have expected you to have
     read every document with great care but obviously there
     would have been certain documents you would have wanted
     to look at, would not there? - A. Yes, sir, I tried to
     get a flavour of the files.

Q. Had you, for example, read Dr. Eastwood's original report
   back in 1979, survey report, page 36 in the bundle?
     Would you care to look at it? - A. I have it, sir.
Q. Had you read that? - A. I really cannot recall at this
   distance ....

Q. If you were trying to see your way into the matter that
   might have been one of the basic documents you looked at.
   You have no recollection? - A. Quite possibly, sir, but
   I do not recall reading that particular document.

Q. You would no doubt have read the 1976 Guide  and how
   capacity was calculated? - A. I certainly read the 1976
   Guide, sir, yes.

Q. And how capacity was calculated because that was something
   which you were going to be responsible for? - A. Yes.   I
   noted how the capacity was calculated but it is not   - it
   is a technical matter which I would have to take advice on.

Q;   And no doubt did take advice from the engineers? - A. Where
     it was appropriate to do so, sir, yes.

Q.    It was appropriate to know how capacity was calculated, was
     not it? - A. If a question had been raised on capacity,
     yes, sir.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I suppose one short cut
     to all this would be when you took over from the
     County to have a meeting of everybody that was involved,
     including the club and its engineer, and say, "took, we
     have taken this over.  We are responsible for the
     certificate. Tell us if the situation at the moment is
     satisattory. Have there been any changes or anything to
     be done?"- A. Yes.  Well, in fact, there was a meeting
     involving the working party, if you like, in the middle

                   of March where those points were in fact raised.

              Q. And the club? -QA. Not including the club,     sir, no.

              Q. Almost inevitable, is not it, Dr. Eastwood would have
                 said well, there have been considerable changes and
                 it has altered capacity? - A. Yes, I think in hindsight
                 it would have been useful to have that discussion.

              Q.        MR. TOULSON:    Just look, if you would,    please,
                   two pages here, page 56? -A.   I have it, sir.

              Q. Keep your   finger in there ifyou would, please, and
                 also go to page 117.  I am just wondering about your
                 comparison           thi figarS' DrSw Easfcwdod ogiglsiltjtly
                 suggested for standing on Spion Kop and the figure that
                 had been certified.  Dr. Eastwood had suggested that
                 once the works had been done which were in fact then
                 done they could certify for 16,000.     In fact the
                 Licensing Authority was more generous from the point
                 of view of the club's revenues by certifying for 16,850?
                 - A. That is evidently true from the file, sir, yes.

              Q. So clearly that authority had exercised its independent
                 mind when looking at the question of capacity? - A. Yes,
                 sir.

              Q. At any rate, when you  - you have said, I think, in your
                 statement that on the occasion when the removal of 144
                 was authorised the building authority were there and
                 represented and able to advise you? - A. Yes, sir.

              Q. And they were the people who you understood you were
                 going to be looking to for advice on calculations on
                 capacity? - A. Yes, sir, as>far as the old revision of
                 responsibilities was concerned, yes.

              Q. So either the question ofcapacity was discussed and the
                 view concluded there was no need to alter the figure
                 or the building authority did not raise it at all but
                 you do not remember? - A. I am afraid I do not remember,
                 sir.

              Q. Now, finally, you produced today a bundle of correspondence
                 starting with a letter of the 23rd October, 1986.     I am not
                 quite sure why the first letter was being introduced but
                 it refers to previous correspondence and in case it has
                 any materiality the position was this, was not it, you
                 are there acknowledging a letter from Eastwoods of the
                 15th of October in reply to a letter of the 9th October.
                 I have copies of the letters .'there, but unfortunately we
                 have just produced them.  The position was this, was not
                 it, on the 9th October you had written to the club saying
                 that you did not seem to have any plans for the Spion Kop

            end although the building work was well underway and
            Eastwoods had replied saying that the plans had in fact
            been deposited with the Council ten months earlier and
            also copies had been supplied to the^Fire Brigade and
            the building authority? - A. Yes, sir.     As I recall,
            what happened was     the advisor - I forget which  -had
            said they had not had copies of these plans and would
            I raise it with Eastwoods.

         Q. And in fact had them all along? - A. Yes.   What had
            happened is that the normal system for submitting plans
            had not been followed.  Sir, I wonder if I may make -
            I am sorry - a comment about the Spion Kop?

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes, by all means.

                 THE WITNESS:     Dr. Eastwood actually applied for a
            capacity of 22,000 or so, I think, nearly 23,000 I think
            it was, and the General Purposes Panel when it considered
            the application for the increase in capacity on the advice
            of the Council's various advisors reduced that to 21,000.

                 MR. TOULSON:   Yes.

                        Cross-examined b%rfMR. WOODWARD:

         Q. Mr. Boitfnes, when you took over you made a point, I think
            you said, of looking at the Green Guide, the 1976 Green
            Guide? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. And looking at the safety certificate? - A. Yes,    sir.

         Q. Because you wanted to know what you were responsible for,
            what you would have to enforce and had to have a firm view
            about the meanings? - A. I certainly needed to familiarise
            myself with it.

         Q. You cobld not do your job unless you knew what you meant
            or what you were taking - to be responsible for? - A. Yes,
            sir.

         Q. Did there come a time when you looked at the 1986 Green
            Guide? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. Did you notice the significant difference between,the tx^o
            concerning the emphasis and importance attached to the
            holder's responsibility and stewarding? - A. Yes, sir, I
            think the accompanying circular drew attention to partÂ­
            icularly the section in relation to management responsÂ­
            ibility, sir.

         Q. Yes.  If one compares the two, and we do not need to do
            it now, but it can be said, can it not, that there is
            barely any reference to stewarding and the organisation
                           127

                                                         D. BOWNES

     of people at the ground but in the Green Guide of 1986
     that is almost the primary emphasis? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Yes.  The 1976 one effectively concentrates on physical
   methods, barriers and that sort of means of controlling
   people's positions? - A. I believe so, sir, yes.

Q. Yes.  Well, when you read the 1986 Guide did you give your
   mind at all to w h e t h e r o r not the safety certificate was
   appropriate and sufficient in the light of the new
   guidance? - A. It did occur to me that amendments may be
   required  and it was an ongoing process,         if you like, of
   redrafting the safety certificate conditions.

Q. Of course you will have looked at the safety certificate
   and you will have seen what was said, perhaps with some
   prescience, under paragraph 9, under condition 9, conÂ­
   cerning the responsibility of stewards, iicgf

          MR. WOODWARD:   Page 111,   sir,   in the core bundle.

          THE WITNESS:    I have it, sir.     Sorry.   What was
     the question?

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:  You will have perhaps noted when you
     looked at the position of stewards to see there that in
     1979 the drafters of the certificate had had some thought
     about it? - A. Yes, sir, I noticed that the condition was
     there, sir, yes.

Q. And the only reference in the certificate to the ensuring
   of safety by control and direction of the fans rests
   insofar as it is dealt with in the certificate upon the
   club and uponIhe stewards?  There is the lacuna that
   Mr. Glasgow pointed out in relation to the terrace.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Mr. Woodward, we have been
     over this umpteen times and I have reminded you three
     times of what your Senior Officers have said and   I can
     read what the certificate says and the Green Guide.

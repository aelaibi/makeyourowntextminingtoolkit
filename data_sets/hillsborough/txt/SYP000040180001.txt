                 Forest on the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough Football Ground you
                 neglected to discharge your duties in that you:-

                 (b) failed to control the movement of supporters subsequent to the opening
                      of Gate 'C'; and

                      rescue operation.

                       to the Deputy Chief Constable)

                       YOU ARE HOWEVER, WARNED THAT IF YOU MAKE SUCH A STATEMENT TO ME OR TO THE

          but       there       was    no       bad       behaviour            or      drunkeness.                       We    got       to     the      ground          at

          about          2.35    pm    (1435).              As     we     approached                     the     Leppings            Ln       e n t r a n ce       I saw

          joined          the    crowd          to    the     right          and went                   through          the    outer          i r on gates,

          Just       as    we    got        t h r o u g h jevte}rt t h e r e w a s                  one    policeman             who          t r i e d to         close

          the       iron       gates        behijya         us.         He was h a v i n g                difficulty                trying          to   keep

          them       closed.           tTh^'re a p p e a r e d            to      be       a    large          crowd          still       outside             the

          iron       gate       pushing          against           it     and       the         policeman                was    unable           to      hold       them

          closed.              There       were       very       few      policemen                     about.           We    we?re      very        tightly

          packed          and    I got          pushed        over        to      the          right       towards             the       river.           During

          the       time       I was       in    the        crowd I saw                about             four       mounted          police

          officers,             two    of       them        were        by     the ri ver                 behind         the    turnstile                area       and

          the       other       two    were          outside          the      iron            gates,          although             one       did     come         in    to

          try       and    sort       out       the       crowd       but      it      was          hopeless             by    this       time.           He       was

          the       only       mounted          officer          in     the       crowd             and    was        shouting            at     everyone               to

          push       back       but    the       other        three          didn't             come        in      to    help.

          I was          stuck    in       this       crowd        until          around                £.30     pm      (1450)          or     just     after

          when       I noticed             that       people          ahead         of         us jrflTre m o v i n g           and       I realised

  C_      that       a    side    exit          gate        w hich faces               j/Ke         river        had       been      opened.              I

          walked          towards          it    and        t h e r e wej?e         about               five     police         near           this gate

          telling          us    to    go       through          cut      no-one               asked       for        our      tickets.               I d o n ’t

          think          many    people          had       gone       through              this          gate       before          us    and        there         was

          no    mad       rush,       I was          suprised           how       we       were          able       to    just       walk        through.

          When       we    got    inside             the     ground          I wasn't                   sure     where         to    go.         Some         of    my

          mates          had    told       me    that        the      centre           section             of       the       terrace          at     this

          ground          gets    very          full       and     not       to     go         down       the       tunnel.              I saw        some

                 arguing       with          each       other.              One       of    them       was       saying,          " Y o u ’ re        letting

                 TheyC       was    one       policeman                standing             near       the       entrance             to    the       t u n n e l.            I

             \l/ the    tunnel.              As    I was          walking             along       the       tunnel           there         were       a    lot       of

                 people       in    there          but       I was          able       to       walk       fairly           freely         along          to    the       end

                 of    the    tunnel          where          the       fence          comes       into       the       middle.              It       then       began             to

                 get    packed          from       behind             and    I        worked          my way       over       to t h e          left

                 intending          to       try    and        make         my        way       right over             to    the wi ngs.

                 I worked          my    way       to    a     position               approx          M2    on    the        graph         shown          to    m e,      when

                 it    became       very          packed          and       tight          and    we       couldn't           move         of    our       own       accord

                 anymore.           It       was    about             2.55       pm     (1455)         at    this           time.

                 Gradually          over          the    next          two       or    three          minutes          the       teams          had       come       out

                 onto    the       pitch          and    the          pressure             became          more       and     more         intense             and       I was

                 forced       further             and    further             forward             until       I ended             up     somewhere               near

                 position          M6    on       the    graph          shown          to       me.        I had       my     arms         outstretched                   in

                 the    crowd,          originally                to    try       and       stop       myself          from       falling             over,          but          it

                 was    becoming             increasingly                   difficult             to       breathe           and I managed                     to pu ll

                 my    arms    in       front       of       my       chest           in a n     attempt              to    take the            pressure             off       my

                 chest.        It       was       about       2.58          pm    (1458)          and       I could           not       believe            the

                 intense       pressure,                it    was       very          frightening,                everyone              was      shouting                at

                 the    police          on    the       pitch          to    let       us       out    and       do    something.                    All       they       did

                 was    to    shout,          "Push          b a c k . 1'        I can          remember          seeing          a     policewoman                  and       a

                     We    were           both       wedged         up    against           a    crowd        bar r i e r .         I saw       the        m a t ch     kick-
         j
         iJ'         off    and        I just          thought,            " G o d , they          still        don't       realise,’ and                    I thought
        V&          ^we    were           all       go i ng    to    die.

                           had    stopped              shouting           myself          as     I knew         I just         had       to    keep        breathing.

                     It     seemed             forever         and       the     game       was       still        going       on    and       I could            see      more

                     and     more          people            clambering             over        the     front       perimeter             fence.             I must

                     have        been          stuck         like    this        for      about         15 m i n u t e s       until          the    pressure

                     started              to    ease         slightly           from      behind         me.        The     game         had    been         stopped

                     and     it       was       about         ten    minutes             after        this      before         I    could       move.

                     At    this        time,          t he    man     standing            to     my     l e f t , I had            described,              was

             "Vc*    slumped          over          the      crowd       b a r r i e r y/nd        he     was      all     blue.          7. k n e w       he     must      be

                     dead.            Myself           and     some       othtr / l o k e s arou n d me picked him up and passed

                     limp        and       we       all     picked        her       up    and     passed           her    over       the       crowd.             I then


        V            saw     a    lad          in    his      twenties           who      had     a middle            aged         man    in    his        arms       in

                TWENTY-NINTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                  TUESDAY, 27th JUNE, 1989

                        (MORNING       SESSION)


        MR. GOLDSACK:     Mr. Sanderson, please.

                  ANDREW SANDERSON Called

                  Examined by MR. GOLDSACK;

Q. Are you Andrew Sanderson? - A. Yes.

Q. A communications assistant employed by South Yorkshire
   Police? - A. That is correct.

Q. And on the 15th of April was it your responsibility to
   be present within the Hillsborough ground to assist with
   any communication problems? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. Did you visit the Police control room early that morning?
   - A. Yes, about just before 9 o'clock.

Q. What was the purpose of that visit? - A. We took some
   spare equipment up.

Q. Was that the spare Base Station? - A. Spare base station,
   battery in case of power supplyfailure and a couple of
   personal radios.

Q. Do you have in front of you West Midland volume 2? - A. Yes.

Q. Would you like to turn to 48, 49, 50 and have those
   available? They are the photos, of the Police control
   box. Having put that spare equipment in the room did you
   then go to was it the gymnasium area? - A. We went to
   the briefing first, yes.

Q. And then you had some responsibility, did you, with the
   issue of radios to certain personnel?- A. Well, on com­
   pletion of the briefing I went round to the gymnasium
   and just made myself available in case there were any
   queries or problems with the issue of the radios, yes.

Q. All right. Now, you had your own radio during the day?
   - A. That is correct.

Q. Was that with an ear piece? - A. It was, yes.

Q. How many ear pieces were available that day? - A. Cannot
   remember offhand.  I think there were about 30.

Q. Who was issuing them? - A. The personnel who worked in
   the inside perimeter or inside the ground as far as I am
   aware, yes.
                                              A. SANDERSON

Why did they have ear pieces? - A. Well, it helped them
being able to listen. The only equipment we have that
can help them listen to the radio messages inside the
ground. But the noise is so great with just a normal
radio it is virtually impossible.

So it was envisaged before the day, was it, that those
inside the ground would be unlikely to hear messages
unless they had an ear piece with the handset?- A. Yes,
I would say that, yes.

Was that based on previous experience at similar big
matches? - A. Yes, and other events as well with a great
amount of noise, yes.

Now, in the past had your experience simply been that
because of the noise individuals simply could not hear
the messages or that because of the amount of noise
the messages were breaking up? - A. Usually with the
great amount of noise it is impossible to hear the
radios, yes.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can you just help me about
the ear piece? It is one ear only, is it?- A. That is
right, sir. It is a little hanger, hangs over your ear.
It is a little inductor that just presses against the
eardrum there.

Is it the kind of thing which if anybody grabbed it can
do any harm to the wearer? - A. Oh, no. If it is pulled
it just comes away from the ears.  It is like clipped
together.

Are there other devices you could have? I mean, I suppose
you could have earphones, could you, for both ears, shut
out some more noise and get some more sound in?- A. Yes,
sir, there is the ear defender type receiver which actually
works like an ear defender, two cups over the ear with the
receiver noise inside.

Is there any disadvantage to that? - A. Well, it is rather
large. You would not be able to wear helmets or anything
with them.

Yes. You would not probably be able to hear anything you
wanted to hear other than the radio? - A. Well, that is
right, sir. You would not be able to hear anything going
on around you. You would only be able to hear the radio.

     MR. GOLDSACK:   Well now, a time came, Mr. Sanderson,
when you heard that the radio was breaking up? - A. That
is right, yes.

What time was that? - A. It would be just after 2 o'clock.

                                             A. SANDERSON

Q. And where were you then? - A. I was in the gymnasium.at
   the time.

Q. And by breaking up what do you actually mean? - A. It
   sounded at first, it was intermittent, it started at
   first, it was just, sort of, being clipped, the voices
   were being clipped off. My original thought was there
   had been some interference coming in. Apparently, I
   was not there last year, but they had some interference
   from a radio station last year and about the same time.

Q. Was the breaking up affecting both messages from control
   and messages to control?- A. It was coming from the control.
   Could not tell that at first but after listening to it for
   about five or six minutes I deduced that it was coming from
   the control room. That is when I started to make my way
   towards the control room, thinking there was a fault.

Q. Believing at first that it was interference from another
   radio, did you do anything at that stage?- A. No, because
   I was the other side any way so there was nothing I could
   have done any way.

Q. You say within a few minutes when it continued you made
   your way towards the Police control room? - A. That is
   right.

Q. What is your best estimate of the time you reached the
   Police control box?- A. It would be about half-past-2,
   just after half-past-2, because I remember walking round
   the inside perimeter of the fence with Mr. Beal and the
   players had just started coming out for a warm-up.

Q. By then was it possible to make sense of what was coming
   out over the radio?- A. Well, the messages were still being
   passed around but I was not really taking a great deal of
   notice of what was being said. I was just listening to
   the radio itself.  I know it sounds a bit double Dutch but.

Q. I think I follow. - A. Yes.

Q. At all events, once you got into the Police control room
   what was the first thing that you did? If it helps to
   identify it on the photographs, please do so? - A. Well,
   the first thing I did was to change the desk microphone.
   That is photograph No. 48, right in the centre. There is
   a blue desk microphone, what we call a tulip microphone.
   My first thoughts were that this could be breaking up, so
   I changed that for a small black telephone type handset.

Q. That just plugs in, does it? - A. Yes, it just plugs into
   the front of the; set.

Q. So you unplugged that and plugged a different one in?
   - A. Plugged a different one in.

                                                   A. SANDERSON

Q. Any difference? - A. No. The fault continued.   So I thought
   then that there could be a problem with the fixed equipment,
   so then I connected up the emergency set which was placed
   underneath the bench.

Q. Now, were you aware prior to doing that that the lead from
   the stand-by equipment was not long enough to reach the
   desk? - A. Well, no, not really thought about that, not if
   they were going to use it as a handset, but in the situation
   where they have it, switch to talk-through, it is irr­
   elevant any way. They would not need it.

Q. Having changed from the original to the reserve base
   station was there any improvement? - A. As far as I know,
   yes. They seemed quite happy with it. They tried it out
   and it was all working fine.

Q. When you say it was working fin^ do you mean that the radio
   messages were not breaking up then? - A. That is right.
   What they were using, they did not use the handset on the
   emergency set, they used a Motorola personal radio which
   they sat on top of the desk acting in the same way as the
   tulip microphone so they would be able to pick it up, use
   it on the desk. They started using that.   It was working
   fine. There were no problems then. They were quite happy
   with it.

Q. For how long did you remain in the Police control room?
   - A. After connecting it up, do you mean?

Q. Yes. - A. Yes. Not long.   About five minutes, probably
   not even that long.

Q. Did you then make your way back   to the gymnasium? - A. No.
   I informed them that I would be   staying available in case
   the fault came again, so I just   went down the bottom of
   the stairs and stayedunderneath    the control room.

Q. And were you continuing to listen in on your own radio?
   - A. That is right, yes.

Q. This would be - what - about 20-to-3?- A. About 10-to-3.

Q. Did you hear the messages coming over the radio?- A. Yes,
   I could hear messages being passed, yes.

Q. Was there any difficulty in hearing them from where you
   were? - A. No.

Q. That is both messages in and messages out? - A. Yes. I
   could not, like I said before, I am not really taking a
   great deal of notice of what was being said.  I was just
   listening to make sure that that problem especially did
   not occur again, the breaking up, so I was just listening

                                                  P. HOPSON


Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Do you know anything about the
     Tannoy system that was in operation that day, or did you have
     anything to do with that? - A . No, it was nothing to do with
     me.

Q. Mr. Sanderson would you wait a moment.  There may be another
   question.  If you would just wait a moment.

                POLICE CONSTABLE PHILIP HOPSON Called

                      Examined bv MR. PHILLIPS:

Q. You are Police Constable Philip Hooson?    Is that right? - A.
   That is correct, sir.

Q. There are one or two matters out of your statement I want to
   ask you about, mr. Hooson.  You were on duty at the match, and
   part of your duty was to go to the Midland Station, was it
   not? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. With a serial of other Pfficers to meet supporters off the
   trains? - A. That is correct.

Q. These would be the ordinary service trains at the Midland
   Station, and they were supporters from both Liverpool and
   Nottingham Forest? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. When the supporters came off the trains at the station did you
   and the rest of your serial have some method of searching and
   filtering the fans? - A. We did, sir, yes.

Q. What did you do with regard to the football supporters? How
   did you filter them? - A. What do you mean? How, physically
   or how did the arrangement work?

Q. Yes. - A. How would you like me to explain it to you?    What I
   am trying to say is when they arrived at the exit it was like
   a matter of depending on the identification with whatever
   scarf they were wearing or what ticket they had on them.   The
   Nottingham Forest went down to the bottom end of the train
   station and the Liverpool fans went to the top side.

Q. So you separated them into two groups effectively at the
   ticket barrier? - A. More or less, yes, sir.

Q. When you got them into the appropriate group what did you
   do? Did you search each one? - A. No.  My serial did not
   search each one.

Q.        LPRD JUSTICE TAYLPR:    How did you get them into the same
     group?   I can see it if they are obviously wearing colours of
     the club, but otherwise what do you do? Liverpool on the
     left, Nottingham on the right? How did you separate them off?
     - A.   That is basically it, sir.  British Transport Police,
     they have all the information as regards what trains what fans
     were using and which platform they were going to arrive at,
     and they basically did the segregation prior to them arriving
                                15

                                                     P . HOOSON


        to us.  We just continued it, ensuring that the Nottingham
        Forest fans went down to their collection point and the
        Liverpool fans went to theirs, basically speaking.

q   .        MR. PHILLIPS:    So the Liverpool trains and the
        Nottingham trains arrived at different times, did they? - A.
        As far as I am aware.

Q. And you would get a batch of supporters all from the Liverpool
   train and another batch from the Nottingham train? - A. That
   is right, sir.

Q. Were you concerned to know whether the people who came through
   the barriers had tickets for the match? - A. What we did, when
   they came through and if we had identified them as football
   supporters, we asked them where they were going.  Our
   instructions were not to allow them into the city centre.   So
   we searched them for a ticket, and if they had a ticket,
   dependent whether they came from Liverpool or Nottingham,
   determined which end of the platform we sent them to.

Q. You say you searched them for a ticket.  Does that mean you
   searched everyone who appeared to be a football supporter for
   a ticket? - A. Basically, yes, sir.

Q.           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That really means that those who
        came without tickets had the advantage of going into the town
        that those who came with tickets did not have? - A. That is
        it, basically, sir.

Q.           MR. PHILLIPS:    And it was only those with tickets you
        sent along to the buses that were going to the ground? - A.
        That is  it, sir.  As far as I can remember, yes.

Q. So if a person had said to you he was going to the match but
   had not  got a ticket with him you would not let him get on the
   bus? - A. If a person what, sir?

Q. Said that he was going to the football match but did not have
   a ticket with him when you searched him, you would not let him
   go to the appropriate bus to go to the ground? - A. I don't
   know, sir.  I did not particularly come across that problem
   that I can remember.

Q.      All of those who came.... - A. As far   as I can recollect, yes.

Q.       Then I think you and your serial went off to the ground after
        you had finished dealing with the arrival of supporters at the
        station? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. And the bus you went on travelled along Middlewood Road, past
   Hillsborough Park and down Leppings Lane from the Catch Bar
   Lane end? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. I think you had a journey along Leppings Lane.   What time
   would it be when you were going down Leppings Lane? - A.
   Roughly speaking it would be 20-to-3, quarter-to-3, roughly.
                                 16


                                                      P . HOOSON



Q. About quarter-to-3? - A. Roughly speaking, yes.

Q. And how was your journey down Leppings Lane? - A. it was very
   slow because there were quite a lot of people down there.

Q. What sort of bus was it you were in? - A. A double decker.

Q. A South Yorkshire Transport bus? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. Had that bus been held up at the Catch Bar Lane end for any
   time? - A. What do you mean by the Catch Bar Lane end?

Q. At the Catch Bar Lane end of Leppings Lane.   We have heard
   some evidence that there was a line of three buses held up by
   a Police serial, and was eventually let down Leppings Lane? -
   A. It did stop, sir, but the exact location Iam not sure.
   It was in Leppings Lane.

Q. Had you previously attended at football Semi-Finals at this
   ground? - A. Yes, one or two over the years.

Q. How did you consider the people in Leppings Lane?

             MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, I do apologise for rising and
        interrupting, but it is in relation to Mr. Sanderson.   The
        purpose of calling him first this morning is that his
        attendance is required urgently elsewhere in relation to some
        matters that are happening in Barnsley.  Might he be released.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      I was about to take an opportunity
        of saying t h a t ,because I have found what I wanted, which was
        something which confirmed    what he had to say.   So I don't
        think I need to ask him anything further about it.

             MR. WOODWARD:   He will be available should later
        information be required from him, but his attendance is
        required urgently elsewhere, sir.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Yes, he is free to go.

q   .        MR. PHILLIPS:   Did the situation in Leppings Lane seem
        to you to be unusual? - A. It did inasmuch that there were
        quite a lot of people there which I thought for that time of
        day.

Q.       And your bus had some trouble getting down Leppings Lane, did
        it? - A. We did, sir.   We had to travel very slowly.

Q. Were      the fans out on the road then as well as on the pavement?
   - A.      From the Leppings Lane they were both sides, but in the
   main      at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, but they were walking
   down      the road towards the turnstiles.

Q.       I think you went to the gymnasium as you were expected to do
        and got there at about 5-minutes-to-3? - A. That would be
        approximately.

                                                     P. HOOSON



Q. And you were to be kept in reserve in the gymnasium? - A. That
   is right, sir.

Q. For further duties if required.  You then got orders to go to
   the Leppings Lane stand? - A. To the West Stand, yes, sir.

Q. And did you go in fact on the pitch side or at the back of the
   North Stand? - A. We went on the pitch side, sir, on the
   track.

Q. What did you see as you were walking towards the stand? - A.
   As I was walking up towards it I saw the ground was full, and
   we neared the West Stand I could see that the West Stand was
   quite full, but the section to the right as you walk towards
   it did not seem quite as full.

Q. When talking about the West Stand I think we should say the
   terraces, the Leppings Lane terraces, rather than the Stand.
   The section to the extreme right you say was not very full? -
   A. It did not appear to be so.

Q.      Where did you see the biggest concentration ofpeople? -  A.
        The most of the stadium appeared full, but to direct it
        straight at the Leppings Lane end, the full face of the
        Leppings Lane end seemed to be quite full, as far as I saw it.

Q.      Did you come to gate 4? - A. I did, sir, yes.

Q.      Was that gate open or closed when you got there?   -A. It   was
        closed, sir.

Q. What did you see.

             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Have you the time when this was
        going on?

q   .        MR. PHILLIPS:   What time was it when you got to or were
        approaching gate 4? - A. I would not be quite sure to give you
        an exact time.  As far as i can remember it was before 3
        o'clock, before the kick-off, because the players were warming
        up on the pitch as we walked into the stadium.

Q. Did you see anything that happened on the pitch after you got
   to the Leppings Lane terraces? - A. On the pitch, sir?

Q.      Yes? - A. No, not on the pitch.

Q.       You don't know whether the game had started or how long    it
        went on? - A. Absolutely no idea, sir.

Q.      You say gate 4 was closed? - A. That is right, sir.

Q.       What did you see in pen 4? - A. I saw that there wasquite a
        number of people crushed up to the fencing.    They seemed to be
        in quite a desperate situation.

                                                  P. HOOSON


Q. That, of course, would be the first of the two centre pens you
   came to? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. Were there other Officers on duty outside pen 4? - A. As I
   walked on the track as I can remember there were three Police
   Officers standing on the track.

Q. Were they conscious or appear to be conscious of what was
   going on in pen 4? - A. I can't say, sir.  I really don't
   know.

Q.    Were they looking towards pen 4 or out towards the pitch? - A.
     As far as I can remember they were not looking towards the
     pitch.

Q. When you got to pen 4 you found the gate closed, you saw
   people crushed up against the fence.  Did you take the
   opportunity of looking along towards pen 3? -A. Not that I can
   remembeir, sir.

Q. You can't say whether No. 3 gate was open or not? - A. What I
   can say to you, when I walked on that track towards pen 4
   there were no gates open.

Q. None at all? - A. None at all, sir.

Q.   Were there spectators on the perimeter track? - A. no, sir.

Q.   None at all? - A. None at all, sir.

Q.    What did you do then when you saw what you did see in pen 4? -
     A. What I did, I realised there was something desperately
     wrong, and of course understanding that the orders are that
     nobody goes on to the track, I had to decide to open the gate.
     I told the Police Officer there - I have no idea who he is -
     to inform the control room that we will need some assistance
     and we would open the gate, and then I went and opened the
     gate.

Q. I think you debated a bit with yourself, did you, before doing
   so? - A. I think so, sir, yes.

Q. And we have the views or the thoughts you had in your
   statement? - A. That is right, sir.

O-        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   What was the thought? - A. I
     think, "If I'm wrong I'm going to get a right bollocking for
     this".

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   That tends to suggest that you had had it
     clearly drummed into you not to open these gates.  Is that
     right? - A. It is, sir.  Over the years of attending football
     matches the practice is that nobody goes on to the track
     except in exceptional circumstances, i.e. they are under
     arrest or they are ill or in the wrong part of the football
     stadium and consequently would be escorted to where they
     wanted to go or taken to the Police room or whatever.

     Basically they are not allowed freedom of movement on to the
     pitch.

Q. Was that something that had been told to you that very day or
   something you had heard previously? - A. It is something that
   you know which is drummed into you, as you suggested, over the
   years. It is not something I was aware of being told on that
   day.  It is just something I know as a Police Officer.

Q. The person you spoke to you say he had a radio - did he have a
   radio? - A. He did, sir, yes.

Q. Did he appear to give the message you wanted him to give? - A.
   I don't know, sir.  I did not necessarily wait for him.

Q. We   heard evidence from a Constable Illingworth who said that
   he   was the one who opened gate 4. Could you comment on tha t .
   Do   you know him? - A. I have no idea, sir.  I don't know who
   he   is.

Q.    He would have been in position already before you arrived? -
     A. I have no idea, sir.  I don't know who he is.

Q.   You did open the gate, did you? - A. I did, sir,   yes.

Q.   What did you do? What was the effect of opening the gate? -
     A. I opened the gate and the people who were behind did not
     move.  They were squashed and crushed, so much so that they
     could not move.

Q. They could not get out through the gateway? - A. That is
   right, sir.




                                  /Q. When you opened the gate.
                                                   P. HOOSON

Q. When you opened the gate did you have any difficulty
   opening it? - A. No, I had no difficulty.

Q. It did not spring open?- A. I mean, not that I can
   remember.  I just grabbed the gate, opened the gate,
   pulled it open and that is it. Whether there was any
   pressure behind it or not I did not recognise it as
   such.

Q. Were you able to get any of the people out of the pen?
   - A. Yes.

Q. And did that seem to do any good? - A. Well, as soon as you
   pulled one out there was another one to take their placet. .
   It did not matter - it seemed at the time, initially, no
   matter how many you pulled out, and each one took a great
   deal of effort, there was another one to take their place.

Q. The people you pulled out, did they appear to be to you
   either injured or in physical distress? - A. Oh, yes, sir,
   they were very distressed.

Q. Did they appear to be injured? - A. There were some app­
   eared to be injured.

Q. The ones you took out were able to walk out once you had
   extracted them from the gateway, were they? - A/i Yes.
   Some ran off.

Q. Some ran off.   You of course had other Officers with you,
   did not you? - A. That is right, sir.

Q. How many of you altogether do you think there were trying
   to get people out? - A. Well, initially there would be
   myself, P.C. Akred.and Sergeant Swift, as far as I can
   remember. I was not taking particular notice at the time
   who was there. Of course, as time went by ....

Q*        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Sorry. There was yourself,
     P.C. Akred and .... - A .......Sergeant Swift, sir.

Q.Swift. - A. And consequently we were joined by other
   Officers as time went by.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   And you three, I suppose, would be all
     busily engaged at the gateway itself?- A. Initially, sir,
     yes.

Q. There would not really be much room for other Officers to
   help there, would there? - A. No, sir.

Q;        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Were you all part of the same
     serial? - A. That is correct.

Q.       MR. PHILLIPS:   Were other efforts being made to get
                                22



                                                          P. HOOSON

         people out of that pen that you were aware of? - A., As
         time went by, from what I can recollect, Police Officers
         were trying to pull the fencing down with their hands and
         drag people out as best they could.

    Q. You were not one of those? - A. No, sir.

    Q. You stayed at the gateway, did you, for some time? - A. I
       stayed there.

    Q. Can I just go back to one matter that I should have asked
       you about? When you got to the pen in the first place did
       you hear anything from the crowd itself? - A. Well,
       initially, it was just a lot of noise, a real lofcd of
       noise, that is not unusual for a match this size, you do
       not particularly take notice of, not knowing anything was
^      wrong at this time. But as I neared pen 4 it became
       apparent these people were shouting and screaming and
       they were screaming for help.

    Q.   For help? - A. That is right, sir.

    Q.   Can you remember anything that was said or is    it impossible?
         - A. It is difficult, sir. It is difficult.

    Q.   They clearly wanted to get out of where theywere? - A.
         Clearly.

    Q. And then I think you have given us in your statement some
       examples of particular people that you hfelped to get out
       of the pen.   I think there was one person with a broken
       arm, was there? - A. That is right, sir.

    Q.   This was a young boy? - A. About 16 I think he     was.

    Q. How did you manage to get him out? - A. He seemed to have
       managed to pull himself up above other people and he was
       shouting to us. We leaned over, just grabbed over and
       dragged him out.

    Q. When you say leaned over do you mean over the top of the
       fence or through the gateway? - A. No, through the gateway.
       Had to hold on to the side of the gate to grab hold of
       him ....

    Q. Were the people then in the gateway standing up or were
       they on the ground? - A. They were standing up, sir, well,
       in a fashion.  They were not erect, as such, but standing,
       sir.

    Q. From your position which was perhaps the closest into the
       pen that we have seen did you see any people on the ground?
       - A. There were some on the ground in front of the gate,
       sir.

                                                               P. HOOSON

    Q. In front of the gate?- A. Yes.

    Q.   They would of course be difficult to see when you were at
         first taking peopleout, would not they? - A. They would,
         sir, yes.

    Q.   Did you get to them eventually? - A.          We did, sir.

    Q.   Can you give us any idea how many people there were like
         that? - A. On the ground?

    Q.   Yes. - A. From what I can remember, probably four or five.

    Q.    Four or five. - A. Yes.        They were,   kind of, stuck at the
         gate.

    Q. Stuck at the gate. - A. On the floor, yes.

    Q. All in the close proximity of the gate? - A. At that time,
       yes, sir.

    Q.   Did you see any way in which the pressure on these people
         at the front could be relieved? -A. The only way I could
         see it at that time was to perhaps get a serial into the
         back of this stand to start pulling people out from the
         back to make the people at the front or near the front
         move back and relieve pressure ....

    Q.Did you do anything about that? -          A. From what I can
       remember, there was an Inspector          present but at the
       time everything was very confused         and I cannot remember
       who it was. No idea who it was.           And I asked him to get
       a serial in the back and do this.

    Q.    Yes. Were you able to observe from where you were any
         Officers getting into the back of the terrace? - A. Yes,
         sir.

    Q.    Did they go into the back of the terrace? - A. From what
         I can remember, they did go in the back end of the
         terrace eventually.

    Q.    And did that relieve some of the pressure that there was
         at the front? - A. Eventually it did, when theyhad to work
         their way through these people.

    Q. How long do you say it was really before the pressure was
       relieved sufficiently for people to get out under their own
       steam?- A. It is hard to say. Could be 20 minutes.

    Q. As long as 20 minutes? - A. It is hard to say, sir.              Could
       be totally incorrect on my estimation.

    Q. And that is starting from just before the match kicked off?
       - A. That is right, sir.
                                                    P. HOOSON

Yes. And then I think you went away from the gate and did
a lot to help those who hadbeen taken out on to the pitch?
- A. That is right, sir.

To see if you could assist, along with many other people?
- A. That is right, sir.

     MR. PHILLIPS:      Yes.     Thank you very much.

                Cross-examined by MR. HYTNER:

In view of the thoughts you had to yourself on the day I
can keep my questions very short.  The reason that you
thought you might get a bollocking if youmade a mistake
is that the whole of your training was to the effect that
those gates were meant for Police use, to get somebody out
who was under arrest or to allow a Policeman into the
terrace to make an arrest or do something of that sort.
- A. That is right, is it? - A. That is the basic under­
standing, sir.

Yes. The one thing you were never trained in relation
to the gates was that they might be for use to get fans
out who were under pressure through crowd trouble, through
crowd pressure?— A. Well, it is not a matter of training.
It is a matter of utilising what you have got at the time,
sir.

Common sense.     That is what     you did. - A. Yes.

It was not due to anything that       you had been taught? -A.
No, sir, it is common sense.

The next thing is this. Going back in time, if I may.
Coming up Leppings Lane from Catch Bar Lane you were in
a prime position to see the back of the crowd that was
pressing into the turnstile area? - A. That is right, sir.

You skirted the     back of that crowd?- A. That is right, sir.

And there were still people coming down and up Leppings Lane
to join that throng?   - A. That is right, sir.

And all you saw, the   impression that you had,   havingyour
bus skirting just the edge of that mob or press, was of a
press of people, a mass of people, simply trying to get
into a football ground?- A. That is basically it, sir.

Nothing more.     Nothing less? - A. That is it, sir.

And coming forward in time again, can you tell us because
it may be Important when you made your statement that we
are now going from?    Do you remember how soon   afterthe
incident?- A. It would be - the disaster happened on the

              Saturday, returned to work ©rathe Monday, returned on nights
              - it would be some time during that week.

           Q. You see, the importance is this, that many things that are said
               now about what the Police should have done it may be said,
               well, this is all with the benefit of hindsight.       It was
               at the very time of this tragedy that you appreciated that
               it was no good asking people at the front of the terrace
               to push back, you needed a serial at the back to pull
               people backwards at the back? - A. That is how I saw it.

           Q. You actually made^that suggestion to          a Superior Officer at
              the time? - A. That is correct, sir.

                     M R ..HYTNER:   Thank you.

                             Cross-examined by MR. JACKSON:

           Q. Two matters, Mr. Hooson.          Would you look at this photo­
              graph, please?

                     MR. JACKSON:    My Lord, it is not one that is before
              you:

           Q. Perhaps before I ask you questions would you hand it to
              My Lord, please? The questions I am going to ask concern
              the time, 14.59, the gates that are opened, 3, 4 and 5,
              and the observation   that you have as to therelative
              densities of pens 6 and 7 and pens 3 and 4.

                   MR. JACKSON:   This is the first witness, My Lord,
              who has come from that side of the ground. All the
              others have come .... Each of my friends has seen the
              photograph.

                   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:           Sorry.   This is the first
              witness who has come from?

                     MR. JACKSON:    Has    approached it that way round.

                     MR. COLLINS:    That is not correct.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         I do not think that is   right.

                   MR. COLLINS:- We have had about half-a-dozen            who
              came from that ....

                     MR. JACKSON:     Since I had the photograph.

                     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:         Since you had the photograph.

                     MR. COLLINS:     Oh, since you had the photograph.

            seen the photograph.

                MR. COLLINS:;      I have not.

                 MR. WOODWARD:      Thatis not right.         I have not seen it

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I will pass it to you in a
            moment, Mr. Woodward.  Is this, by any chance, one of a
            series that appeared in the Liverpool evening paper?

                 MR. JACKSON:      Yes.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I remember seeing.          Taken by a
            fan in the stand, is that right?

                 MR. JACKSON:   I understand it to be from the paper
            itself. There are a number of other amateur photographers.
            I understand this is the Liverpool evening paper.

                 LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:     Yes, I see.

                 MR. JACKSON:        Iam told it is The Echo.

                 LORD JUSTICETAYLOR:         That is an evening paper, is it

                 MR. JACKSON:    I understand so.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Was that on the Friday after?

                 MR. JACKSON:     Iam receiving, as it were, information
            from my side.  I have the sequence. This is the earliest.
            I apologise to those of my learned friends who have not
            seen it. I did think the ....

                 LORD JUSTICE      TAYLOR:     There is only one copy,isthere

                 MR. JACKSON:   At this stage there are negatives          and
            smaller copies available.

                 MR. COLLINS:      Does not appear to be timed.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        It is.   2.59.

                 MR.,COLLINS:      I did not see that./

                 MR. JACKSON:  Yes. As far as we can gather            the match
            kicked off some 25 seconds before 3 o'clock.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Just see the goalkeeper on the
            left edge.

       Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Hooson, I want to ask you three
            questions about that. You told us when you arrived that
            there weie no people on the track.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Sorry. Just forgive me a moment.
          Has everybody not seen it? I think it should go along the
          line just before you go any further. Then hope to get
          another copy.   (Photograph shown)   I do not think either
          of the Assessors have had a chance to see it yet either.

              MR. WOODWARD:   There is a timing on it, sir.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Yes.    If I remember there is     a
          whole series with the time on.

     Q.        MR. JACKSON:   Mr. Hooson, clearly, looking at things
          from different angles can give different impressions, but
          there we see a photograph that rather strikingly reveals
          the difference in density between the pens on the extreme
          right and the pens in the centre. Having seen what you
          saw, does that photograph reflect the difference that you
          perceived? - A. Basically ....

     Q. In fairness to all other witnesses, does that exaggerate
        that which you saw or does it reflect pretty accurately
        the difference between the two? - A. Well, when you are
        stood on the ground you are looking at it from different
        angles. You obviously get a different impression.

     Q. That is why I asked the question. - A. What I perceived
        when I approached the West Stand was simply that these
        side pens did not seem as full as the centre pens.

     Q. May I then move on to the next point?

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I just wonder whether, because
          we have seen something of the same on these photographs,
          looking at these photographs one wondered whether part
          of the visual effect may be due to shadow and sun on the
          front part and shadow further back but I am not sure.  I
          merely raise that point for consideration.

            Q.   You were the   first, so far as you recall           it,    to open any
                 gate?   A.     That's right, sir.

            Q. Can you help as to whether or not there was anybody by
               Gate 3 at that time or do you just not recall?   A.    When
               I got to ---   As far as I can remember, when I got to
               Gate 3 ---

            Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Gate 3?   A.   Gate 4, I am sorry .
                 P.C. Packer would be in front of me.   I understand that
                 he went to Gate 3.   I couldn't say whether it was open or
                 closed.

                      MR. WOODWARD:    It would seem, from what you have
                 described, by the time you got to Gate 4 Mr. Swift and
                 Mr. Packer had already gone ahead of you.    A.   No, sir.
                 P.C. Packer had.   Sergeant Swift was by this time behind
                 me and I was accomp anied by P.C. Akred.

            Q.   If we look at Photograph DB 17/14 in the South Yorkshire
                 Composite 2, there is a photograph fourth in the bundle
                 and in the background one can see the advertising hoardings
                 for Henry Boots and Howarth Timber and a gate open - bottom
                 right foreground.   A.   That's right, sir.

            Q. And there are two Officers at least in that picture                  that
               can be seen to the right.     Is that Sergeant Swift?
               A.    That is Sergeant Swift.

            Q. Do you recognise       anybody else   there?      A.         And myself.

            Q. Which one is you, because ---  A.   I am bending                  down,    sir.
               My hair was slightly longer than it is now.

            Q.   You are bending     down?   A.      I am bending down at that            point,
                 there.

            Q•        LORD JUSTICE    TAYLOR:     Just in front        of the    figure    in
                 the corner?    A.      That's right, sir.

            Q*       MR. WOODWARD:     You recognise yoic'helmet, do you?
                 A.       No, sir. Sergeant Swift is the Sergeant with no hair.
                 That is Sergeant Swift.    But, yes, basically I recognise
                 my hair.    It was quite a bit longer than    it is now.

            Q.   To his left or to his right?         A.      I am at his right.

            Q.   It may be you have got a slightly different print from
                 ours.     It is a different print from mine.       Yes, your hair
                 is    longer.    So you were then occupied in dealing with
                 people at that gate throughout that time?       A.     That's
                 right, sir.

            Q.   You are quite sure that it was you that opened                the gate,
                 are you?   A.   I am absolutely positive, sir.

            Q.   Mr. Illingworth has given his evidence and he has a recollection
                 too about what he did.   A.   Whether he opened that gate
                                                P. HOOSON


prior    to my arrival   and   did what he did --

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    That is what       I was going to         ask
you.      A.   I can't say, sir.

You were walking round the pitch, I take it, along the                front
of the North Stand?   A.   That's correct, my Lord.

Can you say whether there were any people being s hepherded
along the front as you were doing that?   A.   I can't
recollect.

But by the time you got to the track in front of the West
terrace, there were not spectators out on the track?
          sir, not at that stage.   Whether this has happened
prior to me going there, I can't say.   I can only say what
happened when I got there.

      MR. WOODWARD:  But it is likely, is it not, if as you
walked along the front of the North Stand to go to the West
Stand you had seen a gate in the perimeter fence open and
a number of people come out, that is something you would
have remarked upon because of your training?   A.   That's
right, sir.

And if it had happened before your eyes,           you are likely         to
have remembered it.   A.   Yes, sir.

     MR. HYTNER:   Sir, may I just say, before we go further,
there seems to be a lot of difficulty encountered by people
in relation to this.  Can I just say there has, of course,
also been evidence from Mr. Grobbelaar ---

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have        it in mind.        In fact,
I was about to ask a question.

     MR. HYTNER:        Mr. Collins at some stage indicated that
he might be actually going to submit that Mr. Grobbelaar
was wrong.   Can I just say so there is no mystery so far
as Mr. Woodward is concerned that I shall be making submissions
based on the p r o p o sition that the evidence seems to suggest
that Gate 4 at any rate was opened and shut, opened and shut,
and that is consistent with all witnesses and it is also
consistent with the evidence that we have heard very little
of, for obvious reasons, that some fans were actually pushed
back into the terraces once they had got out of the gate
on to the pitch.

     LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:       Well,   Mr.   Hytner,    this   is an
address.

     MR. HYTNER:   No, it is not an address.                I am simply
indicating what line I am taking in fairness              to Mr. Woodward
so he can meet it in questions.

       MR. COLLINS:   Sir,     I do not think I ever sought          to say
Mr.   Grobbelaar was wrong     except as to his timings.

                                                            P.   HOOSON


          LORD JUSTICE   TAYLOR:        The question       I was    going to put
     to this witness:

Q.   You say, as I understand it, from the time that you opened
     Gate 4, it remained open for at any rate 20 minutes or so
     whilst you were getting people out, is that right?
     A.   That is correct.

Q.   Not shut at all   in that time?           A.    Not shut at all.

Q.   So if it was opened at all other than by you it must have
     been opened before you got to the front of the track, is
     that right?   A.   That is correct.

Q. Was there ever a stage when fans were coming out as if
   the top had been taken off a Coca-Cola bottle?   A.    No,


Q.   You were having   to peel   them out?          A.     We were having         to
     prize them out.

Q. Did that continue right through or did there come a stage
   at which the pressure being relieved, people were walking
   out?   A.   Later on, sir, but we still had to pull them
   out.

Q.   By that time the players were well off the pitch,                 I imagine?
     A.   I cannot remember.   No idea.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Yes,    thank    you.      Well,   no
     bollocking!   Thanks.

                          GARY CAMMOCK,         called

                       Examined       by MR.   PHILLIPS:

Q.   Constable Gary Cammock,     is that right?            A.      That is
     correct, y e s .

Q.   You, I think, were on the serial which went to the
     railway station at Wadsley Bridge, is that right?
     A.   That's correct, yes.   One of the two serials.

Q.   You were there for some     considerable        time waiting      for the
     train to come in?   A.       Yes.

Q.   When it finally did come in, just before 2 o'clock, you
     went with the people on the train down to Leppings Lane.
     A.   T h a t 's t r u e , y e s .

Q. What time did you get to Leppings Lane?   A.   I don't
   know, ten minutes, quarter of an hour after we had left                        the
   station, I suppose.

Q.   Once you had arrived at Leppings Lane with the people                      from
     the train, did you remain on duty in that vicinity?
     A.   Yes, I did.
                                          G. CAMMOCK


Did you find, as you stayed there, that the crowd of people
converging upon the turnstiles became greater?   A.   It
certainly did, yes.

When did you think it got to an uncomfortable state?
A•   I couldn't say a time because I was just too busy
to look at my watch.    I don't know, half an hour after
we had got there.    I don't know.

Did you notice people   having any particular   difficulty?
A.   Yes, I did.

What was that?   A.   Where I positioned myself was beside
where the seating turnstiles were for the North Stand.

That is Nos. 1-8, nearest to the sweet-shop?    A.   Yes,
that's it, and the crowd was just getting crushed.    People
were   pushing from the back. They were just getting     squashed.

Did the people that you saw and spoke to have any d i fficulty
in knowing where to go?   A.   Prior to me moving to that
position, yes, I had been stood in the centre where ---     A
little bit further out than that, actually, nearer to where
the road is.

     LORD    JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Outside the gates?    A. Yes,
sir.   A    little bit further, where the causeway edge is there
and I had    been stood there in the crowd and people were
coming up    and asking directions and showing tickets, "Where
does this    go?   Where does that go?"

     MR. PHILLIPS:   What was the problem then?        A.   Basically,
they didn't know where they were going.

Did you think that the sign-posts outside the turnstiles       were
visible enough?   A.   No, definitely not.

You then went to the point you have described inside the
perimeter gates, is that right?   A.   Yes, I went in and
actually went to where the sweet-shop wall is and I stood
with my back to the sweet-shop wall.

And people were getting   to be crushed   and distressed?
A.   Yes.

Was there anything you could do about it?     A.   Well, I
mean, in p a rticular cases, like youngsters, they were just
totally disappearing between adults and getting crushed -
I was pulling them out, and one particular lady who was
crushed with her head facing towards me sideways and
she was, "I am fainting" type of thing - PHelp me, I'm
fainting" so I actually had to reach into the crowd,
get hold of her coat, make a space with my foot and drag
her out towards me, just holding her to me until she actually
came round.

Was there a time when you got two young lads into the ground,
one of them in a w h e e l chair? A. Yes, that was just after
c

                                       37

                                                                   G.     CAMOCK


         I had finished with the directions,              before        I moved     to the
         s weet-shop again.

    Q.    Was the crowd at that stage very packed?                      A.     It was
         building up, yes.

    Q. How did you get this boy in a wheelchair into the ground?
       A.   Basically, I followed a rather large  colleague of mine.
       He barged his way through.   We went by the sweet-shop wall
       and made a path through there.

    Q.   To the big gate?        A.    The concertina gate,                  yes.

    Q. Gate A.       A.     I don 't know.

    Q. Well, yes, it is Gate A, in fact.   Was that gate opened
       for you?    A.  No.   Well, it was after we banged on the
       gate - a little window in the gate - and the stewards
       opened it.

    Q.   For this boy and the one in the wheelchair to go through?
         A.   Well, they were the lad in the wheelchair and the boy
         who was pushing him round.

    Q.   And then it was    closed    again, was   it?        A.             Straight
         away, yes.

    Q.   Now,   it was opened later on, was        it not?              A.      It was, yes.

    Q.   When the crush     got quite severe.            A.        Yes.

    Q.   Can you tell us, please, how the Gate A came to be opened
         later on?   A.    Well, after I had finished pulling the
         lady out I have just mentioned, and one or two other people,
         and people were literally asking for help - asking me for
         help - and one gentleman came out and he was ashen and his
         eyes were, like, staring.   He was frightened and he was a
         fully grown man.   He said something to the effect of, "Fuck
         that" sort of thing, "I am going" and he just went out.
         He was half way down the queue and he walked out.      We got
         him out on to the forecourt and he went and stood onthe      road.
         He went out of the crush.    And obviously things were getting
         pretty bad.    We were getting actually squashed against the
         sweet-shop wall ourselves.

    Q.    When you say "ourselves" were there    other Officers with                     you?
         A.    Yes,   there was P.C. Ramsden, I believe.

    Q.   What did you do?   A.   Basically,              I used my initiative
         and I tried to call Ground Control              on my radio.

    Q.   Did    you get any joy?      A.     No.

    Q.   Why    was that?   A.     I just didn't get a reply.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: What time do you think     that
         was?    A.   I have just no idea, my Lord.    I just lose
         track of time totally.

      Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   Can you say what message it was
           that you gave?   A.    Well, I actually asked ---   I
           passed my number, I said "2910 to Ground Control" and I
           said that three times.    No response.   And then I saw
           Superintendent Marshall.

      Q.   Where was he?   A.   Do you want me to show you?   It
           is probably better if I show you on there.   (Demonstrated)
           There is a wall just there.  He was stood on the wall.

      Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    He was stood on the parapet,
           was he?    A.   Just on the top of the wall.   I could see
           him.

      Q.        MR.   PHILLIPS:        The parapet          of the bridge    over the
           river.      A.   Yes.

      Q.   At that time incide ntally was the Police Landrover parked
           outside the gates, did you notice?    A.   No, I have no
           idea.   I couldn't tell you.    There were Police horses
           there but I didn't see any Landrover.

      Q. Were you able to get to Mr. Marshall?   A.  Not easily.
         I had to use a bit of brute force and pig ignorance to
         get across the crowd but I got there.   I informed Mr.
         Marshall that the situation was bad and I asked him for
         his permission to open the concertina gate.   He said,
         "Yes, go on, Gary".   I turned round, made my way back
         and the gate was opened.

      Q.   So when you left him he had given you an                 instruction for
           you to open   Gate A?A.  Well, I asked                   his permission,
           rather than do it off my own bat.

      Q.   Of course,     and he said,      "Yes,    go on,     Gary".      A.      That's
           right.

      Q.   You went back.   Were you able to barge your way through
           the crowd?   A.    Yes, because the Police horses were
           round about at that time and I managed to skirt the back
           of the crowd a little bit and it was a little bit easier
           and made my way down.

      Q. Did you make your way back to where you had been before
         by the sweet-shop wall?   A.   That's right, I went down
         the side of the wall.

      Q.   Did you get     to Gate     A?    A.      Yes.

      Q.   Was it still    closed    when you got there?            A.       Yes.

      Q.   What did you do     then?        A.      Banged     on the gate.

      Q.   And what happened?        A.          The gate was opened.

      Q.   And did it then stay open?   A.   Well, at that time it
           wasn't wise to stay near the gate, as you appreciate,
           because of the crowd just all near -- from the turnstiles

               they moved left towards me, so I made my way away                   from   the
               gate for my own safety, basically, and went out.

          Q.   Were there other Police Officers on the   other side of the
               gate?   A.    I have no idea.   As soon as the gate was
               opened, I was looking after No. 1, I am afraid.

          Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I do not quite follow.   You
               banged on the gate, is that right?    A.   Yes, my Lord.

          Q.    It opened.    I do n o b suppose        you were       the   first to bang
               on the gate.    A.    Well, no.

          Q.   Did you communicate in any other way?   A.   At the top
               of my voice.   Basically the crowd were shouting that the
               gates ought to have been opened and people were actually
               getting hold of the concertina gate and shaking it like a
               leaf.

          Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   What did you tell the people on the
               other side of the gate?   A.   I d o n T t know exactly.

          Q.   At the top of your    voice?        A.        Just,    "Open it".

          Q. Did you tell them that you had instructions from the
             S uperintendent?  A.   I don't know if I said that.   I
             just said, "Open it before somebody is killed" or words to
             that effect.

          Q.   At that time it was opened?              A.     Yes.

                               Cross-e x a m i n e d    by MR.   HYTNER:

          Q.   The basic problem outside the ground was the number of
               people who were there trying to get in.   A.   That's right,
               sir .

          Q.   The position was being complicated a bit by some idiots
               who were at the back of the crowd pushing forward.
               A.  Unfortunately, yes.

          Q.   That is a fair way of putting it,              is it?         A.   Yes.

          Q.   You cannot always tell, of course - I am not excusing
               them, please do not think I am - you cannot, in fact,
               always tell when you are at the back of a crowd what is
               happening at the front of a crowd.          A.   Not a crowd
               like that.   I c o u l d n T t see what was happening at the front
               at a l l .

          Q.   You could not.   Just very briefly this, when you got on
               to the field after the tragedy, again the sitmtion was pretty
               chaotic at the beginnings was it not?   A.  Totally.
               Totally chaotic.

          Q.   And it was not really until Chief Superin t e n d e n t Nesbit
               came on the scene that a bit of order was introduced into
               the chaos?   A.   I think people had started -- Police Officers

                                                           G. CAMMOCK


     had used their own initiative                  ---

Q.   Yes, they had done it on their own initiative but as far
     as superior officers, it was Mr. Nesbit?   A.   He was
     the one I saw, yes.

                      C r o ss -examined           by MR.    JACKSON:

Q.   The railway station about 11 o'clock.   For various
     reasons, there were more Police Officers than were required
     and you had to wait until around 2 for the train to
     arrive?   A.   That's right, sir.

Q.   I want to ask you about the fans you spent your time talking
     to between 11 and 2.   They were walking away from the
     ground.   A.   Not all of them, no.

Q.   Some of them were.        A.        Yes,       some.

Q.   And you, with some time to spare, thought it very sensible
     to talk to them < _ you had fish and chips, I understand,
     with one family - talk to them and ask them to go back to
     the ground.   A.    Well, that particular family were on
     their way to the ground but others were going away.

Q.   Did you find a resistance            for people          to go to the ground
     shortly after 11?   A.               Yes.

Q.   Can you understand     why?              A.    Yes.

Q. We do know that it was asked of supporters to arrive in
   Sheffield very early, 11, 12 o'clock.   If they did, they
   did not always go to the ground.   Would you explain why
   you thought they did not want to go to the ground?
   A.  They probably felt it was too early, I d o n ’t know.

Q.   Would you be surprised that someone did not want to stand
     for about 5 hours on Leppings Lane terraces?   A.   I
     wouldn't be surprised at all, no.

Q.   Nor would   you expect anyone to be surprised?                     A.     No.

Q.   If anyone were to profess surprise that people were not
     all in the ground very early and standing all afternoon it
     would really be a nonsense, would it not?   A.   At 11 o'clock
     until 12, y e s .

Q.   Even half past    twelve.           A.         Yes.

              Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Mr. Cammack, may I ask you about the railway station.  You
were there early and you were there waiting for orders and
instructions in the event of being required? - A. That is
right.

You did not only stay at the railway station, I think a number
of you were called down by Mr. Marshall to go and attend to a
potential source of problem.   Is that right? - A. Across the
road at the Gateway Supermarket.

So you were in reserve in case of need in that area? - A. That
is right, sir.

And did in fact help.  On the question of the people who were
going to the ground and your experience, you have been to many
football matches before, have you, as a Police Officer? - A.
Oh, yes, sir.

On the question of tickets I think you said in your statement
there were quite a number of people who were looking for
tickets? - A. That is right, sir, yes.

And your words were, "It was apparent that lots of people, and
I mean lots, were looking for tickets”? - A. Yes.

That was something that impressed you, was it? - A. I was
asked at least three times personally if I had any tickets or
if I knew where any tickets were.

It has been put to you by Mr. Hytner that the base of the
problem at the turnstiles was first of all the number of
people that were there? - A. That is right, sir.

In your experience have you ever observed that sort of number
at that sort of time down at the turnstiles? - A. I have never
in all my life been in a crush like that, sir.

It was something quite outside your experience? - A.
Frightening.

You were asked that there may have been one or two people at
the back causing difficulty.  It was put to ,-you that there
were a few people there.  You describe I think the attitude of
a number of supporters in your statement? - A. yes, sir.

And whilst there was the crowd at the turnstile were there
other people coming into and pushing into the back of that
crowd? - A. Yes, sir.

Was what you saw deliberate activity and determined? - A. The
youngsters, some would be on the younger end as well, they
were just pushing in the back of the supporters waiting, and
they seemed to think it was a huge joke.

Yes.   I think you spoke in your statement of people just
                             42


                                                G. CAMMACK


     pushing into the backs and being bloody daft? - A. That is
     right, sir.

Q. Were these people pushing into the back causing surges in the
   crowd? - A. The were increasing the pressure on the rest of
   the crowd all the time, causing problems further down the
   line.

Q. You saw you saw individuals withdraw from the crowd? - A. That
   is right, and I had to withdraw them myself.

Q.   In your statement you made a reference to one man in
     particular who came out observing upon the sanity of    those who
     were there? - A. Yes, very explicit.

Q. Do you remember what he said? - A. He said something to the
   effect of "Fucking mad.  Fucking mad".

Q. From what you observed was he describing just the behaviour of
   one or two people? - A. I think he was commenting on the
   situation as a whole, because he was halfway down the queue.

Q. Did you observe a swelling in the crowd that occurred? - A.
   It was increasing all the time I was there.

Q.   With individuals coming to it, not simply joining the back    but
     forcing their way in? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And again was that just one or two people doing that or
     substantial numbers? - A. Large numbers all the time.

Q. You did what you could? - A. I did what I thought was right.

0.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I would like to understand what
     this pushing amounted to. Obviously people come to the back
     and pressing forward, that is one thing.  You are not
     suggesting they came rushing into the back like forwards
     arriving at a loose scrum in a rugby game, are you, and
     put their heads down and went? - A. Literally some people, the
     younger end, were just jumping into the backs of people
     queueing in front of them.  It was that bad they were singing
     and literally jumping into people with their arms up.   I
     literally lost my temper with two or three and told them in no
     uncertain circumstances to get themselves back.

Q-        MR. WOODWARD:   You see the point that is being made that
     those who were joining were .... - A. Not gentle pressure.

Q. Not just gentle pressure or gentlemen joining the crowd, but
   individuals who were as it were attacking the back of the
   crowd? - A. Or being stupid.

Q. For whatever reason. - A. Yes.

Q. And adding totally unnecessary pressure with considerable
   force, causing those ahead to be embarrassed or further
   embarrassed by the situation? - A. Yes, that is right.
                                           G. CAMMACK



And this was deliberate behaviour, may be out of foolishness
or stupidity, but it was deliberate? - A. I don't know if it
was deliberate on their part or if they just did not care, but
that is what happened.

They were heedless of the consequences? - A. I think that
is the best way to put i t , y e s .

Later on in your statement you talk of people pushing and
chanting, and individuals being just wild to get in? - A. That
is right.  That is the impression I gained.

Are you intending to describe determined behaviour by a number
of people? - A. Very determined.

                Re-Examined by MR. COLLINS:

Do I gather your impression was that the bulk of these people
behaving as Mr. Woodward has put to you were behaving like
that because they were being stupid? - A. The majority of
supporters there were reasonable, but there were t h e ....

I am concerned with the minority you have been talking about.
- A. The minority did not seem to have any reason.

Were you able to tell whether drink appeared to have played a
part in that? - A. You could smell drink from the crowd, but
basically you could not get near enough to the individuals
concerned because of the numbers to get the fumes, type of
thing.

Was it your impression that these people were trying to get
their own way into the crowd to get nearer the front in order
to queue barge, if there were a queue, if you see what I
mean, or was it just they saw this crowd and thought it was
funny to jump on the back? - A. It was both.

A combination? - A. Yes.  There were some just barging through
and being ignorant and others seemed to think it was a huge
joke and pushing at the back.

The ones with whom you lost your temper, those were some who
appeared to think it was a joke, were they? - A. Both, again.

What was their reaction when you told them in no uncertain
terms to stop? - A. I got the standard reply, basically.

Which is "Fuck off", something like that? - A. Yes, sir,
because they knew I could not get to them.

     MR. COLLINS:   Mr. Bownes, please.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Can I just say, Mr. Collins, and
of course a great deal of it is simply reciting the history
which we have been through of the documentation.

          MR. COLLINS:   Sir, the whole purpose of my going through
     the documentation was to avoid having to repeat it through
     witnesses.  I am mindful of that.  May I say for the benefit
     of the press what I propose to do is to treat Mr. B o wnes'
     statement as his evidence without requiring him to go through
     it in any detail at all.

          LORD   JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Shall I make it clear to the press
     that that   means in this case the statement they have, of which
     they have   a copy, is the evidence-in-chief, so they can quote
     any of it   they want to.

          MR. COLLINS:   The same of course applied to the Fire
     witness and to Dr. Eastwood as well.

Q.   Mr. Bownes, you have heard that, and I take it you will
     confirm the accuracy of the statement which you made? - A.
     Yes, sir.

Q. You are the Chief Licensing Officer of the Sheffield City
   Council? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. In the Administration and Legal Department? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   Mr. Bownes, football grounds are not the only licensing
     concern of the City Council.   Is that right? - A. That
     is right, sir, yes.

Q. You say in your statement that you have 33 different systems
   of licensing to administer? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Which range from taxis through sex shops, through.... - A.
   Cinemas, theatres, places of public entertainment and so on.

Q.   How many     people do you have to assist you in this licensing
     concern? - A. Five in addition to myself.

Q.   So there are six of you altogether? - A.      Yes.

Q. And if there have to be prosecutions for breaches of any of
  > the licensing requirements is that something your Department
    also handles? - A. Yes.

Q. So the six of you have to handle not only control, you also
   have to handle prosecutions? - A. Yes.

Q. Have you found it possible generally to cope? - A. Yes, in
   general terms.

Q. Does it mean you have to adopt a system of priorities? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. I am going to come to this later.      As you appreciate there has

         been on the face of it some degree of delay in attending to
         the Sheffield Wednesday football ground safety certificate? -
         A . Yes.

    Q. You, of course, come into the picture as a result of local
       government reorganisation which came into force in April 1986?
       - A . Yes.

    Q. And that meant you became the licensing authority in the place
       of the South Yorkshire County Council? - A. The City Council
       did, yes.

    Q. I say "you".  I mean the City Council.  When you realised you
       were going to have to take this over no doubt ....

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Just give me that date again?

              MR. COLLINS:   1st April 1986 is the change over day.
         The old Councils expired on 31st March and the new ones took
         over on 1st April:

    Q. Mr. Bownes, were there other licensing functions you took over
       from the old South Yorkshire apart from football grounds? - A.
       Not that the licensing section took over.  There were some
       others in relation to poisons and what have you that went to
       other Departments.

    Q. But your Department, this was the only extra matter that you
       took over as a result of local government reorganisation? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. You no doubt got from South Yorkshire the relevant files? - A.
       yes.

    Q.   And you familiarised yourself with those? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Did you go to Sheffield Wednesday ground? - A. Not in April
         1986, no.

    Q. When did you first go to the ground? - A. I believe that was
       later on that year.  The inspection was in August 1986.  I
       think there may have been a visit before that to deal with the
       Kop.

    Q. The other ground the City Council became concerned with was
       Sheffield United? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Were there any other grounds within the jurisdiction of   the
         city? - A. Yes, sir, Owlerton turned up in August 1986
         designated as a new stadium.

    Q. That had not then been designated when you took over, but it
       was thought it was about to be? - A. Yes.

    Q. But the two most important ones at the time you took over were
       Sheffield Wednesday and Sheffield United? - A. Yes.
                                46


                                                 D. BOWNES


Q. We know Sheffield Wednesday had a safety certificate which had
   been issued in 1979 and which had never been changed? - A.
   Yes.

Q. So far as Sheffield United was concerned did that have a
   safety certificate? - A. It did not.

Q. Is there a safety certificate in being for Sheffield United
   now? - A . N o , there is n o t .

Q. When was it designated?

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Has it been? - A. It has been
     designated, sir, yes. I d o n ’t know, sir.

Q. Is that a separate instrument? There was one especially for
   Hillsborough, I gather? - A. Yes, it was a separate one, a
   much later one, I think, owing to this question of moving up
   and down the Divisions.   I am not too sure when it was. I can
   find it out, though, sir.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   The result is Sheffield United has been
     operating without a safety certificate when it should have had
     one? - A. That is not quite right, sir.   Any designated ground
     can continue to operate as a sports ground provided an
     application has been submitted.   It is my understanding an
     application has been submitted for Sheffield United.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Can you let us know when that was
     done? - A. That can certainly be found out.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Anyway, had you ever been to Sheffield
     Wednesday, even as a paying customer or not? - A. No, sir.

Q. So the significance of whatever might have appeared in the
   safety certificate of itself would have meant nothing to you?
   Obviously when you read the files you could follow some of the
   history, but the details themselves meant very little? - A.
   The details of the safety certificate are reasonably clear,
   sir.   It does not require knowledge of the ground as such.

Q. I am sorry, I   am talking   about things like capacity and the
   layout of the   ground and   so on? - A. Obviously the layout of
   the ground is   a bit of a   closed book without the advantage of
   seeing it and   looking at   the plan.

Q. Did you, for example, appreciate on reading through the files
   that there had   been the creation of these pens on the West
   terraces? - A.   No, sir, it was    not immediately apparent to me.
   That is a very   detailed matter    which would require a great
   deal of research at the time.

Q. So you were not aware of the significance when you took over
   of those pens and their effect or potential effect on the
   capacities? - A. No, sir, not at all, that would be true.

Q. We know that the system under South Yorkshire had been via a

                                    47


                                                    D. BOWNES


         working party? - A. Yes.

    Q. Which had inspected bi-annually? - A. Yes, for part of its
       history.

    Q. And had reported back to the relevant subcommittee of the
       County Council?   It is not entirely clear precisely what its
       status was? - A. That is entirely right, sir.  I am not sure
       what its status was, actually.

    Q. And did you consider in any event that was something that was
       rather unsatisfactory? - A. I regarded it as a matter that
       perhaps needed clarifying somewhat, yes.

    Q. When you came into the picture you came in effectively with
       the memorandum at page 313 of the core bundle attached to a
       letter dated 5th June, with the report annexed to it, an
       earlier report.  Have you got page 133? - A. Yes, I have.

    Q. If we look at the first sentence we see that there is a
       reference to a report submitted to the March 1986 meeting,
       which of course was the meeting which was held prior to take
       over.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   As I have it in front of me I
         gather that Sheffield United was designated on 3rd July, 1984


    Q-         MR. COLLINS:   Which means, speaking from memory, it had
         then to put in an application for a certificate once it had
         been designated? - A. No, sir, I believe would have to put in
         an application immediately before it was designated.

    Q. That is right.  It was then up to the relevant licensing
       authority to decide on what were the particular terms required
       in any safety certificate? - A. Strictly, sir, to determine
       whether or not the applicant was a qualified person.

    Q. It has taken effectively therefore 5 years? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. And there is still no safety certificate? - A. That is right,
       sir.  I should explain that the County Council on its
       dissolution was about to issue a safety certificate for it
       pending the completion of certain works that the Fire Service
       required.  I understand those works were not completed by the
       time of the dissolution of the County Council.

    Q. We are not strictly concerned with Sheffield United.  Let us
       come back to Sheffield Wednesday.  Can I just ask you as a
       matter of introduction, and I am sorry this is not in our core
       bundle, but it is page 122 of your bundle, Mr. Bownes, because
       this is the March 1986 report, just in order to put the whole
       matter in context.  I say "your report", it is under Mr.
       Pensam's name but drafted by you? - A. Yes, sir, that is the
       normal practice.

    Q. I am not suggesting otherwise.    It is so we know it was you
                             48


                                                   D. BOWNES


     speaking, although Mr. Pensam adopted what you had said. - A.
     Yes, but I would not seek to transfer responsibility by that,
     sir.

Q. No, I fully understand that, as I am sure anyone who has any
   knowledge of local government also understands.  Really, what
   you are doing there is recording that the City Council will
   have to take over as a result of the legislation, and you
   refer to the Bradford disaster and the Popplewell Report, and
   indicate that a more detailed report will be submitted as soon
   as possible? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And really you recommend the delegations, that the General
   Purposes Panel should have the powers under the 1975 Act? - A.
   Yes.

Q.   And a further delegation of the Emergency Procedures and
     authorisation of officers under the relevant section? - A.
     Yes, sir.




                           /Q. So can we come on
                          49


                                                 D. BOWNES

Q. So can we come on, please, to the report at our page 313
   or your page 124, whichever you prefer? Now, you refer
   to the current situation which was inherited. You say two
   sports grounds currently subject. First, Sheffield
   Wednesday. Yes, if I bother to look I .... Sheffield
   Wednesday designated in August, 1978, certificate issued
   December, 1979, undergoing major x^orks to The Kop. And
   then you refer to Sheffield United and indicate that it
   was hoped that the Council would be in a position to
   issue a certificate before the start of the 86/87 season.
   Then you refer to Owlerton which is expected to be des­
   ignated. Can I ask you to look over the page, please,
   at the paragraph Safety certificate, standard conditions?
   You indicate the desirability of standardisation for
   obvious reasons. Then you say this, "The conditions do,
   however, give some cause for concern as they appear to be
   inadequate or inappropriate in some areas." Now, the only
   conditions or the only safety certificate that existed
   was of course Sheffield Wednesday's.   Is that right? - A.
   That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. And therefore the inadequacy and inappropriateness of the
   conditions in some areas must have referred, must it not,
   to Sheffield Wednesday, on the face of it? - A. It did,
   sir, yes.

Q. Can you help us, please, as to what conditions you consider
   to be either inadequate or inappropriate?- A. Yes.  I
   should explain, sir, first of all, that that phrase is
   what, if I may use one of Dr. Eastwood's comments, is a
   daft phrase, to be honest.  It was not carefully thought
   out by the look of it. In fact it is my view that there
   were no fatal errors in the conditions themselves.
   There were certain areas that needed tightening up.
   For example, it refers to the County Council throughout
   whereas it should of course now refer to the City Council.

Q. Well, yes, that is a fairly obvious one but that does not
   make much difference, does it? I think in the legislation
   there was a provision, was not there, an interim provision,
   which effectively provided that in any document where
   County Council appeared read relevant .... - A. Yes, sir.
   The point I was making was that is the sort of order of
   defect that there was in the certificate.

Q. _    LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Really one would not get that
   impression from this, not talking about .... - A. Yes, I
   agree with you entirely, sir. On looking at it again in
   the light of this Inquiry I would entirely agree the words
   are wrong ....

Q. So there was nothing that!gave cause for concern? - A.
   The conditions gave some cause for concern in that there
   were were drafting corrections that needed to be made.

                                                        D. BOWNES

     Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Was there anything of substance that
          you had identified that needed to be addressed? - A. Th(
                                                                 ere(
          was nothing, if you like, fatal in the conditions that I
          could see that needed to be addressed immediately.

     Q. If I had been asking you in May of 1986, Mr. Bownes, which
        conditions do you regard as inadequate and which do you
        regard as inappropriate what would you have told me? - A.
        Exactly what I have told you already, sir. As I have
        explained, the wording is inappropriate. There is no
        question about that.

     Q.Did anyone on the committee ask, as far as you are aware,
        which were the inadequacies and which were the .... - a !
        I cannot honestly recall, sir.  It is an awful long time.

     Q*        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If it is just a question of
          changing South Yorkshire to Sheffield City it would hardly
          merit, if you look further down, a redraft of conditions
          would of course be submitted to the Fire Service, the
          Police and building surveyor for ___ - A. I think in
          anticipating the redrafting, sir, I anticipated there may
          be changes that would be needed as well,simply to update
          things. Changes may have occurred at the ground that
          needed reflecting.

     Q-        MR* COLLINS:   Why? Were you aware on looking through
          the file that there were changes that had occurred which
          would need reconsideration of the certificate or was this
          just an assumption? - A. It was an assumption, sir.  I
          believe conditions that had been in operation for that long
          could well require review and people might well have
          changed their views as to the sort of things that needed
          addressing.

     Q. But if South Yorkshire had been doing its job pfoperly
        surely you would have expected it to pass on a note, or
        your opposite number in South Yorkshire to pass on a
        note, saying look, this needs to be dealt with or that
        needs to be dealt with?- A. Yes, sir.  I find with
        certificate conditions and what have you that people
        tend to take them as read for years without constructively
        looking at them to decide whether or not they ought to be
        changed. That is my experience with other conditions the
        Council has been involved in in licensing areas.

     Q. So what you are saying is your experience told you that
        it would be sensible to have a fresh look at these? - A.
        Yes, sir.

     Q. And you intended to mean no more than that when you used
        these words inadequate or inappropriate? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. Well, if that is right, Mr. Bownes,I think one is inclined
                           51


                                                  D. BOWNES

   to agree it was a daft expression to use. - A. It was, sir.
   I would fully support that. That is right.

Q. On the face of it, it goes a lot further than that, does not
   it? - A. Yes, sir, without question.

Q. Yes, I see. Did you have available a draft certificate
   for Sheffield United? — A. Yes, sir, Ii believe there was
   one copy on the Sheffield United file.

Q. Because you also refer to the redraft where appropriate
   and to submit to the panel for approval and then go on,
   "The Sheffield United certificate could then be issued
   with the new conditions before the start of the 86/87
   season." That rather suggests that you had spotted
   something other than mere drafting matters in the
   Sheffield United certificate which you thought ought
   to be brought up-to-date or changed?- A. No, I would
   not accept that necessarily, sir.  I must admit I have
   not read the Sheffield United certificate recently
   so I cannot really say what that comment referred to.

Q. I see. Now, over the page you refer to an attempt to
   get the Health and Safety Executive in the picture. - A.
   Yes.

Q. Was that in the hope that it would take the burden off
   the City Council and your shoulders?- A. Not at all, sir.
   It came from a recommendation in the Popplewell Report.

Q. I know it did but was your hope that if the Health and
   Safety could be persuaded to involve themselves this would
   mean that your department would not have to shoulder the
   responsibility? - A. I cannot see how that could happen, sir
   The Council is the certificating authority ....

Q. Well, I know. - A ..... and therefore carrys the can any way

Q. I see. So there was no hope of getting someone else to
   carry out some work that otherwise you might have to do?
   - A. I do not agree with the way you phrase that, sir, to
   be honest.  I would have hoped the Health and Safety
   Executive could have put a useful input into the Council's
   advisory system, if you like, for certificating.

Q. I follow. Now, one of the matters that I think you spptted
   when you received the safety certificate from the County
   Council was that the plans had not been signed, is that
   right, the plans ___ - A. No, sir.

Q. When you say "No, sir" you mean they had not been signed?
     A. No:j,,sir. I had not spotted anything about the plans,
   to be quite honest.         >;

Q. Can I ask you to look at paragraph 130 of your proof?   Do
                            52


                                                    D. BOWNES

     you see you refer in that paragraph first of all to
     sections of the Act and then you say under Schedule
     1 of the certificate the definition of plans is - we
     can see this at our page 107, I think - document or
     documents attached to and forming part of the general
     safety certificate and signed by the person signing
     the certificates When the files were handed over to
     the Sheffield City Council in April, 1986, a copy of
     the general safety certificate was in an envelope
     together with a number of plans none of which were
     signed by Mr. Mallett,the original signatory of the
     certificate.  This, do I understand from your answer
     you gave a moment ago, this is something you have
     spotted since? - A. Yes, sir, that is entirely correct.

Q. But you did not spot that at the time? - A. I did not,
   sir, no.

Q.    One thing that has not come out and I am looking at your
     paragraph 134 in the history so far is that it would
     appear that there were one or two amendments to the
     safety certificate which had not been incorporated in
     the certificate itself? - A. Yes, sir, those are a
     mystery to me.

Q. Again, is that a matter which you have discovered since
   this tragedy and you have been investigating for the
   purpose of giving evidence? - A. Yes, sir. As yocr will
   appreciate, for the benefit of the Inquiry, considerable
   work has gone into the files to extract all relevant
   information as far as possible.

Q.   Maybe slightly surprising, Mr. Bownes, that that had not
     been done in the last three or four years, three years,
     rather, since the City Council was considering what ought
     to be in the safety certificate? - A. Yes. The impression
     I had on taking over the administrative system was that
     everything was O.K., everybody was happy with what was
     going off essentially.

Q. Well, one thing that must have become perfectly - well, no,
   I will come to that later. Any way, there were apparently
   amendments to the conditions, details of which we have not
   seen, but they are somewhere on the file, are they, indic­
   ating wording amendments to conditions 10 and 26, wording
   amendments to 10 and a time limit variation on 26? - A.
   Yes, sir. They are not actually on this file, though
   they can be produced if required.

Q. You mean they were not even on the right file, they were
   on a different file? - A. No, sir. They are not in this
   file here.

Q. I follow.    I am not asking you to produce them. - A. No.
                                               D. BOWNES

You refer to them there, and I imagine they are not
enormously material or are they? - A. No, I do not
think they are, sir, no.

Just indicates a slight, if one may be forgiven to use
the word, sloppiness in approach to what goes into the
safety certificate? - A. That is a matter of speculation
as to what the County Council actually did ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Sorry. Would you speak up?
- A. Sorry.  It is a question of speculation there as to
what the County Council actually did and what they
intended by these alterations.  It is not possible to
pick that up from the file.

     MR. COLLINS:   Any way we know that there was a
meeting at the ground in August of 1986.  Is that right?
- A. The inspection, sir?

Inspection, yes. - A. Yes, sir.

And you attended that, did you? - A. I did, sir, yes.

And I think you told us you had been to the ground before
that? - A. Yes, sir.

Was that correct? The purpose of that inspection was
what, as you understood it?- A. It was one of the inspections
of the ground, the usual.ones the County Council used to
organise, sir.

Yes. And also was it, as you understood it, to view the new
works that had been completed at the Kop? - A. No,sir.

That was wholly separate, was it? - A. That was an entirely
separate issue.  If I could just mention, I had previously
been to Sheffield Wednesday on the 10th of July, 1986, to
discuss questions of the Kop.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   20th,of July? - A. No, sir.
The 10th of July.

Was that the first lvisit you ever made? - A. To the best
ofmy recollection, sir, yes.

10th of July, 1986. - A. Yes.

And the inspection you are now referring to was when?

     MR. COLLINS:   7th of August.

     THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir, I believe   it was.

     q    committee? - A^. . At that stage, sir, it was the working
          party still.

     Q. Still the working party? - A. Yes, sir.

     Q. And what was your intention about its composition and how
        it should work and its responsibilities? -A. I had formed
        no intention at that stage, sir. Formed a number of views,
        butlthe intention was at that stage it should operate as
        the old working party did.

     Q. Now, it would appear that the old working party had no
        chairman? - A. To be quite honest, sir, I have not really
        been able to establish how the old working party worked
        as such.

     Q. It does not matter how the old one worked. How did yours
        work when it started its operations ? - A. Well, sir, it
        started its operation strictly, if I may go back in history
        a while to a meeting that took place on Friday, the 4th of
        July, 1986. That was a meeting to discuss a letter from
        Dr. Eastwood, the 26th of June, relating to The Kop.   I
        recall that that letter included a number of plans, I
        believe, sir, and there were discussions about what was
        going to happen in relation to them.   Immediately prior
        to that meeting, sir, I formed the view I was going to
        follow exactly as far as I could what the old County
        Council had done, as far as I could understand it, in
        relation to preparing notes of meetings and so on and
        so forth. However, sir, I was struck at that time,
        within a few minutes of getting into the meeting, that
        there were; potentially serious problems with the Kop,
        particularly from the point of view of the;Fire Service.

     Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: It is very difficult to hear
          you.  I am sorry. Would you bring the microphone closer
          and try and speak a little louder? - A. Yes.

         Q.   Isthat the delegation that you are referring to?
              A.    That's quite right, sir.   I think Paragraph A on
              page 127 is the key one.

         Q.   That is the general powers and duties of the Council                           under
              the Act be delegated to the General Purposes Panel.

                     LORD JUSTICE        TAYLOR:        Page    127?

                     MR.   COLLINS:         122,   sir,    of the City Council bundle.

                   THE WITNESS:             I think we are perhaps looking at
              different reports.

         Q.       MR. COLLINS:     I am    sorry, which one are you after?
              A.  I am   looking at the May, 1986 report, sir, Re co mm en da ti on
(-— -j        A in the Conclusion.

         Q•       LORD       JUSTICE TAYLOR:            You are looking at page             127,
              are you?       A.    I am, sir,         yes.

         Q*        MR. COLLINS:   That is the a dm inistrative system
              organised by the County Council and continue it in being.
              A.  Yes, sir.

         Q.   But that does not deal, does it, with the powers of the
              Working Party to authorise any changes?   A.   I would
              take the view there that it did, sir.

         Q.   Since you did not know what the Working Partyfs powers were
              under the old system and you could not find out what they
              were, that seems hardly satisfactory, does it?   A.   It
              isn't entirely satisfactory, no, sir, I agree with that.

         Q.   It does look,       with respect,         Mr.    Bownes,     does   it not,    as
              if you may h a v e a c t e d u l t r a v i r e s ?      A.     That I wou ld have
              to t a k e a d v i c e on, s ir , I d o n ' t k n o w .

         Q.   I am not blaming you specifically because the matter was
              far from cleiar but it does look as if no-one had thought
              through the need to decide who was to give instructions and
              who was to authorise.    A.   It is a complex area, certainly,
              sir.

         Q. Was it appreciated how important the removal of this barrier
            might be?   A.    Sir, I was relying there on the experts
            who were present.

         Q.   I know you were but trying to think back to that meeting,
              did this seem to be something which was really rather routine
              or was it your impression, can you help, that there was a
              possibly important safety impact behind it?   A.   That is
              a difficult question, sir, going back that long, but a
              discussion certainly did take place.   Had anybody expressed
              reservations or requested me to do something, then I would
              have done, sir.

                                                    D. BOWNES
Q.   You see, one thing that it affected and considerably
     affected was the capacity of the pens.   A.   I have heard
     that suggested, sir, yes.

Q. Well, it has not only been suggested;        it is a fact if one
   looks at the Green Guide.  A.   Yes.          I think that is also
   a difficult question, sir.

Q.   Had you read the Green Guide before you took over your
     r es p on sibilities? A. I had looked at the Green Guide
     that was available at the time, sir, but the new one didn't
     come out until November, 1986, which was after this time.

Q.   The 1976 Guide is not really materially any different              in
     relation to this aspect, the c alculation of capacity.
     A.   No, sir, I believe it isn't.

Q. And you had obviously familiarised yourself with the
   provisions of the Green Guide.   A.    In broad terms, sir,
   yes, as far as I could understand them.    Obviously there
   were technical aspects there.

Q.   You saj^it help, no doubt,    from those who    did understand       them
     if you had any doubts.        A.   Yes.

Q.   One thing that must have struck you when you went to the
     ground for the first time and looked at Leppings Lane end
     for the first time was the existence of thesec pens.
     A.   I must admit, sir, not having been to a football ground
     before or realising how the operation actually worked,
     it didn't, sir, to be honest.

Q.    Did it not occur to you that it might not be a bad idea to
     get yourself briefed on the significance    of these pens?
     A.     Sir, you might as well say that I should have got
     myself briefed on all aspects of emergency planning, fire
     safety and so on, if you get my drift, sir.

Q. Well, Mr. Bownes, you were the person who was the delegate
   of the City Council who were responsible for issuing the
   Certificate and ultimately r esponsible for ensuring that
   the spectators of Sheffield Wednesday Football  Ground were
   safe.   A.   Yes,    sir, that is correct.

Q.    And that was a grave responsibility,    was     it not? A.        And
     it still is, sir, yes.

Q. We know and when you read the Certif ic at e you would have seen
   that the capacity on the terraces was global in the sense
   that it did not take account of the pens.      A.   That is quite
   right, sir, yes.

Q.   You apparently did not appreciate the s ig ni ficance         of
     that at the time.     A. I did not, sir,   no.

Q.   Did anyone at any   time as far as you can recall before this
     tragedy occurred indicate to you that there was any significance
     in the pens in relation to capacity?    A.     I believe it
                                    63
                                                  D. BOWNES
         would be true to say no,    sir.

    Q. Did anyone at any time indicate to you that it was i mpo rtant
       that there should be some form of control to ensure that fans
       spread evenly over the terrace rather than packing into the
       central pens?   A.   No-one indicated that to me at any
       stage, sir.

    Q.   So you were wholly unaware of the need for any system       of
         monitoring to ensure that there was even distribution       on
         those terraces?   A.   Yes, sir, that is true.

    Q. Were you aware at all of the importance of ensuring that
       there were suficient turnstiles to enable people to get
       through in a reasonable time?    A.   Sir, I think I ought
       to say at this stage that the Council cannot act i nd ependently
©      in exercising its role here.   It acts on the basis of advice
       from specials - from Fire Service, Police, Building Surveyor.
       It cannot subrogate the Club.   It cannot stand in its
       shoes, effectively.

    Q. What it boils down to, or seems to boil down to, is this,
       that the Council went on effectively in complete ignorance
       as to the s ig ni fican ce of any of the lay-out of the ground
       at the Leppings Lane end.       A.   Sir, in so far as the
       South Yorkshire County Council had recently ceased being
       a c er tificating authority, it seemed reasonable to me to
       take the view that the ground was reasonably safe at that stage.

    Q. Did you ask your opposite number, your p redecessor at South
       Yorkshire whether there were any matters which you ought
       to know about?   A.   I believe I did, sir, yes.

    Q.   And he told you nothing?   A.       He didn't highlight   any
         points that needed looking at,     sir.

    Q.   When we get to the meeting of 7th August,     can I ask you to
         look at page 341 of our bundle.    This is    the only note
         that exists as far'as we are aware of the     meeting of 7th
         August, 1986.    I expect you have seen it    before, have you
         not?   A.    I have had a brief look at it    before, sir, yes.

    Q.   And this is the note that deals with the removal of the
         barrier.   As I expect you would agree, unless you know
         that it is dealing with that, it is not entirely clear
         from the face of it that it is.   A.   No, sir.   It
         looks like some handwritten note that was done at the
         time, sir.

    Q.   It was made by Mr. Strange, I think, and there is also a
         note of the various matters that require to be dealt with,
         that needed to be repaired, as we can see from Nos. (3)
         onwards.   Do you see that?   A.    Yes, sir.

    Q.   Obviously matters which the Working Party had spotted that
         needed to be done.   A-   It looks like that, sir, yes.

                                             D. BOWNES
Q.   Unless you have some written record or write some letter
     to the Club,   how on earth can you know or be sure that they
     are going to   do what they are supposed to do in relatio n
     to repairs?     A.   Sir, I think I have already e xplained
     that I did make a note at the time.     I fully intended to
     deal with it but un fortunately it disappeared from the file.

Q.   One would have thought that you would write the sort of
     letter that we see later on, namely referring to the m e et in g
     and saying, "This, that and the other in the way of repairs
     must be done".   A.   Yes, sir, that should have been done.
     There is no argument about that as far as I am concerned.

     Of course, that could stand effectively as the minutes,
     could it not, in the sense that if you write a letter
     immediately following to indicate what was agreed, that
     will take the place to some extent of the minutes.
     A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   But you have got to have one or the other.       A.     Yes,   sir.
     I quite agree with you.

Q.   And sadly here you have got neither.       A.   Yes,   very sadly,
     sir. Yes.

Q.   Then we come on to the Kop because, of course, at this time
     too, as you have indicated, the Kop had been roofed and
     extended to some extent.   A.   Yes, sir.

Q.    C«n I ask you to look atpage 370 of our bundle, please,
     mr. Bownes.    You here confirm the Panel agreed to increase
     the capacity of the Kop to 21,000, subject to three
     conditions;   right?   A.   Yes, sir.

Q.   For some reason the Safety C ertificate was   never amended
     and never has been amended.      A.  No, sir, there was a
     defect in the procedure in relation to that in that no
     public a dv ertisement was made.

Q.   Exactly.   A.    I think    I refer to that in full in the
     statement.

Q.   You do and you seek to     excuse it by saying it got alot of
     publicity anyway, have     a look at the preceding page of our
     bundle, page 369.    A.      Sir, I think the statement is
     entirely clear;   there    is no attempt at excuse her.

Q.   I follow that.    A.      Sir,   you just said it was being    used
     as an excuse.

Q.   Well, it is being used as an excuse, with respect, Mr. Bownes,
     is it not?   You are saying that although the regulations
     were not followed, in fact everyone knew because it was well
     publicised.   A.   Sir, I have not used the word "excuse",
     it was not put as an excuse.  There is a clear admission
     that there was a mistake made, an oversight in not putting
     a press notice in.   The point of referring, I think, to
     the various bits of publicity which accompanied the
                                65
                                               D. BOWNES
     d evelopment of the Kop was to demonstrate really that had
     any interested persons wished to object or to make any
     comments at all, they would have been clearly put on
     notice by all this publicity.

Q.   The Safety C ertificate itself is a public document,     is
     it?    A.  I am not sure what a public document is,      as
     such .

Q. What I mean is, if anyone had come to the City Council
   and said, "Can I have a look at the Sheffield Wednesday
   Safety Certificate?" you would have shown it to him?
   A.   Yes, sir, there is no difficulty with that.

Q.   And anyone looking at it, if interested, would have seen
     that the capacity of the Kop was whatever it was - 1 8, 00 0-odd?
     A.   Yes, sir, that is correct.

Q. And he would not necessarily have appreciated that it had
   been increased.    A.   Sir, I think an amendment to the
   C ertificate can be dealt with by means of a letter or other
   document attached to it, as indeed Liverpool have done
   in the latest certificate.

Q.   If it forms part of the Certificate, because any offence,
     of course, if you have to prosecute, is for breach of a
     condition of the Certificate, is it not?   A.   Yes, sir.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You said just now you did not
     know whether it was a public document but -in'” your proof you
     say this, do you not, at page 42:   "The General Safety
     C ertificate is regarded as a public document and therefore
     the spirit of the legislation has been met."      A.  Yes,
     sir, I failed to recall that.    As far as I am concerned,
     it is a public document and anyone may have access to
     it if they wish to see it.    Sir, as far as I am aware,
     an amendment need not actually be written on the Certif ic at e
     as such, as long as it is properly recorded then I would
     have thought proceedings for an offence could take place,
     obviously you are better qualified to judge that than I
     am, sir.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:      Did you consider   this at the time?
     A.   Consider what,    s i r , exactly?

Q.   That there was no need to amend the Safety Certificate
     because what you had done was satisfactory - was this a
     matter that you considered at the time or is this hindsight
     j u stification? A.   I believe I took the view that it
     was unnecessary to recover the original C ertificate document
     and physically amend it in order to record the amendment
     in that way.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE     TAYLOR:   Was there an amendment in
     effect annexed to     it and a letter saying, "Do the same
     for yours"?   A.       Yes, effectively, sir, this letter
     that we have just     referred to to Mr. Chester at page 370
     of the bundle was     that amendment.

        Q.        MR. COLLINS:     Although that was simply a private
             letter to the Club.     A.   the Certificate Holder, sir,
             yes, indeed.

        Q. Certainly, and did not form part of the Certificate itself.
           A.   The letter did not form part of the Certificate
           itself, sir.   I take the view,land obviously there are
           others better qualified than me to comment on it, that
           the existence of that would effectively amend the Certificate.

Q. Now, after the meeting in August, 1986, and the approval of
   the extension of the Kop, what was the next matter that the
   City Council did in relation to the safety certificate, the
   review of the safety certificate? Can you help us about that,
   Mr. Bownes? - A. I am not sure to what you are referring.

Q. You had indicate in that minute we looked at in May 1986 you
   were intending to redraft the safety certificate, and you were
   going to seek comments from the interested parties, that is
   the Fire Service, the Police and the Building Surveyor? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. And you started that process, did you? - A. If I can refer to
   some notes I have made, sir?

Q. Yes, of course.  I just wanted to find out when that process
   started. It would seem to have been in the late autumn of
   1986, but I will be corrected if I am wrong. - A. Perhaps it
   might be useful for me to go through a chronology of this?

Q. If you have got a chronology that would be very helpful.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We have not got it in ;this bundle,
     have we? - A. I think it can be made available, sir.

Q. We have not got it in the bundle? - A. It is not in this
   bundle at the moment.

Q. Is there a copy?

          MR. MAXWELL:    There is, sir.   There is a copy I have
     made available to Mr. Collins.

          MR. COLLINS:    This is the chronology we are talking
     about?

          MR. MAXWELL:   Yes, sir, and I think it is the schedule
     of safety conditions at the end, its chronology set out with
     letters.  I have not got 20 copies but I can get them.

          THE WITNESS:   I believe it is the last two pages of the
     document you have, sir.

Q.        MR. COLLINS:   Yes.  You had asked other Councils for
     copies of their safety certificates and their conditions, and
     you had done that in April and May 1986? - A. That is correct.

Q. And in June 1986 you sent a memorandum....

      ,   LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   If this is tabulated in some form
     I would very much like to have it rather than have to write it
     all down again.

           MR. MAXWELL:   Yes, I am sending someone off now to do
     it.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I will listen and get a copy

  afterwards.

       MR. COLLINS:     I was handed this by Mr. Maxwell this
  morning:

Q. Let me take it fairly quickly because copies will be made
   available, and we can see them later.  18th April, 1986, you
   refer to a response from Liverpool enclosing copies of their
   safety certificate conditions.

        MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to interrupt, but in the mean
   time could I offer you mine, marked somewhat as it is, but it
   may assist you.

        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     I will be patient.

        MR. COLLINS:   6th May 1986, meeting of General Purposes
   Panel, the resolution we have seen.  That is in our bundle,
   313.  29th May your Chief Executive writes to his opposite
   numbers in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds asking for their
   safety certificates? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. 5th June memo to building surveyor, and letters containing the
   same comments to the Chief Constable and Chief Fire Officer,
   informing them that the certificate conditions were shortly to
   be redrafted when they would be asked for comments.  That was
   putting them on notice they were going to be asked for
   comments but not actually asking them? - A. That is right.

Q. You get a reply from Birmingham on 10th June.  You   write to
   your opposite numbers in Barnsley and Doncaster on   4th July
   inviting consultation, because they had taken over   some of the
   old South Yorkshire grounds in their jurisdiction?   - A. Yes,
   and Rotherham Council as well.

Q. And Rotherham.  29th August you get some response from the
   Home Office? - A. Yes, sir.  I don't think that should be in
   there.  It is not really relevant.

Q. We will forget about that.    - A. The next entry is 24th
   September.

Q. You get a copy from Manchester.  I can see you were doing
   that, but you did not start the process of asking for the
   specific comments of the Fire Service, the Building Department
   and the Police, it would seem until November 1986 or
   thereabouts, because if you look at our page 374.... - A. I
   think I can speed this up a bit.  The drafting of the safety
   certificate conditions actually took place during the 6 months
   January-June 1987.

Q. Yes, I follow that.  All I am asking you about at the moment
   is when you requested the input to help you with the drafting
   from the Fire, Police and Building Department? - A. That was
   on 7th July, 1987.

Q. 7th July?    No, you told them you were going to ask them on 7th

                                                        D. BOWNES


           July? - A. I -think you have mistaken 1986 and 1987.

      Q. You say you did not ask them until July 1987? - A. Yes.

      Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     About a year later? - A. Yes.

      Q.         MR. COLLINS:  I think you are doing yourself an
           injustice there, Mr. Bownes, because unless I have misread the
           purpose of the letter at page 374 you had asked in November
           1986.

                MR. MAXWELL:   I hesitate to say the purpose has been
           misunderstood, but I think it has, because it is a response to
           another letter asking whether the Fire Service has any
           comments about the ground rather than in the context of safety
           certificate conditions.

(^)             MR. COLLINS:    I follow.  I got myself into the same mess
           before as I remember, in relation to the Fire documents:

      Q. It was not until July 1987 that you asked for the input that
         had been referred to in the meeting of May 1986.  Is that
         right? - A. Yes, sir.

      Q. It seems to have taken, with respect, an awful long time to
         get round to asking for their comments? - A. Yes, sir.   The
         problem essentially was that the exercise which I originally
         anticipated would be relatively straightforward was not.   By
         looking at the other Council certificates I noticed very much
         in the way that Mr. Justice Popplewell noticed that matters
         differed considerably between authorities.  It took me a great
         deal of time to wrestle with that and to try and get it down
         and take the best bits of each certificate and put them
         together.

      Q. That was the problem, was it? - A. It was a very great
         problem, yes, sir.

      Q. Having requested that you, I think, had a draft report for a
         meeting in September 1987 which appears on our page 417? Is
         that correct, or your page 128, whichever you prefer. - A.
         Yes, a report to the General Purposes Panel in September 1987.

      Q.    What you say there, I think so far as relevant is that you
           refer back under the heading, "Current situation" to the
           panel's meeting in May 1986, and identified several main areas
           for further investigation? - A. Yes, sir.

      Q. Then you deal with the review of the administrative system and
         say it is going to be changed.  In the meantime presumably
         there had been an inspection meeting in August 1987, or the
         summer of 1987, or not? - A. yes, there had been one in 1987.

      Q.    That was under the old system again, was it? - A. No, sir,
           that was under the new system slightly anticipating this
           report, where individual officers were asked to submit
           comments in writing, which indeed happened.

                                                D . BOWNES



Q. That we can see, for example, at - no we can't. - A. It is in
   my bundle.

Q. I am not particularly concerned with that because no doubt it
   was sensible to anticipate what was clearly a sensible
   reorganisation.  I don't doubt that at all.  Can I get
   absolutely clear what was the new system as you understood it
   that was going to operate? - A.  The inspection system or the
   administrative system, sir?

Q. First of all the inspection system? - A. Yes, sir.     My
   impression was that the best way of operating an inspection
   system like this was to persuade officers to submit the
   comment subsequently in writing and then those comments would
   be submitted to the club, which would make it reasonably clear
   what exactly was being raised and who was raising it in order
   that the matter could be dealt with more efficiently than I
   thought had been done in the p a s t . So it occurred to me that
   some of the working party minutes did not make it clear who
   was saying what in relation to matters.

Q. I follow that, but you would have an annual inspection? - A.
   Yes.

Q. That would take how long, was it anticipated? One day, two
   days? - A. In terms of officer time or in terms of time on the
   ground?

Q. In terms of time actually on the ground? - A. That would take
   perhaps a full day, I would have thought.

Q. Who would decide which parts were to be inspected? - A. That
   would be for the individual officers to form their own views.
   They would go to the areas they were most concerned with.

Q.    Was there a chairman of that group? - A. No, sir, it can't
     work like that effectively.  This is a very similar system to
     that used for public entertainment inspections in those sort
     of premises, where officers simply go to the areas they are
     particularly interested in in order to obtain their comments
     or make comments.

Q. Did you attend? - A. Yes, I did.

Q.   What parts did you look at? - A. I can't recall offhand, sir.

Q.   What did you consider to be the area with which you were
     concerned when you went on these inspections? - A. Any area
     which somebody pointed out to me was a matter for concern, for
     example, sir.

Q. Such as? - A. I can't actually recall what happened on the
   inspection, sir.

Q. Did you have any knowledge of what you were going to look for?
   - A. No, sir.  As far as I am concerned I am not an expert.

       Q. I follow that.  - A. I rely on the advice of experts, and they
          have frequently given advice on various matters relating to
          safety.  My job as I saw it was to ensure that the inspectors
          could go where they wanted to, were not obstructed in any way
          - there was no suggestion they were ever obstructed - and to
          ensure they had all the information they needed to carry out
          their job.

       Q. Did you have an advance meeting before you went on this
          inspection to discuss among yourselves what you should look
          for an so on? - A. Not as I recall in those terms.  All the
          services involved are very familiar with doing inspections in
          this way.

       Q. Did you have a meeting afterwards to decide what each of you
          required to be done or was it simply left to the individual to
          write a letter to you? - A. Individuals wrote a letter, sir.

       Q. To you? - A. To me.

       Q. And you would send on to the club? You would write to the
          club incorporating such of the points as you thought the club
          ought to know about? - A. No, sir.  What happened on this
          occasion is that the newly set up advisory group, which is
          referred to in this report in September 1987, considered the
          various comments made by the Building Surveyor and the
          Environmental Health Department, and from their input I was
          able to extract a list of comments to send to the club.

       Q. The advisory group was going to consist of who? - A. The Fire
          Service, the Police, the Building Surveyor, the Health &
          Consumer Services and ourselves, sir.

       Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You have got a working party which
            consists of these.  They conduct an inspection? - A. Yes.

       Q.   With you there.   They then write to you with their comments on
            the inspection for consideration by an advisory group? - A.
            Yes.

       Q.   Which is the same outfit? - A. Yes, sir, effectively.

       Q.   Then I don't understand.   It is probably my fault, but I don't
            understand the difference between the working party and the
            advisory group at the moment. - A. There is none effectively.
            It is simply a change of name.

       Q. Why do you call it something different? - A. Because that more
          accurately reflected what it did, sir.

       Q.       MR. COLLINS:   Are there two different bodies? One goes
            and does the inspection and then reports back to another
            group? - A. No, sir.

       Q.   It is the same group? - A. It is the same individuals. The
            individuals do not inspect as a group.

                                                     D. BOWNES



Q. They inspect individually? - A. Yes.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    What we have got then is a change
     of nomenclature.   What was the officer working party is now
     going to be the advisory group? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And the officer working party can be buried.       Is that it? - A.
     Yes.

Q. As a name? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.       MR. COLLINS:   I am sorry, but this meeting you attend at
     the ground, is that all the advisory group going along on the
     same day? - A. It is not a meeting as such.  It is an
     inspection.

Q. I am sorry.  This inspection of the ground, is this all the
   advisory group going along on the same day? - A. Yes, it is
   representatives from all the authorities going there and
   inspecting.

Q.   And then you have a meeting after that to decide what should
     be done? - A. When the comments are in, if it is appropriate
     to do so.

Q. Each after that inspection writes you a letter indicating what
   he has seen that he considers ought to be put to the club? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. You receive all those letters? - A. Yes.

Q.    You then put them together and    decide what should go to the
     club.    Is that right? - A. No,   as I have just explained....

Q. You have another meeting of the advisory group? - A. No, a
   meeting, not another meeting.

Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    You have an inspection.   Now you
     are having a meeting.   The same personnel? - A. Sometimes the
     same personnel, sir.   It depends who is available at the time.

Q. That meeting is not on site.         That is round a table somewhere?
   - A. yes, sir.

Q. And if something like removal of a barrier is proposed at a
   meeting of that kind you consider it is down to you to decide
   whether it happens or it does not? - A. No, sir, that is not
   right at all.

Q. Well, I have misunderstood what you said before about
   delegation. - A. When the comments are collated and brought
   together then they are submitted to the club acting under the
   appropriate delegated power, sir, after they have been
   discussed if necessary.

Q. They are submitted to the club, you say? - A.         Yes, sir.

                                                   D. BOWNES



Q. And then? - A. And then the club takes action and the
   individual members check the work has been done.

Q. Forgive me, but can I just get this clear in my mind.   At what
   point is the city's approval given and by whom? - A . At the
   point the letter goes out to the club with the consolidated
   comments, sir.

Q. But between the meeting of the advisory group and your sending
   that letter out, has anyone other than you from the city
   considered it? - A. No, sir, effectively not.

Q. So it is your decision as far as the city is concerned as to
   whether it goes to the club with approval? - A. Yes, sir,
   effectively, after all the comments have been fully discussed
   by the people who are making them.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        I think we will break off at that
   point.  2 o'clock.

Electronics Engineer



Dated 27.5.89



I, ROGER HOULDSWORTH, of                                                 will state:


I am 42 years old and up to the week commencing 10th April (100489) I was employed as
Technical Director by M W (Technology) Limited of Sheffield. I had been employed in that
capacity for some 2 years until I resigned my position. I hold an HNC qualification as an
Electronics Engineer. Prior to working with M W (Technology) Limited, I had previously
worked for more than 10 years abroad, in the electronics field.


When I returned from working abroad, in 1986 (000086), I was approached by the then
Company Secretary of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Dick CHESTER, who asked me
to assist in relation to certain problems the Club were having with their closed-circuit
television systems (CCTV). I understand the CCTV system then installed, had been put in
place by Philips Alarms in about 1984 (000084), but that Company had subsequently gone
out of business.


I did look at the system at Mr CHESTER’s request and as then designed and installed it
was not working properly.


Shortly afterwards, I joined M W (Technology) Limited, and whilst their employee, I
completed my examination of the existing system and re-designed it to improve the system
and also the computer system related to it. I also re-designed the CCTV system which had
been installed by the Club for police use - this being a separate system from that operated
by the Club for its own purposes.
THE CLUB SYSTEM



This consisted of a number of static TV cameras situated at strategic points around the
ground. As a result of my examining the system, I arranged for some additional cameras to

be installed to enhance it, particularly when the Spion Kop part of the Ground was

re-opened in 1986 (000086).



Being a static system, the cameras are in a fixed position and focus on a particular fixed
area. They were in fact positioned at strategic points to view the turnstile entrances, and
there was also a camera covering the players’ entrance. Within the CCTV room, situated in
the South Stand near the players’ entrance, there is a bank of 20 monitors, plus a monitor
for the computer system. This computer system records the number of spectators who
come through the turnstiles for each separate area of the ground. Of the 20 monitors
within the control room, 19 display the scene as depicted in the Club’s static system.
The remaining monitor is connected to the Police CCTV system.


Each of the monitors connected to the Club system is in turn connected to a VCR so that

we have the facility to tape the film shown on those monitors, on a video tape. Of the 19

static cameras however, 1 was not in commission at the time because a wall had been

constructed after the camera had been installed, which obstructed that camera’s view of
the relevant turnstiles. The turnstiles in question were those numbered 9-16 which will be

referred to later in this statement.


THE POLICE SYSTEM



This consisted of 5 fully functional remote controlled cameras - ie. those cameras could
pan-tilt through 360 degrees, and zoom on a 16/160 lens. They are controlled from a
Police control box which is fixed in position at the south west corner of the Ground,
adjacent tn th~ western end of the South Stand.The cameras for the Police system are
positioned as follows:-
1 on the upper south west comer of the West Stand;

2 are positioned on the top of the South Stand;

1 at about its centre point and the other to the eastern end of the stand at the top;
1 at the top (rear) of the roof of the Spion Kop;

1 at the south west comer of the ground, mounted on high near the score-board and close

  to the Police control box.

Within the Police control box there are 7 TV monitors, 5 of them are dedicated, 1 to each of
the CCTV cameras. The other 2 are connected to special time lapse video recorders, and
you can switch from camera to camera by means of a passive switch within the control
room so that the officer in charge can record the scene being displayed on any 1 of the
5 cameras. The remaining 2 monitors are used so that the officer can check which of the
5 cameras are being recorded at any given time. PC Trevor BISHOP was the Officer who
worked the CC’I’V system for the Police, but it was not usual for him to be alone in the
control room - there might perhaps be 3 or 4 other officers in there with him at any given
time, for their own reasons - eg. to watch a section of the crowd from the elevated position.


Within the Police control box, there is also a telephone land line which is part of

Sheffield Wednesday FC’s internal telephone system, and the Police have their own
separate telephone land lines installed also.



THE EVENTS OF SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL 1989 (150489)


Although I had previously resigned my position as Technical Director of
M W (Technology) Limited, I was asked by Graham MACKRELL to attend at the Ground on
that day, in case my assistance was required. We knew that the FA Cup Semi-Final
between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC was a sell out, all-ticket match and I
arTived at the Ground fairly early on the Saturday morning, to check that everything was in
order. I was in fact asked to rectify a fault on 1 of the Police CCTV cameras, the one at the

south west corner near the score-board. I checked it, found it was not functioning properly,
and I made the necessary adjustments to the iris controls within the camera and thereafter

checked that it was working OK. Late in the morning I then went to the
CCTVControl Room where PC Harold GUEST was also in attendance, as usual.
In addition, there was present Doug LOCK, theSecurity Officer for
Sheffield Wednesday FC and                   ~of M W (Technology). PC GUEST, as a matter
of routine, would have ensured early in the morning that cassette tapes were inserted in the
19 VCRs - 1 of course would not be recording a picture because the camera was out of

action, but PC GUEST would nevertheless routinely load all 19. The authorised crowd

capacity figures for each section of the ground was part of the data stored in the computer,

and the display monitor for the computer would show how many spectators came through

each of the turnstiles in operation as the day went on. The system was so designed that

when the turnstiles for a particular area had admitted 90 capacity to that area, the total for
that section would flash on the "IV screen and if, for example, one part of the Ground was

being filled up quickly and there was capacity in another part (subject to segregation of
supporters), that would enable the Police to be aware that they should direct remaining
supporters to a different set of turnstiles. Each of the turnstiles was also fitted with an infra-

red ray sensor, so that if spectators tried to climb over the turnstiles but within the turnstiles

enclosure, that would also be recorded on the screen, under a separate heading.

I produce (Exhibit 1) a copy of the print-out from the computer monitor for the game in

question. Numbers climbing over the turnstiles within the enclosure would be shown on the

column headed ’Check Total’. The first heading ’Gate’ is the turnstile number through

which the fans entered, the ’Gate Total’ shows the number who entered through each of

those turnstiles and there will be sub-totals for each section.



I was present in the CCTV Control Room from about 11.30 am (1130) that morning, when
the turnstiles were opened and spectators were entering the ground. The Spion Kop and
the South Stand had been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters, and the North
St~na and West Stand (including Leppings Lane), were reserved for Liverpool supporters.
The authorised capacity for the vadous sections of the ground was as follows:-


Spion Kop                      21,000

South Stand covered             5,524

South Stand uncovered           3,310

West Stand                      4,465
Leppings Lane                  10,100
North Stand                     9,702


By about 2.45 pm (1445) the Kop and the South Stand areas were full of

Nottingham Forest supporters but the North Stand and the West Stand areas were only

about 2/3 (two thirds) full at that time and it was noticeable from the static camera covering
the Leppings Lane turnstiles, that there was a build up of fans outside the turnstiles in that

area. I produce (Exhibit 2) a plan of the Ground showing the Leppings Lane entrance to

the west and the turnstiles (7 in number) which admit spectators to the terraced area of the

West Stand are designated A/G. It will be seen that to the south of those turnstiles runs a
concrete path which lead around eventually to the South Stand. That path is bounded on

the one side (the south) by the river Don and on the north side by a high brick wall.

Situated n that wall just immediately beyond the turnstiles - ie. to the east of them - was an

exit gate designated Gate C which is a double gate of the concertina metal-type which was ~,j

kept closed. One of the static cameras of the CC’I’V system was situated on a post just~         ~
east of that gate, the camera being positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.



It was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that camera that it was possible

to see the build up of supporters outside the turnstiles. The Police had erected some

barriers across the pathway a short distance east of Gate C, so that spectators could not

walk along the pathway to get access to the South Stand. The build up of

Liverpool supporters outside the Leppings Lane entrance, was such that some had been
forced beyond the entrance to the turnstiles outside Gate C, and some of those supporters

were visible within the field of vision of the static camera.


The position was such that I recall commenting, at perhaps 2.50 pm (1450), "For God’s

sake why don’t they delay the kick-off?" and I made that comment in the presence of
Doug LOCK and PC GUEST. We were all, as I recall, in general agreement that it would

be sensible to postpone the kick-off to enable people to get into the ground, although I do

not recall that anyone in the CC’FV Control Room attempted to contact the Police by radio

or telephone to suggest that. The Police, of course, were monitoring the situation
themselves from their own CC’FV system, and in particular using the camera on the

south west comer of the West Stand roof. We could, of course, see that that camera was
trained on Leppings Lane turnstiles because we were able to monitor the Police pictures on

one of the monitors within our control room, although we did not have the facility to record

that picture.



There came a time when Gate C appeared to be opened, and a number of spectators
rushed through into the ’reservoir’ area between the turnstiles and the rear of the
West Stand. An examination of the video recording appears to indicate that this occurred
when the Police opened the gate in an effort to eject one of the spectators that way, and a
number of the fans pressed through from the outside. It would appear that several hundred
got through before the gates were again closed.


Subsequently, the static camera picked up the fact that a number of fans climbed up over

the structure housing the turnstiles, and jumped down into the reservoir area inside.

That is, it seems, further indication of the pressures building up outside the turnstiles,

although a steady flow of spectators was coming through those turnstiles at all times, in the

normal way.
I recall that after the first influx of several hundred spectators through Gate C, Doug LOCK
left the CC’I’V room to go outside, presumably to report the matter to the Club Secretary,
Graham MACKRELL, and/or to check the position for himself on the ground.


Some time later, I am unsure of the exact time, I heard over the Police radio (we had one in
the CCTV room), a senior police officer make a request that a gate be opened at the
Leppings Lane entrance. Police control asked which gate he wished opened and he
repeated his request 2 or 3 times. On about the fourth occasion he said, "Someone is
going to die here, open the gate", and the Police control replied, "If someone is going to die
open the gate, open the gate".


As appears from the video tape, recording the scene, the gate was then opened,
apparently by a uniformed PC, and a huge number of fans flooded into the area,


At that point in time, I realised from the number already displayed on the monitor as having
entered from the Leppings Lane turnstiles, that a dangerous situation was being created.
I left the room and went down the players’ tunnel to the pitch and, just as I did so, the
referee stopped the match as I recall. I looked over to the West Stand area and I saw fans
climbing over the fence and my first thought at that time was that it was a pitch invasion,
and the match had been stopped for that reason. The perimeter fencing at that point is
high and not easy to climb over. I sat down in the stand area behind the dug-out, and
watched the situation for a little time - perhaps 2 or 3 minutes - before I realised what really
was occurring. One of the Sheffield Wednesday ground staff came down the tunnel
holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed one from him and ran across with it to help ferry the
injured people to the gymnasium area where the first aid room was situated. It was in fact
only after I had ferried 3 or 4 inured people in that way, that I then realised that there were
many people who had died as a result, and the gym was in fact designated as a temporary
mortuary.
After helping on the pitch as much as possible, at about 4.15 (1615)/4.30 pm (1630), I went

back to the CCTV room whereI                                                      a
                                              ]and PC GUEST were present, and I had
cup of coffee and a cigarette. Subsequently, I took print-outs of the attendance from the
computer monitor, and ejected the tapes from the VCR’s, leaving them in the machines in
the ejected position, so that I could later know exactly which tape related to which
monitor/area.


I normally take 3 print-outs from the computer for the attendance figures, 2 of which go to
the Secretary, Graham MACKRELL, and the third will normally go to the ticket office staff.
However, on this occasion, since it was an FA Cup Semi-Final, all-ticket, I did at first give
the third print-out to PC GUEST, at his request, since he said his superior officers might
want it. Later, however, Graham MACKRELL said that he wanted to keep all 3 in his
secure possession and I, therefore, retrieved it from PC GUEST.


At about 6.15 (1815)/6.30 pm (1830), Graham MACKRELL asked me to ensure the video
room was properly secured.               ~nd PC GUEST had left the ground at that time.
I went to the CCTV room, locked the cupboard doors where the VCR’s were and then
locked the room and activated the alarm system for the room. I kept the key in my
possession overnight. On locking the cupboard doors where the VCR’s were, I do not
recall specifically checking that all the tapes were still in the machine, but I do recall that as
I finally left the ground at about 7.30 pm (1930) that night, with my fiancee who works as a
receptionist at the Club, I asked the Security Guard at the players’ entrance, to ensure that
no one entered the CCTV room overnight. He promised to do so.


I returned to the ground at 9 am (0900), on the Sunday morning and checked the room
where it was still locked and the alarm operative. However, when I opened up the room
and checked the VCR’s, I found that 2 tapes were missing. One of those was the tape
relating to the camera which looks over Gates 9 - 16, and the other was from the VCR
which had not been activated at the time. I have no idea who removed the tapes - I
mentioned it to the Security Officer, Doug LOCK, and he was surprised and had no

knowledge of it.



I have read this statement and it is correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.
ROGER HOULDSWORTH, age 42, DOB



ELECTRONICS ENGINEER



Dated 28.4.89



I am engaged on a contract basis with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, dealing

principally with the installation and maintenance of the computer turnstile monitoring

system. There are 16 fixed camera points around the ground which focus on tumstile
entrances to the ground. Each camera is linked to a video recorder which is located in a
computer room off the players’ entrance.


When a football match takes place at Hillsborough, I am normally engaged in the computer
room, monitoring the accumulating crowd figure on the visual display unit.


On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was at the ground for the Semi-Final. Present in
the computer room with me were PC GUEST, Mr LOCKE (Security) andl


PC GUEST switched the video recorders on. There is a monitor in the computer room so
that we can see each turnstile entrance. Of the 16 cameras only one was inoperative on
the day.


Due to the tragedy at the ground, I left the computer room to assist, PC GUEST remained
in the room.


I returned to the computer room some time later, I think about half past four (1630). I recall
ejecting the tapes but leaving them in the machines.
The ground in general during the aftemoon was in a state of bedlam. People, supporters,
relatives were everywhere.


I locked the computer room at about 6.30 pm (1830), but had to return shortly after that as
a Police Sergeant requested a computer print out. I supplied that to him.


I retumed to the ground at about 9 am (0900) on Sunday 16th April 1989 (160489). The
alarm to the room was operative and the room was locked. I checked the video recorders,
as I realised the tapes would be required. I discovered that (2) two tapes were missing. I
made a thorough search of the room but could not find the tapes. I put the remaining (14)
fourteen tapes in a bag.


On Monday 17th April 1989 (170489) I put the 14 tapes in the office safe.


I informed Mr McGEE, Chairman, and Mr MACKRELL, Secretary, that the tapes were
missing.


I checked with PC GUEST and Mr LOCKE, but they had not seen the missing tapes. I am
not aware that any person removed the tapes for any legitimate reason.


The tapes concerned are:-
i)     A blank tape from the camera that was not operating


ii)    The tape covering tumstiles 9-12, entrance for the West Stand (above Leppings
       Lane terraces).
Keys to computer room are held by myself, Mr LOCKE and Mr MACKRELL. I am not aware
that any unauthorised person/s entered the computer room on Saturday 15th April 1989
(150489). There was no evidence of any forced entry to the room at any time.
The video recorders are not numbered to show which turnstiles they cover, it is strange
that the two tapes missing are adjacent to the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

Electronics Engineer



Dated 27.5.89



I, ROGER HOULDSWORTH, of f                                                 ~vill state:


I am 42 years old and up to the week commencing 10th April (100489) I was employed as
Technical Director by M W (Technology) Limited of Sheffield. I had been employed in that
capacity for some 2 years until I resigned my position. I hold an HNC qualification as an

I did look at the system at Mr CHESTER’s request and as then designed and installed it
was not working properly.


Shortly afterwards, I joined M W (Technology) Limited, and whilst their employee, I

This consisted of a number of static TV cameras situated at strategic points around the
ground. As a result of my examining the system, I arranged for some additional cameras to
be installed to enhance it, particularly when the Spion Kop part of the Ground was
re-opened in 1986 (000086).


Being a static system, the cameras are in a fixed position and focus on a particular fixed
area. They were in fact positioned at strategic points to view the turnstile entrances, and
there was also a camera covering the players’ entrance. Within the CCTV room, situated in
the South Stand near the players’ entrance, there is a bank of 20 monitors, plus a monitor
for the computer system. This computer system records the number of spectators who
come through the turnstiles for each separate area of the ground. Of the 20 monitors
within the control room, 19 display the scene as depicted in the Club’s static system.
The remaining monitor is connected to the Police CCTV system.


Each of the monitors connected to the Club system is in turn connected to a VCR so that
we have the facility to tape the film shown on those monitors, on a video tape. Of the 19
static cameras however, 1 was not in commission at the time because a wall had been
constructed after the camera had been installed, which obstructed that camera’s view of
the relevant turnstiles. The turnstiles in question were those numbered 9-16 which will be
referred to later in this statement.


THE POLICE SYSTEM



This consisted of 5 fully functional remote controlled cameras - ie. those cameras could
pan-tilt through 360 degrees, and zoom on a 16/160 lens. They are controlled from a
Police control box which is fixed in position at the south west corner of the Ground,
adjacent to the westem end of the South Stand.The cameras for the Police system are
positioned as follows:-
1 on the upper south west corner of the West Stand;
2 are positioned on the top of the South Stand;
1 at about its centre point and the other to the eastern end of the stand at the top;
1 at the top (rear) of the roof of the Spion Kop;
1 at the south west corner of the ground, mounted on high near the score-board and close
  to the Police control box.
Within the Police control box there are 7 TV monitors, 5 of them are dedicated, 1 to each of
the CCTV cameras. The other 2 are connected to special time lapse video recorders, and
you can switch from camera to camera by means of a passive switch within the control
room so that the officer in charge can record the scene being displayed on any 1 of the
5 cameras. The remaining 2 monitors are used so that the officer can check which of the
5 cameras are being recorded at any given time. PC Trevor BISHOP was the Officer who
worked the CCTV system for the Police, but it was not usual for him to be alone in the
control room - there might perhaps be 3 or 4 other officers in there with him at any given
time, for their own reasons - eg. to watch a section of the crowd from the elevated position.


Within the Police control box, there is also a telephone land line which is part of

THE EVENTS OF SATURDAY, 15TH APRIL 1989 (150489)


Although I had previously resigned my position as Technical Director of
M W (Technology) Limited, I was asked by Graham MACKRELL to attend at the Ground on
that day, in case my assistance was required. We knew that the FA Cup Semi-Final
between Liverpool FC and Nottingham Forest FC was a sell out, all-ticket match and I
arrived at the Ground faidy early on the Saturday morning, to check that everything was in
order. I was in fact asked to rectify a fault on 1 of the Police CCTV cameras, the one at the
south west corner near the score-board. I checked it, found it was not functioning properly,
and I made the necessary adjustments to the iris controls within the camera and thereafter
checked that it was working OK. Late in the morning I then went to the
CCTVControl Room where PC Harold GUEST was also in attendance, as usual.
In addition, there was present Doug LOCK, the Security Officer for

Sheffield Wednesday FC and[                  ~f M W (Technology). PC GUEST, as a matter
of routine, would have ensured early in the morning that cassette tapes were inserted in the
19 VCRs - 1 of course would not be recording a picture because the camera was out of
action, but PC GUEST would nevertheless routinely load all 19. The authorised crowd
capacity figures for each section of the ground was part of the data stored in the computer,
and the display monitor for the computer would show how many spectators came through
each of the turnstiles in operation as the day went on. The system was so designed that
when the turnstiles for a particular area had admitted 90 capacity to that area, the total for
that section would flash on the TV screen and if, for example, one part of the Ground was
being filled up quickly and there was capacity in another part (subject to segregation of
supporters), that would enable the Police to be aware that they should direct remaining
supporters to a different set of turnstiles. Each of the turnstiles was also fitted with an infra-
red ray sensor, so that if spectators tried to climb over the turnstiles but within the turnstiles
enclosure, that would also be recorded on the screen, under a separate heading.
I produce (Exhibit 1) a copy of the print-out from the computer monitor for the game in
question. Numbers climbing over the turnstiles within the enclosure would be shown on the
column headed ’Check Total’. The first heading ’Gate’ is the turnstile number through
which the fans entered, the ’Gate Total’ shows the number who entered through each of
those turnstiles and there will be sub-totals for each section.


I was present in the CCTV Control Room from about 11.30 am (1130) that morning, when
the turnstiles were opened and spectators were entering the ground. The Spion Kop and
the South Stand had been designated for Nottingham Forest supporters, and the North
Stand and West Stand (including Leppings Lane), were reserved for Liverpool supporters.
The authorised capacity for the various sections of the ground was as follows:-


Spion Kop                     21,000
South Stand covered             5,524
South Stand uncovered           3,310
West Stand                     4,465
Leppings Lane                 10,100
North Stand                     9,702


By about 2.45 pm (1445) the Kop and the South Stand areas were full of
Nottingham Forest supporters but the North Stand and the West Stand areas were only
about 2/3 (two thirds) full at that time and it was noticeable from the static camera covering
the Leppings Lane turnstiles, that there was a build up of fans outside the turnstiles in that
area. I produce (Exhibit 2) a plan of the Ground showing the Leppings Lane entrance to
the west and the turnstiles (7 in number) which admit spectators to the terraced area of the
West Stand are designated A/G. It will be seen that to the south of those turnstiles runs a
concrete path which lead around eventually to the South Stand. That path is bounded on
the one side (the south) by the river Don and on the north side by a high brick wall.
Situated n that wall just immediately beyond the turnstiles - ie. to the east of them - was an
exit gate designated Gate C which is a double gate of the concertina metal-type which was
kept closed. One of the static cameras of the CCTV system was situated on a post just
east of that gate, the camera being positioned so as to show the area of the turnstiles A/G.


It was through the monitor showing the scene depicted by that camera that it was possible
to see the build up of supporters outside the turnstiles. The Police had erected some
barriers across the pathway a short distance east of Gate C, so that spectators could not
walk along the pathway to get access to the South Stand. The build up of
Liverpool supporters outside the Leppings Lane entrance, was such that some had been
forced beyond the entrance to the turnstiles outside Gate C, and some of those supporters
were visible within the field of vision of the static camera.


The position was such that I recall commenting, at perhaps 2.50 pm (1450), "For God’s
sake why don’t they delay the kick-off?" and I made that comment in the presence of
Doug LOCK and PC GUEST. We were all, as I recall, in general agreement that it would
be sensible to postpone the kick-off to enable people to get into the ground, although I do
not recall that anyone in the CCTV Control Room attempted to contact the Police by radio
or telephone to suggest that. The Police, of course, were monitoring the situation
themselves from their own CCTV system, and in particular using the camera on the
south west comer of the West Stand roof. We could, of course, see that that camera was
trained on Leppings Lane turnstiles because we were able to monitor the Police pictures on
one of the monitors within our control room, although we did not have the facility to record
that picture.


There came a time when Gate C appeared to be opened, and a number of spectators
rushed through into the ’reservoir’ area between the turnstiles and the rear of the
West Stand. An examination of the video recording appears to indicate that this occurred
when the Police opened the gate in an effort to eject one of the spectators that way, and a
number of the fans pressed through from the outside. It would appear that several hundred
got through before the gates were again closed.


Subsequently, the static camera picked up the fact that a number of fans climbed up over
the structure housing the turnstiles, and jumped down into the reservoir area inside.
That is, it seems, further indication of the pressures building up outside the turnstiles,
although a steady flow of spectators was coming through those turnstiles at all times, in the
normal way.
I recall that after the first influx of several hundred spectators through Gate C, Doug LOCK
left the CCTV room to go outside, presumably to report the matter to the Club Secretary,
Graham MACKRELL, and/or to check the position for himself on the ground.


Some time later, I am unsure of the exact time, I heard over the Police radio (we had one in
the CCTV room), a senior police officer make a request that a gate be opened at the
Leppings Lane entrance. Police control asked which gate he wished opened and he
repeated his request 2 or 3 times. On about the fourth occasion he said, "Someone is
going to die here, open the gate", and the Police control replied, "If someone is going to die
open the gate, open the gate".


As appears from the video tape, recording the scene, the gate was then opened,
apparently by a uniformed PC, and a huge number of fans flooded into the area.


At that point in time, I realised from the number already displayed on the monitor as having
entered from the Leppings Lane turnstiles, that a dangerous situation was being created.
I left the room and went down the players’ tunnel to the pitch and, just as I did so, the
referee stopped the match as I recall. I looked over to the West Stand area and I saw fans
climbing over the fence and my first thought at that time was that it was a pitch invasion,
and the match had been stopped for that reason. The perimeter fencing at that point is
high and not easy to climb over. I sat down in the stand area behind the dug-out, and
watched the situation for a little time - perhaps 2 or 3 minutes - before I realised what really
was occurring. One of the Sheffield Wednesday ground staff came down the tunnel
holding 2 stretchers and I grabbed one from him and ran across with it to help ferry the
injured people to the gymnasium area where the first aid room was situated. It was in fact
only after I had ferried 3 or 4 inured people in that way, that I then realised that there were
many people who had died as a result, and the gym was in fact designated as a temporary
mortuary.
After helping on the pitch as much as possible, at about 4.15 (1615)/4.30 pm (1630), I went
back to the CCTV room where                     ~and PC GUEST were present, and I had a
cup of coffee and a cigarette. Subsequently, I took print-outs of the attendance from the
computer monitor, and ejected the tapes from the VCR’s, leaving them in the machines in
the ejected position, so that I could later know exactly which tape related to which
monitor/area.


I normally take 3 print-outs from the computer for the attendance figures, 2 of which go to
the Secretary, Graham MACKRELL, and the third will normally go to the ticket office staff.
However, on this occasion, since it was an FA Cup Semi-Final, all-ticket, I did at first give
the third print-out to PC GUEST, at his request, since he said his superior officers might
want it. Later, however, Graham MACKRELL said that he wanted to keep all 3 in his
secure possession and I, therefore, retrieved it from PC GUEST.


At about 6.15 (1815)/6.30 pm (1830), Graham MACKRELL asked me to ensure the video
room was properly secured,                  and PC GUEST had left the ground at that time.
                                            J

I went to the CCTV room, locked the cupboard doors where the VCR’s were and then
locked the room and activated the alarm system for the room. I kept the key in my
possession overnight. On locking the cupboard doors where the VCR’s were, I do not
recall specifically checking that all the tapes were still in the machine, but I do recall that as
I finally left the ground at about 7.30 pm (1930) that night, with my fiancee who works as a
receptionist at the Club, I asked the Security Guard at the players’ entrance, to ensure that
no one entered the CCTV room overnight. He promised to do so.


I returned to the ground at 9 am (0900), on the Sunday morning and checked the room
where it was still locked and the alarm operative. However, when I opened up the room
and checked the VCR’s, I found that 2 tapes were missing. One of those was the tape
relating to the camera which looks over Gates 9 - 16, and the other was from the VCR
which had not been activated at the time. I have no idea who removed the tapes - I
mentioned it to the Security Officer, Doug LOCK, and he was surprised and had no

knowledge of it.



I have read this statement and it is correct to the best of my knowledge and belief.

ELECTRONICS ENGINEER
Tel:

Dated 28.4.89



I am engaged on a contract basis with Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, dealing

principally with the installation and maintenance of the computer turnstile monitoring

system. There are 16 fixed camera points around the ground which focus on turnstile

entrances to the ground. Each camera is linked to a video recorder which is located in a

computer room off the players’ entrance.



When a football match takes place at Hillsborough, I am normally engaged in the computer
room, monitoring the accumulating crowd figure on the visual display unit.


On Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489) I was at the ground for the Semi-Final. Present in

the computer room with me were PC GUEST, Mr LOCKE (Security) and



PC GUEST switched the video recorders on. There is a monitor in the computer room so
that we can see each turnstile entrance. Of the 16 cameras only one was inoperative on
the day.


Due to the tragedy at the ground, I left the computer room to assist. PC GUEST remained
in the room.


I returned to the computer room some time later, I think about half past four (1630). I recall
ejecting the tapes but leaving them in the machines.
The ground in general during the afternoon was in a state of bedlam. People, supporters,
relatives were everywhere.


I locked the computer room at about 6.30 pm (1830), but had to return shortly after that as
a Police Sergeant requested a computer print out. I supplied that to him.


I returned to the ground at about 9 am (0900) on Sunday 16th April 1989 (160489). The

alarm to the room was operative and the room was locked. I checked the video recorders,

as I realised the tapes would be required. I discovered that (2) two tapes were missing. I

made a thorough search of the room but could not find the tapes. I put the remaining (14)

fourteen tapes in a bag.


On Monday 17th April 1989 (170489) I put the 14 tapes in the office safe.



I informed Mr McGEE, Chairman, and Mr MACKRELL, Secretary, that the tapes were

missing.



I checked with PC GUEST and Mr LOCKE, but they had not seen the missing tapes. I am

not aware that any person removed the tapes for any legitimate reason.



The tapes concerned are:-,

i)     A blank tape from the camera that was not operating



ii)    The tape covering turnstiles 9-12, entrance for the West Stand (above Leppings

       Lane terraces).
Keys to computer room are held by myself, Mr LOCKE and Mr MACKRELL. I am not aware

that any unauthorised person/s entered the computer room on Saturday 15th April 1989
(150489). There was no evidence of any forced entry to the room at any time.
The video recorders are not numbered to show which turnstiles they cover. It is strange
that the two tapes missing are adjacent to the Leppings Lane turnstiles.

I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed at Deepcar.



On Saturday the 15th of April 1989 I was posted to the Video Room at Hillsborough
Football Ground together with Mr LOCK the Chief Security Officer.


At about 12.45 pm I switched on all the Video Recorders which record the fans entering the

ground via the turnstiles.


The tapes then ran for their 3 hour duration and automatically rewind when they reach the
end.


At the end of their running time all of the tapes were left in situ in the video recorders.

Dated 10.5.89


I am Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed at Deepcar.


During the last four years I have worked all football marches at Hillsborough Football
Ground.


My duties consist of working in the video room in company with the Chief Security Officer,

Mr Lock.


The video room is situated near to the Players’ Entrance on the South Stand of the ground.



In this room there are 20 IV monitors which are covered by cameras which are strategically
placed around the ground to cover all 95 turnstiles. There is also a TV monitor which can
be operated by a switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the
main Police control point situated between the West and South Stands. There is also a
computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at anytime during a match how many
persons have passed through each turnstile at any given point. Each section of the ground
for example the Spion Kop it will give a figure showing the exact number of people in that
area of the ground. These figures for that section of the ground are then added up to give
a grand total at the end. The computer scans all the turnstiles and takes approximately 2 ½
seconds.
On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was on duty for the Semi Final between Liverpool
and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10.00 am (1000) that date. At about

12.45 pm (1245) after the tumstUes were open I switched all video recorders on to record

all the fans as they were entering the ground via the turnstiles.


Dudng the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 pm (1415) I noticed that the

crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles. I am not sure of the size of the

crowd but believe it to be between 25,000 and 30,000. At 2.40 pm (1440) that same date I

checked with the camera which covers the Penistone Road area and noticed that there
were very few people in the streets, and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000

plus, and when each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate, the

total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me that nearly all the
Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was near to full capacity.



I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of the ground and
noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that area. I could see that the fans were
spread from the turnstile entrance right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road. I
would estimate that there would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans. I made a check of the
computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to
capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of 7,000, which would be
near to capacity and the computer would be at a point ready to start pulsating. The figures
on the computer start to pulsate when the capacities get to within 15 of the total.


It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get in, that there would not
be sufficient room for all to be accommodated. As I looked at the scene I could see the
crowd getting larger and many at the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing
violently towards the turnstiles. From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to get
the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the way.
I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police. A large contingent of the fans were
climbing onto the backs of others and climbing the walls over the top of the turnstiles; they
were landing onto the asbestos roofs on the inside of the ground and jumping onto people
who were on the inside of the ground to break their fall as they landed.


On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being pushed on his horse
down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of the West Stand.


Dudng all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent MARSHALL requesting
further assistance in that area, for the double doors to be opened in order to let fans into

the ground to save a major incident outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further

15 minutes.


At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South side of Leppings Lane open,
and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into the ground. Within a minute of this
happening I noticed that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane open and
again about 1,000 fans run into the ground. Within a minute of this happening I noticed
that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane open and again about 1,000 fans
run into the ground. I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers in that area
that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and appeared to be heavily
intoxicated with drink.


I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the area of the West
Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting out of hand and people were being
pushed up against the fencing on the perimeter of the ground.


i could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of the ground to assist
with the injured and dying.
By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players’ Entrance area of the ground
and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging for ambulances to be directed in
that area to ferry the injured to hospital. I can say that during the time prior to the major
incident the Police personal radios were working very well, but during the day there
appeared to be some distortion, and some messages could not be read clearly.


I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of this major incident was
caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late and being under the influence of
drink and trying to enter the ground without tickets. It was obvious that looking at the crowd
outside the ground prior to kick off there were several thousands that were attempting to
enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside the ground.


During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received on the Police

radio network but did not listen to what was being transmitted on the back to back radio

system owned by the Club as I knew Mr LOCK would deal with any situation that had

developed.


I tried several times to pass messages about the situation at Leppings Lane but each time I
tried I was blocking transmission, so I kept off the radio.

When first team football matches are played by Sheffield Wednesday FC at Hillsborough I

have a regular fixed duty. I have not missed many matches at the ground, on duty, for the

last four years. My duty at the ground is always to be in the computer room monitoring
turnstiles via cameras which are linked to 16 screens in the room. In the event of any

problems at the turnstiles ! can then inform the Police Control either by radio or telephone.

Each of the cameras is linked also to a video recorder in the computer room.



On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was posted to duty at Hillsborough for the FA Cup
semi-final. I was at the ground from about 10 am (1000) engaged in the computer room.
During that day there were three other persons in the computer room.
Roger HOULDSWORTH, a man                      and Mr LOCK Security Officer.


I switched the video recorders on to record sometime about 12.30 pm (1230). I did not

physically check that there was a cassette in each recorder but I believe that there was. If

the recording button on the video is pressed and there is no cassette in the recorder it will

not accept the recording mode and the warning/recording light will not operate. I cannot
recall any such instance on that day. If that had occurred I would have told

Mr HOULDSWORTH and he would have inserted a cassette. It is normal practice to leave

all the cassettes in the recorders as on these machines when the end of the cassette is
reached it is automatically rewound. If the cassette is required for any purpose it is then

available if not required it is then ready to record the next match.



The tragedy at the ground then happened and from about 3 pm (1500) onwards the whole
ground was in a state of chaos. There were people all over the stadium in places where
normally they would not be allowed.
Throughout the afternoon I was mainly in the computer room and to the best of my
recollection I left the room on two occasions. One to obtain an ambulance for an injured
person and the other to go to the toilet. At no time to my knowledge was the computer
room left unattended.


I was released from duty at about 6 pm (1800) that day. When I left the computer room,
Mr HOULDSWORTH and Mr LOCK were still there. I was not aware of any unauthorised
persons entering the computer room on that day.


I think it was on the following Monday or Tuesday that Mr HOULDSWORTH contacted me
and asked me about two of the tapes that were missing. I told him I had no knowledge of
any tapes missing.

PC 1421 Deepcar Police Station F2

Tel: (0114) 2570200

Dated 10.5.89


I am Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed at Deepcar.



During the last four years I have worked all football marches at Hillsborough Football
Ground.


My duties consist of working in the video room in company with the Chief Security Officer,

Mr Lock.


The video room is situated near to the Players’ Entrance on the South Stand of the ground.


In this room there are 20 TV monitors which are covered by cameras which are strategically
placed around the ground to cover all 95 turnstiles. There is also a TV monitor which can
be operated by a switch which will operate and show any view by the cameras from the
main Police control point situated between the West and South Stands. There is also a
computer which shows all 95 turnstiles and can tell at anytime during a match how many
persons have passed through each turnstile at any given point. Each section of the ground
for example the Spion Kop it will give a figure showing the exact number of people in that
area of the ground. These figures for that section of the ground are then added up to give
a grand total at the end. The computer scans all the turnstiles and takes approximately 2 ½
seconds.
On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was on duty for the Semi Final between Liverpool

and Nottingham Forest, and commenced my duties at 10.00 am (1000) that date. At about
12.45 pm (1245) after the turnstiles were open I switched all video recorders on to record

all the fans as they were entering the ground via the turnstiles.



During the afternoon leading up to kick-off time at about 2.15 pm (1415) I noticed that the

crowd appeared to be slow in arriving at the turnstiles. I am not sure of the size of the

crowd but believe it to be between 25,000 and 30,000. At 2.40 pm (1440) that same date I

checked with the camera which covers the Penistone Road area and noticed that there

were very few people in the streets, and on checking the computer it was showing 19,000
plus, and when each area of the ground gets near to capacity the totals start to pulsate, the

total capacity for that area of the ground being 21,000, which told me that nearly all the

Nottingham supporters were in the ground and it was near to full capacity.



I then switched to the camera that was covering the Leppings Lane end of the ground and
noticed that there was a large gathering of fans in that area. I could see that the fans were
spread from the turnstile entrance right back into Leppings Lane, fully blocking the road. I
would estimate that there would be between 3,000 and 5,000 fans. I made a check of the
computer and saw that the figures for the West Stand were pulsating and showing near to
capacity, and the Leppings Lane figures were showing in excess of 7,000, which would be
near to capacity and the computer would be at a point ready to start pulsating. The figures
on the computer start to pulsate when the capacities get to within 15 of the total.


It was obvious that looking at the crowd from outside trying to get in, that there would not

be sufficient room for all to be accommodated. As I looked at the scene I could see the

crowd getting larger and many at the back of the crowd were surging forward pushing
violently towards the turnstiles. From that point I could also see Police Officers trying to get

the crowd into some sort of order but they were being pushed to one side out of the way.
I saw several missiles being thrown towards the Police. A large contingent of the fans were
climbing onto the backs of others and climbing the walls over the top of the turnstiles; they
were landing onto the asbestos roofs on the inside of the ground and jumping onto people
who were on the inside of the ground to break their fall as they landed.


On the South Stand of this area I saw a mounted policeman being pushed on his horse
down towards a large double door which leads into the rear of the West Stand.


During all this I could hear several officers including Superintendent MARSHALL requesting
further assistance in that area, for the double doors to be opened in order to let fans into
the ground to save a major incident outside, also for the match to be delayed for a further
15 minutes.


At this point I noticed that the large door situated on the South side of Leppings Lane open,
and there was a surge of about 1,000 fans run into the ground. Within a minute of this
happening I noticed that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane open and
again about 1,000 fans run into the ground. Within a minute of this happening I noticed
that the large doors of the North side of Leppings Lane open and again about 1,000 fans
run into the ground. I could tell from the noises on the radios from the officers in that area
that the Liverpool fans were very boisterous and excited, and appeared to be heavily
intoxicated with drink.


I then turned to the camera that was inside the ground and covered the area of the West
Stand and it was obvious that the situation was getting out of hand and people were being
pushed up against the fencing on the perimeter of the ground.


I could see that all available officers were being sent to this area of the ground to assist
with the injured and dying.
By this time injured persons were being brought to the Players’ Entrance area of the ground
and I assisted in treating people in that area and arranging for ambulances to be directed in
that area to ferry the injured to hospital. I can say that during the time prior to the major
incident the Police personal radios were working very well, but during the day there
appeared to be some distortion, and some messages could not be read clearly.


I would only like to add that in my opinion that the main cause of this major incident was
caused by the Liverpool fans arriving at the match too late and being under the influence of
drink and trying to enter the ground without tickets. It was obvious that looking at the crowd
outside the ground prior to kick off there were several thousands that were attempting to
enter without tickets at all cost to the safety of other Liverpool supporters inside the ground.


During the incident I was trying to concentrate on messages being received on the Police
radio network but did not listen to what was being transmitted on the back to back radio
system owned by the Club as I knew Mr LOCK would deal with any situation that had
developed.


I tried several times to pass messages about the situation at Leppings Lane but each time I
tried I was blocking transmission, so I kept off the radio.

Tel: 0114 2570200

Dated 10.5.89


I am a Police Constable in the South Yorkshire Police at present stationed at Deepcar.


On Saturday the 15th of April 1989 I was posted to the Video Room at Hillsborough
Football Ground together with Mr LOCK the Chief Security Officer.



At about 12.45 pm I switched on all the Video Recorders which record the fans entering the
ground via the turnstiles.


The tapes then ran for their 3 hour duration and automatically rewind when they reach the
end.


At the end of their running time all of the tapes were left in situ in the video recorders.

SECURITY OFFICER SWFS

Dated 2.5.89


I am employed by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as a part-time Security Officer. I
attend all home matches and major events at Hillsborough.


Part of my duties entails the supervision of the fixed camera points via video and the
computer turnstile monitoring facility.


On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was at Hillsborough from about 9.30 am (0930),
engaged in general supervision duties. In the computer room with me were
Roger HOULDSWORTH, PC GUEST and we were later joined by an employee of
Roger HOU LDSWORTH.


The video recorders and the monitors were switched on by PC GUEST about 12.30 pm

I was in and out of the computer room all morning. I stayed in the room until 2.50 pm
(1450) when I left, because I was aware that a Gate (C) had been opened at the West
Stand end of the ground and I wanted to know why.


 Because of the disaster, I was out of the computer room until about 4.30 pm (1630).

 During that time I went back to the room on a couple of occasions, not to stay, and there

was always someone in the room. There were people in the stadium with access to areas
which are normally restricted due to the incident.
I am not aware of any unauthorised persons entering the computer room. I realised that
the tapes would be required as evidence, and after consultation with the Club Secretary, I

told Roger HOULDSWORTH to eject the tapes and save them. I saw him eject the tapes.

This would be about half past four (1630).


There are only 3 sets of keys to the computer room, with myself, Mr MACKRELL and Roger
HOULDSWORTH.


There were a lot of press people in the area of the stile room which is near the computer
room.


I returned to the computer room about 7.30 pm (1930) that night, to collect my raincoat. I

re-set the alarm when I left. I noticed that the video cassettes were in the machines but I
did not check all of them. I have no knowledge of anyone having removed any cassettes

from the videos.
DOUGLAS JOHN LOCK, Age 55, DOB

                                    SOUTH YORKSHIRE,

SECURITY OFFICER SWFS
Dated 2.5.89



I am employed by Sheffield Wednesday Football Club as a part-time Security Officer. I
attend all home matches and major events at Hillsborough.



Part of my duties entails the supervision of the fixed camera points via video and the
computer turnstile monitoring facility.


On Saturday 15 April 1989 (150489) I was at Hillsborough from about 9.30 am (0930),
engaged in general supervision duties. In the computer room with me were
Roger HOULDSWORTH, PC GUEST and we were later joined by an employee of
Roger HOULDSWORTH.


The video recorders and the monitors were switched on by PC GUEST about 12.30 pm
(1230). There was a picture on 15 of the monitors. One other camera was not working.


I was in and out of the computer room all morning. I stayed in the room until 2.50 pm
(1450) when I left, because I was aware that a Gate (C) had been opened at the West
Stand end of the ground and I wanted to know why.


Because of the disaster, I was out of the computer room until about 4.30 pm (1630).
During that time I went back to the room on a couple of occasions, not to stay, and there
was always someone in the room. There were people in the stadium with access to areas
which are normally restricted due to the incident.
I am not aware of any unauthorised persons entering the computer room. I realised that
the tapes would be required as evidence, and after consultation with the Club Secretary, I
told Roger HOULDSWORTH to eject the tapes and save them. I saw him eject the tapes.
This would be about half past four (1630).


There are only 3 sets of keys to the computer room, with myself, Mr MACKRELL and Roger
HOU LDSWORTH.


There were a lot of press people in the area of the stile room which is near the computer
room.


I returned to the computer room about 7.30 pm (1930) that night, to collect my raincoat. I
re-set the alarm when I left. I noticed that the video cassettes were in the machines but I
did not check all of them. I have no knowledge of anyone having removed any cassettes

I am employed by MW Technology Ltd who have a contract with Sheffield Wednesday FC

to provide the computer tumstile equipment and CCTV. On Saturday 15 April ’89 (150489)

I was at Hillsborough from about 10 am (1000). I was in the computer room with Roger

HOULDSWORTH, Mr LOCKE and PC GUEST. To the best of my recollection one of us

was in the computer room from 10 am (1000) until 6 pm (1800) which is when I left. We left

on occasions throughout that time but individually, never all together.


Throughout the day I was watching the monitors and also listening to the Police control.
was there in case any fault occurred with the equipment.


I recall PC GUEST switched on the video recorders about 12.30 pm (1230). They rewound
after a few minutes and whilst I did not check that they were all recording I cannot recall
him saying anything untoward about the recorders.


After the incident I was not involved with the deceased or the injured. I remained in the
computer room. PC GUEST was in the room with me but Mr LOCKE and
Roger HOULDSWORTH were out of the room. They came back at intervals but i can’t say
what time.


After the incident some of the ground stewards came to the room asking for Mr LOCKE.


I recall that the cupboard housing the video recorders was shut but not locked. I did not
see anyone remove any tape from that cupboard. I can recall that Roger HOULDSWORTH
ejected the cassette tapes but he did not take them away, he left them in the machines.
In general terms the stadium wa~ in r.haos after the incident. People were in areas of the
ground where they wouldn’t normally have been allowed.


I did not see anyone go near the video cupboard other than the persons I have mentioned.


I left the ground about 6 pm (1800).


I have no knowledge of any tapes from the ground.


I have a key for the computer room and the alarm system.

Mrs Gillian Radcliffe, Head of Press & Public Relations, said:

"South Yorkshire Police have never sought to hide any of the facts
about what happened to anyone in the areas set aside for the dead or
injured after this terrible tragedy. There would be nothing at all
to gain by doing so. Any questions about the style of interviews
used to draw up the second statements should be directed to West
Midlands Police, whose officers carried out the difficult task of
interviewing witnesses who were then, as now, experiencing the
anguish of their involvement in the disaster.

Our hearts go out to the mother of this boy. Naturally, she will
still desperately want to find out everything possible about the last
moments of her son’s life and we fully understand this need.       If
significant new evidence is uncovered about the deaths, then it is
proper for the families, or anyone else, to report the information to
the Coroner."

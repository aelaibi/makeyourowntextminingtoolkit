 Dear Sirs

 Hillsborough Documentation

 Thank you for your letter of 12 August 1998.

 We must advert directly to the final paragraph of your letter. Neither we nor our clients accept that
 it is “unreasonable” to obtain guidance from the DPP and, having obtained that guidance, to follow
 it.

 That policy will continue to be applied impartially to prosecutor, Defendants and to any other party
 seeking information or documents until the CPS review is completed and the decision of the DPP
 known.

 The other points made in your letter (which are not accepted) would in any event only become
 matters for consideration if the prosecutions are to proceed.

 Yours fail

Dear Sirs

Adlinetonv Murray Adlington v Duckenfield

The purpose of this letter is to request to you as a matter of urgency to make available the
original papers and copies in the possession of your clients in relation to the Hillsborough
disaster to both the prosecution and defence; alternatively, at the very least, to release them as
soon as possible to some neutral third party.

The HSFG is becoming increasingly concerned that all original papers are in the custody of the
South Yorkshire Police. Such papers as we have received from the Home Office in the last
year have led us to believe that the South Yorkshire Police adopted a deliberate policy of
withholding material and not revealing facts as disclosed by its junior officers in their first
statements after the disaster.

We have received both edited and unedited versions of the statements of the South Yorkshire
Police officers. The process of omitting material facts extending patently beyond that
suggested in Lord Justice Stuart-Smith’s report, and makes us suspect that he was misled in
the course of his “Scrutiny”. We are in the process of preparing a detailed analysis.

We have also received in the last year statements from spectators whose identities were
completely unknown to us before. Most of these statements were not on the Master Witness
List of statements submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1990 and most of these
witnesses were not called at the Inquest. We suspect the DPP was given an unbalanced
account of the evidence.

We invite you to explain by what legal process the West Midlands Police entrusted all the
original papers, including copies of the West Midlands Police report and the advice of leading
counsel on the subject of prosecutions to a force that was under suspicion and itself had
admitted negligence? Why should the papers be in the possession of the South Yorkshire
Police at all?

                                                 1

We have seen a copy of a document called the ‘^Phillips Report”. This is not the occasion to
comment upon it We do, however, request you to explain to us how material that appears to
have been collected by the West Midlands Police came to be in the possession of the South
Yorkshire Police in 1990 in order that Mr Phillips might be invited to deliver his opinions upon
it?

Assistant Chief Constable Daines has already expressed the opinion publically that ‘I t is hard
to imagine a private prosecution getting beyond the first hurdle” . Is it right in these
circumstances, that he should make, or be party to decisions about the disclosure to the
prosecutor of the material in his possession at a time w hen the very existence of the
prosecution is under challenge.

We invite you to agree, without, of course, the slightest admission of impropriety, that the
papers should no longer remain in the custody of the South Yorkshire Police. Justice must be
seen to be done. The South Yorkshire Police have an obvious interest in the outcome of the
prosecution, and there is at the very least a temptation to keep shrouded in secrecy relevant
documentation, especially if it casts the force in a duteous light.

Even if our suspicions are unfounded it is obviously in the interests of all parties to have
simultaneous access to the archive. There may be material exculpating the defendants. We
note that the South Yorkshire Police accepted publically the findings of Lord Taylor. It must,
therefore, take the position, as Lord Taylor did, as a central finding that the failure to arrange
for the diversion of the supporters from the central pens when the gates were opened was “a
blunder of the first magnitude”, and the immediate cause of the disaster.

We ask you to explain therefore how it is appropriate that South Yorkshire Police continue to
hold the papers when it has associated itselfwithout reserve with an inquiry which has blamed
at least one of the defendants, acting on its behalf, so comprehensively?

We refer to our letter of 20* July to Mr Daines requesting the addresses of police officers with
whom we wish to speak. There is no possible bona fide reason why the DPP’s review should
prevent you from supplying this information. How can it be contrary to the interests ofjustice
to give us these addresses so we can progress matters?

The argument that you will no nothing until the DPP has made a decision to take over the
prosecution is unreasonable in these circumstances. We invite you to reply positively to this
letter before the end of the week, or we shall apply for a witness summons directed to Mr
Daines requiring the production of all relevant documents. If there is another suitable parson
on whom the summons should be served, please let us know before 5 pm on Friday 14
August.

 Yours faithfully

 Dear Sirs

 Hillsboroueh D isaster D ocum entation

 We have been asked by the South Yorkshire Police to reply to your letter o f 3 August 1998
 addressed to the Assistant Chief Constable.

 As you are aware Summonses have been issued in the Leeds Magistrates Court against David
 Duckenfield and Bernard Murray in connection with matters arising out o f the disaster.

 In connection with those Summonses requests for documentation and information have been
 received from a number o f persons.

 The Chief Constable sought guidance pursuant to Section 3(2)(e) o f the Prosecution o f Offences Act
 1985 from the Director o f Public Prosecutions in relation to those requests.

 The response was that the Crown Prosecution Service were reviewing the question o f whether to
 intervene in the private prosecutions and that the Chief Constable might wish to delay any voluntary
 disclosure o f documentation until that review was complete and a decision was made.

  The Chief Constable has accepted that guidance and accordingly will not respond to any requests for
  documentation or information until the CPS review has been completed and the decision of the DPP
  is known.

    I refer to your recent requests of statements and information, some made direct to South

    You began private prosecutions on 26 June 1998 for alleged offences concerned with the

    i will write to you again as soon as practicable.

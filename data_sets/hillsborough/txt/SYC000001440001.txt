           D e a r Sir,

           Re H I L L S B O R O U G H INQUESTS - VIDEO RECORDINGS.



           You w i l l of course be aware that y o u r c l i e n t was i n te rvie wed u nd er the PACE
           pr ocedure and that this in ter view was audio taped in the usu al manner.

           I also u n d e r s t a n d that in addi tio n to the audio tape, a vi deo rec ording of
           the interviews was prepared.                 This v ide o rec ording bein g h o w e v e r so to speak
           ex tra statutory.          I un der s t a n d that it was done w i t h the consen t of your
           client, and on the u n d ers tand ing that it w o u l d not be u s e d in proceedings.

           It is my i ntention to have the audio tapes p la yed to the Ju ry at an
           appr opri ate point in the resumed Inquests.

           It occurs to m e however that if the v ide o recording is of good e nough quality
           (which I in fact understa nd it is), that it mi ght be b e t t e r a n d e a sie r to
           fo llow if w e showed the vi deo recording r a t h e r than l i s t e n to the a udio tape.

           I w o u l d not how eve r w i s h to do this w i t h o u t the express c o ns ent of y o u r s e l f
           and y o u r clients.         I w o u l d therefore be grateful if y o u c o u l d please let m e
           k n o w w h e t h e r y ou or your client w o u l d hav e a ny o b j e cti on to the v ide o
           re cording b ein g used at the inquest.

           I w a n t to ma ke it quite c l e a r tha t this is en tirely y o u r d e c i s i o n and if you
           w o u l d p r e f e r that the vid eo is not used, then we w i l l respect your
           w i s h and use the audio tapes.




            Yours    faithfully,

   Dear Sir,

   Re; Hillsborough Resumed Inquests - 19th November 1990

   Thank you for your helpful le tte r of the 31st October following the meeting
   on the 30th October.

   We think th a t the suggestion of presentation of statem en ts may very
   well be a way of presenting m atters in a straight-forw ard way to the
   jury and if, as one hopes, they are straight-forw ard, then they shouldbe
   able to be agreed by the Parties and without the necessity of trying to
   find an agreed e x tra c t from the Taylor Report which is rath er more conten­
   tious.

   It certainly would be most helpful if you were able to circulate these
   statem en ts prior to the s ta r t date, and for our p a rt we will do our best
   to seek im m ediate instructions to let you know whether there is agreem ent.

   There was a suggestion made th a t you would circulate details of the various
   R epresentatives so th a t any necessary contact could be made. We are
   not sure whether this was adopted, but we feel it would be helpful.

   In the same way as a t least one of the other R epresentatives, can we
   say th a t our Mr.Manning will, for the most part, be the person who will
   be attending a t the Inquest, but he does have a number of pre-existing
   com m itm ents, which will cause his absence on some days, in which case
   his Colleague (almost certainly Mr. Poyner) will atten d .

   Yours faithfully,

  Dear Sirs,

                         Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

  With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
  the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
  summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
  Hillsborough disaster.

  I would be most gratefulif you could please study                   the documents         as
  soon as possible and let me know:

  1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
  respect of those matters which are dealt with.

  2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
  specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

  If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
  delete it entirely from the summaries. I will decide what
  action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
  the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

  Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
  be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
  present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
  split.

  There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
  that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
  resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
  them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
  client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
  let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
  current address of your client(s) so that I can formally write to
  them.



  Yours faithfully,




  H.M. Coroner.

  Dear Sirs,

  Re:    RESU MED INQUESTS                19th N O V E M B E R 1990.



  If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
  of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m y ou represent,
  on the 19th of No vember 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue w i l l be no tif i e d in
  due course.

  I do not have to remind you of the fact that a cons ider abl e amount of
  evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
  coronal inve stig ati on w h i c h you wil l recollect is not adv ersarial but
  in quisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

  Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
  under my control, and in particular, it is my r esponsibility to select the
  w it nes ses w h o w i s h to give evidence.  I am at present engaged in con sidering
  this and in de termining w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

  W i t hou t pre judice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g   to you
  to give you an opportunity to dra w to my at tention the names and other
  appropriate details of any w i tne ss or wit nes ses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
  c onsider calli ng to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

  May I please ask you in consid eri ng w h e t h e r you w i s h to dr aw any names           to my
  attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

  I also w a n t to make it absolutely clear that       the s ubmission of a name or
  names for c o n side rat ion is n o th ing mor e than that, and that the dec isi on as
  to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a tte r for me.

  I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
  h ea rd from you by the end of Sep tember I w i l l assume you have no names to
  submit.

Dear Sirs,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:                      RESUMPTION AND REPRESENTATION.


It is my intention to resume the Inauests on Monday the 19th of
November 1990 at 10.a.m. into the deaths of the 95 people who
died on the 15th of April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium.

As I have to take some urgent decisions regarding venue for the
res'umed Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please reply
by return and indicate whether you anticipate:

       i.               That you wish to attend and represent your Olient(s)
                         (if you have not previously been granted representation
                        rights I will assume that an affirmative reply indicates
                        your intention to apply).

       ii.             Whether you expect to appear by Counsel and if so
                       whether it would be by junior or by silk and junior.

       iii.            If your response is positive, do you anticipate being
                       present throughout the Inquest which I expect will run
                        for a period of several weeks.

       Dear Sir,

       HILLSBOROUGH - future disasters

       Ask any cricketer, footballer or tennis-player and they will all tell
       you of run-outs, penalties and line-calls that were obviously wrong.
       However, even a wrong decision keeps the game going and avoids chaos.

      Court decisions are only different in their consequences. Apart from
      ordinary mistake, if evidence is falsified or suppressed the verdict is
      likely to be wrong. Supporters of a cause can argue the case for years
      and, occasionally, bring forward new evidence which leads to a
      different verdict. Even when the verdict is correct, objectors can
      continue arguing because the record for upsetting a verdict at present
      stands at sixteen years, so there is no reason for anyone ever to give
      up.

      It is therefore more important than ever before that the law does not
      have rules restricting the right of anyone to call evidence and be
      represented, so that verdicts may be seen to be correct.

      There should never again be a public enquiry and inquests of the
      Hillsborough type. The Taylor enquiry was rushed through without
      separate representation for individual police officers. As a result,
      vital evidence was not heard or properly considered. When it was
      heard, or part of it, at the inquests, the result was gratifying but
      did not compensate fully for the injustice of the comments in the
      Taylor interim report.

      The coroner was scrupulously fair to all parties but the rules do not
      allow advocates to call their own evidence or address either the
      coroner or the jury on the facts and it was not possible to demonstrate
      the part played by a body of people as distinct from individuals.

      After the next tragedy - and there will certainly be one - the enquiry
      should be conducted in a very different way. The judge should have a
      coroner sitting with him and the inquests should be conducted
      simultaneously and more basically as to medical cause of death. A jury
      may not be required. Only urgent recommendations should be made,
      without fouling the waters for subsequent, more thorough, proceedings.

      Matters relating to negligence and crime, which are properly tried in
      other courts, should be handled carefully and it should be made clear
      that no finding is made on liability and contributory fault, where
      appropriate, so as not to fetter or pre-judge any other proceedings, as
      happened with thg^Taylor enquiry.

    Your ref:

    Dear Sir,

    Hillsborough Inquest

    You may recall that on a previous occasion I prepared a computer
    sorting of alcohol content and times of arrival of the deceased,
    partly from the evidence of Dr. Forest and partly from a
    schedule prepared by or on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday Football
    Club.

    Since then, the coroner has supplied everyone with his own
    schedule which contains other information, some of which the
    coroner indicated may not be relevant for any further purpose.

    I have amended my original schedule to include the ages of the
    deceased and to substitute the coroner's times of arrival. I have
    shortened "Probably Gate C - 14.30 plus" to "After 14.30" to make
    for a narrower column. There are some minor discrepancies in
    times of arrival between the coroner's list and theSWFC list,but
    they do not seem to me to be of great consequence.

   There is a note against No. 51 Kevin Daniel Williams which may
   indicate some special feature of which I am not aware - others may
   well understand it.

   I haVe dispensed with the alphabetical list so that there are now
   two versions - one in the original order, with reference numbers,
   for checking. The other is in order of alcohol content rising
   from zero, through less than 10, to the number of milligrams in
   each case.

   I still have the data on computer in case anyone would like the
   data sorted in some other way for ease of reference. I can also
   reprint quickly if it is discovered that I have made any errors in
   transferring information from the original sources.

   I have given a copy of this letter and of the attached sheets to
   each advocate. If no-one objects, I propose to use the sheets, as
   an aid to questioning of the statistician in due course and would       S   ’
   like the jury to have copies. The unsorted data seems to me to
   be very difficult to follow in any ordered way.

     Dear Sir,

     Hillsborough Disaster inquests                           *             *            *


     In furtherance of our submission at the adjournment of the inquest  I i
     have considered what further evidence I should ask you to bring before /
     to tworL t t e r s " - P             d t0 be abl6 t0 Say that 1 Can conftne myself

     1.      The evidence of Mr. Philip Webfr a civilian farrier who speaks of *
             substantial number, at least 14, of burns caused to a police
             horse by cigarette ends being pressed against the horse,
             }?S                          te *)deresL P art of the horse which required
             its tail to        be lifted before the cigarettes were applied      He
            thJ work               ciJ arettes * ere W l i e d separately and were not
            the work of one man because the pressure necessary to cause such
            severe burns would have put each cigarette out. He oau the hUiBC
            m a i l e d Silverwood, ridden by P.C. Scott) on the day of the
            match, after 3.00 pm, by prior appointment to shoe it.          In our
            view, this evidence is extremely important because the main
            thrust of the argument of counsel for the families appear* to be
            that the movement or the crowd and the pressure they oroated was
            entirely involuntary and that no positive or deliberate fit.pps

                         TaJ'lof' ^ n e v e r t h e l e s s dismissed his evidence as
            relating to an isolated incident without hearing him. I am firmly
            of the opinion that justice cannot be done in relation to this
            Tc    5 r o J j * l,3Tt£ e n 3Ury £*!! a2 opportunlty of hearing Hr. Webb and

            at one the p e r p e t r a t o r ^ ,

    2.     A matter I have mentioned previously is the factual evidence
           concerned with the alcohol content of.the deceased which was
           ascertained by post-mortem examination.  Again, because counsel
           for the families has continued to dismiss the part played bv
           alcohol in the behaviour of the crowd and has persisted in
                                                                                                                                A
           presenting the crowd as happy day-trippers unaffected by a l m h o l
           it is essential that the jury should know that. 51 out of 88
           deceased would have been affected to some extent by alcohol (and
           I are sure there will be expert evidence that in many
           circumstances, particularly the driving of vehicles, even one
           Pint begins to affect judgment) and that 21 out of 88 (25% beina
           d * l ! i L Si ! h ^ l ! s nt ^ ° ? o r !ion) were ov*r the limit of fitneec for
           driving vehicles.             It is further essential to demonstrate that
           the proportion of alcohol in those who came late was
           significantly higher than average.
12   03 Jan 1991   Vincent Hale & Co,   0742 325644            Page 2




        There has already been evidence of 3 or 4 young persons who came
        late and were killed and who had no alcohol whatever but there
        still remains the possibility that 15 or 16 out of 21 (a
        fri^htfininQ pro portion- 711? j of those who came late and were
        prima facie responsible for the ultimate crushing were so
        affected by alcohol as to be unfit to drive a motor vehicle. The
        question of whether there is any reason why those killed from
        the latecomers might have been unrepresentative of the
        latecomers as a whole is of course one for the jury but they
        need the evidence on which to form a view.’

 I would like to have the evidence presented objectively and
 accurately rather than Mr. Marshall having to present it from his own
 knowledge of the evidence, which is to some extent speculative and
 could lead to unseemly argument in cross examination.

 It follows that, if possible, I would like all the evidence
 mentioned in this letter to be brought before the jury before Hr
 Marshall gives his evidence.

 I have spoken briefly to Mr. Webb and have two addresses and three
      ’       ‘    *   him.

    Dear Sir,

    Hillsborough Inquests - Video Recordings


    Thank you for your letter of 13th November on which we have taken
    instructions.

    Our client is willing to have the video recording of his interviews
    shown to the Jury and we respectfully agree that they are likely to
    prove clearer and more comprehensible than the audio tapes alone.

    Whilst on the subject of video recordings, we are not sure whether it
    is your intention to show the videos of the Leppings Lane area and the
    turnstiles for the 1988 semi-final and the 1989 semi-final
    simultaneously on two screens.  In our view, such a viewing, showing
    the very substantial difference between the times of arrival and the
    behaviour of the crowds outside the turnstiles in such a comparative
    way is essential to a proper understanding of what happened on the
    fatal day.

    We know that the West Midlands Police have the facility for showing
    two videos simultaneously.  If not, we can assist in that respect.

     We also confirm our brief telephone call today as a matter of courtesy
     to enquire whether you would have any objection to Mr. Hale taking his
     notes in the modern fashion on a lap top computer which is virtually
     silent in operation instead of attempting to make notes on paper.

    We would undertake, of course, to discontinue if it were to prove
    distracting to any of the other parties involved and would be prepared
    to move to a position at the back of the council chamber if necessary
    to avoid any distraction.

     Yours faithfully
     VINCENT HMLB & CO.

FILE NOTE DATED 13.10.90   (Solicitor Vincent Hale & Co).

TELEPHONE CALL TO STAN BEECHEY

He will reply to the letter of Mr. Hale dated 12.11.90.     I

told him to make it clear that there was no question of him

calling witnesses.   Inquests are NOT adversarial and the

number, nature and extent of witnesses and the scope of

this evidence was a matter for me.   I said we had to be

really firm about this.

         Dea r Sir,

          Re H I L L S B O R O U G H INQUESTS           - VI D EO RECORDINGS.



          Y ou w i l l of course be' aware that yo ur client w as i nt erviewed under the PACE
          p ro cedure and that this int er vi ew was audio taped in the usual manner.

          I also u n d e r s t a n d that in addition to the audio tape, a video recording of
          the interviews was prepared.                  This video recording b e in g h o w ev er so to speak
          extra statutory.           I u nd er s t a n d that it w as done w i t h the consent of your
          client, and on the un de rs t a n d i n g that it w o u l d not be use d in proceedings.

          It is my        intention to have the audio tapes p layed to the Jury at an
          a p propriate point in the resum ed Inquests.

          It occurs to me h o w ev e r that if the video r ec ording is of good enough quality
          (which I in fact u nd er st an d “it is), that it might be b e tt er and easier to
          follo w if we showed the video rec ording rather than listen to the audio tape.

          I w o u l d not h o w ev er w i s h to do this w i th ou t the expres s consent of yourself
          and you r clients.            I w o u l d therefore be grateful if y ou could please let me
          k n o w w h e t h e r y o u or your clie nt w o u l d have any ob j ec ti on to the video
           r e cording b e i n g used at the inquest.

           I   w a n t to mak e         it quite clear that this is e ntirely y ou r deci s io n and if you
          w o u l d pr efer that the video is not used,                        then we w i l l   respect your
          w i s h and use the audio tapes.




           Yours        faithfully,

  Dear Sirs,

                        Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

  With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
  the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
  summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
  Hillsborough disaster.

  I would be most 'grateful if you could please study the documents as
  soon as possible and let me know:

  1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
  respect of those matters which are dealt with.

  2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
  specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

  If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
  delete it entirely from the summaries. I will decide what
  action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
  the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

  Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
  be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
  present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
  split.

 There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
 that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
 resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
 them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
 client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
 let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
 current address of your client(s) so that I c a n formally write to
 them.



 Yours faithfully,




 H.M. Coroner.

          Dear Sirs,

          Re: RESU ME D INQUESTS                 19th N O V E M B E R 1990.



          If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
          of the 95 people w ho died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m y ou represent,
          on the 19th of N ovember 1990 at 10.a.m.  Details of venue will be n o t i f i e d in
          due course.

          I do n ot have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
          ev idence has already be en taken, no r of the nature and limitations of a
          coronal in vestigation w h i c h yo u wi ll recollect is not adversarial but
          i nquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

          Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
          under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
          wit ne ss es who w i s h to give evidence.    I am at present engaged in c o ns id er in g
          this and in deter mi ni ng w h o I w i s h to invite to attend.

          W i t h ou t prejudice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
          to give you an oppor tu ni t y to dr aw to my at tention the nam es and other
          appropriate details of any w i tn es s or wi tn esses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
          co nsider ca lling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

          May I please ask you in c o n si de r in g w h e th er you w i s h to dr aw any names        to my
          attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

          I also wa nt to make it a bsolutely clear that the submiss ion of a name or
          names for consider at io n is n o t h i n g more than that, and that the dec is io n as
          to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

           I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
           heard from you by the end of Se ptember I will assume you have no names to
           submit.

   Your Ref: HILLS/SOL/3.   18th September 1990

   Dear Sir,

   Hillsborough Disaster - Superintendent R. Marshall.

   Thank you for your letter of 12th September.
   We would have hoped that now the DPP has indicated that there will
   be no criminal charges against our client, we could withdraw
   gracefully from this matter.

   Unfortunately, we understand that the complaints of certain
   relatives cannot be disposed of until after the inquest has been
   concluded because the evidence on which the Chief Constable would
   base his response to those complaints will not be available until
   then.

   It is clear from reports we have read in the press that the
   relatives of victims are by no means ready to abandon their
   particular view of this tragedy and will be seeking, in addition
   to continuing their complaints to the Police Authority, to bring
   private prosecutions alleging criminal responsibility.

   In these circumstances, we regret that we cannot withdraw from the
   matter and we must maintain the attitude expressed at very great
   length in our letter to Detective Chief Superintendent Foster of
   West Midlands Police dated 6th June 1990 - which should be in the
   file of papers in your possession.

   In brief, that letter invited the complainants to take a more
   objective view of the overall responsibility of virtually all
   concerned in the matter, including the very substantial number of
   Liverpool fans who it is alleged came late without tickets and
   substantially inebriated with the intention of forcing the gates
   to obtain access. Their part in what subsequently took place
   ought to be obvious but it appears that the relatives are
   determined to ignore the part played by the fans and to say that
   the police and virtually the police alone were responsible for the
   deaths.

   In these circumstances, we may have to insist as far as we are
   able (and we appreciate that you have the final word in all such
   matters) on bringing forward the substantial evidence which we
   mention in Para 6 on the first page of our letter of 6 th June and
   which was for whatever reason not made public at the Taylor
   enquiry. We anticipate being involved only in the early stages of
   the enquiry i.e. that part connected with the build-up of the
   crowd outside, leading to the opening of the gates. We shall not
   be directly concerned with what happened afterwards.

   We therefore expect to be present only part of the time -
   presumably early on. We do not propose to appear by counsel but
   shall be rep/resented by the writer, Mr. Vincent Hale.

   Your Ref: HILLS/SOL/3.             20th September 1990

   Dear Sir,

   Hillsborough Disaster - Superintendent R. Marshall.

   Thank you for your letter of 19th September, which crossed with
   ours of 18th September.

   As we said in that letter, we appreciate the extent of your
   powers as regards the calling of evidence and the conduct of the
   inquest. We have no wish to challenge them.

   We are content to await the outcome of your deliberations and the
   representations which will be made to you by other interested
   parties.

   If it is your intention to refuse to be drawn into a further
   investigation into the alleged culpability of the police - my
   client in particular - and to refuse to allow representatives of
   the relatives to use the inquest as a platform for furthering
   their particular view of the matter to obtain support for
   private prosecutions, we shall have little or nothing to add to
   what is already known.

   If the relatives persist in trying to probe further into the
   control of the crowd before the match and the events which led to
   the opening of the gates, we should like to call Detective Chief
   Superintendent Foster of the West Midlands Police to produce the
   statements taken by his force relating to the pre-match conduct of
   supporters and then to call a selected number of the persons who
   gave those statements._____ ^

Dear Sirs,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER?                     RESUMPTION AMD REPRESENTATION.


It is my intention to resume the Inauests on Monday the 19th of
November 1990 at 10.a.m. into the deaths of the 95 people who
died on the 15th of April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium.

As I have to take some urgent decisions regarding venue for the
resumed Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please reply
by return and indicate whether you anticipate:

       i.               That you wish to attend and represent your Glient(s)
                         (if you have not previously been granted representation
                        rights I will assume that an affirmative reply indicates
                        your intention to apply).

       ii.              Whether you expect to appear by Counsel and if so
                        whether it would be by junior or by silk and junior.

       iii*             If your response is positive, do you anticipate being
                        present throughout the Inquest which I expect will run
                         for a period of several weeks.


Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

           I would genuinely prefer to let bygones be byyon«?s.
           Superintendent Marshall obviously has s o m e s e a r i n g e x p e r i e n c e
           that he could put at the d i s p o s a l of any F o r c e m a k i n g p l a n s Tor
           another major football match, but he will not be asked whilst this
           investigation continues.   Your own services, and thosf* of you r
           men, could also, with respect, be better employed.

           It would be very difficult for one police force to suggest that,
           charges against another police force should be dropped without a
           full i n v e s t i g a t i o n t There could be allegations of mutual
           back-scratching, but, again, the circu m s t a n c e s ar1*2 unusual.   There
           has already been a full investigation - and 76 r e c o m m e n d a t ions of
           which, as I mention in my main letter, only 15 directly conrerr.
           the police*          The civil proceedings and the inquest are to corae.
           Many people would think that enough is enough.

           It is obviously necessary for the complainants to be advised
           independently whether or not they should continue with their
           complaints.  I expect they have solicitors in respect of their
           civil claims, who are the obvious ones to advise them and takf? the
           decision entirely out of police hands.  With proper handling, an
           agreed statement could be prepared which would not cause the
           victims organisation to lose any ground in their civil claims.
           There could indeed be a substantial gain to the relatives of the
           dead fans from an act of generosity and they would avoid any
           danger of losing public sympathy by being tarred with the sane
           brush as those fans who the evidence will show went far beyond
           reasonable behaviour.

           I may not be thanked by the police insurers for expressing an
           opinion that civil proceedings by the relatives and injured -\mnot
           fail but I stressed "against someone" not necessarily the p o l c e
           alone.  Between the civil actions and the compensation fund, I am
           sure that many people will think that everything possible has been
           done to compensate the victims and that a continued desire to
           punish Superintendent Marshall (leave aside the other police
           officers for the moment because I do not act for them and am not
           authorised to make any proposals on their behalf) whilst so many
           others with greater responsibility go free, may cause a backlash.

           I hope that whoever has the responsibility will accept this
           request as a serious one and not as a mere tactic to avoid the
           consequences of wrong-doing.  As in many instances where
           substantial costs and effort are required and the outcome is not
           clear-cut, there is a duty on all solicitors at least to enquire
           whether the dispute may be settled amicably, ’out of court'.

           Yours faithfully,
           VINCENT HALE

  Dear Sirs,

                         Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

  With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
  the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
  summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
  Hillsborough disaster.

  I would be most grateful if you could please study the documents as
  soon as possible and let me know:

 1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
 respect of those matters which are dealt with.

 2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
 specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

 If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
 delete it entirely from the summaries. I will decide what
 action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
 the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

 Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
 be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
 present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
 split.                                                       6

There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
current address of your client(s) so that I can formally write to
them.



Yours faithfully.

       If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
       of the 95 people w ho died at Hillsborough, one or mo re of w h o m you represent,
       on the 19th of Nove mb er 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue will be n o t i f i e d in
       due course.

       I do not have to remind you of the fact that a con sid er ab le amount of
       evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
       coronal in vestigation w h i c h you wi ll recollect is not adversarial but
       inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

       Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
       un de r my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
       wi tn ess es w ho w i s h to give evidence.   I am at present engaged in consi der in g
       this and in deter min in g w ho I w i s h to invite to attend.

       W i t h o u t prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
       to give you an o pportunity to d r a w to my attention the names and other
       a p propriate details of any witness or wit nesses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
       c o n si der calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       May I please ask you in consid eri ng w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names         to my
       attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also wa nt to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for con sid er ati on is n o th ing more than that, and that the d e c i sio n as
       to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

       I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       hear d from you by the end of S ep tember I wil l assume you have no names to
       submit.

Dear Sirs,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:                      RESUMPTION AND REPRESENTATION.


It is my intention to resume the Inauests on Monday the 19th of
November 1990 at 10.a.m. into the deaths of the 95 people who
died on the 15th of April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium.

As I have to take some urgent decisions regarding venue for the
resumed Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please reply
by return and indicate whether you anticipate:

        i*              That you wish to attend and represent your Glient(s)
                         (if you have not previously been granted representation
                        rights I will assume that an affirmative reply indicates
                        your intention to apply).

        ii.             Whether you expect to appear by Counsel and if so
                        whether it would be by junior or by silk and junior.

        iii«            If your response is positive, do you anticipate being
                        present throughout the Inquest which I expect will run
                         for a period of several weeks.


Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

                  Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990


Thank you for your letter of 14th November 1990.

I am unclear whether apart from the 2 specific points raised by you
you are objecting to the factual content of the draft summaries as I
find it difficult to understand how one can not dispute the veracity
of what is stated and at the same time dispute the factual correctness.

If there are any details of facts in the draft documents which you or
your client feel are inaccurate please specify them so that if
necessary they can be researched.

It is clearly impossible to recirculate the draft documents and we
will have to deal with any outstanding matters at the resumed hearings.
This also applies to some of your other points which I think are better
dealt with at the hearings anyway.

I cannot quite understand the third paragraph from the end of your
letter. A substantial list of names of possible witnesses was circulate
some time ago. Did you not receive this?

The proposed daily list of witnesses for the first few days has also
now been circulated and I hope that this has been received by you.



Yours faithfully.

Dear Sir

Hillsborough - Resumed Inquests

We refer to your letter dated 8 th November and the attached summaries.
We have considered the facts with our Client, Chief Superintendent D G
Duckenfield.

We would wish to make some general points as to the nature of the facts
upon which you seek agreement.

Firstly,   the most significant point is that a quantity of detail
contained in the factual summaries was not within our Client's knowledge
at the time of the disaster, and, therefore, cannot have had any bearing
on decisions made or not made by him.

Secondly, we trust you will appreciate that certain of the facts comprise
information which has only been obtained subsequent to the disaster and
again, cannot be said to have had any influence on our Client with regard
to the events of the day.     Accordingly, our Client would not wish to
challenge the veracity of much of what is stated, but we would wish to
place on record that this is not to say that he would necessarily accept
that certain of the detail is factually correct.

Our Client has some specific comment to make in respect of the two draft
proposals:-

First draft commencing "the present road network                                                "

Pages 3/4             "Police arrangements"

With regard to the distribution of manpower, our Client considers that so
far as he was aware at the time of the disaster, manpower levels for the
1989 semi-final had been reduced from those of 1988. This decision was
made by others and he was not a party to it. Based on calculations made
by our Client, we understand the respective total Police manpower levels
to be 901 in 1988 and 729 in 1989. Perhaps the representatives of the

CONTINUATION



   Chief Constable of South Yorkshire can assist in resolving this apparent
   discrepancy.

   Second draft commencing "Sheffield Wednesday Football Club     "

   Page 5

   At paragraph 5 thereof, that prior to the match our Client was not made
   aware of the facility of the board and its capability to display messages
   prior to the match.

   As to the final paragraph of this page, our Client advises that the 1981
   semi-final and any facts relating to that match were never brought to his
   attention prior to 1989 semi-final, so far as he can recall.

   Can you advise whether it is your intention to provide the jury with a
   copy of the summary, as agreed, if appropriate?

   Of additions or deletions suggested by others, we trust that you will
   submit a copy of the amended draft to us for our consideration. Given the
   proximity to the Inquests reconvening, perhaps such a draft could be
   provided on the first morning when submissions are being made?

   As a final point, you did indicate that you would give consideration to
   providing in advance lists of witnesses which you are intending to call
   to give evidence. We would ask that such advance notice is given as soon
   as possible to enable us to consider how best to represent our Client's
   interests.

   The Writer was requested to forward a copy of this letter to Detective
   Superintendent Beechey and has done so by fax today.

   Should you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact
   the Writer, Mr/covyghlin.

Dear Sirs

Resumed Hillsborough Inquests on 19th November 1990

Thank you for your letters dated 6th and 8th November.

With regard to your list of witnesses, we note you make no reference to
the witnesses indicated by us in our letters to you dated 2nd and 17th
October save for Wilfred Eastwood the Consulting Engineer.  Can we take
it, therefore, that you do not propose to call Mr J D Phillips, Mr P F
Hayes and J D Tattersall of the Health and Safety Executive and the
report from Elrond Engineering Limited?

As to the summaries of the facts sent under the cover of your letter of
8th November, we are considering the documents and will provide you with
any observations we ha^e as soon as we are able.

Yoprq faithfully

  Dear Sirs,

                         Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

  With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
  the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
  summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
  Hillsborough disaster.

  I would be most grateful if you could please study the documents as
  soon as possible and let me know:

   1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
   respect of those matters which are dealt with.

   2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
   specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

  If we cannot agree a particular point than it may be necessary to
  delete it entirely from the summaries. I will decide what
  action is needed in the light of any comments and in relation to
  the importance or otherwise of the point that is disputed.

  Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
  be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
  present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
  split.

  There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
  that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
  resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
  them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
  client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
  let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
  current address of your client(s) so that I c a n formally write to
  them.



  Yours fiithfully,




                roner.

  Dear Mr Popper

  Resumed Inquests 19th November 1990 - Chief
  Superintendent D G Duckenfield

  We refer to your letter of the 19th September together with our
  subsequent telephone conversation on the 27th, wherein you helpfully
  indicated that you would be prepared to allow us to draw to your
  attention the names of any witnesses whom we would like you to call after
  the end of September.

  To avoid un-necessary duplication we have written to Hammond Suddards who
  represent South Yorkshire Police, and their Insurers, and asked them for
  a copy of the list of witnesses which we understand they have sent to
  you. Subject to sight of that list we may wish to submit further names.

  We can say, however, that we would wish you to consider evidence from the
  following:-

  1.            J D Phillips BA, the Deputy Chief Constable of Devon & Cornwall
                with regard to his inquiry and report into the Hillsborough Stadium
                disaster. We understand that you have a copy of this substantial
                200 page document already.

  2.            P F Hayes and J D Tattersall of the Health and Safety Executive
                Research and Laboratory Services - produced a report entitled
                "The Hillsborough Incident 15 4 89; examination of crash barriers
                from pens 3 and 4".

                We have only received a draft copy of this report and therefore
                requested a full copy from the South Yorkshire Police. Upon receipt
                we will forward a copy to you, as we would wish the authors to give
                evidence.

  3.            South Yorkshire Police Consulting Engineer. We have written to
                Hammond Suddards asking for a copy of the report and authority to
                send to you a copy as we anticipate we will wish you to call
                evidence of its content.

 Dear Sir

 Re:        Hillborough Resumed Inquests

 Thank you for your letter dated 15th October.

 We confirm that a representative will attend on behalf of Chief Superintendent
 Duckenfield at the review to take place on Tuesday 30th October at the
 Medico-Legal Centre.

 We refer back to our letter of 2nd October listing the evidence we wish
 you to consider and enclose a copy of that letter for ease of reference.
 You will see at paragraph 3 reference to the consulting engineer. We now
 have the full copy of that report prepard by Elrond Engineering Limited,
 4 Highfield Road, Edgbaston, Birmingham B15 3ED. The report is dated August
 1990 and runs to three volumes.

 We understand from Messrs Hammond Suddards they have already submitted
 a full copy of the report to you in support of their representation on
 behalf of the Chiefr Constable/of South Yorkshire. We consider this evidence
 to be fundamental Lo aft least? explaining in part the deaths at Hillsborough.

Telephone call from Mr.               solicitors for Mr. Duckenfield.
T h e y w a n t e d to k n o w one or two deta i l s about the inquests

1.   Was I going to ask Mr. Duckenfield to repeat his evidence 95 times.
     I said no.

2.   Was I intending just to call him once?
     I said "Yes" but I might have to recall him either because of
     new evidence or because it might be convenient for coronological
     reasons.

3.   Was I intending to get information from
     I said I had been asked about this, I said I wasn't getting the
     transcripts, I didn't feel the civil trial had any specific
     bearing on the inquests though if anything were to come out of it,
     and it was drawn to my attention I would obviously consider the
     matter.

     He ask whether I was saying then that unless solicitors drew points
     to my   attention I would not use what was said at the civil trial.
     I said that was not the case, I might well find out things my myself
     what I was trying to say   was that the inquest was independent of
     the civil trial,but I would feel free to consider anything else
     that I found out or was drawn to my attention.

4.   He wanted to know that I   was going to utilise the transcripts. I
     said probably not unless   a particular part was entirely agreed
     by all the parties and then enly of course if it was r e l e v e n t . My
     present intention was to hear evidence   and I pointed out that I
     had a jury to consider.

5.   He wanted to know the fomat of the inquest.   I said that I had not
     yet formalised this, I would probably circulate to solicitors
     cnae I had a rough outline, reserving the right of course to make
     changes if I thought it was necessary or desirable.

6.   He said that he had heard that that Hammond Suddard had a big
     dosier from an expert, would I be prepared to consider.      I asked
     him to name the person, he said it was Mr. Phillips.      I said I
     already had , the papers on this were already in our possession
     although I had not yet seen them.    I would obviously consider
     whether or not I needed to call.

7.   He asked whether if they had any              evidence they wanted
     me to consider they should send copies of the document to me.
     I said that if we already had them in the system that seemed to be
     unnecessary, I suggest he check with Mr. Jones and I gave him his
     phone number in Chester.  I said if we didn't have them obviously
     we would need copied so that I could think about i t .

        Dear Sirs,

        Re:   RES UME D INQUESTS 19th NOV EM BER 1990.



        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 1 0 . a.m.  Details of venue w i l l be n o t i f i e d in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, n or of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal i nvestigation w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not adversarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
        un de r m y control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        wi tn e s s e s w h o w i s h to give evidence. I am at present engaged in con si d e r i n g
        this and in determ in ing w h o I w i s h to invite                 to attend.

        With ou t prejudice in any w a y to m y rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
        to give you an oppo rt un ity to dra w to my attention the names and other
        appropriate details of any witn ess or wi tn ess es w h o m you w o u l d like me to
        cons id er calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        M a y I please ask you in consi der in g w h e t h e r you w i s h to dra w any names         to my
        attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

         I also wan t to make it absol ut ely clear that the submission of a name or
         names for co ns ide ra ti on is n o t h i n g more than that, and that the d e c i si on as
         to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

         I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
         heard from you by the end of September I w i l l assume you have no names to
         submit.

         Yours      faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:                      RESUMPTION AMD REPRESENTATION.


It is my intention to resume the Inauests on Monday the 19th of
November 1990 at 10.a.m. into the deaths of the 95 people who
died on the 15th of April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium.

As I have to take some urgent decisions regarding venue for the
resumed Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please reply
by return and indicate whether you anticipate:

        i.              That you wish to attend and represent your Client(s)
                         (if you have not previously been granted representation
                        rights I will assume that an affirmative reply indicates
                        your intention to apply).

        ii.             Whether you expect to appear by Counsel and if so
                        whether it would be by junior or by silk and junior.

        iii*            If your response is positive, do you anticipate being
                        present throughout the Inquest which I expect will run
                        for a period of several weeks.


Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

         Dear Sirs,

         HILLSBOROUGH RESUMED INQUESTS.


         Thank you for your letter of the 5th of September.     With regard to your three
         questions:-

             1.   The date has not yet been fixed.

             2.   I am not yet in a position to give you the
                   information which you have requested.

             3.   We have not yet decided which witnesses to call
                   but I think it is likely that Chief Superintendent
                   Duckenfield will be asked to give evidence.


         Yours faithfully,




         S.L.Popper,

Dear Sir

Hillsborough - Resumption of Inquests

As you know, we are instructed on behalf of Chief Superintendent David
Duckenfield in respect of matters arising out of the Hillsborough
disaster.

Now that the decision has been taken by the DPP not to bring criminal
charges arising out of the Hillsborough incident, we presume that you
will resume the Inquests on behalf of those who died.

In order to enable us to properly advise our Client, it would be most
helpful if you would kindly answer the following questions

1.       The expected date upon which the Inquests will resume.

2.       The anticipated duration of the resumed hearings.

3.       Whether it will be your intention to call Chief Superintendent
         Duckenfield to give evidence in respect of any of the Inquests.

It would be appreciated if your reply could be given in the near future,
and should you require any further information please do not hesitate to
speak to the Writ air, /Mr C Coughlin.

Dear Sirs

Hillsborough Inquest commencing 18th April 1990

We refer to Mr Coughlin's telephone conversation with Mr Popper on the
19th March and confirm that Hepworth & Chadwick act on behalf of Chief
Superintendent David Duckenfield in connection with his personal position
in relation to the Hillsborough disaster.

As discussed, it is likely that we would wish to attend the Inquest to
represent Chief Inspector Duckenfield's interest, certainly in the early
stages.

We note from the telephone conversation that the Inquest is to commence
at 10.30.am. on 18th April 1990 in Sheffield. Would you please confirm
the venue for the Inquest in due course and also note our interest.

The Writer, Mr Coughlin, .was most grateful for the information provided
by you during our telephone c<^versatAon.

     Dear Sir
     Hillsborough Resumed Xnaueat

     You will be aware of various questions which have been raised during
     the Inquests, particularly by Richard Payne, Counsel for South
     Yorkshire Police, relating to exit routes and means of escape from the
     West Terrace, With respect to Mr Payne we personally doubt the
     relevance of such questions to the events which occurred on 15th April
              we accePt     course that, subject always to your own views
     and decisions, the parties should be free to pursue any lines of
     inquiry which they may consider appropriate.
     Dr Eastwood of our clients will be able to assist with regard to exit
     routes and times when he gives his evidence, However, the question
     of ingress and egress from the ground generally, as well as in times
•    of emergency, was a matter for the Officer Working Party. Our clients
     are not members of the Officer working Party, but were only invited
     to attend at particular meetings such as the annual inspection of the
     ground.     The Officer Working Party included in particular
     representatives of the Fire Service, who were primarily concerned with
     the evacuation of the ground in an emergency. We note that the
     present list of those witnesses you propose calling does not include
     any representative from the Fire Service. Mr Alan Seaman of the Fire
     Service gave evidence to the Public Inquiry chaired by Lord Justice
     Taylor. If you were minded to call someone from the Fire Service to
     give evidence, then we would suggest that he would be the appropriate
     person to be called.
     We trust that this will be of some assistance to you.
     Yours faithfully

 Dear Sir

 Hillsborough Resumed Inquest

 You will be aware of various questions which have been raised during
 the Inquests, particularly by Richard Payne, Counsel for South
 Yorkshire Police, relating to exit routes and means of escape from the
 West Terrace.    With respect to Mr Payne we personally doubt the
 relevance of such questions to the events which occurred on 15th April
 1989 but we accept of course that, subject always to your own views
 and decisions, the parties should be free to pursue any lines of
 inquiry which they may consider appropriate.

 Dr Eastwood of our clients will be able to assist with regard to exit
 routes and times when he gives his evidence.      However, the question
 of ingress and egress from the ground generally, as well as in times
 of emergency, was a matter for the Officer Working Party. Our clients
 are not members of the Officer Working Party, but were only invited
 to attend at particular meetings such as the annual inspection of the
 ground.      The  Officer  Working   Party    included   in  particular
 representatives of the Fire Service, v/ho were primarily concerned with
 the evacuation of the ground in an emergency.         We note that the
 present list of those witnesses you propose calling does not include
 any representative from the Fire Service. Mr Alan Seaman of the Fire
 Service gave evidence to the Public Inquiry chaired by Lord Justice
 Taylor.   If you were minded to call someone from the Fire Service to
 give evidence, then we would suggest that he would be the appropriate
 person to be called.

 We trust that this will be of some assistance to you.

 Yours faithfully

represented.




       During the period when South Yorkshire County Council were
the Licensing Authority, the ground was inspected by the Working
Party twice a y e a r .          On these occasions representatives of the
Club, including Eastwood & Partners, were invited to be present
to accompany the Working Party on its tour of the ground.                          On
a few occasions the Working Party had private discussions during
the course of the visit at which the Club and Eastwood & Partners
were not present.
       In between the two visitations to the ground per year, the
Working    Party held formal meetings.                 The    Club and Eastwood     &
Partners were never invited to these meetings but often knew that
a meeting had taken place because the decisions of the Working
Party were communicated in writing or orally by Mr. Vaughan, the
convenor.           it      is   also    understood    that    the   Working    Party
sometimes carried out its function by correspondence.
      When Sheffield City Council became the Licensing Authority
the frequency of visits by the Working Party to the ground was
reduced to one per y e a r .            Eastwood & Partners have no knowledge
of any other meetings             which were     held between April       1986   and
April 1989.


Eastwoods Proposals               Re-org anisation of Leppings Lane End IQ a b


      The statement in the last line of the final paragraph on
page 1 that the Eastwood proposals were                 'rejected' by the Club
may be incorrect,           it was Eastwood & Partners' understanding that
the club decided not to proceed for the time being rather than
rejecting the proposals outright.
                                                                                         3.

Page .2,


        In the fourth paragraph, the statement that gates A, B and
C were built in 1985 is incorrect.                    Gates A and C were already
in existence at their present locations when Eastwood & Partners
were appointed consulting engineers to the Club in 1979.                               The
gate B was also in existence but it was moved at the time when
two of the turnstiles were moved as part of the modifications in
1985.        The two turnstiles now known as A and B were added to
turnstiles previously numbered 19 - 23 to make a block of seven
now named A         - G.         The   turnstiles now known           as A and B were
previously known as numbers 17 and 1 8 , being the last two of a
continuous      block       of   18.      Gate    B    was   in     the   space     between
turnstiles 18 - 19 on Eastwood & Partners drawing 6705/1.                            It was
relocated as shown on Eastwood & Partners drawing 6705/8A.                                  In
effect it was resited about 3m further north.


E-age 3
The Tunnel


        In    the   third    paragraph     it    is    stated     that    the   tunnel      is
 22.17m      long   and    unlit.        There   is    in    fact    electric     lighting
within the tunnel for normal use plus emergency lighting operated
 from the battery system.
      In the fourth line of the same paragraph 4, it would be
 more      accurate   to    say     "descending       towards     the     terrace    with     a
 varying gradient which reaches a maximum of around 1 in 6 over
 a length of about 2 m M .


 Gates at Top of Radial Fence


         In paragraph 5 on page 3 there is a statement ''thus there
 is unrestricted access to each enclosure if these gates are left
 open".       That statement is incorrect if the requirements of the
Licensing Authority are obeyed.               In a letter dated 14 September
1981 to Eastwood & Partners, the Licensing Authority in paragraph
1 (c) said that the two new gates in the radial barriers on the
west terrace were to be under Police control.                   This reflects the
minutes of the private meeting of the Working Party held on 11
September 1981,       item 2(iii).
       If the gates were under          Police       control,    it would not be
possible for anyone in enclosure 3 or 4 to enter enclosures 2 or
5 or vice versa without Police permission.


Barrier Type,*;


       It is probably incorrect to say that the older type barriers
were fitted by Husband & Co.             It is highly likely that all the
older type barriers were fabricated and fitted round about 1930.
The    level   of   the   concrete     deck    was    raised    relative   to     the
barriers slightly at some later date, possibly under the control
of Husband & Co. when the West stand was built in 1965.


Page 4
Area ,.Qf N o rth W est Terrace


       In paragraph 4 it is said that the capacity of the North
West   terrace      was   calculated    with    the    wrong    scale.     That    is
incorrect.     The scale of the drawing as a whole was correct but
the shape of the North West terrace was incorrectly shown.
       A wrong impression might be obtained from comparing the 2900
with the revised capacity on the new safety certificate of 1500.
The down-grading included not only an allowance for the reduced
area but also for the fact that many of the spectators had to
view the pitch through the glazed screen at the western end of
the North stand.


Capacity.of Enclosures


       The Eastwood drawing with the figures 1 2 0 0 and 1000 was
       ^OOD & PARTNERS




 never sent to the Licensing Authority,         the Police or the Fire
 Service,    so far as Eastwood & Partners are aware,      so that none
 o  these interested parties would have known of or would have
 relied upon them.


 Page 6
 Designation of the


        In paragraph 4 , the issuing of the safety certificate on 21
 December 1979 should not be coupled with the club's promotion to
       second division.      The club were not promoted until the end
Of the season some four months after the safety certificate was
issued.


c o mposition of Spc&ts Grounds Adv isory flrnip


         is ^ c o r r e c t to say that Sheffield Wednesday Football
Club and Eastwood * Partners were members of the Advisory Group

                 PartnerS ” ere nover          to be members and never
 ssumed    the    rolo of member.       They were not involved in the
private discussions of the Advisory Group and did not receive
copies of correspondence or minutes of meetings.

 Dear Sirs,

              Hillsborough Resumed Inquest starting 19th Nov. 1990
                  i
 Notwithstanding your letter of 17th October 1990 in which you informed
 me that you would neither be attending nor representing your clients
 at the resumed inquests I feel that I have to write to you again.

 You may be aware that your client has already been informed that he
 will be required to attend as a witness in due course though the date
 and time has not yet been determined but is not likely to be for
 several weeks after the start of the inquests.

 You will also be aware that at these resumed inquests we will in the
 main and in a word be looking at the "How" of the incident.
 It is quite possible that during the hearings evidence may be given
 which in the words of Rule 25 of the Coroner's Rules 1984 may call
 into question the conduct of Dr. Eastwood or indeed possibly his firm.

  As I understand Rule 25 there does not seem to be any obligation on
  a person whose conduct is called in question to be present at the
  inquest but the rule indicates that he should be aware of the
  proceedings.

  I would therefore be obliged if you could reply as soon as possible
  ( my FAX number is 0742 726 247 ) and confirm that Dr. Eastwood and
  his firm are aware of the proceedings and that neither your clients
  nor you for that matter require a formal letter of notification to be
  sent. If you cannot give me this confirmation I would wish to write
  to Dr. Eastwood as soon as possible.

  I have assumed that Eastwood and Partners are a partnership. I notice
  however that on the letter heads Dr. Eastwood and three others are
  described as Directors. Could you please at your convenience let me
  know the status of Eastwood and Partners ie partnership or
  corporation.


  Yours faithfully.

         Dear Sirs,

         Re: Hillsborough Resumed Inquest - Dr. Eastwood.

         Thank you for your letter of the 17th of October. I had of course noted
         what you had said in your earlier correspondence, though I draw your
         attention to your letter of the 13th of September where you say that you may
         wish to be present as observers on selected occasions.

         Apart from that particular comment, I also felt it right that you should be
         aware of what is going on. It is of course entirely a matter for you and
         your clients as to whether or not you are represented at the Inquests.


         Yours faithfully,




         S.L.Popper,

         Re: HILLSBOROUGH RESUMED INQUESTS.

         I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
         exchange of views to take place between myself and representatives on
         procedural matters, with the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
         Inquests proper run smoothly with the minimum amount of delay and to the best
         advantage.

         1 have now decided that this review should take place on Tuesday
         30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield at
         2 p.m.

         Although this meeting is intended for legal representatives, I would not
         raise any objection if interested parties wished to attend to see what was
         going on, subject of course to us not exceeding the space availability at
         the Medico Legal Centre.

          I would be grateful if you could please confirm to me that you would like to
          attend the review.


          Yours faithfully,




         W.L.Vfpp,

        Dear Sirs,

        Re: RESUMED INQUESTS 19th NOVEMBER 1990.


        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of whom you represent,
        on the 19th of November 1990 at 10.a.m. Details of venue will be notified in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal investigation which you will recollect is not adversarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and which of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the Coroners’ Act 1988 and the Coroners’ Rules, the Inquest is
        under my control, and in particular, it is. my responsibility to select the
        witnesses who wish to give evidence. I am at present engaged in considering
        this and in determining who I wish to     invite to attend.

        Without prejudice in any way to my rights in the matter, I am writing to you
        to give you an opportunity to draw to     my attention the names and other
        appropriate details of any witness or     witnesses whom youwould like meto
        consider calling to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

        May I please ask you in considering whether you wish to draw any names to my
        attention, to bear in mind the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

        I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
        names for consideration is nothing more than that, and that the decision as
        to who to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

        I would be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
        heard from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
        submit.

        Yours faithfully.

Dear Sirs,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER:                      RESUMPTION AND REPRESENTATION.


It is my intention to resume the Inquests on Monday the 19th of
November 1990 at 10.a.m. into the deaths of the 95 people who
died on the 15 th of April 1989 at Hillsborough Stadium.

As I have to take some urgent decisions regarding venue for the
resumed Inquest, I would be grateful if you could please reply
by return and indicate whether you anticipates

        i*              That you wish to attend and represent your Client(s)
                         (if you have not previously been granted representation
                        rights I will assume that an affirmative reply indicates
                        your intention to apply).

        ii.             Whether you expect to appear by Counsel and if so
                         whether it would be by junior or by silk and junior.

        111   .         If your response is positive, do you anticipate being
                        present throughout the Inquest which I expect will run
                        for a period of several weeks.

      Dear Sir

       18th April               1990 - Interim Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough

      Thank you for your letter of 9th April.

      We confirm that our clients, Eastwood & Partners, shall have a
      representative attending the first day of the Inquest on 18th
      April 1990 as an observer only. That person shall be Catherine

      days    on which   the  Inquests for Raymond Thomas      Chapman

      would like to be present on those occasions as well.

Dear Sir or Madam,

Re:     18th April 1990 - Interim Resumed Inquests - Hillsborough

I am writing to inform you that the venue for the above will be the
Memorial Hall, Barkers Pool, Sheffield, and we are scheduled to commence
at 10.30 am.

I anticipate that the second date, 19th April, will also be at that
location but after the 19th, we plan to hold the Inquests at the Medico
Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield.

It would be appreciated if you would confirm to me as soon as possible
whether you intend to be present on 18th April,  and also let me have, if
known, the name of the solicitor or Counsel who is representing your
clients.

Yours faithfully,




INIAAH

Dear Sir
As you will of course be aware from my letter of 17 September 1990, I
have resumed the inquests into the deaths of the 95 people at Hillsborough*
which are continuing.
We anticipate that tomorrow we will be hearing from Mr Butler and Mr
Bownes who are local authority employees, who will be dealing with
relevant aspects of the Safety Certificate.
It 1s possible that during their evidence reference will be made to
the Fire Service which may or may not be critical. I am writing to
you to enable you to attend and represent your clients if you so wish.
From a study of other documentation 1t would seem that 1t 1s possible
that during the course of the evidence of further witnesses, an adverse
comment, Including possible criticism of the means of escape, may be
raised and again 1t is a matter for you to decide whether you wish to
be present to represent your clients.
Finally, I have been invited to consider calling Mr Seaman.    I am still
considering this and have not yetntaken a decision.
You will appreclat* that it 1s not a practical proposition to adjourn
the inquest if you are not there and 1t 1s therefore essential that you
take a decision on whether you want to be present.
Yours faithfully

            Dear Sirs,

            Re:   R E S U M E D INQUESTS 19th N O V EM BER 1990.



            If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
            of the 95 people who died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
            on the 19th of N ovember 1990 at 10. a.m. Details of venue wi ll be n o t if ie d in
            due course.

            I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
            evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
            coronal investig at ion w h i c h you w ill recollect is not adversarial but
            inquisi tor ia l in nature, and w h i c h of course has o n l y —limited objectives.

            Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
            unde r my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
            w i t n es se s w h o w i s h to give evidence. I am at present engaged in c on si de rin g
            this and in d e ter mi ni ng w ho I w i s h to invite to attend.

            W i t h o u t prej ud ice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I a m w r i t i n g to you
            to give you an oppor tun it y to dra w to my attention the names and other
            approp ri ate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
            c o n si der calli ng to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

            May I please ask you in co nsidering w h e t h e r you wish to d r a w any names               to my
            attention, to bear in mi nd the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

            I also wa nt to make it absolu tel y clear that the submission of a name or
            names for cons ide ra tio n is n o th in g more than that, and that the deci sio n as
            to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a matter for me.

            I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
            h e ar d from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
            submit.

            Yours       faithfully,

appears that any witness is likely to say anything which reflects
upon the Ambulance Service or its personnel, so that we can be
present when that evidence is given.

Dear Sirs,

Thank you for your letter of the 28th of March. There is one
problem with your letter and that is that I in fact do not
intend to circulate the case summaries prior to the Inauest
apart from sending them to the pepre^entatives of the bereaved.

I hope this will not inconvenience you too greatly.

Yours faithfully,



S.L.Popper,
H.M. Coroner.

Dear Sir,

Re: Hillsborough Inquests
    Dr A R Forrest

We understand that Dr Robert Forrest hks been called by you to give evidence
in respect of blood/alcohol determinations at the Inquest into the deaths
arising from the Hillsborough tragedy.

We have been instructed by Dr Forrest to be present at the Inquest in order
to protect his interest. Whilst the Doctors evidence may or may not be
controversial in itself,it will be the subject of intense media interest
and there will undoubtedly be other parties to this Inquest who the Doctor's
evidence does not suit one way or another.

Counsel has been instructed to appear (Mr Shaun Smith of Figtree Chambers,
Sheffield).

We trust that you will not object to Dr Forrest being represented during
such parts of the Inquest as appear relevant. If any difficulties arise
perhaps you would cause us to be notified of the problem in early course.

Might we ask that a copy of this letter is passed to the Officers of the
West Midlands Police who are actually making arrangements for seating etc,
at the Inquest.

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Yours faithfully

Dear Sirs,

Re:   R E S U M E D INQUESTS            19th NOV EMB ER 1990.



If y ou are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m y ou represent,
on the 19th of Nove mbe r 1990 at 1 0 . a.m. Details of venue w i l l be n o t i f i e d in
due course.

I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
evidence has already been taken, nor of the nature and limitations of a
coronal investi gat io n w h i c h you w i l l recollect is not advers ar ia l but
i n quisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
under my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
wi tn esses w h o w i s h to give evidence.      I am at present engage d in c o n s i d e r i n g
this and in de te rm i n i n g w ho I w i s h to invite to attend.

W i tho ut pr ejudice in any w a y to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
to give you an o pp ort un ity to dr aw to my attention the names and other
a p propriate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
cons id er callin g to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

May I please ask you in c ons id eri ng w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names        to my
attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

I also want to make it absolutely clear that the submission of a name or
names for c on sid e r a t i o n is n o t h i n g more than that, and that the d ec is i o n as
to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m at ter for me.

I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
heard from you by the end of Se ptember I wil l assume y ou have no names to
submit.

Y o u r ^ faithfully
                                                                                  17th September             90

          Dear Sir,

          Re:   H I L LS BO ROU GH RESUM ED INQUESTS.

          I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
          exchange of views to take place between m y se lf and re pr esentatives on
          procedural matters, w i t h the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
          Inquests proper run smoothly w i t h the m i n i m u m amount of delay and to the best
          advantage.


          1 have n o w decided that this revi ew should take place on Tuesday
          30th October 1990 at the M e dic o Legal Centre, W ate ry Street, Sheffield at
          2 p.m.


          A l t h o u g h this m e e t i n g is intended for legal representatives, I w o u l d not
          raise any o bj ect io n if interested parties w i s h e d to attend to see what was
          going on, subject of course to us not ex ceeding the space avai la bi lit y at
          the M e d i c o Legal Centre.


          I wo uld be grateful if you could please c o n fi rm to me                        that you w o u l d like to
          attend the review.



          Yours     faithfully,

      re:        The Hillsborough Inquest

      I have now received Counsel's Opinion upon the various                                                                           matters             of
      evidence which you raised in your recent Instructions.                                                                            A copy             of
      Counsel's Advice is enclosed.

      As indicated in our telephone conversation on Thursday evening, the
      Sealed Crown Office Subpoena was served upon Mr. Lackey on the 5th
      December, requiring his attendance at the Inquest on Wednesday next,
      12th December,   at 11 a.m.     A Sealed copy of the Subpoena is
      enclosed.    I am awaiting a Sworn Affidavit of Service from     our
      enquiry agent.

      Incidentally, I do not know how you are dealing with the question of
      payment of witness expenses, but it may be that you are paying each
      witness on the day.          Richard  Hammond checked the    position and
      established that the return train fare from Liverpool to Sheffield
      was £13.00.      Allowing additional taxi fees and subsistence expenses,
      Mr. Lackey has been paid the sum of £30 .00 , in cash, by way of
      conduct money.      This of course does not take any account of loss of
      e a r ni n g s .

      I enclose a copy of the latest fee note received from C o u n s e l 1%
      Clerk, and I would^liTce tea-kettle Counsel's fees to date.     A p o r t i on ^,<3^
      of this fee note ((£365. 00 f was incorporated in my interim account
      dated 8th N o v e m b e r last, which is still awaiting payment.           Of S9-,
      course, there is no         hurry for settlement of my own  fees, but it «*, >*/c
      would be helpful if you could put me in funds to           the extent of
          3*7.50, so that I can settle Counsel's fees.

      I have this m o r n i n g spoken on the t e lephone to your secretary, and
      in order to get a copy of C o unsel's Opin i o n to you at the earliest
      op p o r t u n i t y it has been agreed that I should send one copy of this
      letter and its e nclosures to Mrs. Taylor in Sh e f f i e l d and one copy
      direct to you at home in West Bridgford.


                                                                                                               Cont/d              ....

Spoke to Ian Rothera.    I told him the date,   I explained to him that
I had spoked to Michael Powers clerk.    I said that everything was in
hand,   that if we needed any help we would be in touch    and that at the
present time I would not be very happy about      switching horses from
Michael Powers.    I also said it was encouraging to know that although
Michael had been very very helpful, but on the whole had confirmed
what I had though,   this had boosted my confidence to a certain extent.

Dear Ian,

Thank you for your letter of the 19th of July.                    I refer to m y telephone
c o n v e r s a t i o n of the 23rd of July a nd I c o n f i r m that I told yo u that I did not
think it w o u l d be a good idea for R i ch ar d H a mmo nd to attem pt to assess the
cost of an Inquest.             I think this is a ver y di fficult task for h i m and in any
event, I p r o ba bl y have a rough idea of the sort of hea din gs w h i c h w o u l d
apply.

W h a t I think w o u l d be helpf ul w o u l d be for you to let me k n o w w h a t the cost
of Coun se l w o u l d be (and Solicitors) on say the fo ll owing a s s u m p t i o n s :-

     1.    That Couns el is prese nt throughout the Inquest in say
           the equiva len t role to "Counsel to the Inquiry".            I think
           this      should be cost ed on the a ssu mp t i o n that the Inquest
           m i g h t last say three or four w e e k s and then a w e e k l y rate,   or
           daily rate thereafter.

     2.    That Coun se l is only present for selected periods e.g.,
           the re- op eni ng of the Inquest and po ssi bl y legal submissions/
           summing up at the end.        Perhaps a p e ri od of two to five days
           w i t h the p r ovi so that he w o u l d be a va ilable for telephone
           consult at ion s ver y similar to w h a t w e did d u ri ng the Inte ri m
           Inquests, and w h a t in fact Hr. Sturt did in co nn ec t i o n w i t h the
           Ze b r u gg en case.

     3.     That Cou ns el did n ot a t t e n d the Inquest at all but that he w o u l d
            be a va ila bl e for telephone consulta tio ns if dif fi cul t points
            arose on w h i c h I thought it was n e c e s s a r y to o bt ai n his help.

I a m sure you w i l l apprec ia te w h e n I say* that I a m v ery conscious that I have
to be ex tr eme ly careful w i t h expenditure, w h i l s t on the one h a n d it is
ob vi ous ly v e r y n e c e s s a r y to spend w h a t e v e r is es se nti al to ensure that the
Inquest is p r o p erl y done (assuming that w e have to resume of course), on the
other hand, I w o u l d no t w a n t it suggested that m o n e y was b e i n g spent
unnecessarily.

Yours     sincerely,

                  Dear Stefan,

                              I enclose Richard Hammond's Attendance Note
                  of the recent conference with Dr. Powers and hope that
                  you will find this of interest.   I assume that you have
                  not as yet heard anything from the Director of Public
                  Prosecutions and that therefore no immediate action is
                  necessary.

                              In the meantime Richard Hammond will be
                  attempting to assess the costs of a three to four month
                  inquest and if you have any suggestions as to what specific
                  costs should be considered then please let me know.

                                        Kind regards,

                                                                  Yours sincerely,




                  Dr. S. L. Popper,

TifM» Ian,

I enclose instruction to Counsel which I have prepared for
you to consider and if you approve* to adopt and forward
to Michael Bowers.

I ha** spoken to his on the phone on a couple of ttocasions,
mainly about the point raised in Part A of the instruction.

I have deliberately avoided putting a lot of detail of the
Hillsborough Incident in to the instruction, as in b o m
respects, it is not the detail of the soope of the Inquests
that I require at the aoaent but aore the general principle of«-

               a. How large is "how".

               b. What is the overlap of that "how" with the
                  questions of whoa to claae and why.

I will he away for soae tlae In July and for practical purposes,
I think we can say that I will be unavailable froa the 4th to the
22nd of July.
In some respects, it would be helpful if I could hear from Counsel
before I.go, but if that Is not possible then I would like Counsel’s
opinion/tn writing available for ay return, or if ho wants to have
a conference, then for It to Ini arranged as soon as a convenient*
date oan bo established.

Tours sincerely,



S.L.Popper,
H.M.Coroner.

Sear Ian,

Thank you for your letter of the 5th of October. We haar*
spoken about this on the phone already end X confirsa that
we would not be reaming the Inauests on the 15th of
January 1990 as previously anticipated. This is because
of the involveaent of the D.P.P.

will need sorting out and I will be in touch with you
in due course to arrange a preliminary meeting to discuss
this natter.

    Dear Stefan

    I refer to our tel e p h o n e c o n v e r s a t i o n s some w eeks ago r e g a r d i n g the
►   f o r t h c o m i n g Inquest into the H i l l s b o r o u g h Football S t a d i u m tragedy.

    I understand          from  your office  in  the   Medico  Legal Centre  at
    Sh e f f i e l d that you are at present on leave.   I thought that I ought
    to ment i o n that I myself am about to be away f rom my office for one
    week, but I will be back on the 16th October.

    My reco l l e c t i o n is that you w ere a w a i t i n g c o n f i r m a t i o n that you
    could commence the Inquest on the 15th Janu a r y 1990.                          A s s u m i n g that
    this is the ap p r o x i m a t e timescale, I w o u l d suggest that it w o u l d be
    ap p r o p r i a t e for us to have at least a p r e l i m i n a r y m e e t i n g within,
    say, the next three or four weeks.                    If you agree, perhaps you w o u l d
    k i n d l y tel e p h o n e so that we can arra n g e an a p p o i n t m e n t , in either
    N o t t i n g h a m or Sheffield, w h i c h e v e r is more c o n v e n i e n t to you.

  At this stage, I w o u l d simply c o n f i r m that I c o n t a c t e d the C lerk to
. Dr. Michael Powers, and I am plea s e d to c o n f i r m that Dr. Powers will
  be a v a ilable to assist in this matter.

    Kind r e g a r d s ,

    Yours         sincerely




    Dr.      S.L.           Popper
FILE NOTE - HILLSBOROUGH DATED 18.7.89.
TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. IAN ROTHERA OF ROTHERAS IN NOTTINGHAM,


I explained to him that I wanted to instruct solicitors who
were independent, so that I could have access to Counsel (in
particular I wanted Michael Powers) in connection with the
Hillsborough Disaster.
He said that he would have a word with Mr. Jenkin Jones as he
was Deputy Coroner.     He could not see any reason why they should
not accept the instruction but that he would let me know whether
they wanted to do so.
I explained to him that although this money in connection with this
would be paid by Council funds were not ■unlimited and I would want him
to keep me advised, assuming that they accepted instructions
in £2,000 or so.

The Coroner

     Following a request by Mrs. Joan McBrien, mother of John McBrien
deceased 15.4.89,., Hillsborough, I, Roger Parry, would like to make a
statement on what happened on that day up to 1500 hrs.

     We took two coach loads of supporters to Sheffield on the 15.4.89.
as in 1988. One of the coaches left Holywell at 10.45 a.m. as in 1988.
This coach joined the second coach at Queensferry at about 11.10 a.m.
After giving out tickets and collecting fares, both coaches left at
11.30 a.m., the same time as 1988. In 1988 we were able to stop on the
motorway for a cup of tea and a sandwich for half an hour, and were still
in Sheffield at 13.30 hrs. On the 15-4.89., although we left at the same
time, we were unable to stop at all because we were held up on the motorway
contraflow road works. When we got to the outskirts of Sheffield, we were
stopped by the Police and searched, as in 1988.

     The coaches then continued into Sheffield to the road where the
coaches parked, as in 1988. We got there at 14.10 hrs - 14.15 hrs. From
there all our members walked down to the ground. When we got to the
ground we were surprised to find that there were no barriers in the street
manned by Police to check for people with no tickets, as was done in 1988.
All supporters were able to get to the gates if they had a ticket or not.
We ourselves got to the ground at about 14.40 hrs. Outside the ground
there did not seem to be any organisation at all with no orderly queues,
just supporters trying to get in. It was much better organised in 1988.

     I myself was in the stand but it was no better at the turnstile than
for the ground standing area. Mr. B. Purcell, Club Chairman, and his son,
went through the side gate at between 14.45 - 14.50 hrs.

     I would like to know why, in response to cross-examination by Mr.
Gibson-Watt, Mr. Marsall asked in what circumstances would he delay the
kick-off, said he would have expected Mr. Duckenfield to consider bad
accident on the motorway, unreasonable delay in transport arrangements.
What we experienced on the way to Sheffield on the motorway must have come
under the category 'Unreasonable delay in transport' considering the
differing times between 1988 and 1989, without a stop, remembering most
coaches and cars must have come the same way that day, and the game should
have been delayed.

         Hrs. J. McBrien,




         Dear Hrs. McBrien,

         Resumed Inquests 19.11.90.

         Thank you for your letters of the 12th and 14th of November 1990, the
         contents of which I note.

         As far as the proposed witnesses are concerned, I propose to call Hr. C.
         Jones and Mr. Cray as well as Mr. Griffiths. Dr. Eastwood will in due course
         be asked to give evidence.

         I have considered the statements of Mr. Parry and Dr. Ashton but do not feel
         that it is necessary to call them.

         Whilst I have no doubt the photographs may be of personal interest, I do not
         anticipate using these at the Inquest.

         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

         Mrs. J. McBrien,


# I
         Dear Mrs. McBrien,

         Resumed Inquests 19.11.90.

         Thank you for your letter of the 12th of November 1990, the contents of which
         I note.

         As far as the proposed witnesses are concerned, I do not propose to call Dr.
         Ashton. I have also considered the statement of Mr. Roger Parry and do not
         propose to call him either.

         I am considering Mr. C. Jones and Mr. Cray at the present time.

         Whilst I have no doubt the photographs may be of personal interest, I do not
         anticipate using these at the Inquest.

         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

         Mrs. J. McBrien,




         Dear Mrs. McBrien,

         I have now had an opportunity of looking through the document dated the 29th
         of October which you have entitled statement and I do not propose to call you
         as a witness.

         I also wish to draw to your attention Rule 40 of the Coroners’ Rules 1984
         which state "no person shall be allowed to address the coroner or the jury as
         to the facts".

         The foregoing does not of course mean that you will not be able to ask
         questions in accordance with the Rules.



         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.H.Coroner.

         Mrs. J. McBrien,




• '      Dear Mrs. McBrien,
                              '
         I have now had an opportunity of looking through the document dated the 29th
         of October which you have entitled statement and I do not propose to call you
         as a witness.

         I also wish to draw to your attention Rule 40 of the Coroners’ Rules 1984
         which state "no person shall be allowed to address the coroner or the jury as
         to the facts".


         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

    Mrs.       J. McBrien.




   Dear Sirs,

                          Resumed Hillsborough inquests on 19th Nov. 1990

   With reference to my earlier correspondence I am circulating to all
   the firms that were represented at the meeting on 30th October 1990
   summaries of what are believed to be facts relating to the
   Hillsborough disaster.

   I would          be most gratefulif you could please study the documents           as
   soon as          possible and let me know:

   1. Whether you agree that they correctly summarize the position in
   respect of those matters which are dealt with.

   2. If you think that there are any errors in the summaries. Please
   specify the errors so that if appropriate they can be corrected.

   If we cannot agree a particular point than it                may be necessary to
   delete it entirely from,the summaries. I will                decide what
   action is needed in the light of any comments                and in relation to
   the importance or otherwise of the point that                is disputed.

   Please note that it is likely that for convenience the summaries will
   be merged and presented as one. They have simply been prepared in the
   present format, and, in the interests of time I am circulating them
   split.

   There is a further matter that has occurred to me. I have taken it
   that you have kept your client(s) informed of the recomencement of the
   resumed inquests and I have not written to them personally informing
   them of this fact. I have also taken it that neither you nor your
   client(s) object to this. If these assumptions are incorrect please
   let me have by return and preferably by FAX the full name and
   current address of your client(s) so that I can formally write to
   them.




   Yours faithfully,




   S. L. Popper.
   H.M. Coroner.

             Mrs. J. McBrien,




•            I________I
             Dear Mrs. McBrien,

             Thank you for your letter of the 13th of October. I note what you say with
             regard to representation. I want to be quite sure that you are clear about
             what you will be allowed to do, which is to ask questions. From what I know
             at the moment this is unlikely. You will not be allowed to proffer evidence
             unless I were to invite you to become a witness in the proceedings.

             I am anxious that this should be clearly understood at this stage.



             Yours sincerely,




             S .L.Popper,
             H.M.Coroner.

         Dear Mrs. McBrien,

         In order to ensure that you are kept informed, I enclose a copy letter which
         I have written to various solicitors in connection with the Pre-Inquest
         review. This meeting will not be held with a Jury present and will therefore
         not take any evidence, the objective being as stated in that letter.

         If you feel that you want to be present at this meeting please let me know by
         return.


         Yours sincerely,

                 Z ___

Dear Sir,

Ret HILLSBOROUGH RESUMED INQUESTS.

I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
exchange of views to take place between myself and representatives on
procedural matters, with the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
Inquests proper run smoothly with the minimum amount of delay and to the best
advantage.

1 have now decided that this review should take place on Tuesday
30th October 1990 at the Medico Legal Centre, Watery Street, Sheffield at
2 p.m.

Although this meeting is intended for legal representatives, I would not
raise any objection if interested parties wished to attend to see what was
going on, subject of course to us not exceeding the space availability at
the Medico Legal Centre.

I would be grateful if you could please confirm to me that you would like to
attend the review.


Yours faithfully,




S iLwopper,
H.M.Coroner.

         SLP/JT/68.




         Mrs. J. McBrien,




#        Dear Mrs. McBrien,

         Re: RESUMED HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS.

         Thank you for your letter of the 9th of October. I note that you are
         withdrawing your instructions from Silverman Livermore.

         The position with regard to the examination of witnesses is that under Rule
         20 of the Coroners’ Rules a parent is entitled to examine any witness either
         in person or by Counsel or by a solicitor, provided that the coroner may
         disallow any question which in his opinion is not relevant, or is otherwise
         not a proper question.

         It follows therefore that if you are not represented, then subject to the
         provisions of the Rules, you would be allowed to ask questions of witnesses.
         Similarly if you were to decide to have independent legal representation,
         either by a solicitor or a barrister they would be able to put questions
         subject to the Rules to witnesses on your behalf. Perhaps you would be kind
         enough, when you have made up your mind what you want to do to let me know
         because it is helpful for planning purposes.

         I am not in any sense decrying the enormous amount of time and effort which
         you have put in to investigating this disaster, and acknowledge the very
         grievous loss which you have suffered.

         I think however on the whole that it is unlikely that I would consider
         calling you to give evidence as an expert. As you were not at the stadium,
         it is obvious that you cannot give evidence as a witness of fact. However if
         you feel that you would like me to see a resume of the type of evidence which
         you might be able to proffer, please let me have it and I will then be in a
         position to let you know whether I would be prepared to change my mind about
         calling you.

         I am very conscious that this last sentence might generate a lot of work for
         you and also raise your hopes with regard to giving evidence. I want to do
         neither, but am simply trying to be as fair as I can be to you.

         Yours sincerely,


         S .L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

         Mrs. J. McBrien,




         Dear Mrs. McBrien,

         Thank you for your letter of the 13th of October. I note what you say with
         regard to representation. I want to be quite sure that you are clear about
         what you will be allowed to do, which is to ask questions.

         You will not be allowed to proffer evidence unless I were to invite you to
         become a witness in the proceedings. From what I know at the moment, this is
         unlikely.

         I am anxious that this should be clearly understood at this stage.


         Yours sincerely,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

I telephoned the British Psychological Society in Leicester
0533 549568 I first of all spoke to Bruce Napier psychologist,
I explained to him that I was looking for advise on experts in the
field of crowd behaviour with or without the effect of alcohol
and also the effect of stress and decision taking.  He said he
thought they would be able to help me.  He would put me onto their
Director of Information.  The line then went dead.  I called back
and asked to be put though to the Director of Imformation who was
Steven White.  He confirmed that he had spoken to Mr. Napier and
I repeated that I was interesting in namely the effect on behaviour
of people being in a crowd, the effect of behaviour of people in a
crowd who were affected possible by alcohol, the effect on
behaviour of alcohol at various levels, not necessarily at drunken
level eg. 80 mgs.  Finally the effect of stress and decision
taking.

He said that rather than give me names off the top of his head be
would consider who in his view would be the best people on these
subjects and he would write to me if I gave him my address which
I did.  I also asked whether I could have a copy of their publication
Psychological Aspects of Disaster, he said this had just been
published and he would put a copy in the p o s t . I said I would pay
for it but he said it wasn't necessary.  I thanked him.

W ITH COMPLIMENTS

J. Mervyn Jones, M.Sc.
Deputy Chief Constable
13. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WITHIN THE SERVICE

    13.1   Mr. Dellow referred to correspondence he had received from
           Mr. Wright, former Chief Constable of South Yorkshire,
           expressing his great concern that the Police Federation
           should have encouraged their members in South Yorkshire to
           take legal action against him for negligence and breach of
            statutory duty in connexion with the Hillsborough tragedy.
           Mr. Wright had suggested that whilst that action might be
           technically proper, it took no account of force morale;
           mutual reliance between officers; or the effect on
            subsequent day-to-day operational matters.

    13.2   Mr. Webber stressed that the claims in question had not
           been submitted immediately after the Hillsborough events.
            But the position was that a number of officers were
            suffering for all sorts of reasons and had felt let down
            by the Taylor Inquiry over the question of compensation.
            The Solicitors1 view was that such compensation would come
            from the football club owners/architect/the Football
            League etc., any of whom would probably have conjoined the
            Chief Constable at a later stage in proceedings.       But
            towards the end of 1989 the Chief Constable declared
            publicly that the force would settle all claims : accord­
            ingly it was regarded as appropriate that claims from the
            police officers concerned should now be sent straight to
            the Chief Constable, to be dealt with by him.      The key
            point was that the claims were not being made against the
            Chief Constable as such, and the solicitors would not have
            taken that course if the Chief Constable had not announced
            that claims would be settled by the force.

    13.3   Miss Neild added that the principle of officer suing
           officer was not a new one : it was a technically proper
           course of action; was seen as such; and happened
           frequently.   Mr. Eastwood said that the explanation of
           circumstances as given by Mr. Webber had been put to the
           new Chief Constable, who understood the position.
                                                                         ACTICM
    13.4   Mr. Dellow thanked Mr. Webber for this clarification of           DELLCW TO WRiTt
           the issue and undertook to convey the substance of it to      do m r . YRIGHT
           Mr. Wright.

Dr Helen Muir of the College of Aeronautics also, as we are, of the Cranfield
Institute of Technology has passed me a copy of your letter JMJ/VSC of 4 Oct 1989.
The Cranfield Disaster Preparedness Centre is becoming increasingly involved in
UK disaster and emergency management studies on behalf of government, the Civil
Aviation Authority and industry (off-shore oil).
In support of our work we have long experience in the development of computer
based simulations both in relation to problem analysis and training. It seems
that crowd behaviour both in regard to major incidents such as Hillsborough or
Kings Cross or public order, are areas meriting examination.
It seems that there may be advantage in bringing the requirements for such
studies as represented by Inquiries such as yours and ACPO Committees, together
with experience such as lies with the Applied Psychology Unit and ourselves,
(we also have behavioural psychologists working here) to examine future areas
tor research and simulation development.

          I refer to your letter of 15 January 1990 in which you offer the
          possibility of a facility in respect of our Hillsborough Inquiry.        I am
          grateful for the information.

          I am not sure whether we are in a position to employ your services at
          this time. It may be that we could perhaps have a discussion later,
          once we have completed the criminal inquiry. We hope to report to the
          Director of Public Prosecutions in the early spring. We then continue
          our enquiries on behalf of the Coroner who may well be interested in
          your assistance.

I rang George Richie si ^ ^ * V ^ D i s a s t e r          Centre 0793 785258,
Mr. Richie was out I said I would ring him tomorrow.            This arises
out of a letter from him of 15.1.90 to Mervyn Jones in which he
mentions the Applied Psycology Unit,            behavioural Psycologists and
crowd behaviour in major incidents.
FILE NOTE   28.9.90

Telephone conversation with somebody called Ken Westgate of (Eranfield
Disaster  Preparedness Centre.

He was in Mr. George Richie's office.   I discussed with him briefly
whether they had any expertise on the effects of stress and decision
making.  He said they know a little b ittgbout it but more rresearch
needs to be done in his view.  However/someBocfysby the name of Tony
Moor who had recently dealt with these issues at a conference.   Mr.
Moor was an ex superintendent.  He would ask him to get in touch with
me but it wouldn't be until mid October.
 FILE NOTE DATED 22.10,90

TELEPHONE CALL FROM MR.     MOORE                tiOME NUMBER

ON THE ffBANFIELD DISASTER CENTRE.

This is in response to my call to them sometime ago when

they told me that Mr. Moore had done some work in this

field but he was away at the time.

Mr. Moore explained that he was an ex-police officer.     That

he had lectured at Bramshill mainly about control.     That he

had left the police force 4 years ago and that he was now

working on the issues of disaster.    He also told me that a

lady called Helen Hetherington                            or

failing that        had done quite a lot of work on

battlefield stress and the effect that that had on ability

to take decision.

Another lady who coincidentally is called Helen Muir at

                       had done a lot of work on behaviour of

crowds in disaster situations mainly directed at civil

aviation disasters whose work had been published a few

months ago, but was very interesting as to the reaction of

people in a stress situation.

He felt that if I wanted to pursue this matter particularly

with Helen Hetherington it might be possible for him to

apply some of her findings to police activities bearing in

mind his background and confirmed that if there was any

further help I wanted,   I could get in touch with him.   He

reminded that the Director of the Institute is Mr. George

Richie whose number is

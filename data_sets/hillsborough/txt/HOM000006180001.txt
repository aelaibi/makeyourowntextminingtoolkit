           Dear Ms Ransford
           HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS
           Thank you for your helpful letter of 20 February 1990. By way of clarification,
           am I right in assuming that the grant on these payments will be in accordance
           with the special payment arrangements previously made to which, in particular,
           Lord Ferrers letter of 27 June refers. Mr A d d i s o n ’s letter of 6 November 1989
           is also relevant.
           Yours sincerely




           R C Johnston
           Clerk and Financial Officer

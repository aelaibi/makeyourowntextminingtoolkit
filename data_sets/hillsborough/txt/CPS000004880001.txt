  Dear Sir,

  Hillsborough

  We thank you for your letter of 26th July.

  In the light of that letter, we were surprised and disappointed to
  read today press reports that the final Police report had only been
  delivered to you on 14th August.   Of still greater concern were
  reports, which we understand to be based on comments by your press
  officers, to the effect that it would now be "several months" before
  a decision might be reached on whether there would be prosecutions.
  We cannot reconcile this with the comment in your letter of 26th
  July to the effect that you would expect the Director to reach a
  decision before 2nd October, 1990*

  You have already indicated your view that the civil trial should
  not proceed until the later of either a decision being reached that
  there should be no criminal proceedings or the conclusion of any
  criminal proceedings which are brought.

 If that is so then, in our opinion, it is undesirable for an
 application to postpone the civil trial to be left to the last
 possible minute.  Not only will this cause the greatest
 inconvenience and the greatest waste of money to the parties, but
 it is also likely to waste the time of the High Court Judge who is
 to try the civil action.



                                                                                                                                                                      /... contd

 We must, therefore, ask you to let us have, as soon as possible,
 your realistic estimate of when the Director’s decision can be^
 expected.  A decision on whether or not to apply for a change in the
 date of the civil trial can be made on the basis of that estimate.

 We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.


 Yours faithfully,

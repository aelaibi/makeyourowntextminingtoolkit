RE:    HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL HELD BY MERVYN JONES -
       FORMERLY CHIEF CONSTABLE, CHESHIRE CONSTABULARY

I refer to my previous correspondence dated 15 October 1997 in which I sought to bring the
existence of the above material to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's attention and his authority to
transport the material from Cheshire to South Yorkshire and to place it in the Hillsborough
Archive.

I have today received a telephone call from the secretary of the Chief Constable of Cheshire
informing me that the room in which the material is stored is required for other purposes and that
they have no other secure storage for it. I have been asked if I could make arrangements for its
removal as soon as possible.

As three months have now passed since I brought the existence of this material to the attention
of the Scrutiny Team may I now bring it to South Yorkshire as I originally requested because I
would like the opportunity to examine it before I retire in just over 3 weeks time and ascertain
whether or not it merely duplicates the material held here in the Hillsborough Archive.

RE: HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL HELD BY MERVYN JONES,
FORMERLY ASSISTANT CHIEF CONSTABLE WEST MIDLANDS POLICE,
LATTERLY CHIEF CONSTABLE OF CHESHIRE CONSTABULARY


Mervyn Jones, as Assistant Chief Constable of the W est Midlands Police headed the police
enquiry into the Hillsborough Disaster, on behalf of his Chief Constable and for
Lord Justice Taylor.

Mr Jones retired from the Police Service on 31 August 1997. I have subsequently learned that
when Mr Jones concluded his investigation in the Hillsborough Inquiry in 1991, he kept certain
documentation relevant to the Inquiry, for reference purposes and in the event that he needed to
consult them, subsequent to the conclusion of the investigation. In addition, he kept personal
notes which he intends to retain.

It is my understanding that there are no original documents in the material, which is stored in a
room 11 feet square at Cheshire Police Headquarters and covers two walls of that room, merely
duplicates of certain parts of the enquiry that were passed to South Yorkshire Police at the end of
the Inquiry. (Please see attached letter dated 25 July 1997, from Mervyn Jones, Chief Constable
of Cheshire Constabulary, to Richard Wells, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police.)

It was felt that the material should not be destroyed and I have now arranged with the
 Cheshire Constabulary that they will box up the material and index the content of each box.
It would then be my intention to transport the material from Cheshire to South Yorkshire and
place it in the Hillsborough Archive, unless Lord Justice Stuart-Smith should direct otherwise.




                                                 The person dealing with this correspondence is:
                                                 Superintendent Hepworth

I would be pleased if you could inform Lord Justice Stuart-Smith of the existence of the material
and seek his agreement to the course of action proposed above. I would of course keep the
material in its original state, until the Hillsborough Scrutiny Team has been able to inspect it.

HILLSBOROUGH

 You will no doubt be aware that I retire at the end o f August. W hen I concluded my investigation in
 the Hillsborough Inquiry in 1991 I kept copies o f certain docum entation relevant to the Inquiry.
 These were kept for reference should I have to refer to them subsequent to the conclusion o f the
 investigation. In addition, I kept my personal notes which I intend to retain. However, the question is
 whether the South Yorkshire Police w ish to receive the duplicate material w hich I presently hold.
 There are no original documents, merely duplicates o f certain parts that were passed to you by
 Detective C hief Superintendent Foster at the end o f the Inquiry.

 The question again, therefore, is would this duplicate material be o f any assistance to you? I f not I
 will make arrangements for it to be confidentially destroyed.

 With best wishes

SUBJECT:        HILLSBOROUGH MATERIAL HELD BY MERVYN JONES
                FORMERLY CHIEF CONSTABLE CHESHIRE CONSTABULARY

Fniinu/ing our meeting on Monday 6 October 1997, regarding the Hillsborough Scrutiny I contacted
       Secretary to the Chief Constable of Cheshire, to make arrangements to collect the
documentation relevant to the Hillsborough Enquiry that had been kept for reference purposes by
Mervyn Jones.

     informed me that the documentation covered two walls of a room measuring 11 feet by
11 feet and that as a minimum we would require a transit van to transport the material from
Chester to Sheffield. Acquisition of this material will obviously cause us an additional storage
problem, but the other thing that has come to my mind is, should we tell Lord Justice Stuart-Smith
that we are going to acquire another large quantity of paper work connected to the Hillsborough
Enquiry?, or should we presume that the material is a duplicate of that which we presently hold
and say nothing until we prove otherwise?

Incidentally I somehow managed to persuade         and the staff officer to box up the material and
provide us with an index to the content of each box and they have now set aside Wednesday 15
and Thursday 16 October to do this. It is therefore likely to be the week commencing Monday 20
October, before I can collect the material.

Dear Mr. Sweet,

Thank you for your time yesterday when I visited the Home Office.      I hope
you found the 'transfer multiplier' example useful.

As regards ticketing and Synchro Systems involvement        in Football,    I
promised to elaborate further on these matters.

Synchro Systems are a computer software and management conpany of ten
years standing.   Since April 1988 they have been part of the Tottenham
Hotspur pic group of companies. This has enabled Synchro to gain the
working capital and viability necessary to continue as market leaders in
this field. Synchro has developed a number of products and services in
several computer related spheres. Specialist software has been developed
for both membership purposes and access control; these are used at many
Football Clubs and Synchro produces over 150,000 cards per annum.

                                                 SYNCHR
Perhaps of most interest at the present tine are the ticketing and
resource management systems which Synchro has developed.    The 'Arenar'
computerised stadium management system produces the tickets I showed you
yesterday. The system works as follows:-

       The software has programmed into it the layout and seating
       plan of the stadium.
       The customer selects where he or she wishes to sit and pays for the
       ticket.
—      The   mini-printer   attached   to   the   computer   then   prints
       instantaneously the ticket as requested.
       The seat sold cannot then be double-booked (nor can seats taken by
       season ticket holders be sold by accident).

       The software also provides the Club with accountancy facilities
       credit card orders, and an instant update on the state of ticket
       sales.
       It is furthermore, very secure and has advantages for 'big match
       situations'.

       The back of the ticket is printed with a map.
-      The front of the ticket can have information over-printed on it
       such as:
             The name of the supporter.
             Suggested arrival time.
             Details of pre-match events.
             Which entry to the ground is correct.

       The tickets are very secure indeed the metallic tickets have never
       been forged.
       The computer retains the information regarding who has purchased
       which seat (e.g. so that the Doctor can be contacted).

This ticket system is now in use at many dubs, including Arsenal,
Sheffield Wednesday, Liverpool, QPR, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United
and Aston Villa. Synchro have been selected to provide all the ticketing
for the 1990 Wbrld Cup in Italy.

I hope this is of interest. The system can best be understood if it is
seen in action: do contact me if you would like to see a demonstration or
have any further questions.

Yours sincerely,
for SYNCHRO SYSTEMS LIMITED,

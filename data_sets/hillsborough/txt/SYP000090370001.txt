just 1 walyt of      people.           I don't    remember          seeiWg any         p olicemen as we

wa 1 ked\ t^wards    the    ground.        I did see one man on h orseback and a

second    policeman standing             on a wall          to the     side of the t urnstiles as

we    tried to   pass a lad over           towards          the    policeman.         The     lad was      being

lifted towards       this    policeman by a man                   I believe was his dad,               the    lad

was about h or 7 years old,                and              been sitting         on his dads          shoulders

at first.

It was    b asically every man /For himself                       outside,      w hichever

t urnstile you were         p u s h e d towards you tried to get                      in,    there was       no

visible    q u e u e s , only a V a i l    of    people,                   and I got s e p a ra te d         in

the    pushing outside       from                                   S o m e ti me s   outside my feel

        The    pushing outside was becomiXg                 unbearable,         it was getting          close to

        the kick off time a n d eve r^o^ne w a n t e d to get                   into the ground.              I can

        remember a boy about           13 - 14 years,            being     passed over      peoples          heads

        towards a policeman who was standing on a turnstile wall.                                      The    boy

        a p p e a r e d to have    fainted       in the    packed      crowd.     It was a relief             to get

        into the ground and just                 escape   the    crowd     pressure.       I entered through

        a turnstile and had my ticket                 stub torn off by the turnstile                     operator.

        I can remember        before       I got    inside      that    the m o u nt ed   p oliceman left the

        a re a outside     the turnstile           saying words        to the effect        “I ’m getting            the

        fuck   out of here,         form a queue,"           It was      impossible       for    the    crowd to

        form an orderly queue.

        Once   inside   1 remember jk policeman standing beside each turnstile

                                                                                                                S3463

            On the match day           I was wearing a grey wide               collar     long sleeve          sweater

            wit h                                                                    blue jeans and

            trainers,      and a Liverpool          scarf.        I did have a hat            but    I lost    it

            earlier      that day.          I am a white male,                                stone w ith      reddish

            blonde hair and           moustache.       A friends wife           has said she saw me             on

            the TV video of           the    disaster.

            The man      in the      crowd that     I tried ta^help and now believe                     to be dead,

            I am certain           1 saw on TV on the mourning of the following M on d a y or

            T u e s da y on e i ther    the   news or a/ c h a t      type show.        They showed a picture

            of the man,        in black and whitar, a family                photo,    not     one from the

            ground and they           said he     c a m ^ f r o m Runcorn. I was      certain this              was the

            same man that           I had s e e p , oft the terracing         turning     blue.

            I do not      consider myse3lf/a squirrnish type                  of man,



                                                                                                    I feel    that   I

            have a good depth of experience                  of    life    but even allowing            for that

            the events        of    15th April     (150489)       at S h e f f i e l d will    be    in my min d for

            the     rest of my life.

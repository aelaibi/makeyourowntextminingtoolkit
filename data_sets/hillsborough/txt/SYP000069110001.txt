                  When        we       arrived        in    Sheffield           we      parked        on     a   car       park    it     cost        me   £.&.

some     lads      collected      it.         It was about       15 minu t e s walk        f rom the        ground.

There were          quite a lot          of Police       officers     at the       bottom of the            road,

it was      by a Police H e a d q u a r t e r s         I think    there were           vehicles     there        froiv:

N o t t i n g h a m Police..      I d i d n ’t have       direc t i o n s    1 knew from         previous

visit.



We    called       in a cafe      not     far    from where we        parked ana          then made         our way

to ! ne g r ound.            We sat      by the    r ive r f o r a w h i 1e and we n I           t o the

e/it ranee at about            2.. 30    pm    (1430 hrs).



As we a r r i v e d and w a l k e d           towards    it was    normal        then when we ware

w i t h i n about       15     20 yards,         it bee ame      c ra m m e d and we were         jostled

a bout



There were         two L i v e r p a o 1 p o 1 i ce on ho rseback            right      by u s . T hey       we re

t ry i ng to air e c X p e o pIs w here            t a g o b a t t he        h o r ss s were     getting

c rowde d .




We went       through one         of     the    turnstiles       in the      right      hand block       to the

standing area,               I handed my ticket            in.     It had been busy outside                      but    i

had e x p e r ienced si rni 1a r b e f o r e „



W h i 1e outside         peopla    had been        cIimbing       into our turnst iIe a r e a           from

the    centre      block      I d o n ’t think      the    centne     t u r n s t i l e s were    open,,         I saw

one    or two      climb over           the wall    above yfrne turn s t i l e s         to get    out      of    the

crush     I think.



I got t h r o u g h     the    t u rnstiles       then as     I stood        m    the    courtyard, probably

about    2.35      pm    (1435 hrs).            I saw t                 o the      right       of the

turn s t i l e s   open,,      The y were        throwi                     out who      had    c 1 imbed    in,,

As    they opened the           gate a. few            came    in/      On seeing       this    I said we'd

better      get      in and went          t h r o u g h .t          n n e 1 , I had swapped my stand

ticket      outside and had a standing                        one    to be with my friends.



As we went           to the    tunnel        I saw about            ten Police and stewards               on the

entrance        to the seats         to the           right    of the     tunnel       but    none at the

entrance        to the tunns 1.              There was about             3 Police,       7 Stewards.,



Inside      the      tunruaa' there was           no    problem,        I just walked          thro u g h the

terrace        was •j^o.rmal for a bio match,                   we made       our way down to the area,

in pen 3 joist to the               right       of the        gate about        two    people     back    f rom ;ne

perlmet«r         fence     (marked as           point E 7 )«         we were     there       in time     to see

the    teams      coma out.        It was OK wha n we                   first    stood there then all                of a

sudden      it was        solid and         I was      uranble to        move.        It was    so packed       I    lost
                                                 -pf-
consciousness             for a couple           of    seconds.          On more      than one o c c a s i o n       I

couldn't        move at all,,       A young            lad went          down    in front       of me    1 c o u l d n 5t

do a n y t h i n g    to help h i m .         Whilst         in the     crush    I was aware        that       people

were    dying        in the    crush,,         I c o u l d n ’t put      faces    to them but           there       was

the young         lad pulling        from below on the bo t t o m of my trousers                              and    I

c ould n *t do any t h i n g t o h e 1 p h im .



I ended        up on my knees         towards           the    front     I can't       even    recall i

cons ci ous at         t h i s t im e .      I t was                  mat e                     t h&t    pu

out,    the     next    real    thing        I can      remember        was   being     in tKe     stand at          the

back    looking        down on the           terrace         looking     for my b r d S m e r .     By now          it

was    v i r t u a l l y empty apart          from the         bodies     all    piled down towards                 the

f ro nt o f t h e terra c e „



It a g a i n    is a blank        from this            part    till     I recall       I was    in a woma n ' s

house at        the    opposite      end of the              ground,,

             I was      brought        back      to L i verpool          by    my    brother




             X    cannot       pass    criticisms          only     on    what       I    have    seen   the    only    thing       w h i s.:-i

             I    can   recall        is    that   whilst      we    were       trapped          and   being    crushed,        2   saw     a

             P o l i cetnars    open       the   gate     in   front      of    me       and   push    people    back    in »

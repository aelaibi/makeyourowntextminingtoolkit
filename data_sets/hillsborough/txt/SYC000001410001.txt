ADD COMMENTS:
FILE NOTE TELEPHONE CALL TO MR. KENNEDY. P.P.P.

He confirmed that Mr. Edey's case had been dismissed both

on substance and because he had no locus standing.

He said he was doing a letter to me regarding Rule?28 about

referring matters to the D.P.P.

I asked him what his letter meant when he said there was no

case to answer about the South Yorkshire Police.   I said
            j'Y -r
what was xX . He was a little bit taken aback.   He said it

wasn't a matter on which they had to exercise their mind

over in view of the fact that there was evidence to

p roceed.

       Dear Dr Popper

                                Hillsborough Stadium Disaster

      Thank you for your letter of 9 November 1990 concerning Rule
      28 of the Coroners Rules 1984 and the Director of Public
      Prosecution's decision, that there were to be no criminal
      prosecutions instituted in this case.

       I should be grateful if you would accept this letter as formal
       notification from the Director that an adjournment under Rule
       28 will be unnecessary in this case.  The Director will
       consider any new evidence at the conclusion of the inquest
       hearings.

       Yours faithfully

FILE NOTE     7.11.90


I rang Mr. Kennedy at the D.P.P and I told him.

I asked him whether he would be good enough to let me have a letter
to confirm that he didn't want me to adjourn.  I explained the
reasons to him.  I drew his attention to the fact that if I were to
leave a verdict of Unlawfully Killed to the jury and I wasn't saying
that I would, but if I were that depended upon the evidence, then by
definition unless I had a letter from him to confirm that he did not
want me to adjourn I ought to do so.

I also drew his attention to the possibility that if one looked at the
evidence the other way round    i.e. if the evidence which came out
supported say the conspiracy .... theory or alternatively that there
was sufficient evidence to show recklessness with regard to individuals
pressing forward etc. then I couldn't see any reason why provided the
evidence was there and all the legal criteria were met one couldn't find
a verdict of Unlawfully Killed even though the people who were alledged
to have done the deed were unknown by .........   if a person is
murdered but the culprit isn't discovered it doesn't diminish the crimew
it just means that the ........    cannot be charged.
Mr. Kennedy agreed with that though he did say probably it would be
very difficult because of establishing the appropriate causal connections
between the deaths and the actions.

I suggested it might have been that their Counsel had looked at the
evidence from the point of view of the "Named parties" rather than the
other way round bearing in mind that even if they had felt that there
was something in this possibility is they did not know who these
people might have been and as it was probably a practical impossibility
to establish who they were they still would have been in exactly the
same position as they were anyway i.e.  not able to prosecute.   I
drew his attentio n to the fact that whilst they were   looking at it
from the point of yours to who if anybody might be prosecuted a
Coroner and his jury will be looking at it from the point of view as to
how the deceased came by his death and the fact that somebody or other
could or couldn't be prosecuted didn't feature in quite the same way.
At that point he asked me to write to then but he felt that they
probably would be able to let me have an appropriate letter.   I suggested
that he had a word with his colleague who had dealt with the Zeebrugge
and in fact I told him that Mr. Sturt had made the suggestion.

The matter is somewhat complicated of course because of Mr. Edey who's
judicial review is being heard on Monday.   Apparently he has already
been turned down by the Judge in chambers but now it will be heard
in open court at tfae Royal Courts of Justice and the Judge whoever it
might be has told thev D.P.P. that he wishes him to attend and be
represented presumably to argue the case.

I told Mr. Kennedy that my attitude to this matter was as follows
   A. Mr. Edey was not connected with any of the families or indeed
        any of the other interested parties.  Indeed as far as I knew
        the representatives of the interested parties were not in touch
        with him, at least that was my impression but I could    be
        mistaken of course.

   B.   That unless I was served with an injunction or the D.P.P. were
         to request me to adjourn under Rule 28 and I felt that I had to
         adjourn I would proceed with the inquests.   This was on the basis
         that it wasn't very fair or right not to do so bearing in mind
         point A. above and that in any event the D.P.P. could always look
         at the matter again in light of the evidence which was taken at the
         inquest.   It did however underline the need for a suitable letter
          from them .

I phoned Mr. Kennedy back and asked him if he could

possibly send the faxes through by about 1.30 as I had an

Inquest. He agreed to do so, and in fact the faxes arrived

at about 10 to 2.

           Dear Sir

           H I L L S B O R O U G H STADIUM DISASTER

           The Director of Public Prosecutions has n o w received from the West
           Midlands Police the final report in this criminal investigation together
           with substantial supporting evidence an d documentation. Y o u will recall
           in Aug ust 1989 that the Director requested a full criminal investigation
           following publication of the Interim Report produced after the Public
           Enquiry conducted by Lord Justice Taylor into the circumstances
           surrounding the disaster at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield on 15th April
           1989.

           Th e most careful consideration has be en given to all the evidence and
           documentation. T h e Director has decided that there is no evidence to
           justify any criminal proceedings being instituted against South Yorkshire
           Police, Sheffield W e d n e s d a y Football Club, Messrs Ea s t w o o d and Partners
           or Sheffield City Council in connection with the disaster at the
           Hillsborough Football Stadium Sheffield on 15th April 1989.

           The Director has also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to
           justify proceedings against any officer of the South Yorkshire Police or
           any other person for any offence.

           I a m sending a copy of this letter to y o u by FAX.

           I a m also sending copies to the investigating officer, Chief Constable
           Leslie Sharp, to the Coroner Dr Pop p e r and to the Police Complaints
           Authority. Copies will also be sent to solicitors representing the^
           Hillsborough Steering Committee, the Sheffield City Council, Sheffield
           W e d n e s d a y Football Club and Messrs E a s t w o o d and Partners.

  Following a lengthy a nd detailed investigation by the West Midlands

  Police an d close consideration of L o r d Justice Taylor's report, the

  Director of Public Prosecutions, Allan Green Q.C., has concluded that

  there is per evidence u p o n which a prosecution for manslaughter or any

  other criminal offence m a y be brought against the South Yorkshire Police,

  Sheffield W e d n e s d a y Football Club, Messrs E a s t w o o d and Partners or

  Sheffield City Council in connection with the disaster at Hillsborough

  Football Stadium Sheffield on 15th April 1989.



  T h e Director has also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to

FILE NOTE DATED 2.6.90. CONFERENCE WITH COUNSEL, PAPER

BUILDINGS, LONDON.________ _________ __________________ ___

For filing - Legal Advice/ Counsel's Opinion - Cross

indexing - Michael Powers Counsel - Legal Opinion.



We saw Michael Powers together with the articled clerk of

Mr. Ian Rothera.       Discussed instructions to Counsel dealing

with the Part A i.e., the interpretation of Section 16.

Counsel said that having re-studied the Section and

considered it, he had come to the conclusion that it was

perfectly possible for the D.P.P. to request an adjournment

 under Section 16 (1) (b) in respect of persons who might be

 connected to somebody who had been charged with an offence

 under Section 16(1)     (a).    The reason for this being that he

 felt that reference to the deceased in Section (1) (b) was

 a reference to the deceased person in respect of whom the

 D.P.P. was making his request and not the same as a

 deceased person who had been charged under the provisions

 of Section 16 (1) (a).         In other words, he accepted the

 construction of this Section which the D.P.P. and Mr.

  Sturt had put upon it.

  Basically he felt that there were three possibilities.

  1.     That there was a charge of Homicide in respect of

         somebody.   That was covered by Section 6 (1) (a).

  2.     That the D.P.P. informed the Coroner that somebody had

         been charged with an offence relating to the death of

         the deceased under Section 16 (1) (b).

3.    A varient of 2 but the D.P.P.        specified offence

      in respect of Manslaughter in respect of somebody other

      than the deceased in respect of whom the D.P.P. was

      giving notice i.e., Section 16 (1) (b) again.

Counsel then spent some time discussing the imnplications

of the D.P.P's decision, assuming that this contingency

were to arise on the resumption of the Inquest.       He made it

clear that the mere fact that the D.P.P. requested the

adjournment did not mean that the Coroner had to agree to

it.    The way the Section was worded was that the Coroner if

requested, shall adjourn unless there is reason to the

contrary.     In other words, request by itself is not

sufficient.    Judicial consideration/discretion must apply.

His advice was that in this event, one should have a

procedural meeting with all the legal advisers (he

confirmed that he agreed that the Jury did not have to be

present for this or indeed any other matter where merely

legal points were raised).     One should listen very

carefully to any arguments which they propounded, then

consider them, possibly with an adjournment and then give

one's decision.     He felt that it could well be that some

very strong arguments might be put up which might induce

one to take the view that one should continue with the

Inquest, but provided one had listened and taken the

arguments into account, he felt if there was the

possibility that the Inquest might prejudice the criminal

 proceedings, then that might well be a very strong factor

 for not resuming.

 He also thought that it would be a good idea, if having

 heard the arguments if one summarised them back to the

 legal advisers to make sure that they agreed that all the

 points which they were trying to make had been understood.

 We then turned to Part B of the instruction i.e., the

 assumption that the D.P.P. will not proceed with it.    We

 spent some time discussing the likelihood of this and the

possibility of who might or might not face proceedings but

of course this is a matter entirely for the D.P.P. and at

the present time,    I do not have any inkling as to what his
thinking i s .

We had a look at the judgement in the Zebrugge*2case and it

was noted that the Court referred to the fact that the

Coroner had done an enormous amount of work in deciding

whom to call.    I pointed out that we had about 5,000

statements and that it was almost an impossible task to

read them all, certainly if one was trying to run a

full-time jurisdiction as well. Counsel's opinion was that

if this contingency were to arise, one would have to take

probably months to try and read through the statements to

decide whom to call and that in effect, one would have to
have a full-time Deputy.

Counsel's opinion was that in view of the undoubted

requirements for an Inquest in a situation like this, and




JOAADA
 Page 4

 the excellence of the performance of Mr.Sturt in Zebrugge^-

 together with the text of the judgement, there really was

no option but for any other Inquest following that, to be

done to at least that standard.   His view therefore was

that the fact that the matter had already been dealt with

by Public Inquiry made no difference, and a full Inquest

Inquiry would have to be undertaken.   He felt that

obviously there were lines to be drawn but these would have

to be assessed when one studied precisely the scope of the
Inquiry.

He said he thought it would be wise to hold procedural

meetings with the legal advisers and that it might be

possible to agree chunks of evidence with them which would

obviously save a considerable amount of time.

I pointed out that one of the difficulties was that in this

case there was probably pressure from opposing parties on

me to hold the Inquest, fin the one side,* presumably there

would be people anxious to obtain an Unlawful Killing

verdict and on the other, there were people who may feel

that things ought to be put more fully than what was done

at the Public Inquiry.

In addition, I pointed out that there were some interesting

observations.   In particular, the fact that many of the

deceased had not been in the stadium early, but had come in

K^leti-vely either late or relatively late.   This could have

had major implications.

 I asked him again as to what     he thought about     the   scope of

the Inquest and he felt that      there really was     no escape

from the conclusion that it would have to be done in full.

We did not actually discuss the length of the Inquest but

it appeared that one to two months was mentioned and this

might well be an under-estimate rather than anything else.

We then discussed some of the practicalities.        He felt that

the absolute minimum that one had to have was 1. A

full-time Deputy who would look after the 'shop' whilst I

was dealing with the Inquests and the preparation probably.

2. Morning after transcripts,     both for myself and the

interested parties.     3.   An assistant for myself or

assistants of course, plus legal assistants in the shape of

amicus.   He felt that this would be both helpful and

necessary in relation to presentation of evidence and

advice.   He did not think having an assessor would be a

good idea, particularly if the assessor were at some point

to give evidence.     On the other hand he also felt that the

inquisitorial role of the Coroner could not be displaced by

'Counsel to the Inquiry'.     He felt that on the whole, the

amicus should be there to advise, assist with the

presentation of the case, express any independent opinions

and be present in Court so as to advise on action.

He pointed out that the costs of such an Inquest is going

to be enormous and he felt that it would not be a bad idea

to make some estimates.       The main headings that he

thought of were Deputy, Transcripts, Legal Assistants CEl

vttiisJk- I hrad^uHt accommodation.   There may of course be other

factors as well such as witnesses and juries, plus possibly

other expenses.

He thought it might be an idea to obtain an estimate from

Rotheras of the sort of costs one would be talking about.

We talked about the jury for a few minutes.        He thought

that they should be out for any procedural or legal

discussions.     We discussed what would happen if a juror

fell ill or for some reason could not continue.        In some

respects he felt that it would be ideal if we did not lose

more than two.     This is because it might be argued that the

ones who dropped out whatever excuse they gave, were

dropping out because they could not bring themselves to

reach a particular verdict and that one was therefore left

with a rump q L.       likeminded.     If however we could

restrict the loss to two and the rest brought in a

unamimous verdict then of course it is arguable that no

harm had been done because in effect this was a majority

decision, but it was not a very good argument as of course

one did not know what influence the jurors who were not

there might have




JOAADA
Page 7

 In the final analysis, he felt it would be ridiculous if

one could not proceed if a juror had to drop out and he

thought the best way to proceed was to see what the

procedure/rules were in respect of this in criminal courts,

and then to follow that procedure as closely as possible.

He expressed his great interest in the matter and confirmed

that he would be very pleased to help and advise further if

that were necessary or appropriate.

After expressing the usual thanks etc., the meeting broke

up.

Counsel is asked to advise Her Majesty's Coroner for South Yorkshire (West)
District on the following matters.      For convenience these instructions
are divided into Part A and Part B.

Part A proceeds on the assumption that the Director of Public Prosecutions
will charge someone or more persons with an offence of Manslaughter.

Part B proceeds on the assumption that the Director of Public Prosecutions decides
that neither Section (l) (a) or Section 16 (l) (b) of the Coroners'
Act 1988 apply.

Part A.   1. Counsel's attention is drawn to Section 16 of the Coroners'
               Act 1988.

          2. For the purposes of this instruction, it is assumed that
               the charge under Section 16 (l) (a) (i) would be in respect
               of one or two of the deceased and not in respect of all
               95 persons who have died.

          3. It had been the view of Her Majesty's Coroner that in
               that event the Coroner would adjourn the Inouest under Section
               16 (l) (a) in respect of those persons of whom a Manslaughter
               charge had been brought and in respect of the remainder of
               the deceased, he would adjourn the Inauests under the provisions
               of Section 16 (l) (b) assuming that the D.P.P. made an
               appropriate reauest.
               This appears to be a commonsense view of looking at the
               inter-relationship of the two sub sections in a situation such
               as the Hillsborough Disaster.    This also seems to be the
               view of the Authors of the Law & Practice on Coroners, Thurston
               Third Edition, Section 22.20.    The attention of Counsel is
               also drawn to Jervis on Coroners 10th Edition Paragraph
               14.27.

          4.   The Coroner's attention was re-drawn to Section 16 because of
               the situation arising out of the Marchioness Inauest, vhere the
               skipper of the boat has been charged with an offence which
               does not fall within Section 16 (l) (a).    However, it is
               understood the D.P.P. has requested the Coroner to adjourn
               the Inquest in respect of all the deceased under the provisions
               of Section 16 (l) (b).

               On an examination of Section 16, what has concerned the Coroner
               is whether it is open to the D.P.P. to request an adjournment
               under Section 16 (l) (b) in a case where someone has been charged
               with Manslaughter of a particular person, and notice is given
               under Section 16 (l) (a).
The drafting of Section 16 (l) (a)     is not entirely clear.
Sub paragraph (i) ends with the word "deceased" whereas
sub paragraphs (ii) and (iii) end with the word "or".
It is not clear whether the word "or" particularly at the
end of sub paragraph (iii) merely applies to that sub paragraph
or to the whole sub section.     If the "or" only applies to the
sub paragraph then presumably it is possible for a person
to be charged under sub section (a) in connection with
the Manslaughter of the deceased 'X' and at the same time,
for the D.P.P. to implement the provisions of sub section (b)
(but see paragraph 6 below on this).    If the ^   : "or"
refers to the whole of sub section (a) then Counsel is asked
to advise on whether it is possible for sub section (b) to
be implemented at all.   One possible reconciliation would be
to argue that sub section (a) deals with a person charged
with the death of the deceased 'X1 whereas sub section (b)
deals with other people, but in that case what is the purpose
of the word "or".   Hopefully the word "or" can be treated
as tautologous   or otherwise reconciled because its implementation
in the way outlined above would seem to produce a ridiculous
result.

The next point that arises is whether or not it is possible
for the provisions of Section l^|J(b) to apply in a
case where a charge has been brought against a person in respect
of Manslaughter under paragraph Section 16 (l) (a).     Prime
facie, this would seem to be the intention.    The difficulty
arising from the fact that the sub section (b) includes the
words "alleged to have been committed in circumstances connected
with the death of the deceased, not being an offence within
paragraph (a) above".    If "the deceased" in sub paragraph (b)
is the same as "the deceased" in sub paragraph (a) then it would
seem that one has the ludicrous situation that a Manslaughter
charge negates the D.P.P's ability to avoid an Inquest being
held into the death of persons connected with the death of
the deceased 'X' but in respect of whom no charges have been
brought.   On the other hand, if a lesser inclinable charge is brought,
the D.P.P. can implement sub section (b).

Ag it happens, this situation has already been explored
by Mr. Sturt, the Coroner for the County of Kent, and I
enclose copies of an exchange of correspondence between
him and the D.P.P. dated the 12th of January 1990 and the
l6th of January 1990.    You will recollect that in the Zebrugge
Disaster, following the Inquest several people had been
charged with the offence of Manslaughter and are in fact at
the moment awaiting trial.     Since then, a further death of
a Mr. Singh has occurred.    The Coroner for Kent was concerned
whether or not he would have to have a full Inquest into
his death.   You will see that in effect the D.P.P. has
interpreted sub section 16 (l) (b) by in fact saying
that somebody has been charged with the offence of Manslaughter
in respect of 'X1, but that he is requesting the adjournment
because that offence has been committed in circumstances
connected with a death of 'Y' but the offence which has
been charged is not the Manslaughter of 'Y1.   In other
words, the "death of the deceased" refers to the person
or persons who have not been charged under sub paragraph
(a).

If this section can be interpreted in this way then the
problem outlined in paragraph 6 would seem to have been
overcome (subject to your advice on the point outlined
in paragraph 5).
The interpretation applied by Mr. Sturt and the D.P.P. has
a very marked advantage of making sense of the provisions.
Counsel is asked to advise on this as soon as possible.
1 . This section deals with the hypothesis that the D.P.P. will not
     proceed under Section 16 either sub section (a) or sub section (b).
     In that event, as the Coroner sees it, the Inquests will have to
     be resumed, and concluded.


2.   Counsel is reminded that the Coroner has already sat with a Jury for
     about 2-js- weeks and taken evidence relating to 95 deceased and in particular
     has dealt with the questions of who, when and where they died, but has
     not dealt with the question of how.


3.        individual Inquest was of course different, but they followed
     a more or less standard form and by way of background information a copy
     of one of these Inquests is attached to these instructions for information.
     (D.G. Godwin).

4.   Counsel is also reminded that a full public inquiry has already taken
     place before Lord Justice Taylor.


5.   The issue that has to be determined then is how much further work has
     to be undertaken by the Coroner and his Jury with a view to reaching a
     verdict?


6. The Coroner i3 aware of the provisions of Rule 36 and 42 as well
     as the Rule dealing with self incrimination.     Counsel's attention
     is drawn to the statutory provisions, in particular Section 8 (2 ) (b),
     8 (3) (d), 11 (2),11 (5),11(6),and 13 (l) (b) of the Coroners' Act 1988.


7.   The issue that has to be resolved in determining the scope of the
     Inquest is:-

                a.   How large a"circle"does the word "how" enconpass.

                b.   To what extent do the questions of "why did it happen"
                     and "who is to blame" fall within the compass of the
                     word "how".

      These questions of course apply to all Inquests but are particularly
      relevant in Inauests associatedwifti a major disaster and where, as
      in this particular case, a public inquiry has/t ai'eS3' ^ ace.
      In this connection Counsel’s attention is drawn to H.B. Sturt
      H.M.Coroner for East Kent ex parte Peter Alan Spooner etc,
      ^here this qtu?stie» to a certain extent was canvassed.


 8 . One view that could I suppose be taken is to restrict the question
      of "how" to the establishment simply of the fact that a'-    crush
      occurred within the terraces, but not to explore the reasons for
      this, taken together with the medical cause of death, the Jury
      could be invited to bring in a verdict.
       I
                               -   2   -

     The difficulty with this is that:

                (i)     This it is unlikely that such a limited inquiry
                        would satisfy anyone.


                (ii)    Probably the decision would be appealed on the
                        grounds of insufficiency of inquiry.
                (iii) It would make it impossible for the Jury to consider
                      a verdict of Unlawfully Killed because the evidence
                      presented to them would not enable them to be satisfied
                      beyond a reasonable doubt that the criteria for such
                      a verdict had been fulfilled, (see Me Curb in case).


9.   If this is correct, one seems to be left with an alternative which is
     that a full inquiry is needed, notwithstanding the Public Inquiry
     which     already taken place or the fact that the D.P.P. has considered
     the papers and has come to a conclusion not to take any action (this
     if you remember is the hypothesis of this part of the instructions).
     Furthermore it would seem that to a large extent, the ground covered
     by the Public Inquiry would have to be re-canvassed.     Counsel’s attention
     is aga-in drawn to the case involving the Coroner for Kent.


10. It seems to the Coroner that if the latter view is correct, then by way
     of example at least the following aspects would have to be explored:


                  (i)     The fans - time of arrival including possibly the reasons
                          for lateness of arrival.

                          Behaviour, demeanour and state of intoxication.

                   (ii) The site (including Club* Engineers---' ^
                        etc)- turnstiles, signs,access, stewarding and
                        possibly previous incidents in particular an incident
                        which occurred in 1981 when crushing occurred on these
                        terraces.


                  (iii) The police - the police were severely criticised in Lord
                        Justice Taylor’s report. Their management of the game,
                        including command and organisation within and without
                        the ground, and management ranging from the Site
                        Commanders to individual officers, particulary those
                        who have been the subject of complaint.


                      (vi) Others, e.g., licensing authorities, rescue organisations
                           etc.

                                                                     Executive
                       (v) Expert evidence from say Health & Safety/Engineers and
                           others regarding configuration. Reasons for breaking
                           of barriers. Explanations as to why the vast majority
                           of the deceased died in Pen 3 as compared with only
                           about 7 in Pen 4 (incidentally, Counsel might be
                           interested to know that more than half of the people
                           who died entered the stadium after 2 .30p.m. and about 22
                           are known to have entered the stadium when Gate C was
                           opened at or after approximately 14-52).
One should perhaps mention that an Inquest conducted on these
lines is likely to be an enormous . task.   Lord Justice Taylor
sat for 31 days and examined about 174 witnesses orally.    In
the Zebrugge Inquest over 400 witnesses gave evidence (some by
way of documentary evidence).
                                             of deaths
In this particular case, although the number/ are less than
the people who died at Zebrugge, the number of people who were
present at the time of the disaster are of course very much
larger and thousands of statements have been taken by the West
Midlands Police.


Because of the enormous task, not to say the cost, Her Majesty’s
Coroner wants to be certain as he reasonably can be that his
assessment of the requirement for the scope of the Inquest as
outlined above is correct.   Counsel is therefore asked to advise
on the extent and scope of the Coroner’s Inquisition in the case
of the Hillsborough Disaster, and in particular, to advise on
the word "how" together with this overlap of "why" and "whom".


Counsel is asked to consider the matter as soon as conveniently
possible.   Would Counsel please note that Dr. Popper is not
available between the 4th and 22nd of July and would like the matter
dealt with either before the 4th of July, if that is possible,
of if that is not practical, as soon after the 22nd of July, as
it may be conveniently possible.


If Counsel feels, before giving an opinion, that he would want
to have a conference with Dr. Popper, then this can no doubt be
arranged.

FILE NOTE 24.7.90 TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR. CLEU G H .

OF THE D.P.P.



I explained to him that I was not trying to pressure him in

any way, but Iwas anxious to find out whether they had had

the full reports from the police and what the time scale

was before they would be in a position to say something.

He explained that Mr.Kennedy was more conversant with the

case at the moment and that he would get Mr. Kennedy to

ring me back.   As it happened, Mr. Kennedy walked into the

room at that moment so I spoke to him.   I repeated what I

had said to Mr. Cleugh.   Mr. Kennedy's response was that he

understood that the last statements had been taken.      They

were awaiting these.   They would then be submitted to

Counsel and the matter would be assessed and a written

report prepared.   He hoped that by the end of August he

would be in a position to either give a decision or be able

to much more accurately assess the time scale before they

would be able to say what they intended to do.    I explained

to him that the reason why I was anxious was that not only

did the decision affect the scope of my Inquests but also

of course the duration of time which they would require

          the volume or level or work which I would have to

put in to the Inquiry at this stage.



I asked him whether he wanted copies of the transcripts.

He replied "no, that if there was anything in them which

to him".



We agreed that I would contact him again towards the end of

            Dear Doctor Popper

            Thank you for your letter of 15 May 1990 which concerns the Hillsborough
            Disaster.

            I saw it as a necessary and important part of my duty as Investigating
            Officer to spend as much time as possible at the inquests and I am
            extremely grateful for the way you received me in Sheffield.

            You are quite correct when you say that I am the Investigating Officer in
            respect   of criminal and   disciplinary matters which arise out of     the
            disaster.   I am under the supervision of the Police Complaints Authority
            and I replaced Mr Geoffrey Dear, who has retired from the Police Service to
            become anv Inspector of Constabulary.      Mr Jones remains as Coroner's
            Officer   for you in respect of the 95 deaths which arose out of        the
            disaster.    He is presently attached to the Police Staff College at
            Bramshill in Hampshire as part of the directing staff there.       He will
            remain available to you for all coronal matters in connection with those 95
            deaths.

            The last act of Geoffrey Dear before his retirement was to send an interim
            report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.   Since then I have received
            the Director's advice on that report and I am progressing the necessary
            actions  which arise from   that advice.   Very soon we will conduct the
            required interviews but at this stage there is no way that I can estimate
            how long that process will take. All I can say is that I am fully awar eof
            the need to proceed without delay.       I shall keep you informed as to
            progress from time to time.    When all of the interviews are complete it
            should not take too long to report to the DPP with my recommendations, but
            after that the matter is out of my control as to how long it will take to
            make the decisions necessary in respect of prosecutions.

            I agree with you that we should meet again in the near future and my staff
            will be in touch with your office to find a mutually convenient date.
Insofar as the police report and recommendations are concerned,   I shall
discuss the matter with the PCA and let you know the outcome.

You may care to note that my base for the time being is at Nechell's Green
Police Station in West Midlands, and it is there that I can most easily be
contacted through Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Foster.

Yours sincerely

FILE NOTE.


Dr. Paul Knapman phoned me at the hotel (following a call from me to
say would he ring me to tell me what was going on).     He was
highly elated as he had had quite a successful Inquest in particular,
he had had a very hairy day on the Monday when he opened, with more
than half of the families not wishing him to proceed.     However in
the final analysis, only 7 people requested him to adjourn.      In
addition on yesterday, Thursday, he received a letter from the D.P.P.
telling him that the Master of the Bow Belle would be prosecuted
for failing to keep a proper look-out.     In the light of this he had
adjourned the Inquest for 28 days and as far as I could understand
he was proposing not to resume under Section 16 lb.     I expressed
some surprise at this as it seemed to me, as I interpretted that
section as referring to serious charges such as Manslaughter etc.
He read me the Section and his view was that provided the D.P.P.
requested him, it didn’t matter what the charge was.     Obviously that
is correct.    It does raise quite important implications for Hillsborough
because for all I know, but at the moment I know nothing, lesser
charges might conceivably have been brought against various people
which might then result in adjoumement under that section.

He said that he anticipated that if he said he was not resuming/lie3’^
would be taken for judicial review, but although he was not
particularly relishing that, he felt to be reviewed for agreeing with
the D.P.P. was probably as good a thing to be reviewed as anything.
If that were to happen then that of course might set a precedent for us

He discussed various other matters such as Press Announcements and
contact with the Media and some of his, the way he dealt with the
Inquests in particular he managed to do them in about 15 minutes each.
He took evidence of identity from the Coroner’s Officer and also from
the Officer evidence of where      the deceased was found in the water.
He called one live witness per case to give some graphic descriptions.
The pathologist, and that was about it.     I asked if he would be kind enough to
send me a trp^sotfipt of one or two of these Inquests so that I could
see precisely what he had done.     I undertook that I would reciprocate
because we were obviously taking rather longer than he.    He said that
all his arrangements were done by just two of the people, and that
the police w§re not involved.     I emphasised that this was not the
case for me.     That I could not have had more co-operation and better
quality service.    He wanted to know whether I controlled them or they
controlled me.     I said that forpractical purposes they had obviously
given advice but anything that I wanted done was done, though quite
                              -    2    -


clearly we did discuss matters.    X could not have been more satisfied
with the way things had been handled.       Obviously I need to have a good
look at Section 16 to see whether there is any substance in what he
says, though I find it difficult to believe that that is right
because it would mean for instance in any R.T.A. or indeed any offence,
where any offence is charged, we could adjourn under that section which
is not in fact the way we do it.       Perhaps I am wrong.   I will have to
look.

Chief Constable,

Dear Mr. Sharp,

It was very good of you to come to Sheffield and spend as
much time as you in fact did at the inquests into the deaths
of the 95 people who died at the Hillsborough Football
Stadium on 15th April 1989.  I very much appreciate the fact
that you were prepared to give your time and to do me the
honour of your presence at the hearings.

I am of course aware that you are now the Investigating Officer
for the purposes of the criminal investigation and I believe
also the Police Complaints Authority investigations, and that
Mervyn Jones has withdrawn from these activities.           <

As I understand it the D.P.P. has not yet taken a decision
with regard to the criminal aspects relating to this disaster
and now that the interim hearings are over I am obviously
anxious to be kept informed of progress as any decisions which
I have to take are very much dependent upon the outcome of
your report as well as the decision of the D.P.P.

It may be that now that the interim inquests are out of the way
that it might be a good idea if we met at some convenient time
or place in order to discuss any outstanding points and in
particular any problems arising out of the inter-relationship
of your task as it impinges upon my future activities in a
Coronal capacity.

It had been our intention that once the interim inquests were
out of the way that I would be furnished with a copy of the
recommendations to the D.P.P. as well as a set of the statements
and documents which have been submitted to him for his
consideration.  Obviously this is now a matter for you, but if
you felt able to let me have the documentation it would be very
helpful.  I should add that I have had the first three volumes,
two of statements and one of exhibits but Without the covering
goleaoed report or summary.

    Dear Dr Popper

    HILLSBOROUGH

    I write further to your letter of the 15th February 1990 and my
    reply of the 16th February.

    I have now received Counsel's opinion and considered fully the
    request made by the Steering Committee in their letter of the 5th
    February.

    The matter has been fully discussed at some length with
    Mr J Mervyn Jones and I am satisfied that evidence can be given
    formally at the adjourned inquest within strict parameters and
    that provided the evidence is given in this way there will be no
    prejudice either to the current criminal investigation or to any
    subsequent prosecution.

    Such evidence should relate only to the movements on April 15th
    1989 of those who died, evidence of identification and medical
    evidence of the cause of death.     Any requests for evidence
    exceeding those restrictions should be refused as it is likely
    to impinge upon matters which are currently the subject of the
    criminal investigation and which will be considered when a
    decision  is made    about  the  initiation   of  any  criminal
    proceedings.

     I enclose a copy of a letter which I have sent to the Steering
     Committee and I confirm I have sent a copy of this letter to
     Mr Jones.




Fax 01-222-4751                               Telex 9 4 5 3 1 0 CPS HQ                                   Britdoc D X 2 3 2 8 Victoria
I should be pleased to attend any meeting which you may wish to
hold to discuss the practicalities of the adjourned inquest
hearing.

Should you wish to discuss the matter on the telephone please do
not hesitate to contact me.

Yours faithfully

     Dear Madam

     HILLSBOROUGH

     Thank you for your letter of the 5th February 1990 addressed to
     the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have been asked to reply.

     Following receipt of your letter I have been in correspondence
     with the coroner, Dr Popper, and your request for information
     has been discussed in detail with the Assistant Chief Constable
     Mr J Mervyn Jones.   We have a great deal of sympathy with your
     request and I have recently received Counsel1s opinion on this
     unusual point.     I am sure you will understand that the
     prosecuting authorities are under a duty to ensure that they <io
     not conduct themselves in such a way as to prejudice either .the
     criminal investigation or any subsequent criminal proceedings.
     Generally, none of the information which is collected by criminal
     investigation is released until the later time either of a
     decision not to prosecute being reached or the conclusion of any
     criminal proceedings.

     However, I have considered the matter fully and whilst I am not
     prepared to disclose all the copies of the statements direct to
     you I feel that your request can be dealt with by a more formal
     disclosure in the arena of the coroner's court.    I have written
     to Dr Popper confirming that the inquests could be resumed to
     hear evidence on a restricted basis providing only that
     information requested by you relating to the movements on the
     15th April 1989 of those who died, evidence of identification and
     medical evidence of the cause of death.

I believe that the release of such evidence in this way will
satisfy your request and provide the necessary formal framework
for the release of that information.   I have copied this letter
to Dr Popper and to Mr J Mervyn Jones.

Should you wish to discuss this letter please do not hesitate to
telephone Michael Kennedy in this office who is dealing with the
case.

           Dear Dr Popper

           RE: HILLSBOROUGH

           Thank you for your letter of the 15th February 1990.

           I note what you say in connection with the disclosure of
           information to the Steering Committee by means of resuming the
           inquests.

           We have considerable sympathy for the relatives of the
           deceased and we are anxious to assist but we must ensure that
           the criminal investigation and any criminal prosecution is not
           prejudiced in any way by such disclosure.

           I have today sent papers to Mr Gareth Williams QC and
           Mr Peter Birts of Counsel who have been advising the Director
           of Public Prosecutions in connection with matters arising from
           the events at Hillsborough on the 15th April 1989.

           I hope very shortly to receive their Opinion and thereafter I
           will contact you to discuss the possibility of a meeting.

           We have spoken with Mr Jones to keep him appraised of our
           feelings on this delicate point.

           Yours sincerely

      Dear Sir,
      I an sorry about not formally replying to 3 ^ ^ letter of
      the 20th of February at an earlier date.

      I a* very *«oh obliged to you and your colleagues for
      dealing with tiie matter so promptly.

      What we have done is to have a pre-inquest review and we
      propose to renume the Inquests on a limited basis starting

  Dear Mr. Newell,

  ftp* TnTJHBQBOUGH - 15th of April 1989.

  X refer to Miss. Steel*s letter to you of the 5th of February 1990.
  I have discussed' the contents of this letter with Mr. Mervyn Jones
  Assistant Chief Constable, West Midlands Police who is in fall
  agreement.
  I also had a meeting' with Counsel (prior to the receipt of Miss.
  Steel's letter) in which I discussed some of the procedural
  aspects relating to this matter.
  On the whole, I think that Miss- Steel*s suggestions may have some
  merit in them       in particular as far as I am concerned, I
  •Hrtnir that it might be both helpful and advantageous if I were
  to resume the Inquests in early Spring’for the purposes of taking
  the medical evidence, together with non-contraversial evidence
  such as to the location of the deceased, either alive or dead
  or both within the ground.
  If I were to do this, it would be on the basis that the evidence
  being taVon at that stage would be restricted to these matters.
  Obviously a degree of control of the proceedings would be required,
  but I expect this could be achieved.
  We think that it would be useful if you agree, for Me. Jones and
  myself to meet with you. to discuss this aspect of the matter as soon
  as possible so that if we were minded to deal with it along these
  lines, the appropriate arrangements can be made as soon as possible.
  Mr.. Jones and I would be available on the following dates

            some person has hean charged before examining Justices

            circumstances connected with the death of the deceased,
            but not being an offence of murder, manslaughter, etc.,
            of the deceased, or otherwise falling within Section
            16(1) (a) of the Ant.

                   Upon receipt of this information, I would intend,
             pursuant to section 16(1), to adjourn the Inquest until
             after    the   conclusion  of  the    relevant criminal

         Dear Mr Doyle

         HILLSBOROUGH - CRUSH BARRIERS

         I. refer to your1 letter of 18 October 1989 on this subject directed to me at
         Furnival (louse, Sheffield.   Unfortunately, we vacated Furnival House in July
         and, whilst we did have a mail re-direction from that address, I do not
         seem to have received your letter.    Incidentally, to further complicate the
         position, given we are now responsible for the criminal investigation,
         Furnival House will re-open on Friday, 27 October.    Fortunately, a copy of
         your letter came to me via Mr Whalley who had copied it to me, together
         with a copy of your letter concerning the drawings prepared by Brade &
         Partners.   Regrettably, the letter did not arrive in time for1 me to respond
         to you before the commencement of today's preliminary pre-trial hearing,
         although I had tried to telephone first thing this morning.
                                                                                                                   /
         I have noted the contents of your letter and in particular your concern
         about barrier 124a and access to it.   The situation at present is that the
         Director1 of Public Prosecutions does not see any further1 need to retain the
         barrier subject to receiving assurances from the Health and Safety
         F.xecutive, in writing, that they have no further use for the barrier
         and that the Director1 of Public Prosecutions has the opportunity of
         having a representative present at the time of future tests, that the
         opportunity will exist to take photographs and all reports and data are
         made available to the Director of Public Prosecutions/Crown Prosecution
         Service.

         However, as you know the interest, in the barrier is not restricted to the
         Director of Public Prosecutions, or myself on his behalf.   Lord Justice
         Taylor has an interest and once I have received the letter1 from Dr
         Nicholson at the Health and Safety Executive declaring they no longer




                                                                                        Cont.
   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                          Hi r;mi ngharn
have interest then J. will write t.o him to seek his approval. Furthermore,
H.M. Coroner at Sheffield will also want to give similar approval once Dr
Nicholson has issued his letter.

All this might, seem a little bit. bureaucrat ic bill, given that the barrier’
could be an important part of any subsequent proceedings then I wish to be
assured that all parties 1 relate t.o have had every opportunity to examine
and carry out tests.   Having said that, I do hope that it will not be long
before J can release the barrier and certainly in plenty of time for you
to carry out what work you wish in good time for the commencement of the
civil case.

1 have received a letter from Hammond Suddards, who as you know represent
South Yorkshire Police, who have also requested access to the barrier for
the purposes of securing samples.   They have also written to the Director
of Public Prosecutions seeking his permission for such samples.    It occurs
t.o me that Hammond Suddards may not tie the only parties who wish to take
samples of this barrier and carry out further’ tests.   Consequently, I have
agreed with the representative of the Director of Public Prosecutions'
office that once I have all the assurances that we no longer need the
barrier then he, Mr Kennedy, will undertake to contact you and the other
representatives of the parties involved in order to discuss the best way
forward.   Sheffield Wednesday Football Club who are ultimately the
'owners' of the barrier, no doubt will wish to have their say in respect
of the way forward.

1 trust this letter is of assistance to you.  Please rest assured that I
will not delay the release of the barrier without good cause.

              OUR REF.          PCM/PAB                    YOUR REF.                                         date    20th October, 198'




               Dear Sir,

               Hillsborough

               Further to previous correspondence, we have been given to understam
               by the Health & Safety Executive, who presently have custody of the
               broken barrier 124A, that no access to the barrier and, in
               particular, no taking of samples is to be permitted and that any
               enquiries in this connection are to be referred to yourself.

                As you know, we are acting for the Chief Constable of South
                Yorkshire in the civil proceedings and one of the issues in the
                case is whether the barrier failed whilst under a load less than                                                                    ~


                the load which it ought to have safely carried.                                                                                        1

                Whilst our Engineer can make some estimates about this on the basi#
                of a physical inspection of the barrier, which he has carried out,^
                no final report can be prepared for use in the civil proceedings
                without some samples being taken and metallurgically tested.

                As you may be aware, there is a pre-trial review in the civil      ~
                actions at Manchester High Court on Thursday, 26th October befor
                Mr. Justice Rose.  At that stage, we may be called upon to indicat|
                when we anticipate having expert evidence available and,
                when we are able to consider a number of other points which depena,
                upon the availability of that evidence.                            !




                                                                                                                                    /■          contl




                 Mr. J. Mervyn Jones,
                 Assistant Chief Constable,
                 West Midlands Police,
                 P.O. Box 52, Lloyd House,
We wonder if you are in any position to indicate at this stage,
that is to say before 26th October, if possible:


        1.   Whether those with a legitimate interest in the
             civil proceedings may now take appropriate samples
             from barrier 124A?

        2.   If not, can any prospective date be given when
             such samples might be available?

As we are today writing to the Director of Public Prosecutions on a
separate matter, we are taking the liberty of copying this letter to
the DPP.


Yours    faithfully,

      Dear Sirs

      HILLSBOROUGH

      Your faxed letter dated 20 October 1909 addressed to the
      Director of Public Prosecutions has been passed to me for
      reply.

      With regard to the question of possible prejudice and the
      D.P.R. Futures case, it is our view that, on balance, no
      application to stay civil proceedings needs to be made.
      However, the Director would be grateful to receive an
      undertaking that the Judge dealing with interlocutory matters,
      at any stage,be referred to the DPR case so that he may be
      alerted to the problemfif necessary making orders restricting
      publication of sensitive or potentially prejudicial matters.
      The same would apply if the civil trial itself were to precede
      the Director's final decision.

      With regard to the request made to the West Midlands Police
      for samples to be taken from barrier 124A for metallurgical
      testing.  There is no objection to such samples being taken
      providing the following undertakings are first given in
      writing by each party

       1.             When samples are taken and when tests are carried out
                      wherever they occur a representative nominated by the
                      Crown Prosecution Service is to be present.

       2.             Photographs are to be taken whenever samples are obtained
                      and copies provided to the C.P.S.

       3.             All reportB and data are to be provided promptly to the
                      C.P.B.




 V m 01-222-47 51                                              Telex 9<153 W CP5 HQ                                                               I M tdo c D X 2 3 2 8 Victoria

                           to und«rstand that- you have instructed the West

    Whilst we have no instructions in connection with any possible
    criminal charges, nor indeed any instructions on behalf of specific
    individual Police Officers, it occurs to us that   in the light of
    thO'Cnoo of DPR Futures Limited 1(1989) 1WLR 778] that some
    prejudice may be caused to any Individual - L’olice Officer or
    otherwise - subsequently charged with a criminal offenco if either
    a civil trial takes place before any criminal trial is concluded,
    or indeed if civil interlocutory proceedings take place in opon
    Court, as wc believe may be the intention, on 26th October,

    Wo write to bring this matter to your attention so that you have the
    opportunity of responding to the issuea raised if you consider this
    a p p ro p ria te .

    Wo look forward to hearing from you and, as wc have also written
    today to the Assistant Chief Constable of the West Midlands in
    connection with another matter arising out of the civil proceedings,
    we take the liberty of enclosing a copy of. that letter, in case this
    should bo referred to you for advice.


    Vours faithfully,

             I write following our introductory meeting on 25 August, which I found
             helpful.  You will appreciate that matters have progressed and
             Mr Geoffrey Dear has now been formally appointed as the Investigating
             Officer after the request made by the Director of Public Prosecutions to
             Mr Wright for a full criminal enquiry.

             The investigation is well under way and it is obvious that there will be
             a very large number of statements and other evidence produced.  This has
             prompted me to consider the question of the future availability of the
             evidence, in particular, for the Coroner for the purpose of the inquest
             and for Mr Wright for the purpose of disciplinary or civil proceedings.

             When the enquiry is complete, in the usual way, copies of the
             Investigating Officer's report, together with statements and other
             evidence, will be sent to you as the supervising member of the Police
             Complaints Authority and to Mr Wright for transmission to the Director.
             I take the view that it would be of benefit to me and also to the Coroner
             and Mr Wright if, at this early stage, you would concur with my opinion
             that there should be no objection to the Coroner and Mr Wright having
             access to the evidence for the purposes I have referred to above.   I say
             this having regard to the unusual nature of the investigation which is
             looking, not only at the potential criminal responsibilities of those
             police officers involved, but also the possibility of criminal
             proceedings being issued against the other bodies and persons whom we
             mentioned during the meeting on 25 August.  Obviously this evidence
             could only be made available after the Director had concluded any
             criminal proceedings or decided that no such proceedings were to be
             issued.



   PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE AT                  Lloyd. House,_Birmingham
                                   -   2 -



I am sure that this course can be adopted in the special circumstances
of this unusual investigation and that by taking this decision at an
early stage there can be considerable savings for the public purse,
without any prejudice to the criminal enquiry or subsequent proceedings.

I have discussed this matter with Mr Newell and Mr Cleugh of the Crown
Prosecution Service who agree that this course of action could properly
be adopted and to whom I have sent a copy of this letter.

I look forward to hearing from you on this matter, however, if in the
meantime I can be of any assistance please do not hesitate to contact me.

FRIDAY 1 FEBRUARY 199T


CONFERENCE WITH   COUNSEL MR WALKER.

FROM 5 PM UNTIL APPROX 8 PM.


In some respects we merely scratched the surface of the issues I had
raised with him but ran out of time.

Counsel confirmed that Cunningham had recently been confirmed in the
Court of Appeal R v. Spratt 1989, in which case apparently a person
was acquited despite the fact that it was thought he was reckless,
because he failed to give thought that his action could give rise to
harm. However, this was an offence under Section 47 rather than a
Common Law offence like Manslaughter and on the whole Counsel did not
think that the Cunningham applied.

We then spent some time talking about Re Church. I wondered whether,
if there was an unlawful act other than negligence the requirements
for harm would be less, i.e. only minor harm. After considerable
discussion Counsel took the view that this would not be applicable.

We then turned to Lawrence. Counsel took the view that on the whole
if the issue were to arise the Lawrence direction would probably apply.
He drew my attention to R v Seymour from which it is clear that the
Lawrence/Caldwell applied generally. See Lord Roski 1 1 1s judgement
(this is also clear from Jennings v US Government, which he did not
refer to). He drew my attention to Caldwell and in particular to Page
970 at (b) where it is stated "in the absence of exculpatory factors,
the defendent's state of mind is therefore all important where recklessness
is an element in the offence ch a r g e d ", We spent a lot of time
discussing the fact that not every risk taken could be described as
reckless and, by and large, it appeared to me that Counsel was advising
that in effect one had to look at the whole of the circumstances and
in effect the criteria in ex parti Gray which would seem to indicate
that one has to pass through a number of gates, so to speak, the last
one of which is assessment of recklessness as defined. This would
therefore exclude from the definition those cases where risks were taken
e.g. by a surgeon. We also spent some time thinking about causation
and that it would be necessary to be able to show a direct relationship
between the deaths and the act.
We discussed at length the procedural aspects of withdrawing the verdict
from the Jury. On the whole Counsel felt that in all the circumstances
it would not be possible to do that, although he did think it might be
possible to withdraw in respect of a few parties, if for instance,
causation was clearly not there. One of the problems of withdrawing
a verdict in respect of named parties is that there is the possibility
that it raises a presumption of guilt against the parties in respect
of whom it is not withdrawn, and the prejudicial effect of this might
outweigh any possible benefit.

Counsel was of the view that in summing up it probably would be best
not to sum up against each named individual, picking out the pros and
cons, as this was more likely to generate a judicial review if that
person felt that in law there was no evidence against him (I am not
entirely happy about this aspect of the advice).

Counsel thought that it would be better to leave a special verdict
open to the Jury and referred me to ex parti Kendall (Knaoman, P 248).
The difficulty with this is that such a wording would have to be succinct
and in fact might not be beneficial.

Counsel took the view that in R v. Seymour, the reference in Lord Roski1 1 1s
judgement in P . 1066 that in the offence of manslaughter the risk of death
being caused by the manner of the defendant's driving must be very high,
was an appropriate qualification.to the Lawrence direction, but note
that he does not seem to be supported in this bv Archbold, nor the
House of Lords (                              ).

I also drew his attention to Kong Cheuk Kwan and in particular the
paragraphs, P25 and 26, where the issue of response to the action of
another is mentioned. He thought that the points he had drawn my attention
to in Caldwell covered this.

Counsel agreed with me that cross negligence was not sufficient to ground
a finding of manslaughter. There had to be something more, i.e. reckless­
ness. On the whole he also seemed to agree that mere inadvertance which
Lord Hailsham equates with carelessness, query, which is a word often
used to describe negligence, could be excluded.

1.   Ton will of course be aware that on the 15th of

        April an incident occurred at the Hillsborough

        Football Ground which resulted in the loss of

        95 lives as well as injury to other spectators.

2.   Waft Lord Justice Taylor was charged with holding

        a Public Inquiry, and that the first part of it

        has been completed.     I understand that Lord

        Justice Taylor's interim report is     ix j jm ijI 'O il




3.      As Coroner for South Yorkshire West District, it

        falls to   to   to deal with the deaths by way of Inquest.

4*      It is ay present intention to resume the Inquests

        on the 15th of January 1990.

5.      Mr. Beaneit Huyton ;£ Q.C. in his oral submission to

        Lord Justice Taylor at the close of the oral evidence

        stated:- /•




                                        <2^k^6f
6.      This point is also reported Ln gegtieulaa? in the

        Daily Telegraph, Saturday the 15th of July where

        it is stated:-
         "Solicitors representing the bereaved and injured

         believe that the Inquest is likely to return verdicts

         of Unlawfully Killing*.     They say that if the Grown

         Prosecutor fails to act they will seek leave to begin

        private criminal action against the people they hold

         responsible.   Hiss Elizabeth Steele, Chairman of a

         group of Liverpool Solicitor67........ ./Vsaid

        yesterday that her clients were more interested in

        seeking prosecutions than gaining compensation
        payments.

        "A substantial number "were determined to ensure

        those they felt were responsible for the deaths

        were "brought to book" she said.

        A summons alleging corporate manslaughter by P & 0

        European Perries following the Zebrugge Perry Disaster

        which claimed 193 lives was issued at Bow Street
        last month.

        Mr. Michael Humphries of the Liverpool Solicitors

        Group said "My clients want the people responsible

        for this disaster made to pay the proper price for

        what has happened"."

   7.   You will of course be fully aware of the provisions of

        Section 16(I) of the Coroners Act 1988 flub ■ec^tton a (A fccs*

        in effect provides that where the Clerk of the Magistrate's

        Court informs the Coroner that certain serious offences

        have been charged, the Coroner shall in the absence

        of reason to the contrary adjourn the Inquest.      Sub section

        Jfcris even wider in scope and enables the Director of

/« 4    Public Prosecutions to request the Coroner to adjourn an



        Sub seutlun 8 ■of' Section 16 provides savings which enable

        the Coroner not to adjourn Inquests whioh fall with
                                        ad
        Section 16£l)or where having sojourned an Inquest, he
                           - 3 -


      may be permitted to proceed.

      I believe in fact that where Inquests are adjourned

      by Coroners under Section 16.4 it is in fact

      very rare for the Coroner to resume these, and the

      matter is usually coaj^k&fced under the provisions



8.    Bole 27 of the Coroners Rules 1984 substantially
                                             b(S>&
      reiteaeute the point covered in Clause J&b of the

      Coroners Act 1988.

9.    Rule 28 of the Coroners Buies provides that if

      during the course of an Inquest evidence is

      given from which it appears to the Coroner that

      the death of the deceased is likely to be due

      to an offence within Rule 26.3 and that a person

      might be charged with such an offence, then the

      Coroner, unless he has previously been notified by

      the Director of Public Prosecutions that adjournement

      is unnecessary, shall adjourn the Inquest ^      Retiesx

      for 14 days or such longer period as he may think

      fit and send to the Director particulars of that

      evidence.

      At any time before the datd fixed for the holding of

      the adjourned Inquest the Director of Public Prosecutions

      may ask the Coroner for further adjournm@s± and the

      Coroner may comply with his request.

10.   I appreciate that you have not yet had an opportunity

      to assess the evidence in the Hillsborough Dj^uster,

      and therefore are not presumably in a position to

      say whether any charges may be brought which fall

      within the provisions of Section 16 ^ ) or Section

      16 # . )



11.   I also fully appreciate that it would not be

      convoBtieaal for you to take aasy* decision? purely

      upon what legal representative? of tese£sm& families
might say or what is stated in newspaper articles



However, these comments are very relevant to me

because they indicate the line of thinking

which at least a portion of the interested parties

are likely to pursue.

You will of course be aware of Regina - v - St. Pancras

Coroner's Court ex party Higgins, Divisional Court

Q£D:   k-      ------------ 2jrd May 1988

where their Lordships appeared to indicate that

a Coroner can withdraw the verdict of Unlawful

Killing from the Jury where there was no

evidence which could conceivably have amounted

in law as sufficient to justify such a verdict.

You will appreciate that it is impossible

for me to take a view until in fact the

evidence has been given at the Inquests, and

it will be at that stage no doubt that I will

have to decide whether there is evidence which

can be left to the Jury to consider a verdict

of Unlawful Killing or whether the evidence is

of such a nature that I can properly withdraw that

verdict from their consideration.

This position precisely encapsulates the problem

which I am now faced with:-
  a. I anticipate that it will be necessary

       to call a considerable number of witnesses and that

       consequently the Inquests will take some

       considerable time. This apart from being

       expensive will of course generate a great

       deal of stress both for the bereaved but also

       for the witnesses, some of whom may well

       wish to shield under the provisions of Rule 22

        (Rule against Self Incrimination).
                        - 5 -

          b. Nevertheless evidence at the Inquest

              be given which falls within the provision of

              Rule 28 of the Coroners Rules,      (i am assuming

               for the purpose of this letter that no-one has

              been charged with any offence tinder the provisions

              of Section 16^1)and that I have not been requested

               to adjourn the Inquest under the provisions of

              l6$b).

16.   I am particularly anxious not to get into a
                               S -bee*I*?
      situation where having stated I am forced to stojjy

      I am requested to do so^ or because I have to^ under the

      provisions of Rule 28.    This would create considerable

      distress I am sure to relatives and witnesses and would

      leave us open to the                  that we have not

      covered a situation which is foreseeable in view of

      the comments referred to in paragraphs 5 & 6 above.

17.   You will of course know that if we were d           e   a   l   i   n   g

      with a serious Road Traffic Incident where fSection             ■
                                                  f-kzr
      1   proceedings were contemplated,7 it would be the                   /'
                                                                          / m
      normal practice to adjourn the Inquest until such

      time as the C.P.S. have indicated whether or not
                                                     *
      they intend to proceed under that Section.          If they

      indicated that they do not wish to proceed, then

      we would deal with the Inquest in the normal way.

      If they do decide to charge^ someone, then^the

      provisions of Section 16^would apply.

18.   It seems to me in this case that there are two

      possible courses open as far as my Inquests and

      your involvement are concerned

          a. You can notify me that you have no objection

              to me proceeding with the Inquestsjbnd that you

              do^require me to adjourn the Inquest notwithstanding

              that evidence may be given which might require

              me to leave the possible verdict of Unlawful
                              - 6 -


                  Killing with the Jury.   You will of course

                  appreciate that it is their decision not mine as to

                  what verdict they bring in.

                  I imagine that this situation most have arisen

                  in the Zebrugge Inquest undertaken by Mr. Start

                  at Dover.

             b.   The alternative would of course be for

                  you to request me to adjourn the Inquests

                  before I resume until such time as you have

                  completed your investigations, and then in the

                  light of your decision, one would have to

                  decide whether or not the Inquests should be

                  resumed or dealt with under Section 1

                  Coroners Act 1988.


19.      You will appreciate that there is a considerable

         amount of public interest in this disaster as well

         as a great deal of anxiety and personal grief.

         I am very anxious that whatever is done by me

         should be done correctly, but with a view to

         minimising the upset and pain which the Hillsborough

         Disaster has, is and will cause.

20   .   I would be grateful if I could hear from you as soon

         as ■possible. Irrespective of what the decision might

         be, several urgent matters have to be dealt with

         and I would like an indication of your thinking.before

     DISASTERS AND THE LAW


     1 have seen your note of 14 March and Mr Brook's of the same
     date. I am not expert in this matter but am aware of criticisms
     made in the past about the limitations of statutory technical
     inquiries. I understand that the criticisms levelled are that
     such inquiries are too narrowly focused because they do not
     address 'non-technical' factors which may have contributed to
     the disaster or its effects. And these issues are not always
     apparent at the outset - what appears prima facie to be a
     technical matter may soon reveal other underlying causes. But
     the 'expert' inquiry has no competence or powers to look into
     them with the result that subsequent and complete investigation
     is delayed until the conclusion of the technical inquiry report.
     As I say, I am not an expert, but it would be useful if the
     2 forms of inquiry could be combined or run in parallel or some
     similar arrangement devised.

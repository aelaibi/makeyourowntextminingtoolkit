           General Hospital       in Sheffield.
           <_          ____________________________

           On Saturday 15th April         1989 (150489)          I was at work, at about 3.15 pm

           (1515)     that day I was aware of an incident at the Hillsborough

           Football     ground and that casualties were being brought to the

           hospital.        It was not at that time known to be a major                incident and so

           I finished my duty at 3.30 pm (1530) and travelled home.

           A short time after        I got home,       I got a phone call from the hospital

           and as a result I decided to treat what was happening at the football

           ground as a major incident.            I made a number of phone calls from home

           to my deputy and other staff and I returned to the hospital at some

           time after 4.00 pm (1600).
                                                                                 PAGE     2
                                                                                 S3376

                               I

                           t                   we could efficiently deal

         transparation of          patients around the hospital.

         I am not able to          say what specific duties each porter carried out but

         I have completed a list of the members of my staff who were on duty

         that day and could well have had contact with the dead or injured

         brought from the football ground.

         I stayed on duty          to about 8.00 pm (2000) on Saturday 15th April

         { 150489)   by which time the worst of the rush was over.         During my time ,

         at the hospital       I did not have any personal   contact with any of the

         casualties from the disaster.

                                                                                SIGNED

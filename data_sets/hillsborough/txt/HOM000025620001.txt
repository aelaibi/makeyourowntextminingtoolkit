                 The Member's letter expresses concern over the requirement for
                 all seated accommodation at football matches played in Wales.
                 The recommendation on all seated accommodation contained in the
                 Final Report is expected to apply to UEFA high risk matches, the
                 4 Divisions of the Football League and the national stadia.
                 Cardiff City, Swansea and Wrexham football clubs are presently
                 in the 3rd or 4th Division. International matches involving
                 Wales are traditionally played at one of those grounds (although
                 Cardiff Arms Park has been used on occasion). By virtue of the
                 Welsh FA Cup, the winners have automatic entry to the European
                 Cup Winners Cup. Inevitably it is one of the league sides who
                 gain entry.
                 Assuming they maintain their present league status, the three
                 Welsh clubs will require all seated accommodation by 1999.
                 The FIFA resolution of 26 July 1989 provides that all qualifying
                 rounds of the 1994 World Cup (commencing in Autumn 1992) should
                 be played, in principle, at all seater stadia. The resolution
                 goes on to say that national football authorities have a duty to
                 hold high risk matches in their country only in all seater
                 stadia.
                 The definition of high risk matches is provided in UEFA
                 regulations and contained in paragraph 82 of the Final
                 Report (see doc 2).
                 Therefore it would appear that although the Welsh clubs are
                 represented in the lower half of the Football League, their
                 European and international involvement may require the
                 provision of all seated accommodation within the timetable
                 set by FIFA rather than recommendation 4 of the Final
                 Report. There would of course be the option of admitting
                 spectators only to those parts of the ground where there is
                 seating or moving the game(s) to an alternative and better
                 equipped ground.
                 A similar situation may apply in the domestic scene. Part
                 I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 provides for the
                 Secretary of State to designate matches It is a matter for
                 discussion but the adoption of the high risk factor in
                 domestic matches -which the FA favour - would apply to
                 third and fourth division clubs if, say, drawn against
                 teams from the top half of the league in the Cup or playing
                 derby matches.

                                                                       23 February 1990




CODE   18-77
Thank you for your letter of 29 January to the Home Secretary
about the effect on football in Wales of the recommendations of
the Final Report on the Hillsborough Disaster.

You may be aware from the Scheduleplaced in the     Vote Office
                       tLyX flAvM?    S
on 29 January following my ^statement to the House that the
Government expects to apply the recommendations on all seated
accommodation in the case of UEFA high risk matches, the 4
Divisions of the Football League and the national stadia.

                          i*Â»
The timetable recommended^the Final Report, would appear to
require that Cardiff City, Swansea City and Wrexham in view of
their current league status, toe        convert to all seated
accommodation by 1999.

However there is an additional element that the clubs and the
Welsh Football Association will need to take into account. Last
year FIFA, the sport's international governing body, passed a
resolution requiring that all preliminary rounds of the 1994
World Cup - commencing in Autumn 1992 - should be played in all
seater stadia.    The resolution went on to place a duty on
national football associations from 1993 to holdhigh risk
matches in their countries only in all-seater stadia.       The
definition of high risk, provided by UEFA, is contained in
paragraph 82 of the Final Report.

Taylor apart, therefore, in order to comply with the FIFA
resolution, with entry into European competitions and the 1994
World Cup, it would appear that the Welsh FA have the option from
those dates of playing European and international matches at club
grounds using only the seated accommodation or playing matches
at a suitable alternative venue.

Whether the FIFA resolution on high risk matches as defined by
UEFA will be applied to domestic football, is a matter we will
discuss with the football authorities.

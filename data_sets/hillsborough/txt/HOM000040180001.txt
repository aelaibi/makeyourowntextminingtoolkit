The attached enquiry from Teeman Levene has been matched by a
similar telephone enquiry from the Legal Department of Wakefield
Metropolitan District Council.

Both parties share the same concern over the position of the
Chief Constable and the level of his liability. The contents of
the draft agreement submitted by Teeman Levene is, I imagine, a
matter for the club and the police.
Our interpretation of Recommendation 4 of the Interim Report is
that the agreement between police and club should be at the level
of an exchange of correspondence. The contents of that agreement
may then be incorporated into the safety certificate subject to
the further agreement of the police.

 I should be grateful for guidance of the position of the Chief
 Constable in respect of a written agreement.

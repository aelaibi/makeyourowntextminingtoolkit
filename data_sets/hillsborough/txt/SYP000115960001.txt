              but    obviously              i n c r e a s e d as     the     kick       off    time       drew       near,     the      main

              early      flow         of    spectators          were       the        family      type      with young            children.

             From around 2.00pm                     (1400)         the     crowd        increased and                the    checks       made

a    few    from     the       youth        element          of    the          supporters.                  The       mood        of        the

supporters           was       jovial        and    good          humoured                but     it m u s t       be       said         that       a

lot     had     been      drinking,           some       I would                say       iny^ess.                 By       this        t ime       the

the     rear,      the      turnstile             area       was       now       very           congested.              I had            in fact

moved       from     the       side     of    ttie t u r n s t i l e s            and        gone       to       the    outer           edge        in

an    effort       to     discourage              the    supporters                   from        pushing,             other        officers

had    joined        me.         Whilst       there          was       an       ongoing           problem with                the            crowds

pushing        and      surging         forward,             another             problem arose,                    that       was            there

was    some        confusion amongst                    the        fans          as       to w h i c h       part       of    the            ground

their       tickets        were        for.        This        was      due       to       the       poor        indication              g i v e n as

to w h i c h     was      the     correct          entrance             to       the       West       and S outh Stands.                            The

s i t u a t i o n as      to     the    pushing          and       shoving                became       worse           as    kick        off        time

became         nearer.           The    people          at     the      front             were       being        squashed and                     despite

efforts        by a       number        of    police              officers                asking       the        crowd       to        refrain

from       pushing        forward           there       was       no    response,                things          at     this        poi n t        were

dangerous          as     serious           injury was             likely             to    be       c au sed,         it w a s         with       t his

in m i n d     several           supporters             went       into          th e      ground          through           the w r o n g

turnstiles           to        relieve        the       situation.                    By    kick       off       time        there           was

still      a   considerable                 number       outside,                the       pushing          and        shoving           was       still

apparent        but       not     as    severe.              By arou nd               3.30pm          <1530)           the    crowd           h a d all

been    accommodated                  in the      ground.               At       this       point          I along           with        other

colleagues          were         directed         to     take          our       meal       in the          gymnasium,                  t his      we

did.       After        about         half an       hour        we      were          called          on    to a t t e n d          the

Nottingham          Forest            end    of   the        g r o u n d as           there          was    a    report            of    crowd

problems,          by     th e    time       we   attended              the       problem             had       been        sorted           out     by

other      officers.              We    took      up s t a n d b y              duties          in the          gymnasium,               and       then

resumed        duties          round        the   ground           to    the          Leppings             Lane       end,     where

   Brian KettleboBough
   Police Constable 65^
   Main St Rotherham.

I am a police constable in the South Yorkshire Police stationed at Main St Rotherham,
On Saturday 9th April 198$ I reported for duty at Main Street at 8*30am and was then,
conveyed to Hillsborough Football Ground Sheffield frab briefing pending the foottiall
match that afternoon between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest,this being the Semi-Final
of the F.A.Cup. The briefing took place inside the football ground in the North Stand,
at 10am that morning. The duty is was to perform along with other officers was the
Leppings Lane Turnstile s Entrance. Other officers in that duty were PS Keenan, Pc's
Yeomans,Cooper,0xley,Slater, and Reynolds.
We took up our duties at around 12nnon for when the gates were opened. The brief was to
observe and spot check for containers etc being taken into the ground, this was done
by means of spot checks.
The flow of spectaors into the ground at the early part was slow,but obviously increased
as the kick off time drew near,the main early flow of spectaors were the family type
with young children. From around 2.00pm the crowd increased and the checks made with
regard to containers showed an increase as we had gathered quite a few from the youth
element of the supporters. The mood of the suporters was jovial and good humored but
it must be said that a lot had been drinking,some I would say in excess. By this time ikE
the crowd has swelled considerably and there was pushing and shoving from the rear,the
turnstile area was now very congested, I had in fact moved from the side of the turnstile
and gone to the outer edge in an effort to discourage the supporters from pushing,other
officers had joined me. Whilst there was an ongoing problem with the crowds pushing
and surging forward,another problem arose,that was there was some confusion amongst the
fans as to which part of the groung there tickets were for. This was due to the poor
indication given as to which was the correct entrance to the West and South Stands*
The situation as to the pushing and shoving became worse as kick off time became nearer
the people at the front were being squashed and despite efforts by a Snumber of police
officers asking the crowd to refrain from pushing forward there was no response, things
at this point were dangerous as serious injury was likely to be caused, it was with
this in mind several supporters went into the ground through the wrong turnstiles to
releave the situation* By kick off time there was still a considerable number outside
the pushing and shoving was still apparent but not as severe,by around 3 »30pm the crowd
had all been accomodated in the ground. At this point I along with other collegues were
directed to take our meal in the gymnasium,this we did. After adout -ghour we were
called on to attend the Nottingham Forest end of the ground as there was a report of
crowd problemsjby th® time we attended the problem had been sorted out by other officers.
We took up standby duties in the gymnasium, and then resumed duties round the ground
to the Leppings Lane End,where after the match we escorted the fans to the coach and
railway .
In general discussion after the match it was thought that for future big matches that
consideration should be given to installing barriers which would run from the entrance
to the turnstiles,this would have prevented the crushing and left the problem out on
Leppings Lane
My duties never involved incidents inside the ground as such,I am unable to comment
as to there being any problems with view to the Leppings Lane stand or to any gates

                  I am a police             constable         in the above          force       s t ationed at Mai n Street,

                  Rotherham.

                  In a d d i t i o n    to my       previous       statement        regarding         tne   1938 s e m i final

                  m a t c h with Liv e r p o o l         and N o t t i n g h a m F o r s s t    at Hills b o r a u g h ,     There

                     e a few minor             points w h i c h        I wis h to       clarify,        firstly     the Mounted

                  S e c t i o n did move         into     the    crowd     to ease       the     surge towards         the

                  t urns t i l e s     at a r o u n d -2 p m < 1400),      they made           some   headway and          it eased     tne

                  s i tuation        but   it d i d n ’t solve          it as     there were          still    a large       number

                  of s p ectators          to get        into    the    ground at kick off               time.      The     problem

                  eased after           kick     off,,      1 have      not     seen any        video    or much m edia

                  the     late    coming       of   the     s p ectators .i n "1988 along w ith the                  confusion of

     FIS MONITORING: 1989 3RD QUARTER RETURNS
     Please find enclosed third quarter FIS returns relating to the
     subhead (S) that you manage. I would be grateful if you would
     ensure that these are completed to take account of the 8 months'
     actual expenditure and 1 month's estimated expenditure required to
     show the position at the end of December 1989. I would also be
     grateful if you could ensure that these are returned to me by no
     later than H|t2_/§3
     As with the last FIS exercise I would be grateful if copies of the
     monthly profile sheets could be completed and returned with the
     FIS returns re-profiled to account for actual expenditure to date
     and anticipated expenditure for the remainder of the year, should
     there be a significant variation between the last profile you
     provided and the current position.

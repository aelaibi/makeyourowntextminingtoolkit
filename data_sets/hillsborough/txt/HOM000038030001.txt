       chat something had happened down there? - A. Over on to
       the pitch area, yes.

    Q. Yes.  Up to that time had anything struck you, although
       your only conscious recollection of looking at the
       terraces is at about 2.15, between that tine and the
       occasion when you saw the people coming over the
       perimeter fence had anything struck you about the
B      state of the terraces? - A. No.

    Q. Nothing happening in the control box had drawn your
       attention to anything abnormal down there? - A. No.

    Q. You have been asked about communications with the club.
       - A. Yes.
c   Q. There is the club's radio and there is also the telephone
       link? - A. Yes.

    Q. Ordinarily is the communication a two-way thing, inform­
       ation being passed each way? - A. Yes, that is correct.

    Q. Now, is this the situation?     You have no recollection of
       any particular information coming to you or being passed
D      by you down to the control room, to the club's control?
       - A. No ,. -I have no personal recollection.-

      If there had not been any would that have been something
      unusual? If it had been totally -silent and there had been
      no communication would that not have struck you? -A. If
      my job had been totally silent? If the ....

      Well, if there to all intents and purposes had been
      nothing - the'control room had been dead? - A. Yes,
      it probably would.

      Does it follow from what you are saying that there cay
      have been communications passing between the two of you
      but there was nothing unusual or abnormal about any of
      it? Could that be an explanation? - A. I cannot say
F     that I did not get any calls from the club but I cannot
      honestly recollect.

              MR. WOODWARD:    Thank you.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Thank you.

Q. And you were in the control box on the day of this
   natch? - A. I was, sir.

Q. As you had been on many previous occasions? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. How long had you had experienceof being in control?
   - A. In the control since January, 19S6, was the first
   tine I did it.

Q. You had been in control therefore in the natch in 1987
   and 1988?- A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. Your particular duties were concerned with radio messages?
   - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.   Is that so? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You had     to transnit nessages to those who were engaged
   in the operation at the ground itself. Is that right?
   - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. For that purpose would you use channel 25? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you also have to transnit nessages from ground control
   to other..places. to the Force .control, for example, at
   Snig Hill? - A/Yes, but- that would not be on channe?J25.

Q. No. What channel would you., use for that? - 'A. That would
   be on VHF.

Q. On VHF? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you     have a contact with the DivisionalOperations B.oon
   at Hammerton Road? - A. Yes.

Q. And what channel would you use for that? - A. That is
   channel 35.

Q.Channel? - A. Channel 35.

Q. Channel 35? - A. Yes. You would use      thatby   using a radio.
   You would not use thenornal system.

0. You have a hand held radio .... - A. Yes, sir.      -

0.        to keep you in touch i*jith Hammer ton Road which is the
     Divisional Headquarters? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. And in order to get in touch with the Force control at
   Snig Hill what would you use for that? - A. That would
   be a VHF set, hand held VHF, pack.set, snail one.

0.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      That is two separate hand sets

     for VHF and channel 35 and the main set channel 25?
     - A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q.        MR. PHILLIPS:   And the main set .... - A. Can I -
     the small one which we use on 35 is there basically just
     as a standby thing rather than specifically for 35.

Q. Some of the Officers who attended would have radios
   capable of picking up channel 35, would not they? - A.
   If they were switched on that channel, yes, sir.

Q. Yes. And, indeed, I think it is true that some of them
   had VHF radios as well and could get directly in touch
   with Force control? - A. Only the mobile vehicles would .

Q. The mobile vehicles? - A         have VHF, yes, sir.

    Q. When you started this operation was it your intention to
       have the radios on talk-through or not talk-through?
       - A. On talk-through sir. Talk-through is the norm. I
       have never known not using the radio without talk-thrcugh
       and that is general throughout the country.

    Q. You probably know better than most what happens when we
       are using talk-through and not talk-through. Can you tell
B      us please what in fact happens when you use talk-through?
       - A. Yes sir. When we use talk-through the signal* my
       transmission is heard by everyone and the reply from the
       person I speak to is again heard by everyone.

    Q. What happens if two people, two Officers want to talk at
       the same time when you are on talk-throueh? - A. Vie get
       a garbled message and you can normally realise that two
Q      people are transmitting simultaneously.

    Q. So both messages will come through but of course scramble
™      each other up in the process? - A. It will be scrambled,
       yes.

    Q. If you are on non-talk-through, what happens then? - A. You
       would hear, anyone on the ground would hear my transmission
D      but they would not hear the reply from the transmission.

    Q. You alone would hear the reply?     A. Me' alone, yes.

    Q. And if two people separately wanted to come to you when
       you are on non-talk-through, what would happen then? -
       A. Again you would get a totally garbled message.

    Q. One would not have the effect of cutting the other off
       then? - A. Yes.

    Q. I am sorry, that is really not the same thing? - A. To an
       extent it would cut if off, yes. You would get a garbled
       message with two coming through at the same time. You
       realise that there are two people transmitting.

    O.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Is it the same whether you
         are on talk-through or non-talk-through if two people try
         to get through at the same time? - A. Yes, it is identical
         sir, yes.

    Q. So the only difference is that only you hear the reply
       when you are not on talk-through? - A. Yes, my Lord.

    Q.        MR. PHILLIPS: Nov/ are there any circumstances in
         which a message can be cut off by you or by other Officers
         on the ground? - A. On which system? On talk-through or
         non-talk-through?

    Q. On either system? - A. No, on talk-through, yes, because
       what happens is that although you have got talk-through
       it requires a base station which is situated in the 3o:c,
H                                    119

    . but you transmit on a frequency and you receive on a different
      frequency and all the radios we have are on those frequencies.
      Tell me the question again, sir?

Q. Are there any circumstances in which a transmission can
   be cut off? - A. Yes, by interference with someone else
   coming in on radio and cutting it off that way.

Q. So when you are trying to talk to somebody on the ground,
   can you be cut off by somebody else coming in at the same
   time? - A. Yes, I can, on talk-through, yes sir.

Q.            LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Are you actually cut off
        or are you garbled? - A. I would assume that I am cut off
        sir.

q   .         MR. PHILLIPS: As far as you are concerned when you
        are talking into the radio itself would you know whether
        you had been cut off or not? - A. No, not at all sir.

Q. When messages are passed between you anc a man on the ground
   is it your practice to have a system so that each message
   is acknowledged? - A. Yes, well if I make a transmission
   I put my transmisison to a specific person and at the end
   of the transmission I would say, ask him his name or nsmber:
   "Did .you receive.?", and I .would expect a reply from that ..   .
   sit.''

Q. And if you don't get a reply what do you do? - A. I try
   again.

Q. You were on duty on the 15th of April, weren't you? - A.
   I was, sir.

Q. I think the day before you had heard from Superintendent
   Murray that the Chief Superintendent wanted a log to be
   kept at the Control Room? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q. I think it is true to say you started keeping it and it
   was taken over by Superintendent Murray? - A. That is
   correct sir, yes.

Q. Can we go through the early stages of the match day in
   this way:   that you had of course messages going forward,
   out and inof the sort you would normally expect on a
   match day? - A. Yessir.

Q. There was a time, I think, when Chief Inspector Creaser
   came into the Control Box and had a conversation with
   Superintendent Murry. They have both told us about it.
   It was about the packing of the terraces? - A. That is
   correct sir, yes.

Q. You.recall that, do you? - A. I do sir.

Q.' And the instruction that they should find their own levels?
    - A. That is correct sir.

Q. Did you stay in the Control Box throughout the period
   from about midday onwards? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Were you able to observe from your position how things
   were developing inside the ground particularly at the
   terraces? - A. I was sir, yes.

Q. Your position in the Control Bo:: is towards the front,
   isn't it? - A. I am in the centre of the three people at
   the front.

Q. There is Hr. Bichard I think behind you controlling the
   screens of the video cameras? - A. That is correct, yes
   sir.

Q. You are at the front at the table where the microphone
   is, the tulip microphone? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

Q. Do you sit down there?        Do you have a seat? - A. Yes, a
   stool, yes sir.

Q. Where is Mr. Duckenfield and Hr. Murray? - A. Mr. Murray
c .is to'iay left, p:c.;Ry&h to'my-.right'ana when Hr. Duckenf ie_I-d_
   was in he was behind me somewhere.

Q. By about 2.15 or so how did the terraces seem to you? -
   A. The Spion Kop, all the areas in relation to the Notts.
   Forest end were filling quite well and the Liverpool areas
   were comparatively empty in relation to the Forest areas.
   There was still a lot of room within all the ground but
   certainly the Forest areas were more populated than the
   Liverpool areas.

Q. Did you think there was anything strange about the
   situation at that time? - A. Not particularly, no sir.

Q. Were you able to look at the video cameras at the monitors
   above you? - A. Yes, from time to time.

Q. Did you see anything that gave you cause for concern? - A.
   At that early stage, no sir.

Q. Do you remember a request coming in for Leppings Lane to
   be closed? - A. I do sir, yes.

Q. That, we understand, was at 17-minutes-past-2? - A. I
   understand that is the case sir. I must admit I thought
   it was later than that.

Q. Did you look at the monitors when you had that request?
   - A. Yes.

            Q. Were you the person who tried to put that request into
               effect? - A. Yes, I asked that Leppings Lane be closed to
               traffic and on top of that obviously we then talk about
               re-routing buses and I sent messages via Chief Inspector
               Sumner for the bus people to be informed.

            Q. In the first place did you send a message out to the Serials
        B      at each end of Leppings Lane? - A. I can't specifically
               remember doing that but my assumption is that I would
               have done.

            Q. It would be you who did that? - A. It would be me that did
               that.

            Q. You can't therefore say whether you had any reply froa
               the Serial at the Catchbar Lane end? - A. I can't sir.

            Q. How were you going to get the buses re-routed? - A. That
               is why I contacted Mr. Sumner to see the people at Herries.

            Q. Where was Chief Inspector Suinner? - A. Ke was in that area.
               He was around Herries Road itself.

        D   Q. Did you get any acknowledgment from hi:u? - A. I did sir,
               yes.

            Q. And left it to hi.Ti -to see to that, did you? - A. He went
               to see to that, yes.

            Q.. At that time did you look at the monitors? - A. Yes sir,
                about 2.30ish, certainly.

            Q. Well at the time you got the request to close Leppings Lane?
               - A. As .1 have said my thoughts, you tell me it is 2.17
               which I will accept, I believe it was a bit later than that.

            Q. That is the time given in the log that was kept in the
               Ground Control Roo;n? - A. Yes, I accept that sir. As I
               say I still believe that it was later than 2.17.
        F
            Q. You saw I think at any rate the monitors at 2.30, didn't
               you? - A. Yes sir.

            Q. Because your attention was drawn to them, wasn't it, by
               Constable Bichard? - A. That is correct sir, yes.

            Q. And what did you see? - A. Masses of people around the
               Leppings Lane turnstiles and going back from the turnstiles
               just about into the roadway.

            Q. Did you have any idea of numbers? Could you hazard a guess?
               - A. I initially said 3,000-4.,000 and I think I would
               stick to that.

            Q. It is quite a lot of people, isn't it? - A. A lot of
        H      people sir.                 ^^

Q. To get into the ground by 3 o'clock? - A. Yes sir.

Q. At this time did you look at the terraces? - A. I did sir,
   yes.

Q. Did you see what condition they were in? - A. Yes, the
   central pens were filling quite well. The West Stand was
   filling but there was loads ofroom in it as was the North
   Stand. The outer pens were, in comparison with the centre
   pen* were relatively uninhabited.

Q. Did you receive messages from various sources at this time
   on a sort of continuous basis? - A. Yes sir.

Q. It is probably difficult, isn't it, to isolate one message
   out froa any other message? - A. Very. There are certain
   things that stand out in your mind but it is difficult, yes
   sir.
Q. Can you help us about this: there was a time when the
   radio began to break up? - A. There was sir, yes.

Q. Can you say when that was, to your recollection? - A. I
   would have thought it was about 2.25/2.30ish.

Q. We know that Mr. Sanderson .came over to the Control Bo;:
   very rapidly? - a. Yes.

Q. How long was he in there trying to remedy things? - A.
    Five minutes sir, thereabout, yes about five minutes.
  /
Q. You could not use the radio on Channel 25 as you had been
    doing up till then? - A. Ho.

Q. Had you had any trouble at all before that period, 2.25/
   2.30? -A. Before that, no sir.

Q. We know, and it is right is it not, that the radio engineer
   was unable to mend the set that you wereusing? - A.  That
   is correct, sir.

Q. What did he do? - A. I think his initial reaction was that
   the tulip mike was wrong so he replaced that with a tele­
   phone depression handset. Again it was still found to
   be inoperative so we then went on to the spare base station
   which was under the bench.

Q. That‘is the blue thing. Yes, carry on? - A. The lead was
   reinserted into that and again it was found that it was
   inoperative.

Q. The blue base station was found to be inoperative? - A.
   The transmission was inoperative.

Q. Why was that, do you know? - A. I don’t sir. Probably at
   this stage in time I was trying to make transmissions too
                                 123

                quickly because that thing has got to be warmed up for
                probably 30 seconds and I was trying to transmit prior
                to the 30 seconds and so I have since realised that. When
                that did not come into effect I then used the normal hand­
                held Motorola radio \*hich again was on talk-through so it
                wouldn't do the same job.

        Q.             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Is that the one you would have
    B           on Channel 35 for Hammerton Road as a standby? - A. That is
                 a standby set, yes sir.

        Q. So you then switched it to 25? - A. Put it on to 25.

        q   .         MR. PHILLIPS: And the base station for that remained
                at Hammerton Road, did it? - A. I-io, the base station is
                underneath me.

        Q. Can you just help us about this: there was a time, I under­

    •      stand, when you threw down the telephone handset that you
           had been given in disgust on the table? - A. Frustration
           probably sir.

        Q. Yes, all right. What was the problem with that? Why couldn't
           you use that? - A. As I have outlined, I v/as probably trying
    D     to use it before the set itself, vhichwas the spare set,
           had warned, up and it takes..a .period .of .tine,, probably 3.0
           seconds for- it- to wanr_jap.

        Q. Well did you have any problems about.access to that base
            station? - A. Yes.
          t
        Q. You know it is on the floor? - A. Yes.

        Q. We see it, I think, if you look in West Midlands Bundle 2
           at Photograph 50. Do you see it directly in front of the
           chair there on the floor?

                       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   We do, I think,      We have seen
                it   at the Control Boic.

        q   .         MR. PHILLIPS: What wasyour problem over access?
                - A- Sorry?

        Q. What was the problem you had over getting access to that
           machine? - A. The machine on to the handset?

        Q. Yes? - A. The handset although it shows there it is on
           the desk, to lift it up you could not lift it up, you
           were bent down.

        Q. Did you need to get close to the base station to hear tiie
           loud speaker? - A. Well you would need to get .... On
           that base station you have got the loud speakers from
           the base station, the substitute base station, they are
           on the floor.

Q. You could not hear anything out of the ear piece of the
   telephone handset then? - A. No because it comes from the
   loud speaker, which is a smaller loud speaker thanthe
   normal set and that is on the floor.

Q. What stopped you from putting a base station on to the tab la
   top? - A. Because it is a fixed lead, sir. To plug in the
   lead is not long enough.

Q. It is as simple as that? - A. Yes.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    The thing that_looks likea
     telephone is for speaking but not for listening? - A. That
     is correct sir, yes.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS: So you then ended up using a hand-held
     radio? - A. Yes sir.

Q. Were you able to do that satisfactorily? - A. Yes sir.

Q. I think it was Mr. Murray who said that you had communications
   restored within a minute of Mr. Sanderson attending. Is that
   right? - A. I would not put it to a minute sir, no, I would
   say a bit longer than that.

Q. Did you jget a-request-from'Mr. Buxton out in the Land Rover
   to delay the kick-off? - A. I did sir, yes.

Q. I think in the first place you had sent out a message asking
   for the attendance of a PA vehicle, hadn't you? - A. That
   is correct, sir, ves, and in fact a traffic car was sent as
   well.

Q. We know Hr*. Buxton attended, of course. Can you give us
   any idea when it was you got the request from him to delay
   the kick-off? - A. It was directly at the time that one
   of the teams came on the field, and when I say "came on to
   the field" I mean not for the warm up but for the start
   of the match proper.

Q. We know Liverpool came on to the field at 14.54 and Nottingham
   Forest at 14.55? - A. Well it would be 14.54 then sir.

Q. At that time Gate C had already been opened for a second
   time? - A. I can't say. In relation to the times I don't
   know but I believe that will be the case, yes sir.

Q. So you are saying the request for the delay of kick-off
   came after the business about the opening of Gate C? - A.
   As I have said I am not quite sure on my times in relation
   to       The call from P.C. Buxton and the calls for C Gate
   to be open, in which order I don't know.

Q. You don't know the order? *- A. No. Not that I don't know,
   I cannot remember in which order of sequence they went.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Can you just remind me. I
think Hr. Duckenfield said that he had seen some photographers
round the tunnel which he took to mean that the team was
about to cone out but in fact that turned out not to be
the case?

      MR. PHILLIPS: Sir, I think that is right. I think
in fact the teams came out a little later than that.

Were you going by the presence of photographers round the
tunnel or were you going by What you saw coming out on to
the field? - A. I saw a team in red were going out on to
the field which was Liverpool, because-jay reply to P.C. Buzcton
"It is too late, one team is already on the field" and I
know that I did not mention which team.

                                                                  M.   GODDARD




                    Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You answered that off your
                         own bat, did you? - A. Yes, sir.
                B
                    0.         MR. PHILLIPS:    That is just the point I ara coining
                         to, Sergeant.    Did you pass that message over to either
                         Superintendent Hurray or to Chief Superintendent
                         Duckenfield? - A. It came out quite clear on the radio,
                         sir.   My assumption was that Mr. Murray or Mr.
                         Duckenfield had heard it.

                    Q. Could you be sure of that, there was an awful lot of
                       things going on in that room? - A. There were many things
                       going on, sir.

                    Q. Did you not think you ought to pass that message on to
                       one of your superiors? - A. No, sir.   My assumption was
                       that with Mr. Murray being at the side of me and Mr.
                       Duckenfield being somewhere behind me, that they would
            D          have heard that.

                    Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR.: . They, may have heard it, but
                         whose decision was it, whether you stopped the kick-off
                         or you didn't?   Was it yours or the Chief Superintendent
                         who was standing beside you? - A. I would suggest, my
                         Lord, it was the Chief Superintendent.

                    Q.         HR. PHILLIPS:    Did you not ask him? - A. No, sir,
                         I did not.

                    Q. Why? - A. Because I automatically assumed he had heard
                       the message and he would act accordingly upon it.

                    Q. You did not really give him much chance did you?   You
                       replied straight away, "No, it is too late"? - A. Yes,
                       because as the request came through the team ran out.

                    Q. Why is it too late when the team runs out on to the
                       field?   Why cannot they run back again? Or walk back
                       again? - A. I do not know, sir.   My assumption is if a
                       game is going to be - and it is something I have never
                       had any experience of - if a game is going to be delayed
                       it will be delayed before the teams come out.

                    Q. Was not there a kick-off delayed in 1937 at a match
                       involving Coventry City?   Were you not there when that
                       happened? - A. Coventry and Leeds, sir?

                    Q. Yes. - A. I do not know if it was delayed.   If you tell
                       me it was delayed I will accept that, but certainly as
                       far as I am aware there were no teams on the field at
            H          that stage.

Q. Certainly the match was delayed?   The kick-off was
   delayed? - A. I cannot tell you that, sir.   I cannot
   remember that.

Q. You decided because   the teamhad come out on the field
   that you could givethat message back to Constable Buxton
   without asking Chief Superintendent Duckenfield? - A.
   Yes, sir, with the belief that he and Mr. Murray had
   heard the message come through.

Q. And heard your reply? - A. And heard my reply.

Q. What were they actually doing at this time, those two
   men? - A. Mr. Duckenfield was behind me so I cannot
   really say.

Q. You cannot say whether he was talking on the telephone or
   anything else? - A. Certainly if he was on the telephone
   he would be at the side of me.

Q. Or using a radio? -    A. Well, the only radio he would use
  • then;is ;the-rVHF    :.    7>;i;r. 7 .TtV.-c. :         ; •

Q. He*is in control? - A. He is, yes, that is right.

0. Now can we just look at the request to open the gates.
   You received those requests? - A. I did, sir.

Q. You received the requests from Superintendent Marshall? -
   A. That is,-correct, sir.

0. Did you communicate those requests to Chief
   Superintendent Duckenfield? - A. I do not know about the
   first two, but the third - well, it wasn't a request, it
   was a demand - he was quite aware of that demand.   I did
   not have to communicate anything to him at that stage.
   It was Mr. Murray who said to him, "Mr. Duckenfield, do
   we open the gates?"   He was totally aware without my
   having to pass on to him any radio transmission that came
   into the box.

Q. We know the gates did open coincidentally at about this
   time?   Gate C opened for the first time at 2.48? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. Did you see that on the monitor? - A. I did not see it
   open, no, sir.   I saw people starting to come through.
   A comment was made in the box, "They have broken
   through".   That was the comment that was made.   It was
   very quickly retrieved by one of the mounted Officers and
   the gates were closed.

Q. That was after you had had the^iregsage to open the gates?
   - A. I believe so, yes.       l£o

                                            M.   GODDARD


Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    Who said they had broken
     through? - A. It was someone in the box.   I cannot
     remember who said that, but I have got a feeling, because
     there were quite a few people in the box, I have got a
     feeling it was Mr. McRobie.   However, I cannot be
     certain of that.

Q.         MR.PHILLIPS:_ Mr. McRobie?    He was in plain
     clothes? - A. He was in plain clothes.

Q. How long had he been in the box? - A. From ten past two,
   quarter past two - that's approximate. They   all seemed
   to come together.

Q. It would be getting a bit over-crowded with so many
   people in? - A. We had got quite a few in, sir, yes.

0.. When the gates opened as you saw it, or heard this
    expression "They have broken through", was that before or
    after Mr. Duckenfield had decided to open them? - A. That
    was way before, sir.

0. Before he decided to give the order to open them? - A.
   Yes.

Q..Were you able to see the gates being closed again with
   the use of a mounted Officer? - A. Yes.   Well, you do
   not physically see the gates close from there, but what
   you do see is that the flow stops.

Q. You then got another request for the gates to be opened?
   - A. That is correct.

Q. Did you pass this on? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you get a decision then? - A. No decision was made
   because there was certain discussion going on within the
   box as to whether or   not to open the gates.

Q. How long did it take   to get a decision? - A. It wasnot a
   long time at all because as I say, the third      - well,not
   request, the demand,   order, call it what you    will -came
   through.

Q.   From Superintendent Marshall? - A. From Mr. Marshall.

Q.    Did you pass that over as well? - A. No, sir. That was
     heard quite clearly within the box. I did not have to
     relay that at all.

Q. We know there was about four minutes between     the first
   and second opening of gate C.   Was that the     time it
   took, basically, to come to a conclusion, or     was it some
   shorter time than that? - A. No, it was some     shorter tioie
                                     129
                                             M.   GODDARD


     than that.   When the third request - or the demand -
     came in, as Mr. Murray had said, "Mr. Duckenfield, do we
     open the gate", I turned round and obviously Mr.
     Duckenfield had been considering that for some time.
     That is the way I looked at it.    He had been considering
     that.    He then said, "Open thegates".

Q. So you passed a message on,    did you? - A.Yes, sir.

Q. On the radio? - A. Yes.

0. Using channel 25? - A. Yes, sir.

0.. Which should have     been heard by any Officer with a radio?
    - A. That is correct, sir.

0. Was it directed at any particular Officer, your message?
   - A. My message was directed to Mr. Marshall.

0. Did you know Mr. Marshall was outside in Leppings Lana on
   the parapet of the bridge and not in a position to open
   the gates?. - A. No. I did not know where Mr. Marshall
   was.    My assumption was that Mr. Marshall was by those
   gates, or by C-gate, certainly.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    He could not beat all of
     them, coujd he? - A. No, sir, but by C gate.

Q.         MR. PHILLIPS:   What was the message you gave? - A.
     "Open the,gates".

Q. Did you address it particularly to Mr. Marshall? - A. I
   believe so, yes, sir.

0.. You said, "Superintendent Marshall, open the gate"? - A.
    No, the message came in from Superintendent Marshall,
    "Open the gates", and then there was a vary brief
    conversation between Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield.
    The reply was "Open the gates" and I replied "Open the
    gates".

Q. Not using any particular name or call sign in giving that
   message out? - A. No, sir.

Q. So anybody would have heard it? - A. Yes, sir.

0. It was "Open the gates"? - A. Yes, sir.

0. Gates at, of course, as you were concerned with, Leppings
   Lane? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. It would have been heard, of course, over at Penistone
   Road and on the perimeter track as well? - A. That is
   correct, sir.

                                            M.   GODDARD


Q.   You saw gate C open, or at least the crowd coming through
     gate C, did you, on the monitor? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you then subsequently get a message from Sergeant
   Higgins who was in charge of serial 20? - A. Yes, sir.

0. What was that? - A. He was requesting that A gate be
   opened or else someone would get killed.

Q. How long after the opening of gate C was this, the second
   opening of gate C? - A. Probably three or four minutes I
   would suggest.   I would say three or four minutes,
   maybe.   It might be less than that.

Q. What did you do on receipt of that message fromSergeant
   Higgins? - A. After hearing what Mr. Duckenfield had
   said, I went straight.through and said, "Open the gates".

Q. So you took it that the previous instruction applied to
   all the gates? - A. I took it that the first instruction
   in relation to gates was C gate.   .   . . .           (

Q." You took it that it was C gate? - A.   I assumed it was   C
    gate.
Q.,Why did you assume that? - A. Because the influx in C
  •gate is the one that is off-front, so you can pull people
   out and put them through the gate and relieve your
   numbers, or relieve your crush, probably more easily that
   way than ..opening B gate.

Q. It was a message, and do correct me if I am wrong, "Open
   the gates" in the plural? - A. It was, sir. That is what
   I said.

Q. You did not specify C gate? - A. No,    I did not.

Q. If Sergeant Higgins had heard that message he wouldhave
   known that that would have applied to gate A as well,
   would he not?   He would not have needed to ask? - A. I
   am aware that Sergeant Higgins was deployed from another
   area, to the back of A gate.    Whether he had heard the
   first_message, "Open the gates", I do not know.
   However, bear in mind, A gates would have no influence on
   entrance into the west stand or the standing areas.

Q. You took it on yourself then to give the instruction to
   Sergeant Higgins to open A gate? - A. I did, sir.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   When you passed the order_
     the first time and said "Open the gates", you did say it
     in the plural? - A. I did, my Lord.

Q. However, you took that only to mean C? - A. Yes, sir.

                                              M.   GODDARD


Q. Why in the plural? - A. Well, it is gate, when we say
   "gates", we call C gate, C gate, but when we say "Open
   the gates", it still refers to one to me.    That was the
   thing in ray mind when we were talking about gates, I was
   believing it was in fact C gate.

Q.          MR. PHILLIPS:   Why did you not check with Chief
      Superintendent Duckenfield who had given the order, what
     lie meant? - A. Because we assumed as C gate had already
      been opened, that that was what was required again.

Q. Did you not think to say, "Do you mean A, B and C, sir?"?
   - A. So, sir.   I believed and I am sure Mr. Duckenfield
   believed, that it it was C gate that was required to be
   opened.

Q. At all events, you did not go back to him before telling
   Sergeant Higgins to open A gate? - A. That is correct.

Q. You say in your statement:

            "By the.time A,gate was. opened the gates at C had
            been closed."

     Is that right? - A. That was my belief at that time.

Q..' Is it right? - A. I do not believe so, not now.         Not now
     I have seen the video, no.

Q. When you made this statement, was it made shortly after
   the event? - A. It was made on the 16th.

Q. The following day? - A. Yes.

Q. It was your recollection of what had happened? - A. Yes.

Q. You do not now think that gate C was closed when A was
   opened? - A. After seeing the video earlier this week,
   no.
Q. Then you go on to talk about the delay of the kick-off,
   which we have already dealt with.   You cannot be sure at
   all at what point this comes? - A. I cannot be sure
   whether it is before the gates or after the gates, no,
   sir.

Q.    What did you see inside the ground that put you on notice
     that something was wrong in pens 3 and 4? - A. People
     were climbing over the fences.

Q.    When did   you see that? - A. About three o'clock time.

Q.    What did   you do about it? - A. My first thought was, "We
      have got   a pitch invasion", and it was a matter of
                                        132

        deploying as many men as possible down to the Leppings
        Lane end of the perimeter track.

Q. You would have probably one of the best views in the
   Control Box, because you are sitting right at the front?
   - A. I am sitting right at the front, yes, sir.

Q. Did you say to the other Supervisory Officers in the
   Control Box, "Look what is happening over there"? - A. I
   do not recall saying that, no, sir.

Q. Were they in fact in the Control Box to have it said to
   them? - A. Yes, sir.

0. What did you do when you thought you had got a pitch
   invasion? - A. I deployed as much available manpower as I
   could down to the Leppings Lane end.
q   .         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Who is taking the decisions
        in this Control Box? - A. Mr. Murray.

0. Was anybody' t-eil'ing you- to:~depLbb'y“-themor- was that off
   your own'bat?’- A. It came through, "We have got
    so-and-so and so-and-so" and Mr. Murray said,
   "Deploy..."

Q.' Right.      I thought you acted off your own bat. - A. No.

Q.            MR. PHILLIPS:   He was seeing the same thing as
        you, is that what you are telling us? - A. Yes.

Q. And giving you the instructions which you carried into
   effect? - A. Yes.

Q.       Then you saw Superintendent    Greenwood goingthroughand
        signalling first of all for the match to be stopped and
        running on the pitch? - A. Frantically signalling, yes.
        It was fairly obvious he could not get through on radio
        and then he came through very, very clearly, "Stop the
        game.   Stop the game".   It was obvious to all at that
        stage that the game was required to be stopped.

Q. Now did you get in touch with any of the outside
   emergency services at this stage? - A. Personally, no,
   sir.
Q. Did you get in touch with either Hammerton Road or Snigg
   Hill to request emergency services? - A. I did not, no,
   but I know that it was done.

Q.       I am asking you whether .you   didit personally? - A.No.

Q.      Because you were in fact on    theradio? - A. Yes, I was on
        the normal radio, not the VHF rad^.

Q. Who did actually get in touch with Snigg Hill or
   Hamraerton Road? - A. PC Bichard.

Q. We will ask him about it.   Did you then concentrate on
   dealing with the ground radio? - A. Did you get a request
   for bolt croppers? - A. Yes, sir.

   the Fire Brigade? - A. At that stage, no.

Q./Why?    - A. Because it is probably quicker         from Claywheels
   Lane    thanit is from any fire station.

Q. Did you get through by radio to Claywheels Lane? - A. Mo,
   by telephone.

Q. Was it answered fairly promptly? - A. Straight away, yes,
   sir.

Q. You were told there were no bolt croppers in the Road
   Traffic Division? - A. I was, sir.

Q.   Did that surprise you? - A. Yes, very much.

Q.    What did you    do then? -A. I said,"They have gotno
     cutters" and PC Bichard was behind me at his video and
     said, "Do you want the fire brigade?"    I did not reply
     to him, I just put my hand up in the air, which he
     acknowledged as an acknowledgment-- "Yes, get the fire
     brigade".

Q. Did he make the call? - A. Yes.

Q. To Force Control or somewhere? - A. That is correct.

0.   For the firebrigade? - A. Yes.

Q.   Did you hearhim call? - A. I didnot, no, sir.

Q. Did he make the call that requested a fleet of
   ambulances? - A. He did.

Q. Again, did you hear that call? - A. No, sir.

Q. You were busy talking on the radio with your people at
   the ground? - A. Yes.

Q.   I think you saw what went on on the pitch? - A. Yes, sir.

Q.   And the efforts that were made to rescue people from the
     terraces? - A. Yes.

Q. If anyone wants to ask you about that I have no doubt
   they will, but I do not intend to taka you through that
   myself. At any stage did you get any idea that doctors
   and nurses and so on were required? - A . It became fairly
   obvious that doctorsand nurses were going to be required
   there and then, yes.

0.. It seems a request was put out fairly early on via the
  ■ media. ^ I-am-not •saseT.if^it isn' t Radio Hailam or so:ne
    local radio station - for nurses and doctors at the
    ground.    Did you have anything to do with that? - A. No,
    sir.
Q.' Did you make any effort to get nurses and doctors in the
    ground who were already in the ground to go to the
    Leppings Lane end? - A. I believe that a tannoy message
    was passed on for that, "Would any doctors within the
    ground go to Leppings Lane".   That is the belief I have.

Q. You of course would not be using the tannoy anyway? - A.
   No, sir.

           MR. PHILLIPS:   Yes, thank you.

                 Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

Q. Sergeant Goddard, at 2.15 Mr. Duckenfield and Mr. Murray
   returned to the Control Box? - A. Yes, sir.

0. At some stage the Assistant Chief Constable was there? -
   A. Yes, sir.
Q. Do you remember when he left? - A. I do not, no. I
   believe it was during the period the communications
   man•••
Q. From 2.14 onwards we have in the Control Box Chief
   Superintendent Duckenfield and Chief Superintendent
   Murray? - A. Yes.
                                      135
                            91
                                             M.   GODDARD


From then on.   They were there until after three
o'clock? - A. Yes, sir.

Mr. Duckenfield was actually standing behind you? - A. He
was behind ate somev/here, yes.

He would be in an even better position to see the
monitors than you were? - A. Yes, sir.

Because you would have to crane your neck up to have a
special look? - A. That is correct, sir.

At 2.15 it was plain to anybody looking at the monitors,
or looking out of the window to the ground itself, that
the Liverpool portion of the ground was comparatively
empty? - A. Yes, sir.

At that time did you yourself draw any particular
conclusion as to what might happen in the future from
your observation? - A. No, sir.   From where we are in
the Control Box you only get a certain view of the
ground, but you do not see what is in the concourse.

Yes, that is what I am going to come to.              You have a
very good view of the ground.           Now let us suppose, which
is unlikely because you would not have been in the
Control Box, but let's just suppose that the match was a
pre-season warm-up. between Sheffield Wednesday Second .and
Accrington; Stanley;; ’ *~tfoulti i tr'fre’
                                          .a..fair "conclusion, if
you saw an empty ground at 2.15, that there were not
going to be very many people turning up to watch the
match? - A. Yes, sir.

If you are dealing with ,a semi-final, all-ticket match,
between Liverpool and Notts Forest, and very few people
are in the ground at 2.15, what conclusion would you
normally dfaw as to what is going to happen in the next
three-quarters if an hour? - A. In that period of time we
are going to have quite a few people coming through the
turnstiles in a bit of a rush.

Since the majority of those who were not in the ground at
2.15 were Liverpool supporters, would not it have been a
perfectly reasonable forecast at 2.15 that at some stage
in the next three-quarters of an hour therre was going to
be a very great rush of people arriving at the turnstiles
in Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, sir.

Therefore, it can have been of no surprise whatever to
any Police Officer in the Control Room that at 2.30 there
was a milling throng in the concourse outside Leppings
Lane? - A. At 2.30, sir, in relation to a milling throng,
you expect lots of crowds there but not the way they
came. It would appear that from 2.15 to 2.30 we got




                                 13-6
                              92

                                               M.   GODDARD


   no-one in the ground and frora 2.30 onwards everyone
   arrived.   When you are talking about a period of fifteen
   minutes, you are talking of getting a lot of people
   through the turnstiles in fifteen minutes.

Q. Sergeant Goddard, this is what I an putting to you.    It
   may be that it was not your responsibility.   There were
   very senior Officers there, but you are giving the
   evidence and I have to ask you the questions.   It was
   obvious, as plain as a pikestaff, that 24,000 people,
   minus those few already in the ground at 2.15, would be
   arriving at the ground sometime between 2.15 and three
   o'clock? - A. That is correct, sir, but by the same token
   I know it was said earlier that we had not made checks.
   I had checked with PC Guest as to how many were in the
   ground, how many Liverpool people were in the ground.
   He said there were a few thousand in.

Q. What we have been told, and it may be that your memory
   does not go to this, but we have bean told that at two
   o'clock the club thought there were 8,000 fewer in the
   ground than they would have expected and that the bulk of
   those 8,000 were Liverpool supporters.   Do you remember
   that figure ever being transmitted to you? - A. No, not
   at all, sir.

0. Maybe it never was.        I am not suggesting it was.      We
    just- do not .know-.-- -•■However,r-whether the.figures were
    coming through' fr.om 'the' club''or riot,''thosa figu"-^ would
    have reflected in numbers what your observations told
    you, that there were an awful lot of people still to
    arrive at the Leppings Lane end between 2.15 and three
  / o'clock? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Because there were more than would normally be expected,
   at some time in that three-quarter of an hour period
   there was ’bound to be a crush of people in Leppings Lane
   and at the turnstiles at the end of the Lane? - A. I do
   not know, sir.    We are talking about a three-quarters of
   an hour period.    In that three-quarters of an hour
   period I would hope, I would expect, that those
   turnstiles would accommodate them without a massive rush
   or crush.    A big rush but not a crush.




            Q. Was it in fact




                                     137

                                                  M.   GGuOAt\D



Q.. Was it in fact - I have got to be fair to you; nobody wants
    to be unfair - was it in fact your responsibility as the
    Sergeant in the control box to be anticipating crowd movements
    in Leppings Lane from your observations, or was that somebody
    else’s responsibility? - A. It was mine, sir, as much as
    anyone else’s.

Q. That is a very frank and honest answer, so I have got to
   pursue it. The Police Officers in Leppings Lane controlling
   the crowds would not have a clue as to how many people were in
   the ground and therefore how many were still to come? - A.
   That is correct.

Q. Mr. Marshall, who was in charge outside, would need to have
   information in order to deploy his forces. Is that right? -
   A. I think Mr. Marshall was aware that, obviously he had been
   policing that area for a while, and he must have been aware
   himself that there were not as many as he would probably have
   foreseen. How would he know outside in Leppings Lane that at
   2.15 very few Liverpool supporters were at the Leppings Lane
   end and in the North Stand if he was not told? - A. He would
   not, sir.

Q. If he would not know it, it was something that it was vital to
   tell him. Is that right? - A. Yes, I will accept that.

.CL. Had* you. ever:been told either'on this briefing or on any-- ---
   briefing at any other match that it was part of your duties to
   convey to Police Officers outside in Leppings Lane the state' '
   of the stands and terraces within the ground? - A. No, sir,
   but can I go back to radio procedure at this stage. When we
   talk about radio we talk about going on to talk-through, and
   hopefully everyone hears what is going on. So the assumption
   is hopefully everyone can pick up what up what is going on
   within the ground. So many times requests don’t have to be
   made. The man can judge for himself.

Q. It may be. It is a wholly different question as to whether
   Mr. Marshall should have requested the information, but
   there was no way he would have picked this information up,
   and are you tell us, having considered it, that it had never
   been part of your briefings at any match that it was one of
   your duties to keep the Officers outside the ground informed
   as to the state of the crowd inside the ground? - A. I can
   never recall any explicit direction on those lines, sir.

Q. Do you understand the thrust of the questions I am putting to
   you,-Sergeant, because otherwise it is unfair to you? You
   understand what I am saying, that it was obvious to those
   inside the ground at 2.15 that in the next three-quarters-of-
   an-hour at some stage, unknown when, there would be a sudden
   massive influx of supporters down Leppings Lane, and that that
   information needed to be given to the Officers organising
   crowd control in Leppings Lane. Do you follow? - A. I follow,
   yes, sir.
         LORD .JUSTICE .TAYLOR:   I don ’t know that the word

  •"sudden" is fair, is it?      Intense, anyway.

        MR. HYTNER:     Intense, yes:

Q. It might have been sudden. It might have been a gradual
   intensity. Do you follow? - A. I follow, yes, sir.

Q. Was there no comment made at any stage between 2.15 and 2.45
   that, "Well, somebody is going to be coming late. There is
   going to be a late onrush"? - A. No particular comment, sir,
   no, because at that stage it was believed that the turnstiles
   would adequate cope even though there were people coming late
   and they were all going to come together.        ~

Q. Again, had you ever been any briefing as to the rate at which
   people could go through the turnstiles? - A. I understand it
   is about one every 10 seconds.

Q. Had you any idea as to how many - never mind one every 10
   seconds per turnstile - did you have any idea as to the
   overall numbers that could come through the Leppings Lane
   turnstiles every 15 minutes or so? - A. No, but it runs at
   thousands, a few thousands.

Q. The next question is this. It is obviously part of your
   duties to monitor the-crowd - I suppose that is why you: are
   there   -to' monitor'-the "crowd to ensure''tho^ 'if trouble breaks
   out here or there or if hooligans start up some nonsense in a
   particular part, you can see that immediately and let people
   on the ground know where the trouble is so they can deploy
   their forces? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. And also not just that, you are there to     monitor overcrowding?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Were you aware that there was a greater need for you to
   monitor overcrowding in pens 3 and A than anywhere else in the
   ground? I am sorry, I should add to that, of course,
   theoretically, the two wing pens as well. But it was more
   important for you to monitor the individual pens at Leppings
   Lane end than anywhere else in the ground? - A. It was a part
   to monitor them, but when you know that you have a 10,000
   capacity on that end, that the 10,000 are going to go in
   whether it is the centre pens or theend pens.

Q. This is what I am going to ask you. Were you aware that there
   was a special problem on the Leppings Lane terraces or not? -
   A. No, sir, I was not.

Q. Were you aware there was an overall capacity for the Kop which
   unless there was a terrible error could not be exceeded
   because the computer would tell the club when the capacity
   had been reached? - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. You knew, because you have just saidso, that you knew that
   the overall capacity of the Leppings Lane terraces could not
   be exceeded beyond 10,000 for the same reason? - A. Yes, sir.
                                128
                           ?5A




    Did you know that the individual pen capacity could be
    exceeded if sharp eyes were not kept open for the problem? -
    A. No, I believe the capacity, if we talk about the central
    pens, would be such that at some stage you would probably be -
    able to say, "That is full", and put them to the wings.

    Yes. So you knew that the control of the centre pens or the
    wing pens was visual? - A. Yes, sir.

    That crowd safety depended on Police Officers and/or stewards
    keeping an eye on the pens to ensure that so far as was
    possible the capacities were not exceeded? - A. That is
    correct, sir.

Q. Did you know in fact what the capacity of the centre
   pens was? - A. I think it is two, one.

Q. That is the total? - A. I believe so.

Q. You are quite right.   Itis a thousand in one and twelve
   hundred in the other. Sorry. Two, two. Did you at any
   stage before you saw people climbing over the pens notice
   any overcrowding in pens 3 and 4? - A. No, sir.

Q. Apart from noticing that there was crowd trouble in that
   people were climbing over did you ever say to yourself
   pens 3 and 4 are beginning to look overcrowded. They
   have reached capacity? - A. No, sir. 3 and 4 were
   getting full, were full. From my vantage point they
   were not overcrowded.

0. How, it may not be in any way your fault because you
   may not have been given any sort of briefing or training
   for this observation but I must ask you. At 3 o'clock
   would you have said that there was a thousand in one pen
   and twelve hundred in the other? - A. Around those
   figures, yes.

Q. That is what you would have said? - A. I would, yes, sir. I

Q. Did no Officer.in the.control box, anybody, comment at'
   any stage that pens 3 and 4 -looked full? - A. No, sir.
   They did look full but not overfull.                       j
                                                              I
0-. How, the next thing is this. I am not sure at all that
    your evidence suggests that it was difficult at any stage
    to communicate by radio with Officers in Leppings Lane
    but had there been any difficulty at all you had enough
    spare people and in particular Chief Inspector KcRobie
    who could have run with a message down to the turnstiles
    at Leppings Lane. That would not have been a difficulty,
    would it? - A; It- would not had it been on the inside of
    the turnstiles, sir, no. If the message was going to be
    passed to the inside of the turnstiles that would be O.K.

Q. Ten seconds? - A. Around that time, yes.   A bit more
   probably.

0. And to get to the outside of the turnstiles, you may not
   know this, it would have taken another two or three
   seconds to get through Gate C or Gate A. Do you follow?
   - A. -Through Gate C two or three seconds more. Gate A
   much more.

Q. Much more? - A. Yes.

Q. It does not matter. Mo problem about sending messages
   by runner if the radios were not operative. Is that

          .right? - A. Yes j X would agree with that but it is then a
           matter of passing a message on.

                HR. HYTNER:     Yes.         Thank you.

                MR. JACICSON:    I have no questions.

                        Cross-examined by MR. MULLER:
    B
        Q. Sergeant, you were doing your monitoring of the terraces,
           do I understand, visually by looking and looking through
           the window and also looking at the videos? - A. Both, sir.

        Q. Both? - A. Mainly through the window.                         Looking through
           the window.
    C   0. Mainly through the window? - A. Yes.

        Q. When you are observing the terrace have you found from
           experience there is a blind spot? - A. Yes, sir.

        Q. Where is the blind spot? - A. Down at the front.                         With
           the - the fencing.
    D   0. The top of the fencing goes back, does not it, at an
           angle? - A. That is correct, yes.                                           •
                                       • .   -   .   .   -** v *   „ _     „

        0. And the result of that is - correct me if I am wrong -
           that you cannot actually see anybody from your bo:: who
           is certainly in the front row and probably in the second
         / row of the terrace? - A. In pen 1 you can but it goes at
           an angle. If you get to pen 7 you cannot - you know,
           probably, 4, 5, 6, 7 steps up. You cannot see.

        0. So certainly if we are talking about pens 3 and pen 4
           which I think we are principally concerned with as
           far as they are concerned your view of the front of
           the pen is certainly obstructed, would you agree, first
           two rows, something like that? - A. At least, yes, sir.
    F      Yes.

        Q. Did you regard that as satisfactory? - A. Not particularly,
            It was something that I must admit I had never even con­
           sidered before because you could - you could see people.
           Even though your view is obstructed basically you see
            figures although you cannot see - you would not be able
            to pick them out individually. You could see figures.

        Q. Would you agree the position is basically this, that if
           you want to have a view of people who are at the front
           of 3 and 4 you have got to ask the colour television,
           the one in the middle, to zoom in on the front of the
           terraces? - A. You would have to do that, yes, sir.

        Q. You would have to make a specific request to do that
    H

                          97




  •presumably if you want to look at that? - A. Yes, sir, yes.

Q. Your view of the terraces generally would not alarm you
   because you would not be able to see the first cwo? - A.
   No, sir.
Q. I see. Was it your understanding that you were principally
   those of you in the control box, principally responsible
   for controlling the crowds and the quantity of people going
   into those two pens? - A. No, sir, no.

Q. Well, who did you think had the principal responsibility?
   -A. It is an overall responsibility of control as is the
   whole of the ground and no doubt the overall control was
   filling of any pens or any pen would be down to control
   but then we cone down to individual Officers deputed on
   those serials.
Q. Where? - A. Whether it be on track - well, basically track
   who would get a better view of things than we could see
   ourselves.

0. Yes. One other thing I would like to ask you about.
   You say - I do not hold you to exact time but I want
   to explore it with you - at 3.10 there was a request
   for b-o-Lt crapper.s I .think .you subsequently say you
   discovered was Sergeant Wright?;-.A. That is correct,
   sir, yes.

Q. Assuming that tine to be right and assuming the sequence
 * of events which you have told us about, namely, an
   immediate telephone call to Claywheels Lane which was
   immediately responded to. Plight? - A. That is correct,
   sir.

Q. And was immediately followed by a signal by you to Mr.
   Bichard who then made the telephone call to the Head­
   quarters, Snig Hill? - A. Made the radio call, yes.

Q. How long would it be before he made that radio call?
   - A. Seconds.

Q. Seconds? - A. Yes.

Q. So if we assume it was 3.10 when there is the call for
   the bolt croppers what time would you suggest the Fire
   Brigade was being summoned? -A. By 3.11, 3.12.

0.. 3.11, 3.12. Well, we do happen to know - at least there
    is evidence or will be evidence, I think - to the effect
    that the Fire Brigade were actually called a few seconds
    before 14-ainutes-past-3. Bearing that in mind and if
    that is right would that tend to indicate to you that
    the call for bolt croppers cane rather later than you
    suggest? - A. That could be correct, sir, yes.

   to a witness who we have not actually heard from, a Police
   Constable Savioury whose statement we have been provided
   with, what he says is, and these times may not be entirely
   accurate, he says that at six-minutes-past-three bolt
   croppers were requested and the request was acknox-zledged.
   It goes on to say ambulance requested and acknowledged.
   Ke was a man who was down, one of the Officers, who was
   down on the ground and he then goes on to say four
   minutes later at 15.10 further request for bolt croppers,
   none forthcoming and fence torn down by hand by Police
   and spectators. Presumably the only wav he would be
   able to communicate with you would be by radio? -A.
   That is correct,sir.

0.   And you were on the radio? - A. I was, sir.

Q. If he is right there were two requests for bolt croppers?
   - A. No, I only recall one request for bolt croppers being
   made and it was acted upon immediately.

0.. If he is right in saying there was a request at one time
    if he says 15.06 and that was acknowledged you would have
    been the one who acknowledged it? - A. I would have been
    the one who would have acknowledged him. yes.

Q, So the situation could■be;-could it, that he.makes a call
   at 15.06' or whatever time for bolt croppers - you
   certainly did get a request for bolt croppers? - A. We
   certainly did get a request for bolt croppers, yes.

Q. You think it was from somebody else though? - A. Yes.
   I thought it was from Sergeant Wright.

Q. Yes.    Whatever. That is acknowledged? - A. Yes.

0.. Right. You do not recall any subsequent request? - A.
    No, sir.

          HR. MULLER:    Yes.   Thank you.

            . JACKSON:    Sir, there is one short, matter.
     It is page 6 of the statement, sir.

                 Cross-examined by     MR. JACKSON:

Q. Sergeant, may I just ask you      about the events after
   the two openings of Gate C?       We understand and My Lord
   asked you about your request      as expressed, open the-
   gates, referred to Gate C? -      A. Yes, sir.

Q. Have you heard by now that it was the Chief Superintendent's
   intention to make the observation apply to all three gates?
   - A. No, sir, not at all.

                          99




Q. At 2.52 or thereabouts Sergeant Higgins cane through and
   said words to the effect the gates at A have got to be
   opened as if not somebody will be killed? - A. That is
   correct, yes, sir.

Q. When that message came through was there an explosion,
   as it were, from the Chief Superintendent to the effect
   I have already ordered those to be opened? - A. Not as
   far as I am aware, sir, no.

Q. In fact quite the reverse. You in fact took a decision,
   did you not? - A. When he said someone will get killed
_ I took the decision open the gates, yes, open Gate A,
   to Sergeant Higgins, yes.

Q. It arises out of My Lord's question to you earlier.
   I do not want to be rude. Who on earth was making
   the decisions in that control box? - A. Hr. Murray
   was in charge.

Q. But in fact you made the decision, a quite proper one -
   it is not a criticism - but you made it off your own bat
   to open Gate A? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And you were never in receipt of any question about why    *
   had it not been opened in response to the Chief
   Superintendent's.request"minutes before? - A. That is
  •correct~sir. 'i opened'that"gate - I ‘ordered'that gate
   to be opened bearing in mind what Hr. Duckenfield had
   said in relation to earlier on, if people were going
   to get killed open the gates. The same thing applied
   so I ....

Q. Sergeant, forgive me. Do not misunderstand me. I am
   not criticising at all your decision to open the gate.
   I am merely confirming it was Sergeant Goddard of his
   own initiative who opened Gate A? - A. I gave instruction
   for that, yes, sir.

        MR. MULLER:   Thank you.

               Cross-examined by MR. MAXWELL:

Q. Sergeant, when you passed the message on, open the gate_s,
   did you think you were then addressing a Superior Officer
   in passing that particular message on? - A. I thought I
   was speaking to Mr. Marshall, yes, sir.

Q. Did you then say open the gates, sir? -A. No, sir, I did
   not.

0. You did not add sir at the end? - A. I did not, no, no.

0. It could lead to confusion, could not it, between the
   singular and the plural? - A. It could, sir, but if I
   can add that in relation to football when a Senior
   Officer comes through there are two ways we normally

      •do it. One is to address them by their Divisonal radio
       number ....

Q.     That isvery .... - A. Which would be Foxtrot whatever.

Q.    Forgive ne.  I thought I might have solved part of the
      riddle but I fear I have not.

0..        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Did not it strike you as
      being rather strange that Chief Superintendent there
      able to see what the situation is should require you
      to tell him that he could open the gates? - A. No, sir.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Does not.   Yes, I see.

                Cross-examined bv    IS. GI3S0S-WATT:

0. Sergeant, going back a bit, we know that you were in
   the control room for the semi-finals in 87, 88 and
   89? -A. That is correct, sir.

0.. And we know that Superintendent Murray was your control
    room Officer in 88 and 89? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Who was the control room Officer in 87, please? -A. Mr.
   Freemarn;^.-Super in:tendent -J-r-e.eman.-v, r

Q. Superintendent Freeman. And is this right - we have
   heard some evidence about it - that Superintendent
   Freeman liked to fill the pens, the Leppings Lane pens,
   one by one and then close them off when they were full?
   - A. Is this for a semi-final, sir?

0.. Yes. For..-the semi-final in 87. - A. No, that is not
    the case, sir.

Q. Your recollection is that that was not done in 87?
   - A. My recollection is that certainly was not done
   in 87, no.

Q. I see. - A. It was people finding their own level.

Q. Your recollection then is that people found their own
   level in both 87 and 88? - A. That is correct, sir.




                                    / 0. There has been ....

                                    101




    Q. There has been some evidence that both in 1987 and 19SS
       the gates, or let me put it this way, the back of the Leppings
       Lane tunnel, the tunnel leading to the central terraces
       was closed off when it was thought that the central pens
       were full. Are you aware of that? - A. No sir, I was not
       aware. It was probably off an Officer's own volition
       that that was the case rather than fron Control.
B
    Q. You say "an Officer's own volition". How is an Officer
       of his own volition to find out that the pens are full.
       Where would he have to be? - A. Two places. One is on
       the track and one is at the West Stand.

    Q. And in either position, either on the track or on the
       West Stand it is quicker for him to radio through to
       Control than to send a runner, isn't it? - A. Very much
       so, yes sir.

    Q. Are you quite certain that no nessage was passed to Control
       about this from Officers on the track or in the West Stand
       in 1937 or 193S? - A. I certainly don't remember that at
       all sir, no.

D   Q. A different topic, Sergeant. You have told us how you
        replied to Constable Buxton's suggestion that the kick-off
       "shoul-d--be■^os'tpon-ed'1whe:h-.':
                                         hisr:;n:cLde-the suggestion on the!'
        radio at a very late"stage? - A. That is correct, sir."

    Q. Do you remember a conversation a bit earlier about half-past-2
      , between Superintendent fiurray and Chief Superintendent
     ' Duckenfield in the Control Room about'the agreement or the
        basis that they had agreed as to the circumstances in which
        the kick-off should be delayed? - A. No sir, X was totally
        unaware of that.

    Q. I tell you why I put it to         you and I will put it more
       broadly. You have told us          you replied very quickly to
       Mr. Bu:-:ton saying: "It is        no good, it is too late" or
       words to that effect. You          have told us that? - A. Yes sii
F
    Q. And it has been suggested to you that you should have
        passed the message on to Hr. Duckenfield instead of
       answering off your own bat. You remember that suggestion
       being made? - A. I do sir.

    Q. What I wanted to ask you was this: were you under the
       impression by the time that Mr. Buxton's message came
       through, that in some v/ay Mr. Duckenfield had already
       decided not to postpone the ki<3c-off in his own mind?’- A.
       That was my impression.

    Q. I was wondering whether, and this is why I have put the
       previous conversation to you, I was wondering whether
       that impression came from something that had been said
       between your two Senior- Officers in the Control Eo:c? -
H      A. No, not at all sir. Basically my impression is that

                                             147
                               102

                                              GOD DARD



   at 2.50 whatever it is, if he is going to delay the game
   he would have been out of the Box and down the tunnel to
   the Directors' place and seen the F.A. people.

Q. That seems entirely logical. Were you aware of a policy
   about delaying kick-offs to this effect, that if there
   was a particular reason such as a motorway blockage or
  ‘fog for people to be late    it would be delayed, but
   if they just turned up late it wouldn't? - A. Yes, I aia
   aware of that, yes.

Q. Nov/ where are you aware of that from please? - A. Generally.
   It was not from hearing anything in the bo::. It was just
   something I have known for some while but if there are
   specific reasons, for example fog, road accidents on motor­
   ways yes, you will delay it. When the spectator is
   unavoidably detained you would then delay it, yes.

Q,. But if he is just late you don't? - A. That is correct
    sir.

Q. You are aware of that as a general policy, you say? - A.
   Yes sir.

Q. Again a different matter. Do you recall after the match
   had been-. stopped.-that.Jir < Kelly, who.-is,..the Chief ..Executive
   of the Football-Association',"came, into u-ia^Police Control
   Box with another man? - A. I know someone came in.            Two
   people came in. I don't know Mr. Kelly or the other chap
   obviously. I know two people came in.

Q. And they had a conversation with Mr. Duckenfield? - A. well
   I would assume so sir, yes.

Q. Well you were there? -      A. I was there, yes.

Q. Were they asking what had happened? - A. I don't know.
   At this particular time obviously we were very very busy
   so though I am aware that people are coming in and going
   from the box I am not aware of v/ho they are talking to
   unless it is me personally or what they are saying.

Q. If you are saying that you don't remember anything that
   was said between the two men and the Police Commander
   then I won't ask you further. Is that the situation?
   - A. That is correct.

         " MR. GIBSOU-WATT:    Very well.    Thank you.


                   Cross-Examined by MR. KALLIPETISt

Q. Sergeant Goddard, do you remember in 1935 attending a meeting
   at the Hillsborough Ground with some Ambulance Officers,
   Mr. Wilkinson, Mr. Higgins and Mr. Keyworth? - A. I believe
   so, yes sir.
                                     148
                              103




Q. That was as a result of a request from the Ambulance Service
   to meet at the ground follov/ing the Bradford Disaster to
   sort out between you the emergency plans? - A. That is right
   sir.

Q. And it v/as agreed among you that the emergency area rend­
   ezvous for the ambulances would be the gymnasium? - A. Yes
   sir.

Q. That would be the casualty clearing centre, a mortuary if
   such were needed and isn't it right, Mr. Goddard, you knew
   that the Ambulance Service were preparing their own plan
   for Hillsborough Football Ground itself and subsequently
   a copy of that v/as given to you by Mr. Keyv/orth or
   Mr. Wilkinson? - A. I did not know, sir, and I certainly
   am not aware of any copy being given to me personally.

Q. Very well. If you did not receive a copy oi the plan
   there was no doubt in your mind as to where the Ambulance
   Service would be located in the eventof a major incident?
   - A. The logical place would be there sir, yes.

Q.Not only the logical place but the place that had been agreed
   at the meeting at which you attended? - A. Yes sir.

Q. And it..did. .not-,change from-that, did _it?_ -   A.   Not as far
   as I am. aw_ar-e-._: ••;

Q. And subsequently, and I-ask-you this because you have           had
    such a long experience with this particular ground in          the
  / Police Control Box, it v/as always known that that v/as        the
    station for the Ambulance Service at Cup semi-finals?          -
    A. I believe that is correct, yes sir.

Q. It would apply, to make it absolutely accurate, not tc
   1937 but to 1933 and 1939? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you hear any request at all for an Ambulance Officer
   to attend the Police Control Bo:c? - A. I don't know about
   a request. I know a Fire Officer v/as there asking for
   an Ambulanceman with Senior Ambulance personnel.

Q. Whom did the Fire Officer ask? - A. I don’t know sir.
   I honestly don't know. My assumption is that it would
   be Mr. Murray.

Q. Did you hear anybody say: "Well they are over by the
   gymnasium because that is the agreed point where the
   Ambulance Officers will be”? - A. No sir, but bearing
   in mind sir I don't know if things have changed, I know
   I said "No" but the Ambulance Officers also have a place
   in the South Stand.

Q. Did anybody say that to the Fire Officer? - A. I don't
   believe so, no.

Q. You .have said in answer to ray Lord's question earlier that
   the hand-held set, the spare set that you were using you
   could not receive messages on the hand-set. Is that
   absolutely right, Mr. Goddard, or did I take my note down
   wrongly? - A. That is correct, the substitute set with
   the telephone mike?

Q. Yes? - A. Yes, we received nothing from that at all.

Q. Can't you hear any messages on that? - A. Yes, you can hear
   messages if it is working, but as I explained (a) I had
   probably been trying to transmit before it had got warded
   up.

Q. It takes three minutes to get warmed up, as I understand
   it? - A. Hopefully 30 seconds sir.

Q. Well after 30 seconds could you hear things through it?
   - A. I don't know. Within that time I had thrown it down
   and used the hand-held radio, but it is 30 seconds and
   in that period of time it is an eternity.

Q. I want to understand your evidence, Hr., Goddard, so I don't
    ask questions of you unnecessarily. Are you then saying
    that because you could not use it you did not use it at
" ’ all /th’
           at 'afterhooh?T — A. that is correct, sir, I did r e f ­
    use it *ST: -all. It v/as tried, found-not to be working or
    I believed it was not workingso I never used it that
    afternoon, that is correct.

Q.' So the only radio contact v/as the hand-held radio? - A. That
    is correct sir.

Q. Apart of -course from the contact with Snig Hill which v/as
   the VHP radio which you did not operate, as I understand
   it? - A. That is correct sir.

                           3-05




                 Cross-Examined bv MR. GLASGOW:

Q. Sergeant Goddard, are you the Officer in the control box
   through whom anybody makes contact with the outside world? -
   A. Myself and P.C. Ryan, yes.

Q. Is there a segregation between you? Does Sergeant Ryan
   ordinarily hold one piece of equipment and you another, or do
   you share the telephones and the radios between you? - A. We
   try and keep it separate, but that does not work. It is
   interchangeable.

Q. You have told us that you checked the figures for spectators
   with P.C. Guest. When you say that do you mean you spoke to
   him specifically or just to the club control room? - A. To Mr.
   Guest.

Q. To Mr. Guest personally? - A. Yes.

Q. And can you remember how many times approximately you did
   that? - A. I can’t, but it would be certainly three or four
   times.

Q. As the figures built up? - A. As the figures built up.

Q. Did you ever .have any. difficulty contacting him? - A.. Mr.
   Guest,-ha,* :sirr.         -••• ' ;i ;

Q . Can you now remember, and don’t guess, please, because it may
    not matter, but can you remember whether you did that by the
    radio or by the telephone? - A. By telephone, sir.

Q. Did anybody ever tell you they were having difficult in
   getting through to the club either on the radio or through the
   telephone? -A. No, sir.

Q. If you were the man principally responsible for and handling
   the communications would you think it surprising if one of the
   other people in that room was unable to make contact with the
   club that they should nothave told you that they were having
   a difficulty? - A. I would have thought so, but it would all
   depend on how they were trying to make contact.

Q. Precisely. Let me put the alternatives to you. if somebody
   had said to you, ’’Sergeant, I can't get through on the club’s
   radio to the club control room, what would you have said? - A.
   "Well, ring them”.

Q. "Well, ring them”? - A. Yes.
Q. Can you remember - I am sure you won't be able to remember the
   actual figures - can you remember roughly when it was you
   last spoke to P.C. Guest to get the figures for ground
   attendance? - A. It would certainly be well after 2
   o'clock, but what time I would not guess at all.

Q. Can I see if we can get there in another way.     Even on the

                                  151
                            106




     last occasion when you spoke to him were you personally
     alarmed by the figures that he gave you? - A. No, sir.

Q. And is the best you can do to say that the figures he gave you
   sounded approximately what you would have expected? - A. I saw
   nothing untoward in them at all, sir, no.

Q. Did you keep the information to yourself or did you pass it
   on? - A. it was passed round.  I said, ’’There's so many in
   now” .

Q. Finally on this point. Can you remember whether this was just
   you being methodical and acting as you normally do in checking
   on the figures, or did somebody say, "Sergeant Goddard, find
   out how many we have got in the ground"? - A. It was a bit of
   both, sir, because different people, and certainly Mr.
   Duckenfield had said to me, "Would you find out what is in
   here", and you do it for yourself anyway.

Q.    Is the answer that   on some of     the occasions you spokeit may
     be of your own initiative and as a matter of routine, but on
     others it may have been in response to an Officer’s request? -
     A. That is correct, sir.

Q. You told us that Mr. Murray was the Officer who was actually
   taking, the decisions, in. .the .control .box?. - A, Yes..

Q.   Did you mean that?    - A. Yes.

Q.    You have also told   us of one particular decision which was
     taken by his superior Officer, Mr. Duckenfield? - A. Yes.

Q. Do we understand from that that only one of the decisions that
   was taken that afternoon was actually taken by Mr.
   Duckenfield, and the others were taken by Mr. Murray? - A. I
   would say yes, that as far as I was aware my ground Commander
   was Mr. Murray.

Q. And the one decision which Mr. Duckenfield did take took so
   long for him to announce that a number of people were
   either asking him what that decision was or as in your case
   physically turning round in order to see what his response
   was going to be? - A. I am not saying it took him a long
   time to make the decision. No, he was asked a question and
   he responded to it.

Q. Well, the first question he was asked was asked before gate C
   opened for the first time, was not it? - A. Yes.

Q. And we know that gate was opened at 14.48 to be precise, and
   it seems we are all in agreement that the request was made at
   some time at or about 14.47. Does that accord with your
   recollection? -A. Yes.

Q. The gate then opened, but those of you who saw it open from
   the control box believed that it had at that stage burst open?
   - A. That is correct.

                                  152
Q. So you did not understand that it had been openedinresponse
   to an order from Mr. Duckenfield? - A. No, sir.

Q. The gate opened for a second time as we can see on the video
   at 14.52? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. And on that occasion you understood that   it was in response to
   the order which Mr. Duckenfield had just   given? - A. That is
   correct.

Q . And you mean that? - A . Yes.

Q.   I don’t want to lead you unfairly. He had just given the
     order? - A. As I believe it that is correct, yes, sir. As I
     saw it, yes.

Q. You personally passed that order on and within a few moments
   of you giving the order, ’’Open the gates” ,you sawgate C
   open? - A. Gate C opened, yes, sir.

Q. So we have the delay between 14.47 about and 14.52 before the
   positive order was given in response to a request which had
   originally been made by a Superintendent in difficulties at
   14.47? - A. Yes, sir.

Q..; Again, do you mean to say, and don’t answer if you think it is
   - unfair, that you were not at the time surprised by the delay
     between 14.47 and 14.52 for the man in command of that ground -
     to respond to an urgent request from a Superintendent in
     difficulties? - A. But bear in mind the gate had already been
     opened or was opened shortly after that at 14.48, albeit a
     short period of time.

Q. But Sergfeant, I think you have already told us that you
   believed....

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am not sure, Mr. Glasgow, this
     is really going to be helpful to ask this Officer about that.

Q.        MR. GLASGOW:   The next matter, Sergeant Goddard, I would
     like your help with, is the vision that you have of the ground
     from your elevated position. Would you like to look at the
     bundle which is West Midlands 2, the fat one, photograph 51.
     Is the blind spot you were referring to the front row or rows
     that are tucked under the cranked back section? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. As you are sitting in your seat looking along that line? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. And if you need to know what is going on particularly in that
   section of the ground you have two choices. Either to ask
   Sergeant Bichard to direct the television camera to that
   section? That would be one? - A. That is one, yes.

Q. Or alternatively, for somebody to step outside on to the
   platform and physically look straight down? - A. That is

                                    J. «5
                            1«1B




    .another alternative, yes.

Q. Did anybody go outside to look directly into the pen? - A. No,
   sir.

Q. With the photograph still in front of you do you remember the
   time at which Chief Inspector McRobie said that he would go
   down and sort things out? - A. No, I don’t remember the time.
   I know the occurrence.

Q. You remember the event? - A. I remember the event, but what
   time it was I can't say.

Q. I think in your statement I think that he volunteered, saying,
   "I’ll go and sort it out”? - A. Yes.

Q. Was it that way round, or did somebody order him or ask him to
   go down? - A. I think it might have been a bit of both. I
   know he said, ’’I ’ll go and sort it out". It could well have
   been Mr. Murray or Mr. Duckenfield had said something to him.

Q. When he said that and left the control room, did you see him
   physically standing in the photograph where we would see him?
   On the video it would appear he was standing almost directly
   in line with where the tulip microphone is on the photograph?
   - A. I saw him down on- the ground for just a matter of
   seconds ,•but •by then*, we-got so many-people coming on :to Lhe ~
   ground you were just lost, because basically you are looKing
   at uniforms and the people coming across, and as I understand
   it Mr. McRobie was not in uniform.
i

Q. Well, you know that he was not? - A. I know that he was not.

Q. Did you see him standing by that corner of the ground and then
   did you notice him go behind the goalposts? - A. No, I
   initially saw him by gate 1, that area, which is the nearest
   gate to the control box. After that I lost him and I don't
   know where he went.

Q. The last matter if you can help us on timing, Sergeant, can
   you remember how long it was before he came back to the
   control room after going down to try and sort it out? - A. I
   don’t remember him coming back, sir.

Q. Thank you very much.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Have you much to ask?

          MR. WOODWARD:   I will be some little time, sir. I can't
     finish by quarter-past-3. I am prepared to start, sir.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Not much point in doing that. We
     will break off then. How many more Police witnesses have you,
     Mr. Collins?

          MR. COLLINS: Sir, Police.Constable Bichard, who is not
     going to take that long because most of what he deals with is

                                   154
                          109


                                                M.   GODDARD


already covered.   There is Police Constable Guest, who will
be, I think, relatively short, and then two very short
Officers. We might in the light of the evidence that has been
given have to call Chief Inspector McRobie, but we can’t
anyway call him on Monday because he is not available. We
will have to consider that. That is the end of the Police.   I
would have hoped about an hour-and-a-half, possible 2 hours at
the outside.                                        ,

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       What are we then going on to?

     MR. COLLINS:   We are then going to have the St.
Ambulance and the Fire Brigade. That is limited, as far as
the Fire Brigade is concerned, to those who arrived and what
happened on that afternoon, not the Fire Brigade in relation
to their input into the Safety Certificate side. That I
anticipate and hope will complete Monday. We will then on the
Tuesday deal with the club, but again stewarding, etc., purely
on the day. We are not going to deal with the history of the
club and the state of the premises. Then I hope we will be
able to start with Mr. Eastwood on Wednesday. That at the
moment is the way I see it, and we are I think just about on
target for that.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Thank you very much.   We will
_break~off. Jiow.and-s±t.-atCJ10_3Q. on-Monday.

                                                                                           T

          sets including control rootn get all the messages. However,
          it becomes increasingly difficult to understand individual
          messages when several Officers are speaking? - A. That is
          correct, yes, sir.

     Q. If the controller is transmitting on the hand set - that
        is the one that is wired to the radio? - A. Yes.
B
     Q. And one of the personal radios transmits at the same time
        then the control output is' cut off? - A. Yes.

     Q. All users including the controller will receive the
        message from the personal radio and that arrangement
        is built into the equipment? - A. Yes.
C    Q. That is the way it works.     It is standard equipment? - A.
        It is, yes.

     Q. It can only be overcome by deselecting     talk through? - A.
        Yes, sir.

     Q. When the control room moved on the day in question to
r)      using a hand set did that result then in the control room
        being in the same position as any individual in the
        ground?- A. Exactly, yes, sir.

     Q. That was the means of using the equipment but it rendered
        the control room equal? - A.'Yes, exactly.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I have not followed how it
          was not equal beforehand.

               MR. WOODWARD:   It v/as less than equal beforehand, sir.

     Q.       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    On talk through, as I understand
*         it, anybody can transmit and everybody hears until it becomes
          so garbled nobody can understand. - A. That is right, sir.

F    Q. That applies to control as well as out stations.       Is that
        right?

               MR. WOODWARD:    That is right, save, sir .....

     i.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    When you operate from the
          hand set rather than the main set what difference does
          it make?

               MR. WOODWARD: It means, sir, that control is not
          being cut off automatically.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I am sorry, I may be very dense
          but I am not following.

               MR. WOODWARD:    What difference does it make? - A. If

         you use a normal tulip mike on the normal base set there
         if you transmit and at the same time someone is transmittin
         to yourself it will cut control out.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Right. - A. If I use a normal
         hand held set I have got just the same opportunity of
         getting on the airwave.
B   Q. It sounds as though the system of last resort here gave
       you a better option than .... - A. That is correct, sir,
       yes.
              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I do not understand that. I
         mean, I understand it but I do not see the point of it.
         Yes.

    Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   That is the effect? - A. That is
         the effect of it, yes, sir.

    Q. On the question of the hierarchy, the arrangement of
       responsibility in the control box, first of all, there
       is Mr. Duckenfield? - A. Yes, sir.

D   Q. Then Mr. Murray? - A. Yes.

    Q.Then yourself? - A. Yea.

    0.   And the other two Officers? - A. That is correct, sir, yes.

    Q.. The team apart from Mr. Duckenfield that had worked in the
        control box had worked together on a number of occasions
        before? - A. Yes, yes, sir.

    Q. Were you all familiar with the way each other proceeded?
       - A. Very much so, yes, sir.

    Q. And v/as it necessary according to your experience to have
       to tell each individual Officer in the team what it was
       that you were doing? - A. No, not at all.

    Q. Why was that? - A. We had worked together certainly over
       12 months so we knew - each person knew what the other
       v/as doing ‘or v/as aware of what the other was doing and
       it v/as a matter of you trust in each other. You would
       certainly rely on all your people and you work as a team.

    Q. The use of the various items of equipment. - A. Yes.

    Q. You would be receiving messages and passing messages?
       - A. I would, yes.

    Q. So v/ould Mr. Bichard be receiving and passing messages?
       - A. He v/ould be receiving messages on VHF, yes, and
       passing on VHF, yes.

    Q. And if there was any doubt on the part of, let's say, Mr.
       Murray or Mr. Duckenfield as to what you were saying or
       what the message was would they enquire? - A. They would,
       definitely, yes, sir.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: So the VHF set was not operated
         by you but by M r ...... - A. Mr. Bichard. It is a hand held
B        set which ....

    Q. That is the one that connects with the club? - A. No, no,
       with the Force Control.

    Q. Is there another one that does connect with the club? - A.
       Yes, sir.

    Q. And does he have that as well? - A. No.     That is on the
       desk with us.

              LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I beg your pardon?

              MR. WOODWARD:   Forgive me, sir. I was interrupting.
         I did not intend to interrupt.
D             LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   No, no.

              THE WITNESS:   The Club radio is on the desk which I
         operate or P.C. Ryan would operate". P.C. Bichard would
         only operate the VHF radio to Force Control."

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   That is Hammer tonRoad      or at
         Snig Hill? - A. No, Snig Hill, sir.

              LORD,JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Snig Hill.

    Q.        MR. WOODWARD:  Was the way it ordinarily worked   and
         the way you and the team proceeded such that you would
         have expected Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield on the
         occasion to have everything at their fingertips? - A.
         Yes, sir.

    Q. Mr. Duckenfield was in the control box? - A. For a good
       length of time, yes, sir.

                                     / Q. So far as



H
                                      181
So far as you are concerned, do you have any doubts or
reservations as to whether or not he was aware of what
you were doing?    A. None at all, none whatsoever, sir.

Were you aware of what he was doing?   A. Not particularly,
no.

Was there a reason for that? A. Yes, sir, he was behind
me; I think he was directly behind me and obviously I
couldn't hear everything that Mr. Duckenfield would be
saying.

Was he in a position to give direct instructions to you?
A. Yes, sir, he was.

In relation to the decision of delaying the game, postponing
the kick-off, would that be a decision that Mr. Duckenfield
would have to take?   A. It would, yes.

You got a request over the radio for the game to be
postponed?   A. That is correct, sir, yes.

When you replied to that, saying that it was too late}
were you in fact saying "No, the game must not be postponed",
or just stating that things had gone so far?   A. Things
had gone so far.

If Mr. Duckenfield or.Mr. Murray had wanted to make the
decision to postpone the game, were they in a.position to
have done that?   A. At that stage, no, sir.

Why was that?   A. Well, they were in the control box.
To get from there down to the players' tunnel, etc., into
the ground offices area itself, it would only take them
a minute or a minute and a half, but they would certainly
have to get a move on.

So in making that decision, according to your understanding
of it, it involves further communciation before it is
made, does it?   A. Yes, sir.

What did you understand that process or procedure to be?
A. That they would obviously have to communicate with
members of the FA and the. Club and the teams.

So however the decision would be made, that would not be
something that would have been in your mind?   A. No, sir.

And whoever was making the decision would take whatever
procedural steps he considered necessary?   A. That's
correct.

And would it be right that you are not in a positionto
say quite what steps Mr. Duckenfield would have considered
it necessary to take?   A. Yes, sir.

Or Mr. Murray?   A. Yes, sir.
                           162
                               5


                                                M.    GODDARD


Q. You agree?      A. Yes, sir.

Q. It was a matter within their responsibility and the ir
   power?   A. Yes, sir.

Q. To do it in whatever manner they chose?               A. Yes, sir.

Q. Are you aware of the evidence that Mr. Murray and Mr.
   Duckenfield have given about the question of postponing
   the kick-off?   A. I am not, sir, no.

Q. On the question of opening the gates, youwere aware that
   Mr. Duckenfield had given an instruction to open certain
   gates?   A. Yes, sir.

Q. You have spoken of giving authority or permission to open
   certain gates yourself?   A.  'A' Gate, yes, sir.

Q. That was intended to relate to 'A' gate, was it?              A. That's
   correct.

Q. Gate A?    A. Yes.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:          Sorry, gate ...?

           Mr. WOODWARD:    'A', sir.

Q. Did you have a reason for believing that that was a decision
   that you could properly give?  A. I did, sir..

Q. What was it?      A. Mr. Duckenfield, prior to him authorising
   the opening of    gate 'C', had said "If people are going to
   get injured or    killed, we have got to open the gates."
   The same thing    applied to 'A' gate, and that is why I said
   "Yes, open 'AY    gate."

Q. And was Mr. Duckenfield, if'he had wanted, in a position
   to countermand what you were saying?   A. Yes, sir, he
   was behind me.

Q. May I ask you about the request for cutters? Did you
   know that police accident vehicles carried metal cutting
   equipment?   A. That is what I understood, yes, sir.

Q. So why did you make the request to Claywheels Lane?
   A. Because it is the nearest police station, which is
   a traffic garage, to the ground.

Q. If there was a vehicle there, would you have expected it
   to have such equipment?   A. Exactly, yes, sir.

Q.    So that was the reason       you made the request to Claywheels
     Lane?    A. Yes, sir.

Q.   How faraway is that?           A.   800 yards;    half a mile.

           Mr. WOODWARD:    Thank you, Officer.

             Re-examined by Mr. COLLINS:

Q. Sergeant Goddard, can I ask you to look at Tab 14 in the
   big bundle, which is the Operational Order. Can you turn
   to 4.1.1, please, which is the part of the Order dealing
   with communications? It is about a quarter of the way
   in to Tab 14 - page 12 at the top right?   A. 4.1.1, did
   you say, sir?

Q. 4.1.1,- yes. It is page 12 at the top, about a quarter of
   the way into that tab.   A. I'm afraid the pages on here
   aren't marked.

Q. Let me see if I can find it for you. This is a defective
   one; it is missing the page that matters. Here we are.
   (Handed to witness). Do you have it - "Communications,
   4.1.1"?   A. Yes, sir.

Q. That sets out the provision for the communications. We
   can see the UHF/VHF channel set out in 4.1.1.2?   A. Yes.

Q. And then the reference to FI Sub-Divisional Operational
   Functions on 35?    A. Yes.

Q. That is the UHF direct to Hammerton Road.       Then, at 4.11.5,
   we have this:

         "Strict radio discipline will .be maintained at all
         times. Messages must be kept: as short as possible
         and where this is not the case, gro-und control has
         the overriding option of cutting short any
         transmission irrespective of rank."

   Now, correct me if I am wrong, but the only way in which
   ground control can do that is by switching to non-talk-
   through, is that right?   A. That would be correct, yes,
   sir.

Q. And when the radio went down, as you have described, and
   the civilian technician came in to mend it, after that,
   you could not get the non-talk-through because you were
   limited to your hand-held set?   A. Exactly, sir.

Q. So you were unable to achieve what is set out in 4.11.5
   thereafter?   A. Yes, sir.

         Mr. COLLINS:   I am obliged.   I hope that clears that
   up.

         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I think it does.

         Mr. COLLINS: Thank you, Sergeant.

         Mr. PHILLIPS:  Sir, may I now call PeterWells  out
   of order? He has in fact broken off his holiday tocome
   and give evidence to  the Inquiry.

          THE CORONER:   Sergeant Goddard.

                      MICHAEL GODDARD Sworn

                         By THE CORONER:

0. Are you Michael Goddard? - A. I am, sir.

0. Police Sergeant 616? - A. That's right.

0. For four years prior to 1989 you had been doing work as
   the Sergeant in the Control Room? - A. That is correct,
   sir.

0. Which year did you start? - A. 1985/86.

0. Had you worked with Mr. Lock at all in that Control Room?
   - A. No, sir.

Q. There were actually three of you who did this job
   regularly - you, Mr. Bichard and Mr. Ryan? - A. Correct,
   sir.

0. You task normally was to deal with the radio
   communications? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I will take you straight to 1989.   You turned up in the
   Control box after having been to the briefing, is that
   right? - A. No, I did not go to the briefing. I started
   at 8.00 am directly in the Control Box.

0. You did not go to the briefing on the North Stand? - A. I
   did not go to the briefing, no, sir.

Q. I think I am right in saying that various tests were
   carried out on the tannoy to check that it was working? -
   A. Yes.

Q. I think the radios were tested to see if they were
   functioning? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q.   Is it right they were functioning?   - A. Yes, sir.

0. This isall, of course, before the      match had begun? -A.
   Yes, sir.

0. In fact we were told it takes quite a long time to test
   all the radios.   Would you agree with that? - A. It did.
   It took far longer than it would normally take, than you
   would normally associate...

Q. Was that because there were so many of them, or what? -
   A. Two points.   One, there were so many.   Number two
   was the fact that there were repeated interruptions in
   relation to the movement of fans, both Nottingham and
   Liverpool fans, around the ground in the areas, not quite
   at Hillsborough but around Hillsborough.

Q. You mean messages were coming in? - A. That is correct,
   yes, sir.

0. I do not think we need to be too concerned about those
   early times, by which I mean certainly up to half past
   one, quarter to two.   I know there was various activity
   but we will not deal with that.   I want to take you in
   the first instance to about two o'clock on that
   afternoon. - A. Yes.

Q. You were in the Control Box?    - A. Yes, sir.

0. The other two men were there, Mr. Ryan and Mr.Bichard?      -
   A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Is it right that around that time Superintendent Murray
   left the Control Box to go, as you thought, to see the
   referee? - A. Yes, to see the referee.

0. That is normal practice? - A. Yes, sir.

0. He then came back at what time? - A. Around 2.15.

0. Was he accompanied by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield? -
   A. Mr. Duckenfield was with him.

Q. He had gone with him, do you mean, or he came back with
   him? - A. No, he came back with him.

0. I think you also saw Mr. Jackson for   a time? - A. Yes,
   Mr. Jackson came in.

Q. He was in civvies, is that right? - A. That is correct.

Q. Did he stay for any length of time or not? - A. He stayed
   quite a while.   I am totally unaware of whenhe leftus.
   I know he was with us quite a little while.

0. Was it general chit-chat, if I can put it like that, or
   specifics to the match? - A. It was something of both,
   both specifics and general talk.

Q. At around that time, at about 2.15, did you have a look
   round the ground, you yourself? - A. Yes, I did, sir.
   It was a visual thing, not throughthe cameras, but from
   my position within the Box.

                                                     M.   GODDARD


Q. You sit in the cervtre of those three in the front row? -
   A. I am the centre one of the three in the front row,
   yes.

0. Would it be right tosay that Notts, seemed to be  filling
   but they appeared to bea relative emptiness at the
   Liverpool end? - A. Yes, that is correct, sir.

Q. Was that uniform in the Liverpool sector, or was it more
   marked in one place than another? - A. No, it was
   uniform.    The fact that the Kop and the South Stand
   area, what we could see of the South Stand area, was
   filling quite well yet the Liverpool area, the North
   Stand, the West Stand, was relatively empty in
   comparison.

Q. Did you pass any comment about that? - A. Yes, just a
   general comment how the Nottingham area had in fact
   filled. They were in bright and early, that is basically
   what it was about.

Q. Let*s get this right.   Mr. Murray was sitting in his
   seat on your left? - A. Immediate left.

Q.    You were sitting in the middle.   Who was sitting on... -
     A. PC Ryan on the other side.
0. He was the tannoy man? - A. The tannoy/telephone man.

0. On the back row PC Bichard? - A. PC Bichard.

0. Where was Mr. Duckenfield? -A. Somewhere over my right
   shoulder on the step.   Sometimes on the step up to the
   video area and sometimes on the floor.

0. He was standing up? - A. He was standing up.

Q. You did not have room for him to sit down? -A. No room,
   sir.

Q. At about 2.30 - can you remember 2.3? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you look at the TV monitor with regard to Leppings
   Lane? - A. Yes, my attention was drawn to that by a
   comment made by PC Bichard and obviously.I then looked at
   the Leppings Lane camera, on the outside of the ground on
   Leppings Lane itself, to see there were quite a lot of
   people in Leppings Lane.

0. When you say Leppings Lane, do you mean the whole of the
   road, or the concourse? - A. The concourse...   The area
   prior to the...   Outside of the ground.

Q. I think you noticed that this was a substantial number? -
   A. There were a substantial number.

Q.    Was it unusual to have that man there at that time or
     not? -A. I would say it was unusual.    I had seen it
     before, but on the number of matches I have covered, yes,
     it would be unusual in that I have seen it but not very
     often.

Q. Had by that time a message come through asking for
   Leppings Lane to be closed as far as you can remember? -
   A. I don't believe at that time a message had come
   through.   Obviously I have since learned certain things.

Q. Yes, tell me what you can remember from the time. - A. At
   the time the way I believed it to be was at around half
   past two Mr. Marshall radioed in asking for Leppings Lane
   to be closed and that is something obviously we took up
   by asking other Serials to do the closing of the road.

Q. You would have passed all the messages because you were
   the operator? - A. That is correct, sir.

0.    The instruction to close the Lane, did that comefrom you
     or from Mr. Murray, or Mr. Duckenfield, or from somebody
     else? - A. The instruction basically was from
     Mr. Marshall.

Q. So you merely activated that? - A. Yes, that is correct.

0. It did not need further intervention from Control Room
   staff apart from passing the message on? - A. Apart from
   passing the message.

Q. Any comments made about it at the time? - A. No, sir, not
   at all.

0. Now the radio I think throughout the relevant period was
   working on talk-through, is that right? - A. That is
   correct, sir.

0. We have already been told, and you can confirm that I
   have understood it correctly, that when you are on talk-
   through everbody can hear every message in and out? - A.
   That is correct.

0. Provided, of course, they can hear the radio? - A. That
   is correct.

Q. Did you notice at some point that your radio was not
   working properly? - A. We were told.   We got a message
   that our radio transmissions were hopeless, were useless,
   and immediately followed within seconds the civilian
   communications man came into the box which obviously


                                168

     means the radios had been going down for some while for
     him to get across to us.   Yes, that is what happened.

Q. He messed around with the various sets? - A. Yes.

0. How long were you actually off the air? - A. Off the air
   itself probably a couple of minutes.

0.    Did he first of try and substitute a temporary sat for
     you? - A. Yes. We were using a tulip mike which he
     unplugged and put a depression mike in.     The telephone
     handset with a central depression mike in.     That was
     found not to work so we then took on the base pack, the
     substitute pack, which again had to be plugged in etc.
     There was one problem there.     It was a fixed lead from
     the thing itself which was under the bench.     The lead
     was quite short.     Although it came above the desk there
     wasn't a lot of room so any messages through that,
     basically you would be bending down to talk into the
     telephone handset.

0.   So it was jolly uncomfortable? - A. Quite, sir.

Q.    Did it actually work but did you in the end finish up
     with your hand held sets? - A. It did not work, sir, no.
     I finished up with the hand held...

0. Those, of course, were on talk-through but you could not
   override messages, is that right? - A. That is correct,
   sir.

0. Did you receive any message from Superintendent Marshall
   about the closure of gates? - A. I received...   The
   closure of gates, sir?

0. No, opening of gates? - A. Yes.    Mr. Marshall came
   throu.-n asking that the gates at Leppings Lane be opened.

0. Before we go any further, can you remember how many
   requests he made? - A. In total I remember three
   requests.   Well, two requests and one demand.

Q. Was there a time interval between these or did they come
   in rapid succession or did they come in groups or what? -
   A. I am not quite sure on this, but I think they all came
   in a period of just a few minutes.

Q. When these requests came through.   Perhaps you can help
   me on this because I am still not entirely clear, is the
   message broadcast because you happen to be on talk-
   through so that everybody who wants to listen can hear? -
   A. Yes, that is correct, sir.   In the box behind the
   radio set itself are loudspeakers, very small square


                              189
                                               M.   GODDARD


loudspeakers, so the relaying of the messages would come
through those speakers.

So the people in the box would-be able to hear? - A. Yes.

Does that mean there was no necessity for you to speak to
people and say, "Did you hear that?"? - A. That is
correct.

Did you in fact do that or did you just take it that they
had all heard it if you heard it? - A. I took it that
everyone had heard it.

You say there were two requests and then a demand? -A.
Yes   .
Any action, if that is the right word, on the first
request that you can remember?   Any action by anyone?
Did you radio back with any response? - A. No.   There
was no response in relation to that.   I don't know if it
was on that occasion or the second occasion, the gates or
C Gate opened, or was opened and a few people came in.
On that one there was basically no response.

Because that happened are you saying more or less at the
same time as the message was corning through? - A. Very
shortly afterwards.

Did you yourself see that on the screen or were you told?
-A. No, I did not see the gates open.   Somebody said,
“Look, the gates," and I just saw people coming in
because ours is a view that is not a front-on view.    It
is a side-on view.

I see.   You could see people coming in? - A. People were
coming in, yes.

As far as you were concerned you received no further
instructions with regard to that and you took no further
action? - A. That is correct.

The third time - there is some dispute as to how many but
you remember three - there was a demand? - A. I believe
it was a demand.

What was the substance of it? - A. It was a demand that
if the gates weren't opened someone was going to get
killed.

                                                       M . GODDARD


Q . What happened then? - A. The demand came through. I
    looked at Mr. Murray on my left who turned round and
    said to Mr. Duckenfield, "Mr. Duckenfield, do we open
    the gates?" and Mr. Duckenfield immediately replied,
    "Open the gates, yes".

Q. That was his response to Mr. Murray? - A. That was his
   response to Mr. Murray, yes.

Q . what did you do? - A. I said, "Open the gates".

Q. Did you as a matter of interest say in which part of
   the ground these gates should be opened? - A. Not at
   all, sir. "Open the gates". It was apparent to me and
   obvious to me that all the concentration of radio was
   on Leppings Lane and when I talked about "Open the
   gates” it was again apparent to me that we were talking
   about Leppings Lane and Leppings Lane gates, no other
   gates wherever on the ground.

Q. In other words, you did not think there was any
   ambiguity in that? - A. None whatsoever, no.

Q. Was it the plural or singular so far as you remember? -
   A. It was in the plural, sir.

Q. You are sure of that? - A. I am positive, yes, sir.

Q. Prior to all this happening do you recollect requests
   for assistance from serials, mounted Officers or
   anything else arriving? - A. Yes, there was certainly a
   request for more mounted Officers to go to Leppings
   Lane and I directed a Sergeant Soresby directly round
   there with what available horse power he had got to go
   round to the Leppings Lane end. I think at that stage
   the C&V with Sergeant Higgins and Mr. Delaney, I think
   they were directed as well but I am not quite sure time
   wise on that.

Q. Having passed the order on, so to speak, to open the
   gates did you get a further request to open another
   gate? - A. Yes, some short time afterwards. That was
   from Sergeant Higgins in relation to A gate.

Q. Did you yourself know which was A gate? - A. Yes.

Q. What did he tell you? - A. Basically the same, the same
   as Mr. Marshall had said, that if we don't open the
   gates someone is going to get killed.

Q. Can you recollect whether that request was actioned? -
   A. It was immediately, yes, sir.

Q. Was it actioned by whom? - A. It was actioned by me at
   that stage, sir.
Q. Did you get authority to action it or not? - A. No. As
   I say, Mr. Murray is at the side o£ me. They can hear
   it totally, totally plainly. Mr. Duckenfield was
   behind me and when it comes to the fact, yes, someone
   is going to get killed, you open the gates. I said
   that knowing full well that C gate was certainly open
   and that A gate would not lead on to the West Stand
   area because of the railing factor and would lead to
   the North Stand area and so there would be no mass of
   people in on the concourse.

Q. How many gates did you know were at the Leppings Lane
   end as a matter of interest? - A. How many gates?

Q. Did you know how many gates there were at Leppings Lane
   end? - A. Three gates, sir.

Q. You knew that at the time? - A. I knew that at the
   time, yes, sir. Can I add one thing there, sir?

Q. Yes. - A. I said, "Open the gates” but my thoughts at
   that stage and it is probably because my concentration
   was totally on C gate and the screen was on C gate,
   that although I am saying, "Open the gates" I still
   thought it was C gate and only C gate that was meant to
   be opened although I did say it in the plural. That,
   as I say, is probably my fault in that my concentration
   was totally on that gate, not on B gate which I
   couldn't see, or not on A gate but just on C gate.

Q. Do you know when A gate was opened, actually opened as
   opposed to the request to actually open it? - A. Time
   wise, no, sir.

Q. Do you know when the opening is in relation to C gate
   at all? - A. It was after C gate. It was certainly
   after C gate, yes.

Q. We know that C gate opened and shut again
   temporarily? - A. Yes.

Q.   Then it opened and stayed open a while? - A. Yes.

Q.    Then it shut and then    it reopened. Do you know whether
     A gate was opened while C gate was still open? - A. At
     the time I didn't know. I have subsequently learned.

Q.    No. - A. At the time, no. I understood that C gate   had
     closed and A gate had opened but I know now that is   not
     the case.

Q.   Pardon? - A. I know that is not the case now.

Q.    That is what you thought at the time? - A. I thought
     that at the time, yes, sir.

Q.    You did not see A gate open at all or did you? - A. You
     saw, as I say, looking on the screen you could see
     people coming in from the area of A gate, yes.

Q.    In addition to all these messages about gates and so
     on, did you get a message from PC Buxton? - A. I did,
     sir, yes.

Q. What was his message? - A. His message was in relation
   to the delaying of the kick-off.

Q.    Tell me then what the response was in relation to that?
     - A. As he said that and as his words were coming
     through, one of the teams came out. I know my reply
     was in relation to the fact, "It is too late. One of
     the teams is already on the field". It was the
     Liverpool team that ran out and came to the Leppings
     Lane end.

Q. You are quite certain in your mind that the team was
   actually coming on to the field as you said it? - A.
   Were running out, yes, sir.

Q. In fact that was your response, "It is too late"? - A.
   That was my response.

Q. I do not want you to take this as a criticism of you
   but in fact that was your response and not as a result
   of any order? - A. That was my response and not as a
   result of any order, sir, yes.

Q. It could have been countermanded, of course? - A. Of
   course.

Q. If somebody did want to? - A. Yes.

Q. Had you had any instructions with regard to match
   postponement? - A. No particular instructions but I was
   aware of the reasons, the general reasons, as to why
   matches would be delayed, kick-offs would be delayed,
   but that was in relation to matters, as I say, road
   accidents, motorway road accidents, weather conditions
   etc., that type of thing and nothing specific in
   relation to around the ground.

Q. Had that been discussed that day or was it just from
   general knowledge of previous occasions? - A. This was
   general knowledge of previous occasions.

at all about delaying kick-off? - A. I cannot, sir, no,
none at all, no.

You were dealing with this and you were sitting, of
course, looking forwards? - A. Forwards, yes.

How much of the Leppings Lane terrace could you see in
a normal sort of day? - A. Yes. You could see the
whole of the terrace but because of the fences at the
front it is a very slight angle so that basically you
could see the whole of pen 1 except the little bit that
was underneath you and then it went out at an angle so
that by the time you got to say pen 6 you would be
missing or you would be unable to seeprobably the
first five or six steps prior     to the fence.

You are saying part of pen 6, which was nearest to the
ground, was the bit that you could see least well? - A.
The part of pen 6 which was nearest to the North Stand
was the area I could see least well and it came down so
that when I got to pen 1, which is by me, you could see
that in total but because of the fences and the
structure of the fences and the angle we were sat at,
it got less and less. You could see less and less,
although as I say about seven steps.

On this day, 15th April 1989, at what point did you
yourself first notice anything unusual about the
pens? - A. The first point I noticed, the unusual part,
was when I saw people start climbing over the fences on
to the perimeter track and then I saw a gate open. I
don't know whether it had been opened but my first
thoughts were in relation to the climbing of fences and
then I saw people coming out on to the perimeter, not
in a flood but as a trickle. I thought, "We have got a
pitch invasion but why?". I couldn't understand as to
why.

Had the match kicked off by then or not? - A. I don't
know, sir. I just do not know, sir.

Had you noticed any particular surging within the
terraces at all? - A. No specific surging, no. I mean
they were swaying, yes, but that is the norm. I have
seen it, times many, at football at Leppings Lane,
certainly in the period I have worked there, yes.

Did you after the requests for the gates to be opened
and M r . Buxton's request to you look at the Leppings
Lane terraces at all? - A. I was all over, looking all
over.

Q. Did you notice anything unusual with regard to the
   distribution? - A. Not particularly.  The pen nearest
   to us, pen 1, was not as full as I would have
   anticipated but as you went down the line all you can
   then see is heads.

Q. How did pen 6 look to you? - A. As I say, all I could
   see of pen 6 was heads but it did appear to have less
   people in although I couldn't see directly into the pen
   because all you can see from my vantage point is in
   fact heads.

Q. X take it from what you said, and again I am not
   putting this in a critical way at all, that you did not
   say to anybody in the box "This looks unusual”? - A.
   No, not at all, sir. I knew there were people still
   coming into the ground at that time and if those people
   were still coming in, yes, that probably was my
   reasoning, rightly or wrongly. That was my reasoning
   as to why it was probably a bit lighter than it may
   have been.

Q. I did not ask you before but I will ask you now; it is
   right, is it not, that having given the order to open
   the pens no further orders were given as regards to any
   diversion of fans over the radio? - A. That is correct,
   yes.

Q. Have you any recollection of any discussion regarding
   that matter in the Control Room? - A. No, none at all,
   no.

Q. Having seen these people climb over after a little
   while you saw Superintendent Greenwood? - A. I saw Mr.
   Greenwood. It was fairly obvious he was trying to
   transmit and we were getting nothing from him and then
   I saw him and he was signalling. It came through then,
   "Stop the match, stop the match" and the next thing I
   saw Mr. Greenwood running on the field and obviously
   the game was stopped. I didn't see the game stopped
   but I just saw him going on to the field because by
   this time there were quite a lot of people, in fact
   many people, on the perimeter track and encroaching on
   the field.

Q. Was Chief Inspector McRobbie in your Control Box at any
   point? - A. He was, sir, yes. He was in civilian
   clothes and he had just joined us. He had just come to
   the Division or he had not been in the Division long.
   He came up into the box and I remember he was stood
   behind Mr. Murray for most of the time and when it
   started, when the people started coming over the

fences, there was a Police lady down on gate 1 who did
not appear to see them. I could not understand as to
why she wasn't seeing them and I commented on this
like, "If they are coming across put them in pen 1” and
it was Mr. McRobbie who said, "I'll go down and sort it
out" and he then left the box.

Q. When did the ACC come back, ACC Jackson? - A. I don't
   know, sir. Certainly some little while after this, but
   how long in time I just don't know, sir.

Q. Was it you who put the radio message out for the
   ambulance? - A. No, it wasn't me, sir. It was done on
   VHF by P.C. Bichard.

Q. I just want to go back   to 1988. - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were there then as   well? - A. I was there, yes.

Q. The only question Iwant to ask with regard to that is
   were you aware that in 1988 fans were diverted on the
   concourse area? - A. Not at all, no, sir.

Q. You were not aware of that? - A. Not at all, no.

               Cross-Examined by MR. ISAACS

Q. Sergeant Goddard, how long have you been the Sergeant
   in the Control Box operating at Hillsborough? - A. From
   1986 and I still do it now.

Q. So by 1989 you had had plenty of experience? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. How well do you know the Ground, that is the layout of
   the Ground? - A. I would suggest as well as any other
   Police Officer in South Yorkshire.

Q. So you knew, as you have told the Coroner, about the
   gates and where they were on the Leppings Lane end? -
   A. Yes, sir.

Q. And I expect you knew about the wall that went from
   behind the turnstiles up to the back of the West Stand?
   - A. Yes, I did, sir.
Q. And you would have to know   about these things because
   being the Sergeant who was   involved controlling
   serials, you would have to   know the layout so you could
   direct them from one place   to another if you needed to?
   - A. That is correct, yes,   sir.

Q. It also seems, if I may say so, that you had a pretty
   good relationship with the people who were normally in
   the Control Box, is that right? - A. Yes, it was a good
   working relationship.  It was a team, we worked as a
   team.
Q. Mr. Duckenfield was joining the team for the first time
   on that particular day for a big match, if I am not
   mistaken? - A. For a big match, yes, sir.

                                                 M.   GODDARD


Q. The team before that big match had been Mr. Murray, who
   was in control of the Control Box, is that right? - A.
   That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. Yourself, Mr. Ryan and Mr. Bichard? - A. That is
   correct, sir.

Q. I think you had been there even before Mr. Murray's
   time? - A. That is correct, yes, with Mr. Freeman.

Q. With Mr. Freeman? - A. Yes.

Q. I expect from time to time, and we have heard about it,
   Mr. Mole would be in the Control Box during certain
   games? - A.   When you say in the Control Box,   yes, he
   would visit   the Control Box but he was never   thereas a
   permanency in the Control Box.

Q. That is what we have understood. He took his role to
   be a roving commissioner? - A. Roving, yes.

Q. You certainly seem, from what you have told us about
   what happened in 1989, to have had the confidence of
   Mr. Murray, for example, in relation to being able to
   take certain decisions yourself? - A. Yes. As I said,
   it is a team, we work as a team. Bear in mind I know
   the area, not just at Hillsborough but around
   Hillsborough, far better than Mr. Murray did, so going
   away from the Ground, if certain things were happening
   I would be able to direct, and with all due respect to
   Mr. Murray some of the areas he probably would not
   know, whereas I knew them.
Q. If you felt   that as a result of a decision made byMr.
   Murray it was necessary to move men from one      placeto
   another, do I understand you to be saying that if Mr.
   Murray did not give that order and you thought it was
   necessary you would do it? - A. That is correct, sir,
   knowing full well obviously Mr. Murray could say, "No,
   I don't want that".

Q. Absolutely, and I get the impression, correct me if I
   am wrong, that your relationship with him was such that
   if you felt that there was something that needed doing,
   either you would    say to him, however you referred to
   him, "I think this needs doing", or you would do it
   yourself if you felt it was within your chain of
   responsibility? - A. Yes. If I thought there was
   something needed doing I would approach him first.   I
   would say, "What about so and so, do we need this, that
   or the other?", and he would say yes or no, but I would
   not do it straight off my own bat and then say, "Oh, I
   have done so and so", especially when we are talking
   directly at Hillsborough, I certainly would not do


                                 178

                                                M.   GODDARD


   that. The areas around Hillsborough I would certainly
   do that, as I outlined to you, because I knew the area
   better.

Q. Certainly if there was something within your area of
   responsibility and you felt it needed doing, you would
   not even need to refer to him? - A. I would not need to
   refer to him, but I think I would refer to him. Bear
   in mind that he is sat directly at the side of me.

Q. But by the same token, if you felt that something did
   need doing, whether it was in your direct sphere of
   responsibility or not, the fact that he had not
   mentioned it to you, or the fact that he perhaps had
   not thought of it, would not stop you from mentioning
   it if you thought it was necessary? - A. That is
   correct, sir.
Q. Your relationship was as good as that? - A. It was,
   yes.

Q. To be fair, having regard to the team approach, as far
   as you can say, and if you think you can t please tell
   us, but would the same apply to Mr. Ryan and Mr.
   Bichard? - A. Exactly, yes, sir.
Q. They had the confidence both of Mr. Murray and they had
   the confidence in themselves to be able to mention
   things if they felt it was worth mentioning? - A. Most
   definitely, yes.

Q. Thank you very much. 1988, you had effectively the
   same view of the Leppings Lane Terrace as you had in
   1989? - A. Correct, sir.

Q. There was nothing in what you saw that day in 1988 that
   gave you any cause for concern in relation to any
   possibility of overcrowding in the central pens? - A.
   Nothing at all, sir, no.

Q. Do you keep an eye on those pens? - A. Yes, sir, as
   well as the rest of the Ground.

Q. I assume that as you are looking"round the Ground if
   you see signs, either visually or through a monitor,
   that appear to suggest that an area is overcrowded, you
   would do something about it? - A. Yes, sir. I would
   certainly make mention of it to Mr. Murray, or I would
   certainly do something about it, yes.
Q. In 1989 we have not heard you tell us that you thought
   there was any sign of overcrowding on the Leppings Lane
   Terrace, prior to you seeing somebody come over a
   fence. Is the position that you didn't think that


                             179
                                                             98

                                                   M.   GODDARD


     there was any such overcrowding? - A. That is the
     position, yes, sir.

Q. I am very grateful.   Indeed, nobody, whether it be an
   Inspector or a Sergeant who was in the West Stand, or a
   Police Officer on the perimeter track, had suggested to
   Control that they felt there was any overcrowding? - A.
   That is correct, sir.

Q. Could I take you to the period between quarter-past-2
   and just after kick-off on 15th April, 1989, Sergeant?
   There are the three people who are on the three seats
   at the front of the Control Box, you, Mr. Murray, Mr.
   Ryan. Mr. Bichard is at the back, Mr. Duckenfield
   somewhere behind you.  I expect if you are looking
   forward you cannot see where he is? - A. I knew he was
   somewhere over my right shoulder, yes.

Q.    Certainly you have a recollection of him beingon the
     step next to Mr. Bichard? - A. Certainly, yes.

Q.    There was also, we understand, Mr. McRobbie there? - A.
     Yes.

Q. Would it be fair to say that even before any crisis
   things were pretty tight? - A. We had a full house,
   sir, yes. You can put Mr. Jackson in there as well so
   it was full, yes.

Q. I think Mr. Jackson was there and then he wasn't there,
   so we need not really trouble with him, I think, for
   the period that we are talking about. Your
   recollection is that it was about half-past-2 that Mr.
   Marshall radioed in for Leppings Lane to be closed? -
   A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Your view of this is that was an instruction on the
   part of Mr. Marshall because that was within his^
   operational responsibility? - A. Totally, yes, sir.

Q. At that stage, to you, was there any cause for concern
   about any aspect of the safety of the crowd?- A. Not at
   all. I was quite confident that okay, there is a big
   crowd there, but they would get in.
Q. Is this right, that from your point of view, thinking
   perhaps to yourself about it, you thought the crowd
   would get in that you could see? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Did you express that view to anybody else? - A. No, not
   at all, it was my own thoughts. I had heard, maybe
   before or after that, where Mr. Duckenfield had a
   conversation with Mr. Murray on those lines and Mr.
   Murray ....

Q. And Mr. Murray, I think we have heard said he thought
   that the crowd would get in? - A. Yes, he was quite
   confident the crowd would get in, yes.

Q. That as I understand it, and can you confirm this,
   appeared to be just a matter of routine, the sort of
   thing that would pass between people in the Control Box
   - "Do you think they will get in? , and the response
   was, "Yes, I think that's right"? - A. That was my
   understanding of it, yes.

Q. With your experience of these matters you agreed with
   that? - A. Yes, most definitely.

Q. From what you are telling us, keeping that to yourself?
   - A. Yes.

Q. You have told us about the radio breaking down and the
   length of time that caused actual disruption being off
   the air. We have heard, would you agree with this,
   that the effect so far as disruption is concerned goes
   far further than merely the time that you were off the
   air. Is that your understanding, your recollection? -
   A. Yes, most definitely. Okay, we may be off the air
   for just a couple of minutes but it is an ongoing
   thing, and you get basically of messages wanting to
   send, and coming in.

Q. You are the man who was in charge of the radio
   communications in terms of sending the messages and
   receiving them to a degree. How desperately did that
   effect what was happening in the Control Box at that
   time? - A. It affected u s    it was devastating
   basically. It was something that quite honestly we had
   never been used to, this going down at a particular
   time as it did, with so much going on, so much going on
   that it seemed like, I know I said two minutes, it
   seemed like hours before we got back into radio
   communication, and there was so much needed to be done
   and said.

Q. It also seems to have had the effect of diverting
   attention as well, away from what may have been
   happening outside Leppings Lane to moving around inside
   the Control Box, people getting up, people moving back.
   Is that the position? - A. That was the position, yes,
   sir.

Q. Is this also right, that it appeared that the situation
   outside Leppings Lane, outside the turnstiles, from
   before the radio went down to the situation as it
   turned out after communication came back on, that
   situation had changed quite dramatically from what
   appeared to be public order but something that Mr.

     jMarshall was felt to be able to cope with, to a
     crisis? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   Is that fair? - A. I think so, yes.

Q.   I am sure, Sergeant, that at the time when this vas
     happening you were not thinking, 'I'va got to try and
     remember all of this'. It was something that was just
     happening a-:id seeded to be a crisis situation? - A. It
     was a crisis situation, a.ni it was something that I
     didn't think, 'Oh, I've got to remember all this'. It
     was just that things were happening and, 'Gat started
     as soon as we can'.

Q.   There is a message, you say possibly a second, that
     comas from Mr. Marshall asking for the gates to be
     opened, that is the first of a series of messages as I
     understand your avidanca, is that correct? This is
     before we get to the one which actually leads to
     anything? - A. Yas sir.

Q.   Your recollection is that shortly after that, possibly
     within seconds, the gate that is being shown on tha
     monitor has burst opan, some fans have come in but
     then the situation is retrieved, is that correct? - A.
     That is correct, yes.
Q.   Does it appear to you at that time that that crisis,
     the opening the gate crisis, at that stage has been
     resolved? - A. Partially resolved, yas sir, with the
     numbers that came in, but knowing that there were
     obviously quite a few people outside, or quite a lot
     of people outside, I didn't sae it from start to end,
     I didn't see the numbers coming in from start to end.

Q.   That is right. The message that came at that time,
      before that first opening of the gate, however it
      opened, when it came from Mr. Marshall, can you
      remember whether it made any reference to life or not,
      or was just a request for the gate to be opened? - A.
      That I cannot say, sir, I don't know.
Q.   Very well,    but then I think you have told us it was a
      matter of   minutes until you say the third request
      came, and   that request was couched in the words of a
      demand? -   A. That was a demand, yes.
Q.   This time you have no doubt, I am sure, that the risk
      to life was vary clearly mentioned? - A. That was most
      definite, yas sir.

Q.   "People are going to be killed"? - A. "People ara
      going to be killed".

7ould it be fair to say that the atmosphere at that
time in the Control Room was electric? - A. It would
be, yes sir.

anybody else, would that be fair? - A. That would
fair, yes sir.

'.’a :nov, Hr. Goddard, that no order was given by
anybody, ur. Duclcenf ield, Hr. Murray and you have said
yb'irsaif, to send a serial of men to divert fans away
 fron the central tunnel. Had you thought that was
necessary, would you (a) have suggested it to
somebody? - A. Yes, most definitely.
Uad you thought - and I am not suggesting for a moment
you nad the duty to do this but I want to investigate
what you as an experienced and competent Control Tloom
Officer thought at the time, do you follow me? - A.
Ye;
I!a*I you thought there was any ris-c to anybody in^ Pens
3 n vi i as a result of people being allowed in through
fie ;;ate, would you have done something about it? - A.
Yas sir. Had I believed there would have been risk,
oivio.isly I would have done something about it.

Is tie position this, that everybody's concentration
vas focused on the need, voiced oy Mr. Marshall, to
save the lives of those outside the Leppings Lana
turnstiles? - A. Yes, concentration was total on that
aspect, yes sir.

As I understand your evidence, after the order vras
given to open the gates, people could be 3een to come
into the concourse area and the situation outside Gate
C seemed to be relieved? — A. From the camera there is
only part of the area outside the ground that you can
see. Up to the turnstiles, an area between the
turnstiles and the gate 3 at the start of the ground,
you cannot 3ee that because of the turnstiles coming
in. Beyond that obviously you can see. So when you
talk about relieving injuries you cannot really see
that at all because it is totally obscured from your
vision.                       183

You could sea them coning into the concourse area? -
A. Yes, you could see then coming into the concourse
vhen Gate C was opened, yes.

Of course, your view on the monitor -  and it is only a
monitor view that you have got - does   not show any
more of the concourse than just that area just behind
the turnstiles and next to Gate C? - A. Yes, that is
correct.

You have told us that you, of all those in the Control-
Room, had the greatest experience of the ground since
1936? - A. That is correct, yas sir.

You knew what the state of the terraces vas. Do I
take it tnat you did not tie in in your mind the link
between Gate C and the tunnel? - A. That is correct, I
didn’t.

After people had started to dome in, it could be said,
"Uall, they had to go somewhere those people”. Did
you feel they were going to ma'.ce their way onto the
terraces where there was space? - A. r’hen they came
onto the concourse, obviously they had the option of
whare they wanted to go and they could have taken any
option that they wished, yes. So they would go into
the areas where there was space, yes sir.

With your knowledge of the ground, with your
experience, had you considered that they would, or the
majority of them would, go down the central tunnel and
had you considered that the area in the terraces in
the central pens was too full, if those things had
gone through your mind would you have done something
about it, told somebody or done something? - A. If
those things had gone through my mind, there is no way
would anyone have gone down the central tunnel.

But I am putting these things to you in hindsight, of
course? - A. Exactly, ye3.

At the time your attention, and so far as you could
tell the attention of those in the Control Box, was
focused on the saving of lives outside? - A. Yes.

Then, of course, everybody's attention was diverted to
Gate A and the opening there? - A. That is correct,
yes.

Is it also right to say that whilst this was going on
you had some concern for what may be happening on the
Spion Kop where there had been some difficulty in the
previous year? - A. Yas, that is quite correct, but
the Kop was totally secondary. The ICop was totally
                                                            103

                                                   H.   GODDARD


      secondary, yes. Thera had been problems the year
      before but in relation to the tine 3 pent: between ends,
      the Xop was hardly touched, sir.

Q.   I just want to ask you about one or two other matters,
     just about, first of all, delaying the kick-off. You
     said to the Coroner that you recollect, though not on
     that day, conversations as to why kick-off would be
     delayed - road accidents, weather conditions, nothing
     specific as to natters happening around the ground.
     That, I assume, was conversation that you had heard
     when Ur. Hole was in charge? - A. That is correct, yes
     sir.

Q.   But a3 I understand the position - and could you help
     us as to your view of this - appreciating that, of
     course, you would not be the one to make such a
     decision, if safety were a consideration in the
     context of the delay of the kick-off, then obviously
     delay would not be ruled out merely because, for
     example, there had bean no road accidents, the weather
     was good, or anything like that? - A. That is correct.

Q. Just one final matter. You have talked about the team
    work in the Control 3ox and we know from other
    witnesses something of the chain of command in the
    Control 3ox, but so far as command of the Control Box
    on that day was concerned, I think Mr. Murray was in
    command and Mr. Duckenfield was in overall control of
    the whole event? - A. That is correct, yes.

          HR. ISAACS: I am very grateful, thank you very
     much indeed, Sergeant.

                Cross-Examined by MR. MASKING;

Q.   Sergeant Goddard, your knowledge, of course, of the
     Control Box goes back far more than most other
     people's because of your length of service there, but
     you have talked about there being a team within the
     Control Box. It is also right to say that the ability
     of the Control Box team to work efficiently depends
     upon the team that is generally available around the
     ground as well? - A. Yes, that is right.

Q.   Is it right to say that in the same way that you do
     your duty on a week-in-week-out basis, so do the
     colleagues that you had in the Control Box at that
     time? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q.   Particularly the four of you, starting with
      Superintendent Murray but going through PC Ryan and PC
      Bichard? - A. That is right, yes.

                                  185
                                                              104

                                                     M.   GODDARD


        It is right as well that that community spirit was
        extended into other key areas of the ground, so that
B       if, for example, you looked down onto the Leapings
        Lane perimeter track on an ordinary day you would
        expect to 3 ae the 3 ame face? - A. Yes, exactly, that
        is correct, sir.

        The Officers down there would be the same Officers on
        a week-in-week-out basis? - A. Yes.

        Tell me this Sergeant.  It may be a statement of the
        obvious, but why did you not actually go to the
        briefing by the Chief Superintendent? - A. 3ecause I
        had read the briefing notes, sir, prior to that and if
        I was going to be required, what I needed to know was
        discussed with me by Mr. Murray, by the
        Superintendent, and the briefing by the Chief
        Superintendent, Mr. Duckenfield, was a total briefing
        in relation to duties for everyone. Now I had already
        read the Order and I knew what Mr. Murray wanted of me
D       and expected of me, and that is one of the reasons why
        I didn't 30 to the briefing.  It was not required.

        Was the briefing superfluous so far as you were
        concerned, Sergeant, because you knew what you had to
        do? - A. I knew what the briefing would contain, sir,
        yes.
    nM ' You knew what you had to do because you were doing it
        week-in week-out, match-in match-out? ~ A. Yes sir.

        The only difference was that this was a semi-final
        with a very much larger crowd than you would
        ordinarily get at a League match? - A. Yes sir.




                                  /Q.   So far as the plan


                                    186

                                                                   -me

                                                    h   .   Go d d a r d


O. So far as the plan was concerned, you have said you read
   it through, did you recognise the contents of it? - A.
   Yes, the content did not really vary from the first semi­
   final I did in 1987.

Q. That was the Mole plan? - A. The Mole plan, yes.

0. The Mole plan had been adopted and re-adopted with some
   modifications, but the ethos of it was the same? - A.
   Yes.

0. So far as the Sector Commanders were concerned, the
   Superintendents who had jobs to do, they were
   Superintendent Murray in the Control Box, Superintendent
   Marshall outside the ground - a man known to you? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. A man who worked regularly outside the ground, great
   experience in policing football matches, knowing what was
   to be done outside the ground and a man who was, when the
   Chief Superintendent wasn't there, the
   second-in-command and took over? - A. That is correct,
   sir.

Q. Inside the ground Superintendent Greenwood, a man who I
   think in the twelve months previously had not worked the
   Division but who had in previous years had a lot of
   experience? - A. Very much so, yes, sir.

0. At the other end of the ground, Superintendent Chap‘tnan,
   also a very experienced man? - A. Yes, sir.

0. You knew all of them? - A. I knew all of them.

0. You knew what they were to do, and they knew what they
   were to do, so far as you were aware? - A. That is
   correct, sir.

0. Then down the ranks, Chief Inspectors, Inspectors,
   Sergeants and including the PCs on the community PC
   basis, men all known to you for the most part - obviously
   extra men drafted in from other parts of South Yorkshire,
   but in the key positions men who were known to you, who
   had done their jobs and knew what their jobs were? - A.
   That is correct, sir.

Q. Your job was to link all of that together? - A. Yes,
   collate all that.

Q. Collate that, receive messages from them and give
   messages out in other places.   The key to all that, the
   vital part of your being able to do your job was to have
   a radio working? -A. That is correct, sir.

                                                   M. GODDARD


Q. Uithout the radio your particular job was almost
   impossible, wasn't it, unless you got semaphore flags
   out? - A. Yes.

0. You have been described, and I hope you will accept it,
   Sergeant, that you are a very reactive person.   Do you
   understand what that means? - A. I understand what that
   means.

0. Something happens, Sergeant Goddard reacts to it straight
   away, and that is born out of years of experience, of
   reacting to those situations? - A. I believe so, yes,
   sir.

0. t7e have talked about the team, but we are also aware of
   the hierarchy of Police Officers.    You are a Sergeant,
   but there is a Constable a rank below you, but a
   Superintendent, of course, is considerably above you.
   Would it be right to say that so far as the team in the
   Control Box is concerned it is very much a team and for
   the most part does not depend upon rank as such? - A. I
   would agree to an extent on that.    Obviously there is a
   certain part where rank does come in.    Someone has got
   to be a Commander.    You have got to have a Commander.

0. There comes a time when a decision has got to be made? -
   A. Yes.

Q« Those decisions for the most part in Control are taken by
   the Control Commander, Superintendent Murray in this
   instance? - A. That is right, sir.

0. But there are those decisions which need to be made by
   the overall Commander, whether it is Mr. Mole around
   wherever he was, or on this occasion, Mr. Duckenfield who
   was actually standing there? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Uhat I am establishing if you like is the finesse beyond
   the question asked of Mr. Isaacs.   In other words, you
   would not have felt that if there was a point to make,
   "Hang on a minute, I am only a Sergeant and the fellow to
   my left is a Superintendent, I had better not stick my
   oar in."    It would not be like that, Sergeant? - A. It
   is not like that, sir.

Q. So, for example, if we can take a specific point, you
   heard Superintendent Murray and Chief Superintendent
   Duckenfield looking at the monitor and the crowd outside,
   which you had looked at yourself at around 2.30.    You
   had reached a decision that those people could get into
   the ground on time? - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

                                                  M.   GODDARD


When you heard them talking Mr. Murray said to
Mr. Duckenfield, "I think we will get them in all right
for three o'clock"? - A. Yes.

If you had thought they were wrong, notwithstanding     you
being a Sergeant and they being Superintendents and     Chief
Superintendents, you would have said to Mr. Murray,     "You
know, Mr. Murray, I am not so sure we will get them     in"?
- A. I would have given my impression.

You would have given your impression. Again I am not
suggesting you could have made that order, not at all,
but as a Sergeant who had been there far longer than
anybody else, your comments, your views, would have been

  .
weighed in the balance of things? - A. I certainly hope
so

That was the sort of relationship you had with the senior
Officers in Control? - A. Yes.

     MR. MANNING:    Sir, I am not towards the end of my
cross-examination.

      THE CORONER:   But you have reached a break?

      MR. MANNING:   I have reached a convenient point.

      THE CORONER:   Ok. In that case, in view of the
time, we will stop.    Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow at
9.30.    I have already warned you that we are going to
take tomorrow as a full day, but no Saturday.

     MR. MANNING: I may be making a plea for more than
myself, sir, but if it is 9.30 and a full day it becomes
a very full day. In other words, if it is a full day it
would ordinarily have been a ten o'clock start.   I am
very happy to start at 9.30 with the hope and prospect
that we will get something of a reduction at the other
end, but I think it would be an impossible burden...

      THE CORONER:   Maybe, we will see how we do.

      MR. MANNING:   But you want a 9.30 start?

     THE CORONER:   I want a 9.30 start, please.   I did
tell you that if need be next week we will be doing 9.30
starts as a matter of routine, but I will tell you
exactly what time we are staring on Monday tomorrow.

     Sergeant Goddard, please be here at 9.30.    You are
in the witness and you are on oath.   You must not
discuss the evidence.   You know that, obviously.

     THE WITNESS:   Yes, sir.

                  MICHAEL GODDARD Recalled

          Cross-Examined by MR. MANNING (Continued)

Q. Mr. Goddard, since I have not got the transcript in front
   of me, perhaps let me spend thirty seconds just finding
   out where we were.   We had established, Sergeant, that
   within the Control Box the numbers of people, that it was
   very much a team.   Although there was rank, obviously,
   amongst that team, nonetheless if somebody had seen
   something that was needed to be drawn to another's
   attention that, as part of the team, would be done
   automatically within it? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. You accepted that yourself had been experienced, you have
   been described as very reactive to any particular
   situation, that you knew there were men of considerable
   experience in Sector Commanders and down through the
   various Commanders down to the PCs who were doing the job
   week in, week out, knowing what they had to do, knowing
   what was expected of them? - A. That is correct.

Q. We had established that even though you were a Sergeant,
   that if one of the Superintendents had said something
   that you thought was perhaps not a correct assumption or
   not a correct assessment of the situation, you would have
   been prepared to have said, "I am not sure that is
   right ? -A. Yes, sir.

Q. My learned friend Mr. Isaacs helps me by what I think was
   the last answer, "If I had thought they were wrong I
   would given my own impression of it."   Can we look at
   the views on the monitor that you have in front of you,
   or more precisely, they are almost above you? - A. Above
   me, yes, sir.

Q. You have got to crane your neck? - A. Yes, you look back
   and up.

Q. That, of course, is one of the reasons why PC Bichard
   sits in the row behind because he has a more natural look
   of those monitors? - A. A direct view.

Q. I think it is right to say that the view on the monitors
   does not give the view of the turnstile wall itself?
   You cannot see people right up to that wall? - A. That is
   correct.
                                                    M.   GODDARD


Q. So when it was that Mr. Marshall said to you there was
   crushing at the front that was something you could not
   see? -A. That is correct, sir.

Q. When you looked at the monitor of what was going on what
   was going on in Leppings Lane it would be right to say
   that you could not, yourself, other than that there were
   people there, you could not see why he was asking in the
   first instance for the road to be closed? - A. That is
   correct.

Q. When he said to you ultimately that the gates needed to
   be opened, again you could not see at that time what it
   was that was in his mind, in his sight, to have caused
   that to be said? - A. That is also correct, sir.

Q. Of course, as we have established before, Superintendent
   Marshall was a very experienced Officer, second-in-
   command, effectively took command when the Commanding
   Officer wasn't there? - A. That is correct.

Q. Therefore, on that basis there was very great weight to
   be placed upon his statements? - A. Undoubtedly, yes,
   sir.

Q.    Insofar as the general watching is concerned, and now I
     go back a stage to come forwards, it is right that
     although 1988 had by common agreement been a very
     successful operation, that the one problem that had been
     noticed was the point on the Kop end between the two sets
     of supporters? - A. That is correct.

Q. When it came to the orders for 1989, one of the specific
   monitoring points was that Kop end? - A. That is correct.

Q. Indeed, it was considered to be so significant that one
   camera was trained on that particular position? -A. That
   is right.

Q. Can we now look at talk-through?   I do not think we need
   too much by way of technicality because we have all heard
   in general terms that it means everybody can hear what is
 . being said on the radio.   If 800 Officers were all
   talking on the radio that, of course, would be an
   impossibility? - A. That is correct.

Q. What it means is that messages have to be kept relatively
   short and that by and large they have to be kept to a
   relevant point? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Of course the relevance of the Control was not only in
   relation to what was going on inside the ground, but also
   immediately outside the ground and then in the environs
   of the ground? - A. That is correct, sir.


                             194
                                                    M.   GODDARD


Q. Whilst it may not have been as relevant at say quarter to
   three, from twelve o'clock onwards you were getting
   reports on the radio from people in the environs about
   problems and disturbances at public houses with
   householders complaining about people urinating?    All
   these sort of things were happening the area were coming
   through Control as well? - A. Yes, that is correct.

Q. By and large it is right to say that the talk-through
   mode is the mode adopted by most Police Forces for this
   sort of situation? - A. That is correct.

Q. It was not something particularly innovative so far as
   South Yorkshire is concerned? - A. No, not at all.

Q. Although one may have some doubts about its success and
   particularly on this day, may I just suggest to you three
   instances where talk-through clearly saved the necessity
   of you having to send out another message as a result of
   hearing or receiving a message?   The first was that a
   message was received from the front for PC Buxton to go
   with the Land Rover? - A. To Leppings Lane, that is
   correct, sir.

Q. It is right, isn't it, that without you having to send
   that message to PC Buxton wherever he was, that PC Buxton
   actually radioed in and said, "I am on ray way"? - A. Yes,
   he responded immediately.
Q. The second one was in fact in relation to the monitoring
   of conversations by the civilian engineer.   You would
   have had to have called him up when you received the
   information that the radio was down, or was breaking up,
   but in fact you had an opportunity to do so he had
   already crossed from wherever he was and got to your
   Control Room because he too had heard it on talk-over? -
   A. that is correct.
Q. The third one, just yet another very different is the
   Inspector Sewell situation, where a request was made for
   Serials to go to the Leppings Lane turnstiles.   This was
   part of, if one may say, the rescue attempt.   In other
   words, the attempt...

          THE CORONER:   I do not really think it matters what
     it was for and I am not sure whether it is relevant to
     give all of the examples, but if you want to give the
     example, fair enough, but not the reasoning.

Q.        MR. MANNING: Is it right, Sergeant, that Inspector
     Sewell, without your having to put a message through, he
     went immediately on to the air and said he had spare
     Serials and that he would despatch them? - A. That is

In terms of the breakdown of the radio, would you agree
with me that that had a calamitous effect insofar as your
ability to operate is concerned? - A. Yes, exactly.
Yes, sir.

And that that was compounded by the actual physical
disruption that came from (a) not being able to
immediately have one microphone changed for another
microphone and that still did not work and (b) then
having to get up from your seat and having a man crawling
under the table trying to fix wires, pull out a spare
system and get it all up and going again? - A. Yes, it
was certainly disruptive.   Most disruptive.

                                                      M. GODDARD


Q. That was at a time that was critical to the general
   running of the whole operation? - A- Yes, sir.

Q. Is it right to say that the knock on effect of that is
   that people who axe trying to pass messages through to
   you are not able to do so? - A- That is correct.

Q. So they begin to queue up for the ability to get on to
   the air? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. In doing that, if you pause for a moment or   even pause
   momentarily to take a breath, it might give   somebody
   else the opportunity to come in on that air   wave and to
   take over the message so that you might get   the mumbo
   jumbo of one person talking and getting the   phrase in
   and somebody else coming in and getting the   next one? -
   A. Yes, that is absolutely correct, yes.

Q. We were not there, Sergeant, you were. Perhaps what
   you take as normal we need to understand so far as the
   difficulties and major problems you were experiencing
   on that day? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. The one difference between what you had before when it
   was working and what you were left with after the
   engineer had finished was that you then had no override
   feature? - A. That is correct.

Q. How important is that, Sergeant? - A. It is most
   important- You cure trying to keep messages down to a
   minimum or the length of messages down to a relative
   minimum. Everyone knows that but unfortunately it does
   happen that people do on occasions tend to ramble on
   when we could stop them. With the sets being down we
   could not stop them at all.

Q. You could not in any way gain priority for something
   which you might know is more urgent than somebody1s
   message? - A. Yes, that is correct, sir.

Q. Can I now turn to look at another topic and that is the
   pens. You said that you always have a general look
   around the ground from where you cure sitting? - A. That
   is correct, yes.

Q. It is right to say, and the Jury have been there as
   have all of we, that the straight view ahead of you is
   in fact along the Leppings Lane terrace, along the West
   Stand. That is more or less in front of the Control
   Box as you look straight out of the window? - A. Yes,
   to look from my position directly out of the window you
   would be looking along the perimeter track more so,
   directly along Leppings Lane.
                                                                6
                                                       M. GODDARD



Q. You said that at 2.15 you had looked through those
   windows and there was nothing to draw your attention to
   any problems? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. You said that at 2.30 PC Bichard drew your attention
   and may I first of all put to you, Sergeant, that is
   again an example of the team work. He had seen
   something and he drew your attention to it? - A. That
   is correct, sir, yes.

Q. Your evidence to the Inquest is very simple; you never
   saw anything unusual in that Leppings Lane terrace in
   the pens there until you saw the people climbing over
   around three o'clock? - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. I wonder having said the negative, Sergeant, I wonder
   if you can help us with signs of normality that you may
   have seen. Did you at any time see people climb on to
   the barriers and then dive off them again? - A. Not
   climb on to barriers and dive.   No, I did not see that.

Q.    Did you see     swaying in the crowd? - A.There was
     movement in the crowd, yes.

Q.    Did you see     a beach ball? - A.Yes,  itwas being
     knocked around within the central pens, yes.

Q. Is that in your experience something which displays
   normality in people? - A. Most definitely, yes, sir.

Q. Did you see at all people punching the air to either
   acknowledge or applaud the teams when they were being
   announced? Do you remember seeing that at all? - A.
   Not particularly, no, sir.

Q. You have said that your view is principally along the
   perimeter track itself. That is the straight view. So
   far as the pens themselves cure concerned I am right in
   thinking that your view is partially obscured certainly
   at the front by the overhang of the perimeter fence? -
   A. That is correct, sir, yes.

Q. Would you agree with me, Sergeant, that the view in
   front of you is more easily ascertainable than the view
   at the distance? In other words, that you have a
   somewhat blurred view of pen 6? ~ A. Most definitely,
   yes, sir.

Q. Could I invite you to have a look at a couple of
   photographs please? These cure photographs we have seen
   before, 490 and 449 from 1989. That is No. C.490.   490
   is the view not quite of what you are going to get from


                                10*
                                                          M. GODDARD


       the Control Box because it is more straight on to the
       pens whereas you cure more looking down the fence but
       not dissimilar to the view you are getting. Would you
B      agree? - A. Yes, I would agree. Obviously we are a
       little bit further to the right and so the front part
       we just cannot see.

    Q. We cure looking there across numerically upwards, in
       other words, 1 and 2 in front     ofyou and lookingdown
       towards pen 6? - A. Yes, that is correct, sir.

    Q. That in 1988 is said to be an even distribution of the
       crowd across the whole terrace with all the sections of
       the terrace being more or less equally filled? - A.
       Yes.

    Q. Would you now look at the second photograph, Sergeant,
       which is C.449? That again is looking across.   It is
       obviously a slightly different angle and probably
       slightly different again from what you would be seeing
       but can you cast your eye across there and look towards
       pen 6 again? - A. Yes, I can, sir.

    Q. Can you see any obvious difference between what you saw
       on that earlier photograph - and keep your finger in
       490 - looking at pen 6 from what you can see there
       looking at pen 6? - A. No, I can’t, sir.

    Q. Of course, 449 was taken in the disaster match and we
       now know that pen 6 was an area where there was an
       awful lot of space? - A. Yes, that is correct, sir.

    Q. That is not something in any way that you could.    - A.
       That I couldn't see, no.

    Q. My learned friend, Mr. Isaacs, put to you yesterday and
       I put to you again, Sergeant, just to get the picture,
       that you accept part of your Control Room duty is to
       monitor the ground as a whole? - A. Yes.

    Q. Obviously, therefore, the pens and the Leppings Lane
       terrace is part of that ground? - A. That is part and
       parcel of it, yes, sir.

    Q. Again when you accept part of that responsibility it is
       fair to say that that is a team effort? - A. That is
       correct, yes.

    Q. You have said you are the recipients and conveyors of
       pieces of information from all sorts of sources and so
       far as the Leppings Lane terraces cure concerned we have
       the serials in the West Terrace, the serials of the
       Community Officers on the perimeter and any other

                                   109
                                                                8
                                                       M. GODDARD


   Officers all of whom could feed information in to
   you? - A- That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. In the monitoring process is it right that PC Bichard
   spotted and brought to your attention a Police horse
   that was apparently outside on the Leppings Lane
   entrances and appeared to be at that time surrounded by
   a crowd? - A- That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. As a result of that did you completely off your own
   bat, being reactive to that situation, send a message
   to Sergeant Soresby to send any spare mounted Officers
   round to the Leppings Lane entrance? - A. I don't know
   about that. I just cannot remember on that. I know
   that mounted were sent but whether it was in relation
   to that particular incident I do not know. I cannot
   say, sir.




                            /Q. Did you know in general.

              Q. Did you know in general terms, Sergeant, that the
                 Leppings Lane Terrace had all of its radial gates
                 locked open? - A. They were open, yes.

              Q. And that the terrace was treated, so far as the Police
          B      were concerned, as one unit ....

                        THE CORONER:   We have had this. That is
                   precisely what I don't want to do, Mr. Manning, it is
                   unnecessary.  I want to take evidence on what this
                   Officer did, saw and heard, insofar as it is relevant,
                   and insofar as it is applicable to your client.

              Q.        MR. MANNING:   You knew that people generally, or
                   some people generally preferred to take a position
                   behind the goal, is that your experience? - A. Yes,
                   that is correct, sir.

              Q. That the part behind the goal tended to have people in
                 more quickly than the parts at the side? - A. Yes.

              Q. But that the North West Terrace was also a popular
                 viewing spot?- A. That is correct as well, yes, sir.

              Q. You knew that in 1988 in the essence of the "Mole" plan
                 that the crowd had spread across the terrace in a
                 successful way? - A. That is correct, yes.

              Q. Did you believe that Hillsborough was a well policed
                 Ground and that the South Yorkshire Police was a good
                 Force in relation to its policing policy of football? -
                 A. Most definitely, yes, sir.

              Q. I have suggested to you that you could not see the wall
                 of the turnstiles, and the reasons why we had to look
                 particularly at Mr. Marshall as being the experienced
                 Officer on the spot, but it is right, isn't it, that
                 when Mr. Marshall made his request for Gate C, or for
                 the gates, to be opened that P.C. Bichard then zeroed
                 in on or concentrated his camera on Gate C? - A. That
                 is correct, yes.

              Q. At that time, having brought his camera to bear there,
                 he said either, "The gate s gone", or "The gate's
                 burst", something to that effect? - A. Something was
                 said, whether it was P.C. Bichard that said that I
                 don't know, but something was said, "The gate's gone",
                 "The gate's burst".

              Q. And by that time you had caused tannoy messages to be
                 sent over the tannoy outside the Leppings Lane
                 turnstiles?

                                                    M.   GODDARD


          THE CORONER:   That is not right.    He did not
     operate the tannoy.

          MR. MANNING:   I did not say that.    I said, "You
     had caused ....".

          THE CORONER:   Sorry, I misunderstood you.     Let's
     see whether he had caused it.

Q.        MR. MANNING:   Had you? - A. Mr. Murray had,
     certainly, yes.

Q. Had you heard that? - A. I had heard P.C. Ryan on the
   tannoy, yes.

Q. Thank you very much, that helps. You had sent the
   mounted Police and the reserve serials? - A. Yes.

Q. And the words, and we have established it already, from
   Mr. Marshall were, "Open the gates or people will get
   killed"? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. Had you in your experience, Sergeant, ever come across
   a situation like that? - A. Not at all, sir, no.

Q. Would you accept the words that have been used, unique
   and unprecedented? - A. I would.

Q. And you used the word already that it was a demand? -
   A. Yes, most definitely, yes, sir.

Q. Did you form the view that there was any time then for
   delay? Of course, I am talking about the third
   message, if you like, the "demand" message. Was there
   any time then to delay making that decision? - A. There
   was no time, none at all, sir, no.

Q. In your view, Sergeant, was there any alternative but
   to accede to that request/demand? - A. None whatsoever,
   sir, no.

Q. Is it right to say that you had to display intense
   concentration upon that decision in an effort to save
   lives? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Is it right to say that in the tremendous pressure to
   take that course of action you were intent upon saving
   lives, and nothing else was obvious toyou at that time
   except to save lives? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You were watching the monitor of people coming through
   Gate C at the time that Sergeant Higgins then requested
   the opening of Gate A? - A. I would have been, yes,
   sir.

                               202

                                                    M.   GODDARD


Q. Is it right then that the camera then moved via P.C.
   Bichard to show a shot of Gate A? - A. Yes, it lifted
   up to go to "A", yes.

Q. Is it right, Sergeant, that you did not form any link
   or risk so far as you were concerned of the people who
   were already standing on the terraces as a result of
   the opening of the gates? - A. That is correct.

Q. You have said that when the fans got onto the concourse
   you believed that there were a number of options, both
   as to what they would then do at that moment in time,
   and then where they would go? - A. Where they would go,
   yes, sir.

Q.   And you have said, I remind you, Sergeant, that you
     believe that there is probably nobody who has got a
     better knowledge of the Ground than you? - A. That is
     correct, sir.

Q. But you, even with that expert knowledge, did not think
   of any link between Gate C and the tunnel? - A. None
   whatsoever, no, sir.

Q. Does it follow from that, Sergeant, that if you had
   considered that there was any risk, whether in relation
   to the tunnel or indeed to any other aspect of safety,
   and particularly bearing in mind that the action had
   been taken to try and save injuries occurring or even
   the loss of the life, that in those circumstances you
   would have taken all action that you could have
   considered necessary? - A. All possible action would
   have been taken, yes, sir.

Q. Thank you very much indeed, Sergeant.
          MR. KING:   Sir, can I say I don't intend to be as
     long as I have been with a number of witnesses on these
     matters.
          THE CORONER:   I am pleased to hear it.

          MR. KING:   Can I say, sir, if I omit to put to a
     witness that this is not accepted on behalf of my
     clients, that should not be inferred as a concession
     that it is, if you understand me.

          THE CORONER:   Yes, of course.
          MR. KING:   I am mindful, sir, of your indication
     to get on with matters.

                Cross-Examined by MR. KING

Q. Sergeant Goddard, can I first of all go to the opening
   of the gates? The first message came through and you
   believed the first message only concerned Gate C, that
   is right, isn't it? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Because of that, was that your process of reasoning,
   therefore, that because it only applied to Gate C, when
   not long after that first request had been made you saw
   it open and shut for 20 seconds and a few people came
   through, you thought that was the end of the matter,
   was that your reasoning? - A. Not necessarily the end
   of the matter, but it had alleviated —   it had
   required what Mr. Marshall wanted, that had been done,
   yes.
Q. Because you believed he wanted just one gate opened? -
   A. That was my belief, yes.

Q. Of course, if you had believed he wanted three gates
   opening the same process of reasoning could not have
   applied to you, could it? - A. Exactly.

Q. You would agree with that? - A. Yes.
Q. Secondly, you say, I think, there were three messages,
   I think that is your recollection? - A. That is my
   recollection, yes, sir.

Q. We have dealt with the first one; following the first
   one, opening and shutting of Gate C. The second
   message comes through; you don't get a decision
   straight away after the second message from Mr.
   Duckenfield, do you? - A. Not straight away, no, but by
   that time, of course, the third one had come.

Q. I am going to deal with the difference between the
   second and the third. Between the second and the third
   there was, wasn't there, discussion going on within the
   Box as to whether or not to open the gates? - A. I
   believe there was some form of discussion going on as
   to that, yes,, sir.
Q. And that discussion would involve Mr. Duckenfield? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And Mr. Murray? - A. And Mr. Murray.

Q. In that discussion did anybody voice this question:
   where does Gate C lead to? - A. Not that I am aware of,
   sir, no.

Q. The video camera, of course, was concentrated on Gate
   C, wasn't it? - A. That is right, yes.

Q. At the time this discussion was going on? - A. Yes.

Q. And outside Gate C you could see a large crowd of
   people? - A. No. You can't see it because of the wall,
   the gate.

Q. I won't argue because it is a matter of evidence and
   there is video ....

        THE CORONER: •• I think there is a
   misunderstanding.   I think Sergeant Goddard means he
   can't see exactly outside the gate.

Q. That is what you are saying, isn't it, you can't see
   precisely outside the gate? - A. No, no way.

       MR. KING:   Let me put it this way, because I am
  mindful about not arguing about what is right, what is
  wrong - that is for the Jury, not me:

Q. You knew there was a large number of people outside
   that area, put it like that? - A. I did, yes, sir.

Q. Putting it simply, if Gate C was opened it was obvious
   that a large number of people were going to come in? -
   A. Yes.




                      /Q. So I go back .

Q.   So.I go back. During that discussion which you have
     told us about, no one asked you, "Where does that gate
     lead to?" that is right? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q.   Of course, you were well versed with the ground, were
     you not? - A. Yes.

Q.   If you had been asked the question, say by Mr.
     Duckenfield who did not know the ground, "Where does
     that gate lead to?" you could have told him, could you
     not? - A. I would have done, yes.

Q.   If you had turned your mind to it, and I accept it
     appears you did not but if you had turned your mind to
     it, you could have been able to say, "Well, Gate C
     leads to outside turnstiles A to G, turnstiles A to G
     is where the Leppings Lane fans come into the terraces
     and it leads onto the concourse where there is a big
     tunnel", you would have known that? - A. I would have
     known that. It obviously leads onto the concourse,
     yes, but it just does not lead to the tunnel. We have
     got the options. Once we are in the concourse, we
     then have the options of going where we want to go.

Q.   Mr. Goddard, I appreciate what you say about options
     of people coming in in ones and twos. I just want to
     ask you questions about what you knew, what answer you
     would be able to. give as to where it led on to. You
     would know, would you not, from your intimate
     knowledge of the ground that that part of the
     concourse immediately on the other side of turnstiles
     A to G was the way in which people going onto the
     terraces that day were going to come? You knew that?
     - A. Yes.

Q.   You would know, would you not, that immediately in
     front of you as you came through those turnstiles the
     main entrance open to you and visible to you as you
     came through was a big tunnel, you would know that? -
     A. Yes.

Q.   I will not take it any further with you as to what was
     obvious because that is a matter of argument, and I am
     not going to, but the fact is you could have supplied
     such information as had been requested of you in that
     discussion if anybody had asked you the question
     "Where does this gate lead to?"? - A. Yes sir.

Q.   If anybody had asked you the question, "Where is this
     large crowd of people likely to go once they are
     through?" if anybody had asked you that, that is again
     a question you could have turned your mind to? - A. I
     could have done, yes.
                                            M. GODDARD


But again no one asked you that question? - A. That
was not asked.

Then, of course, the gate was opened on the orders of
Mr. Duckenfield? - A. That is correct, yes.

I want to clarify, if I may, the time gap between the
order to open Gate C and it being opened, which we
know was at 2.52, and your recollection, not based on
what people have told you but your recollection, of
when the request for Gate A came through. Is it not
right, first of all, that your recollection was that
it was something like three or four minutes after, I
shall call it the official opening of Gate C, that the
request came through from the person we know to be
Sergeant Higgins, requesting Gate A to be opened? - A.
There was a request from Sergeant Higgins. What
period of time went by between the C gate opening and
the request for A gate to be opened, I do not know,
but I would not suggest to you that it was three to
four minutes. I would think it was less than that.

That is what you are saying now, but let me
investigate it a bit further. First of all you
thought, did you not, originally, your original
recollection, that by the time Gate A was opened, Gate
C had been closed after its opening? - A. That was my
original idea, yes.

We know that Gate C was opened at 2.52, and we know
that Gate C was closed at 2.57, just after, some five
minutes later - all right? - A. Yes.

On that recollection that by the time Gate A was
opened Gate C had been closed, it would put the
opening of Gate A on that about five minutes after the
official opening of Gate C, would it not? - A. Had my
initial thoughts been correct, yes, that would have
been right.

Your official thought may be correct to this extent.
You clearly had the view on that thought that there
was a substantial period of time between the official
opening of Gate C and the opening of Gate A. That
would fit in with that recollection, would it not? -
A. It would fit in with that recollection, yes.

Can I also suggest to you again that your original
thought was that it was three or four minutes, or it
might be less but three or four minutes, after the
opening of Gate C, the official opening, that this
request came through for Gate A? - A. That was my
original thought, yes.
                                                             16

                                                    M. GODDARD


Q.   So you accept that then? - A. Yes.

Q.   So your original recollection was (1) that Gate A was
     opened after Gate C had been closed and (2) that the
     request for Gate A was something like three or four
     minutes later? - A. A period like that, yes.

Q.   Of course, if that is right, there was during the
     period Gate C was opened between 2.52 and 2.57 no
     distraction a3 regards the request for Gate A, no
     distraction by that request from everybody in the
     Control Box being able to see what was happening as
     the people came through Gate C, that is right, is it
     not? - A. That is right, yes. Everybody was
     concentrating on Gate C, yes.

Q.   Why have you changed your mind, if you have, as to
     this length of time between the opening of Gate C
     officially and the request for Gate A? Why have you
     changed your mind? - A. Because I subsequently found
     out that my original recollections were not correct.

Q.   From whom have you found out? - A. Certainly after the
     event.

Q.   From whom? - A. The Mr. Justice Taylor Inquiry.

Q.   Forget about Mr. Justice Taylor's Inquiry, he can get
     things right, he can get things wrong. I can in fact,
     if necessary, remind you of what you said to Lord
     Justice Taylor which fits in with your original
     recollection totally. - A. And I saw it on video, of
     course.

Q.    The only thing we have on video - and\I think I will
     be corrected if I am wrong - is 2.58,jis it not?             !

          THE CORONER:    As far as I know/that is all there
     is on video.

          MR. ISAACS:    But that, sir, is the gate actually
     opened.

          THE CORONER:     Yes, Ithink that is right.

          MR. PAYNE:It is slightly unfair,   sir. This
     Sergeant is asked what made him change his mind, he
     has given his answer and now he is told, "Forget about
     it".

          THE CORONER:    No, no,no, no.

          MR. KING: I    know itis Friday and I know we are
     coming to an end, but really!

                                            M. GODDARD


     MR. PAYNE: That is exactly what happened and the
transcript will show that is exactly what was put.

      THE CORONER: Mr. King was surprised that he said
it was Lord Justice Taylor who made him change his
mind.

     MR. PAYNE:   That is his answer.

     THE CORONER: MR. King, please, you may ask one or
two more questions' on this.

     MR. KING: Let me do this through questions. If
the video shows Gate A in the state of openness at
2.56 - all right? - A. Yes.

That certainly is consistent with your original
recollection that Gate A became open some substantial
time after Gate C was originally asked to be opened
officially, that would be right, would it not? - A. A
gate was opened after C gate certainly, yes.

Think this through, Sergeant Goddard. Your original
recollection was that Gate C was officially opened, is
that right? - A. Yes.

Then there was a gap of time which we know was about
five minutes while people came through, and then it
was shut, and then your original recollection was that
Gate A then became open in the way you have described.
That is right, is it not? - A. That was my original
recollection, yes.

On that original recollection then, of course, Gate A
would become open at about 2.58? - A. Yes.

So piecing together these pieces of evidence from
different sources, your original recollection that
Gate A was not asked to be opened until after Gate C
had been closed, your original recollection that it
was three or four minutes after the official opening
of Gate C and the request for the opening of Gate A,
and the video evidence that at 2.58 we see Gate A in a
state of openness - all that fits together, does it
not? - A. Yes.

So really there is no reason, is there, for you to
change your original recollection? - A. There is no
reason other than the fact that when I saw other
things I realised that obviously my timing was wrong.

I am going to suggest to you no more than your timing
is right.

                                            M. GODDARD


     THE CORONER: We are going round in circles. Can
you tell me as plainly as you are able, and then I
think we will have established this, what has
happened, or what have you learned, which makes you
now believe that your original timing was wrong, just
tell me what it is? - A. Basically because I saw a
video prior to Mr. Justice Taylor's Inquiry and
obviously on looking at that it led me to believe that
my timings were wrong. That is the reason, sir.

That is the sole reason why? - A. Yes, and I think I
was questioned on that by Mr. Justice Taylor's
Inquiry.

     MR. KING: Apart from the video which we know
shows Gate A in a state of openness at 2.58, what else
do you recall is to be seen on a video which helps us
as to the opening of Gate A? - A. I just don't know,
sir. I do not know what you mean.

Let us leave that for the moment because again that is
just a question of fact.

     THE CORONER: I think that is right. I do-not
think we can take it much further than that.

     MR. KING: It is a question of fact, sir.
But on that fact, if it be the fact that there was
this period, a substantial period on these figures of
anything between four and six minutes, between the
official opening of Gate C and the request for Gate A,
during that period there was ample opportunity within
that period for everybody in the Control Box, if they
so wished (1) to look at the people coming through
Gate C because that was on the video the whole time,
was it not? - A. Yes.

And (2) to look at the terrace if they so wished? - A.
Possibly, possibly, but the main concentration was on
Gate C, that is the obvious thing.

I am talking now after. I have moved on a bit. I am
talking about after Gate C was opened and people came
through in a stream - all right? - A. Yes.

On this basis of fact, which is not for me to resolve,
that there was this period of up to six minutes before
the Gate A request came through, during that period
everybody could see the stream of people coming
through Gate C - right? - A. Yes.

As I understand it, when that happened you were no
longer concentrating on that because on your evidence
that had alleviated the situation?

     THE CORONER: Can I just stop you for a moment,
Mr. King, because you put it to him that in his
original statement he said it was three or four
minutes.

     MR. KING: I did not get that from his original
statement. Do you want me to say where I got it?

     THE CORONER: Yes.

     MR. KING:     I got it from the Lord Justice Taylor
Inquiry.

     THE CORONER: I have turned up a reply of his to
Lord Justice Taylor, and I have also got his original
statement and, in fact, he specifies on two occasions
the time when the request came through from Sergeant
Higgins. Perhaps if you are going to ask him the
question, then you must put that to him as well. Do
you want to see a copy?

     MR. KING:     Certainly I will take it in stages
then, sir.

     THE CORONER: I do not want to spend too much time
on this.

     MR. ISAACS:    Which page, could you help us?

     THE CORONER: Lord Justice Taylor, page 99. It is
a reply to Mr. Jackson. Mr. Jackson puts it to him
and he agrees, and it fits in with his original
statement.




                             /MR. KING:   Sir, that

     MR. KING:   Sir, that is right on the timings as
regards his assumption that Gate A was 2.52.   I accept
that, sir.   However, what is more important is his
recollection which I have been putting to him of the
relationship between the request for Gate A to be opened
and the other events, sir.   If one looks at his evidence
on the same day in the same transcript, he was not being
pinned down as to whether he was right or wrong about
what time Gate C was opened, but he was being questioned
about the relationship between the Gate A order and the
earlier request.
     THE CORONER:   Yes, I realise that.    I understand
that point, but what I am concerned about is if we are
dealing with that I think it is also important to find
out why he mentioned a time, which he did.
     MR. KING:   Sir, can I deal with this and then can I
ask for a break after I have dealt with this part?

     THE CORONER:      Yes.

     MR. KING:   Can I show him, sir, first of all the
passage on pages 86 and 87 of the transcript and then I
will take him to page 99, sir?
     THE CORONER:   All we want to do is to establish the
facts as far as we can.

     MR. KING:      Indeed.

     THE CORONER:      What were the pages,Mr.   King?

     MR. KING:   Pages 86, 87 and 99.   Page 86 is letter
C, sir.   Page 87 it is letters D to E, sir.

     THE CORONER:   In fact that is exactly what you have
established from him up to now.
     MR. ISAACS:   Save, sir, that he says quite clearly,
"I would say three or four minutes, maybe.   It might be
less than that.

     MR. KING:   With respect I said that to him, sir.
I said to him, "Four minutes or less," when I put it to
him.
     MR. ISAACS:   My learned friend is very good at this
and I have great admiration for his advocacy.   He picks
the bits he wants to rely on and he rejects the rest.
We all know that through the course of these Inquests
that witnesses were looking at these events at a time
when they were not thinking that at some stage later they
were going to have to remember what happened.   We all
                                 9 19

also know that never mind about this aspect of the
matter, many witnesses have said many things that have
been directly contradictory or they have moved their
times, because people just did not know.   My learned
friend, as he did at the outset, before you very fairly
drew his attention to certain aspects of the evidence,
and particularly that 2.52 time, was happy to pick out a
little bit, as we see - "Three to four minutes - and
leave out the next bit, "It might be less than that."

     MR. KING:   With respect, sir, I did not leave out
the less bit because I put it to him that he thought it
was three or four minutes, or might be less.

     THE CORONER:   We will see from the transcript if it
is there.   May I put this to this witness and then we
will break and you can pick it up?

                Further by THE CORONER:

Sergeant Goddard, what we are trying to do is to
establish as near as we can what happened. You have told
Mr. King and the Inquest various things about your
original ideas as to when Gate C was opened and as to
when Gate A was opened.   You were asked almost identical
questions before Lord Justice Taylor? - A. That is
correct.

Now you have got those sheets in front of you.    You were
asked on that occasion - first of all you were asked how
long after the opening of Gate C, did Gate A open.    I am
summarising two questions.    Read the answer at C.   Is
that correct what you said there? - A. Yes, "Probably
three or four minutes I would suggest.    I would say
three or four minutes, maybe.    It might less than that."

Then you explain why you authorised him to open the
gates? - A. Yes.

On the next page, page 87, it was drawn to your attention
that in your statement you had said - this is at letter D
- you had said, "By the time A Gate was opened the gates
at C had been closed."   You were asked, Is that right?"
Your response was, "That was my belief at that time,
which is basically what you have told us now. - A. Yes,
sir.

You were then asked whether it was right again and what
did you say? - A. "I do not believe so, not now.   Not
now I have seen the video."

I asked you about that and you have told us that the
reason why you have changed your mind is simply because
you saw the video? - A. That is correct.
                                                    M. GODDARD


Q. If we turn to page 99, you were asked about this again.
   In fact this is also in your statement.   One of the
   lawyers asked you, "At 2.52, or thereabouts, Sergeant
   Higgins came through and said words to the effects that
   the gates at A have got to be open as if not somebody
   would be killed?"    Now your response.••   Look at the
   response.   Is that a correct answer to that question
   that is written down there? - A. Yes.

Q. What was it? - A. "That is correct, yes, sir."

Q. Why did you agree that the request from Sergeant Higgins
   was made at 2.52 or thereabouts? - A. Basically because
   that was the question that was put to me and no doubt
   Sergeant Higgins had in his own statement given the time,
   this time factor.   In relation to times that is
   something I cannot dwell upon in that I would not have
   known whether it was 2.52, 2.51, or whatever, sir.

Q. If you have a look at your statement in the middle of
   this page - check that that is your signature at the
   bottom. - A. Yes.
Q. Can you see there is a reference to a time there? - A.
   Yes.
Q. That is your statement, is it? - A. That is my statement.

Q. What time is mentioned there? - A. "Approximately 2.52."

Q. Where did that come from? - A. That was my belief at the
   time.   These were notes I made relatively shortly after
   the 15th of April.

Q. Did you   have any hard evidence for that time? - A. No.
   I think   I describe in here that in relation to the
   events,   the timing of things, it is only what I believed
   at that   time, and that is certainly in my statement, sir.

              Further Cross-Examined by MR. KING:

Q. It follows from that, Sergeant, that in your original
   statement you said two things: one, your belief that
   Gate A was opened after Gate C had been closed? - A. I
   did, yes, sir.

Q. You also said you thought Gate A had been opened at 2.52?
   - A. Yes.

       THE CORONER:     Request for...

       MR. KING:      I had better do that in stages then:
                                                M. GODDARD


Your understanding was from your statement that the
request for Gate A to be opened came after Gate C had
been closed?   That was your original understanding and
that is in your original statement? - A. That is correct,
sir.

Also in your original statement was that you put the
request for Gate A at 2.52? - A. At approximately 2.52.

It follows from that that as far as you were concerned in
your original statement in your mind, if Gate A had been
2.52, then the closure of Gate C had been before 2.52? -
A. At around that time, yes - before.

Then you would have to go back in time again before you
came to the official opening of Gate C? - A. Yes.

So it is not the timings which we can rely on through
your evidence.   What is clear in your mind from your
original statement was the relationship, that is what I
have been putting to you, the relationship between the
official opening of Gate C, people going through, then it
closing and then the request for Gate A.   As far as that
relationship goes you, in your original statement, were
clear that the request for Gate A came after Gate C had
been officially opened and Gate C officially closed? - A.
Yes, that was my belief at that time.

You also thought that period, to Lord Justice Taylor, was
three or four minutes or might be less? - A. That is
correct, sir.
The only thing which may have changed your mind would be
something which you may have seen on the video? - A. That
is correct as well.

To be fair to you you can't tell us what it is you saw on
the video which made you change your mind? - A. Not now,
no, sir.

You accept that what the video does show is Gate A in a
state of openness at 2.58? - A. Yes.
    THE CORONER:     Very well, we will break for coffee.

                   (Short adjournment)

Q. I want to Investigate now, if I may, Sergeant Goddard,
   your statement to us before to the question which was
   not asked of you but if it had been asked of you your
   answer was, "They had an option" and I just want to
   investigate this option with you from what you could
   see? - A. Yes.

Q. In a sense, and I accept this, and I hope the Coroner
   will bear with me, it is hypothetical to this extent
   because you were not asked the question and I have
   established that, but if your mind had been directed,
   for example, by Mr. Duckenfield, "Where is this large
   group of people likely to go when they come through the
   concertina gate?” and you had applied your mind to
   it? - A. Yes.

Q.    I accept you did not. First of all, you would know if
     you had applied your mind to it that there was on the
     concourse on the other side of turnstiles A to G this
     tunnel and you would know that? - A. Yes.

Q. You would know that that tunnel was a wide tunnel
   ■clearly marked with "standing". You would know that? -
   A. That is correct, yes.

Q. You would know you were not dealing in the situation of
   the question, "Where are these people going to go?"
   with just ones and twos coming through turnstiles, you
   are dealing with a whole mass of people being
   introduced through a wide concertina gate? - A. Yes.

Q.    You would be able to see, and indeed you did see, on
     the video how they all came in together in a stream? -
     A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. Clearly they would have the option of going down the
   tunnel, would they not? - A. That would be one option,
   yes.

Q. How would they know, do you say, this stream of people
   coming in en masse that they had the option of going in
   some other direction? - A. Because of the signing. The
   signing to the area on the south-west terrace and at
   the angle they would come in at, at gate C, they would
   be basically facing the south-west terrace rather than
   the tunnel.

Q. What would they see? - A. The entrance not just to the
   tunnel but to the south-west terrace.

Q. What would they see which amounted to an entrance do
   you say? - A. It is not an entrance as such as


                                   2i£
                                                                        25
                                                               M. GODDARD


              obviously the tunnel is but an open space which is
              totally open where obviously your spectators can go.

    B|   q. That is what you say. You agree with me it is not an
            obvious entrance as such? - A. It was an open space
            between the rear of the West Stand and the boundary
            wall.
         Q. You have agreed with me it was not an obvious entrance
            as such on to the terrace? - A. I wouldn't agree that,
            no. It seemed to me to be a perfectly fair place as an
            entrance.

         Q. Fair enough, that is your evidence. Did you see on the
            video when the people came in the way they were moving?
            That is to say, as you looked at the video could you
            see the way they were moving? - A. For a certain
            length, for a certain area, yes. They came in and
            there was like a mass and they appeared at some stage
            to me to stop to get their directions as to where they
            would go.
         Q. Did you see the way they were moving, this stream? - A.
            As far as I was aware, sir, they were moving in all
            directions.

         Q. I need not take you any further with that because we
            have that video evidence. Let me just go back. I
            wonder if Mr. Griffiths will point out gate C and
            follow it through. Imagine Mr. Griffiths' pointer is a
            mass of people going through. You have now gone
            through. Pausing there, Mr. Goddard, are you seriously
            saying to this Inquest that there would be an obvious
            entrance to the right to people coming through en masse
            like that? - A. Yes, sir.

         Q. You cure? - A. Yes.

         Q . ‘Just point out again the feature which you say makes it
              an obvious entrance on to the terraces? - A. The area.

         Q.        THE CORONER:   Walk up to it. - A. This here is a
              totally open area which gives access to the terrace.

         Q.        MR. KING: Yes, we know that. That was not my
              question. What was it when a great mass of people came
              through that gate, and use the pointer to take us
              through the gate   _
                   THE CORONER: Mr. King, you are asking him to say
              what was in people's minds.

                  MR. KING:   You are quite right.

                                                          M. GODDARD



            THE CORONER:   All he can say is what he thought.

            MR. KING: Yes, but I am entitled to test the
       obviousness of it.
            MR. ISAACS: Sir, he has actually been asked this
       now three or four times and my learned friend again,
       being the good advocate he is, does not like the first
       answer and so he comes back to it and he comes back
       hoping that he is going to get it changed.
            MR. KING: No, I am entitled to investigate the
       factual basis for it because it is important.

            THE CORONER: No, I think you cure entitled to
       investigate why he thought that there were options but
       you cure not entitled to ask him why somebody else might
       or might not have found the entrance in the same easy
       way as he might have done.
            MR. KING:   I agree, fair enough, sir.

    Q. Let me deal with the option of the tunnel. You have
       agreed with me that was an option straight in front of
       people as you come through? - A. Yes, sir.

    Q. What about the other option? What was the other option
       you say people would have if they came in a large
       number in that way? - A. You have got any number of
       options, (a) that is one of them,(b) which is   not so
       much an option is to go throughhere   on to the other
       side.

    Q. Pausing there, how do you say that people would know
       that is an option available to them? - A. Quite simply
       had it been any other Club than Liverpool it may not
       have been an option but Liverpool being regular
       visitors down at Hillsborough, bring good numbers with
       them all the time and that again is that they were
       there the previous year and so, therefore, we cure
       looking, I am not saying all the same spectators were
       there but they know the area of the ground that they
       are going to go in.

    Q. So be it. I hear your answer. I am not going to waste
       any time cross-examining on that point. Let me deal
       with an allied aspect of this same issue. You told us
       in a question to my learned friend, Mr. Isaacs, that
       had you considered that people would go down the
       central tunnel and considered the area in the central
       pens were too full, those things had gone on in y<?ur
                                                        M. GODDARD


   mind, no one would have gone down the tunnel. That is
   what you told Mr. Isaacs? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q. Tell us what you say could have been done to ensure
   that no one would have gone down the tunnel? - A. Two
   things (a) gate C would not have been opened when it
   was opened because we would have needed manpower
   obviously to barricade the tunnel and to get that
   manpower would obviously take a little time. Obviously
   people would have to be diverted accordingly.

Q. In other words, you would have taken some time to
   organise a diversion? - A. Yes.

Q. I am not going to ask you to give evidence about how
   long that would have taken because we have asked
   questions of that to other persons but you cure quite
   clear in your mind as to what you said to my learned
   friend, Mr. Isaacs, that if you had considered those
   matters then clearly there would have been an obvious
   duty to you to have closed off the tunnel? - A. Had I
   considered those matters, yes, sir.
Q. I know you were not asked to consider the question of
   where they were going to go. Let me ask the other side
   of this question which is the question of the state of
   the pens. You were not asked to consider that question
   either, that is to say, the state of the terraces at
   the time of the decision for gate C to be opened was
   made, were you? - A. No, I wasn't asked, no, sir, but
   by the same token had I known anything or believed
   anything would have been amiss within those pens I
   would have said something. I wouldn't have needed
   asking.

Q. Just pause with me, Sergeant Goddard, and consider what
   the question is. First of all, you told us earlier on
   that pen 1 was not as full as you might have
   anticipated and as far as pen 6 was concerned it did
   appear to have less people in it. My note finished in
   and I did not quite catch the end but I assume you
   meant less people in it than something else. - A. Less
   people in it in relation to the other pens. That is
   all I can think of.

Q. So you were in a position to assess the relative
   fullness of the pens across the terrace? - A. Yes.

Q. You are   not suggesting that   from that Control Box you
   are not   able to assess, for   example, the difference
   between   the centre pens and   the side pens because
   clearly   you were able? - A.   It would be far easier to
                                                             28
                                                      M. GODDARn


   assess the difference between the centre pens and pen 1
   rather than pen 6 because of the distance.

Q. Of course, but you were actually able to tell us that
   pen 6 appeared to have less people in it than
   something? - A. Yes.

Q. You told us I think when you were giving evidence
   before that the problem with pen 6 was that you could
   not get right down to the first six or seven steps, was
   it? - A. Six or seven steps, yes, and you cure looking
   down on them so that all you would see anyway is heads.

Q. Just let me deal with the six or seven steps for the
   moment.   If one accepts that for one moment, just have
   a look at C.326A. This is not your view of pen 6 but I
   am just looking at the steps. This is a view of pen 6
   from a different side but we can see the steps in the
   front portion of that terrace, can we not? - A. We can,
   yes, sir.

Q. Indeed if one counts up from the front six or seven
   steps that does not take us, does it, throughout the
   whole of the section which on this photograph one can
   see clear empty space, does it? - A. I would say to you
   on my counting here, six or seven steps, is where those
   spectators are.




                                     /Q. Yes, but behind.


                               220
                                                         29

                                                M. GODDARD


Q. Yes, but behind those spectators there is big space? -
   A. Behind those spectators there are spaces, yes.

Q. Very obvious space, there is a wide area between them
   and the next band of people, isn’t there? - A. There
   are wide spaces from that photograph and from that
   angle, yes, but when you change it from the other side
   of the Leppings Lane -- on the other side of the West
   Stand, all you see is heads. You don't see space.

Q. Sergeant Goddard, if that were right how are you able
   to even make the assessment to us that Pen 6 had less
   people in it? - A. Because of the numbers. As I said
   just a short while ago it is far easier to assess on
   Pen 1 than onto Pen 6.

Q. Of course. - A. And that is why I said that it appeared
   less because on the volume side of it, on the heads,
   yes, but you can't see totally and say, yes, there are
    x" spaces there. You just can't see that.

Q. If the view of Pen 6 was so poor from the Control Box
   you in the Control Box would never be in a position,
   would you, if you are right, would never be in a
   position to assess the state of the wing pens? - A. Of
   course, yes, from the Control Box you can see the
   Leppings Lane Terrace. Quite obviously, as you can see
   on the photograph, where the Control Box is it is far
   easier to assess 1 than it is to assess 6.

Q. You have, do you not - and I am not in these questions
   suggesting that this is all down to you, I had better
   make that clear, but you are entitled, of course, to
   warnings which have not been given, and so forth.

        MR. KING:   Sir, you will appreciate that I am
   investigating what I am investigating.

        THE CORONER:   Yes, that is why I have not given
   any warnings yet.

       MR. ISAACS:    Sir, actually in fairness to my
  learned friend and the Witness, having regard to the
  answer he gave to one of my learned friend's questions
  perhaps he should at an appropriate time have a
  warning. I am concerned about that.

       THE CORONER:   Very well.   I will give him a
  warning as a precaution:

Q. Sergeant Goddard, you don't have to answer any question
   which may tend to incriminate you, in other words which
   might make a possibility of some prosecution or penalty
   action being taken against you, so if you are asked

                             221
                                                  M. GODDARD


such a question, if I spot it I will draw it to your
attention. If I don't but you think it is one which
imperils you then you are entitled to draw it to my
attention, so to speak, and say you don't want to
answer it. You understand that? - A. I understand
that, yes, sir.

     MR. KING:   Let me take it in stages, Sergeant
Goddard. Are you saying that from the Control Box it
is not possible to make a sensible assessment of the
difference between the centre pens and the wing pens? -
A. No, I am not saying that at all, sir. I am saying
that an assessment can be made but it is probably a
little more difficult, in fact, it is more difficult to
assess Pen 6 than Pen 1.

It is important, that question, because I understood,
and you may be able to help u s , that it was accepted
that one of the roles of the Police in the Control Box
was monitoring the state of the Leppings Lane Terraces,
and you accept that? - A. One of the roles, yes.

Because clearly if your judgment was that you could not
possibly make any sensible assessment of the wing pens
you would not accept that role, would you?

     THE CORONER:     He didn't say that.

     MR. KING:      So be it, sir, quite right:

The facility within the Control Box includes cameras,
doesn't it? - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Those cameras are an aid, an addition to your visual
eyes, aren't they? - A. They are, yes.

Let me therefore take it in two ways. First of all, if
you had been asked by, for example, Mr. Duckenfield, at
the time the decision to open Gate C was being taken,
what is the state of the pens, you first of all would
be able to tell him, wouldn't you, that Pen 1 had lots
of space in it? You would be able to tell him that? -
A. Pen 1 had space in it.

Well it had lots of space in it, didn't it? - A. I
don't know about lots of space but certainly space.

Just let me point to a contrast between 1988 and 1989
as regards the area beneath the Control Box, of which
there could be no doubt as to what you could see.

     THE CORONER:     Mr. King, he has said space, you
say lots of space.     We have seen the photographs ....
                                                     M. GODDARD


          MR. KING:   So   be it, sir, I take the point:

Q. Let me then quicklyask you the next question on this
   line. If you had been asked the state of the centre
   pens, that is to say whether the centre pens at that
   time had space for a large number of people, your
   answer would have to have been no, wouldn't it? - A.
   No, sir.

Q.   You don't agree? - A. No, I      don't agree.

Q.    Again, I accept the learned    Coroner's rulingthat    it is
     a matter of the evidence to be assessed, but just let
     me be sure I understand your question. Are you saying
     that looking at the centre pens you would have been
     able to say that there was room in those centre pens
     for the sort of numbers which you could see were about
     to come through Gate C? - A. You are assuming there,
     sir, everyone coming through Gate C is going to go into
     the centre pens.

Q. I have done this in stages, with respect, Sergeant
   Goddard; it is a different question. The question as
   to what was to be expected where people would go is one
   question, I have dealt with that. I am on a different
   question now. I am on the question of what you are
   saying would be an assessment of the centre pens at the
   time the decision to order Gate C to be opened was
   made. You are not seriously saying that there was any
   room of any significance in those pens, are you? - A. I
   believe there was room in the centre pens.

Q. So be it.

          MR. KING:   Again, sir, that is a matter of
     evidence.

Q. What you have told us though is what you could have
   done if a different assessment had been made? - A. Yes.

Q. And the difference between us is whether or not one
   assessment was obvious or the other assessment was
   right, that is the difference between us? - A. Yes.

Q. And that, as the learned Coroner says, is a matter of
   evidence and I won't go into that. - A. Yes.

Q. Let me deal, if I may, with one or two other matters.
   First of all, earlier on in the day at 2.15 you told
   us, you remember the visit from Mr. Jackson, don't you?
   - A. Yes, sir.

Q. You told us that it was clear then that the Nottingham
   Forest end was filling up well? - A. Yes.


                                   2 2 2
                                                          32

                                                M. GODDARD


Q. But it was also very clear then, wasn't it, that there
   were a lot more Liverpool supporters to come? - A. That
   is correct, yes, sir.

Q. Indeed, you would therefore expect in the next 45
   minutes really the bulk of the supporters to be coming,
   having viewed it at 2.15, that is right, isn't it? - A.
   Having viewed it at 2.15, yes, the bulk.

Q. Yes, the bulk, the majority of spectators could be
   expected on that view after 2.15? - A. Yes.

Q. Also you had access, didn't you, to the Control Room of
   the Club, where precise figures could be given for the
   numbers going through turnstiles? - A. Access by
   'phone, yes.

Q. That includes, does it not, numbers as to going through
   A-G onto the Leppings Lane Terrace end? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you at regular intervals after 2 o'clock receive
   numbers and figures from that Control Room? - A. I know
   that I personally did not speak to the Control Room,
   but I know that was done and numbers were obtained,
   yes.
Q. Indeed, didn't you yourself check with P.C. Guest, this
   is to say at about 2.15, and check with him as to how
   many Liverpool supporters were in the Ground? - A. A
   check no doubt was done but I don't believe it was me
   personally, no.

Q. Let me just show you, because I want to investigate
   this, please, page 92B of what you told Lord Justice
   Taylor. - A. Yes, I had checked with P.C. Guest.

Q. So do you accept that you did check with P.C. Guest? -
   A. Yes. When I say that to you, I am saying I had
   checked, but I as part of Control. Whether it was me
   personally, I don't know. I cannot tell you now but I
   know checks would be made.

Q. So in other words, what you are saying is, your
   evidence is, that at 2.15 checks were being made within
   the Control Room of P.C. Guest in the Club Control Room
   as to how many Liverpool people were in the Ground, and
   the figures were given? - A. Yes. It could have been
   me that said to P.C. Ryan, "Phone Harold Guest and see
   what we have got", yes.
Q. And we know that the capacity of the Liverpool end was
   approximately 24,000? - A. Yes, sir.



                              995
                                               M. GODDARD


I think your evidence is that at 2.15 what was being
said was there were a few thousand in? - A. Yes.

And therefore again one has that same assessment both
from figures and from visual impression that the great
bulk of supporters had to come in the next 45 minutes?
- A. That is correct, yes, sir.

That was not known just to you, it was known to
everybody in the Control Room? - A. Yes.

Indeed, you continued, didn't you, to receive figures
well after that time? - A. Yes, I would assume so.

     THE CORONER:   Can we just make sure that when he
says that he means the Control Room, not him
personally?

     MR. KING:   I am interested in within the Control
Room, that is right.

     THE CORONER:   And you are asking him whether to
his knowledge figures were being received?

     MR. KING:    Yes, that is right? - A. Yes.

     MR. MANNING:   I am sorry, I am only looking for
clarification, both of the point that you were making
and also the Sergeant said, "I assume so", and I think
it is very important to know whether he actually knows
so, as opposed to whether he assumed so.

     THE WITNESS:   I did not make any checks myself
but I know that checks were made, yes.

     MR.   KING:   And you can certainly say that it was
not just   one check, it was certainly three or four
times in   the period I am talking about that checks were
made for   figures, wasn't it? - A. Yes, with regularity,
yes.

And those figures were being passed around? - A. Yes.

I need not ask you any further questions about those
figures because again it is a matter of evidence. At
2.30 you told us that when you looked at the Leppings
Lane end, because of the comment F.C. Bichard had made,
what you saw was unusual, wasn't it? That is what you
told us yesterday? - A. Yes, it was unusual. I had
seen that before but it was unusual, yes.
It would certainly be unusual at a semi-final because,
of course, it was a capacity game when you were hoping
for everybody to come in a steady flow over a long
                                             M. GODDARD


period of time, that is right, isn't it? - A. You can
always, always hope for that but you know that you are
never going to get that.

Is that right? - A. Yes.

That is helpful, thank you. So anyway this is the
picture, at 2.15 we know from what you tell us that
within the Control Box to your knowledge the picture
was that the majority of the Liverpool fans still had
to come? - A. Yes.

Figures were being-obtained, three or four times? - A.
Yes.

And at 2.30 you could see what you described as an
unusual situation of the numbers outside the Leppings
Lane end? - A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Now at some stage P.C. Bichard -- sorry, I am wrong,
he had made the comment at that stage and the video
camera was actually concentrated then on the Leppings
Lane end, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

Therefore the Control Room were able to watch from that
moment onwards the build-up of these numbers, these
unusual numbers which you saw at 2.30? - A. That is
correct.




                /Q. It is right ....

                                226

                                                  M. GODDARD


Q.   It is right, is it not, to be fair to you, that you
     have to crane your neck to look at the monitors, do
     you not? - A. Yes.

Q.   Someone in the position of Mr. Duckenfield behind you
     has a much easier look directly at the monitors, does
     he not? - A. Yes, it would be easier.

Q.   Within the next 10 minutes, that is between 2.30 and
     2.40, there are a number of incidents which tend to
     show that things are getting out of hand, and can I
     put one or two things to you to see if you can
     remember them. First of all, do you remember a
     request for mounted assistance? - A. I do, yes sir.

Q.   Do you recall a sending out of a message for such
     assistance? - A. Yes, I sent a message to Sergeant
     Salisbury.

Q.   I do not know if you remember a message from Mr.
     Marshall asking for a tannoy message to be put out
     over the Leppings Lane end, do you remember? - A.

          MR. MANNING: I got stopped for this, sir, at
     about quarter-past 10.

          MR. KING: With respect, sir, it has a factual
     basis now on the picture I am coming to.

          THE CORONER: I stopped you giving the reasons, I
     seemed to remember. I did not actually stop you. I
     was tempted to stop you, I do admit, and I am tempted
     to stop Mr. King, but I did not stop you for asking
     him to recite.

          MR. KING: Sir, if my learned friend wants to
     know in advance what I am leading to, I am leading to
     a short investigation of delay in kick-off, that is
     what I am leading to, and I did indicate that that was
     an area which I think legitimately, in the
     circumstances, I can investigate with the witness
     because he is the one who gave evidence of receiving a
     message.

          THE CORONER: Yes, you can do that.   We will see
     how you go.

          MR. KING: Thank you, sir.
Q.   After 2.30, after this unusual situation which is then
     the scene at 2.30, you have got these additional
     features which I am putting to you - the request for
     assistance of mounted Officers, the request by Mr.
     Marshall for some tannoy messages - yes? - A. That is
     one thing I cannot recollect specifically.  Tannoy
                                                           36

                                                 M. GODDARD


     messages did go out, but I don't know who they came
     from.

Q.   Were you able to observe yourself some difficulty with
     a mounted Officer being surrounded by people? - A.
     Yes, I was.

Q.   Do you recall at that stage, either at 2.30 when you
     first saw an unusual situation, what you describe as
     unusual, or not long afterwards, a discussion between
     Mr. Murray and Mr. Duckenfield as to the agreement
     which had been reached as to when kick-off would be
     delayed? - A. I don't know, sir. I was certainly
     aware of the general reasons why kick-off would be
     delayed, but I don't think there was anything specific
     about that.

Q.   When you yourself had a request for kick-off to be
     delayed, or as you received a request for kick-off to
     be delayed, that was from PC Buxton, was it not? - A.
     That was from PC Buxton, that is correct.

Q.   You gave a reply immediately, did you not? - A. Yes, I
     did.

Q.   You did not refer it to a senior Officer in the
     Control Box? - A. No.

Q.   In fact, it would have been a decision, would it not,
     delaying kick-off, for a senior Officer in the Control
     Box? - A. Yes, it would.

Q.   Your immediate reply was, "It's too late, one team is
     already on the field"? - A. That is correct, yes sir.

Q.   Why did you believe automatically that it was too late
     to delay kick-off because a team has run out onto the
     field? For example, they can run back, can they not?
     - A. They can run back, sir. I would like to know of
     an occasion when that would have happened. If you get
     to a stage that a team has run out, and it was
     Liverpool that ran out, when the question was asked
     they were running onto the field, and that was
     obviously 2.54, I believe, something like that. For
     that to happen, for the kick-off to be delayed then
     would have meant someone going down onto the ground to
     see the referee and taking them back off the field,
     and in that space of time the logistics of it said
     basically there is no way you can do that.

Q.   Did you know that there was this agreement as to the
     circumstances in which kick-off would be delayed? - A.
     I knew the general outlines as to why kick-off would
     be delayed.

                                                 M. GODDARD


Q.   What was that general outline? - A. The general
     outline was quite basic, in that when it was no fault
     of the spectators on their arrival, in relation to
     certain incidents occurring away from the ground,
     obviously you would then consider delaying kick-off.

Q.   But if it was their fault, what was the position? - A.
     The norm there was that we would try and get kick-off
     to go ahead on time.

Q.   So it comes down to this, that on that policy, on that
     agreement, if the assessment is, "It is the fault of
     the fans for their late arrival, then we don't delay
     kick-off", that is how you understood it? - A. That is
     how I personally understood that, but you will find
     obviously at any football match, whether it be a semi­
     final or any game you want to mention, you will get
     fans coming in after kick-off.

Q.   Let me, if I may, go ahead to after the gates had been
     opened and it was seen people coming over the fences,
     and so forth. You had the control, did you not, of
     messages, communications, between the Control Room and
     the outside world, did you not? - A. Yes.

Q.   For example, there was a communication line, was there
     not, with Snig Hill, that is to say the Force
     Headquarters? - A. Force Headquarters, yes.

Q.   And the only way in which communications would be
     being passed between the ground and Snig Hill would be
     through your Control Box, would it not? - A. Through
     VHF in the Control Box.

Q.   I just wonder, therefore, if you can help me on this.
     Could I just show you 315A and B.

          THE CORONER: VHF, in fact, is not his wavelength,
     you had better establish that.
          MR KING:   Sir, if I have got the wrong man --

          THE CORONER: You have, it is Mr. Bichard.
Q.   That is right, is it not? - A. I did not use VHF at
     all, sir, no.

          MR. KING: So be it, but I can still ask him
     whether he heard anything in the Control Room about it
     certainly.

          THE CORONER: Yes, but he was not the operator.
     What was the number again?

     MR. KING: I got it wrong, sir - 517A and B.
Sergeant Goddard, this is a transcript of messages
passing from Snig Hill to the Ambulance Service - all
right? - A. Yes sir.

It starts on page 1 at 1507 and then I need not take
you all the way through everything but if you go to
page 2 you see about a minute or so later at 1508.14
halfway down the second page? - A. Yes.

Clearly a message was being relayed at 1508 from the
Force Control to the Ambulance Service to this effect:

     "A lot injured, apparently one of the gates, has
     they've been pushing and pushing and shoving I
     understand and one of the gates has, they've
     collapsed the gates and there's .... "

Do you have any knowledge of anything you heard in
your Control Box as to how it came about that at 8
minutes past 3 Force Control at Snig Hill were putting
out a message that what had been happening at the
Hillsborough Ground which required ambulances and had
caused injuries was a collapse of the gates - "they've
collapsed the gates"? - A. I have no knowledge of that
whatsoever, sir.

Because one thing is certain. Your knowledge was that
Gate C had been opened when it was opened for the long
time, and a lot of people came through, that had been
opened on Police authority, had it not? - A. On Police
orders, yes.

So you cannot help us with that puzzle? - A. Not at
all, sir, no.

     MR. KING:   I have no further questions.

         Cross-Examined by MRS. McBRIEN:

Sergeant Goddard, I want to try and get a clear
picture if I can. Your position in the Control Room
was radio operator, was it not? - A. That is correct,
yes.

You had held that position since 1985? - A. 1986 -
January 1986 it was.

Mr. Murray's role in the Control Room was overall
control of the Control Room? - A. That is correct,
yes.

And the event itself, an adviser to Mr. Duckenfield? -
A. Yes.

                                                 M. GODDARD


Q.   Of course, he would be interested in all
     communications that were taking place in the Control
     Room, would he not? - A. Yes.

Q.   Now Mr. Duckenfield was in overall command of the
     whole operation? - A. Yes, overall command, yes.

Q.   How much ground space approximately is there in the
     Control Room in square metres?

          THE CORONER: " Mrs. McBrien, we have all been
     there and I do not think we want that. We know how
     many people were in there. We have got a plan and you
     can measure it, it is an exhibit. I do not think we
     need that.
Q.   I think it is fair to say that there is not much room,
     is there? - A. There is not much room, it is small.

          MRS. McBRIEN: I made a note that you said it was
     crowded in there, so I was trying to compare densities
     really, that is what I was trying to do.

          THE CORONER: You have got to allow for desks and
     tables. It is impossible.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN: I was just trying to work
     something out, but there were six of you in there
     anyway, were there not, I believe? - A. Yes.

Q.   To you it seemed quite full with that number there? -
     A. It was quite full, yes.

Q.   For working purposes? - A. Yes.

Q.   In fact, I may have this wrong but I think you said
     there really was not any room there for Mr.
     Duckenfield. Have I got that right? - A. No, that is
     not correct. You have got the four normal operators
     and with that I include Mr. Murray. You have got Mr.
     Duckenfield who would make five, and you have
     obviously got people coming in and out at different
     times. I did not say there was no room for Mr.
     Duckenfield, no.

Q.   I am sorry about that, but I believe Mr. Mole used to
     valk around the whole stadium, did he not, from time
     to time? He was not there continuously, was he, in
     the Control Room? - A. Mr. Mole was not, no. I do not
     know about walk around, but he would both walk and be
     driven around, yes.

Q.   So Mr. Duckenfield could have taken a walk, could he
     not, if he would have wanted to? - A. I cannot answer
     for Mr. Duckenfield.

                                              M. GODDARD


     THE CORONER: No.   We know he was there, and that
is it.

     MRS. McBRIEN: I did not put that very well. I
meant to say he could have done a similar thing to
what Mr. Mole had done, that is what I meant to say? -
A. He could have done, but every Commander has his own
ideas on things.

Yes, of course. It was not your job to make major
decisions, was it? - A. No.

These would include the closure of Leppings Lane to
traffic before a match, the ordering of the opening of
the exit gates to allow fans into the stadium, or the
delaying of the kick-off, they would not be your
decisions, would they? - A. No. In relation to the
first point you make, that was a request from Mr.
Marshall. Obviously in Control we cannot decide that
we will close a road. The man on the spot, the man on
the site, is going to tell us that, yes, but it is not
my area to make major decisions.




                             /Q.   Your job was
                                                             41
                                                     M. GODDARD


Q. Your job was to put out the message once the
   authorisation had been given? - A. That is correct.

Q. So it would be your voice saying what was to be done?
   Somebody else would have given the order? - A. It would
   be my voice.

Q. You would be able to make suggestions there if you
   thought   they seemed like sensible things to do? - A. Yes,
   I was allowed to do that.

Q. Did you   make any suggestions that day? - A.Well, I am
   sure on   that day I did, but if we     are talking in relation
   to the major decisions, no, because certain of those
   major decisions...    It was fairly obvious they had got
   no alternatives.

Q. Superintendent Marshall made a request for Leppings Lane
   to be closed to traffic and this request is recorded in
   the log at 2.17, isn't it? - A. That is correct.

          THE CORONER:   I think we had better say in
     Mr. Murray's log:

Q. That is where it is recorded, is that right? - A. Yes.

Q.         MRS. MCBRIEN: It did not apply to the time the
     request was granted and it did not apply to when the
     traffic was actually stopped, it just related to the time
     the request was made, the log? - A. It did, yes.    I have
     always been of the opinion, and I accept it is 2.17
     because it is recorded in log form, but I was always of
     the opinion it was later, the request came later than
     2.17.

Q. Anyway it was written down? - A. It was written down at
   that time, yes.

Q. Now the situation at Leppings Lane changed from a very
   normal situation at about 2.15, before the request to
   close Leppings Lane to traffic from Superintendent
   Marshall, to a chaotic situation at the turnstiles from
   2.40 onwards? - A. Yes.

Q. You said the radio became faulty? - A. The radio went
   down, yes.

Q. We know that was at 2.42?   There was a record kept of
   that.   You said it caused complete disruption in the
   Control Room? - A. Very much so, yes.

Q. In fact you said it was devastating at the time? - A.
   Yes.

                                                M. GODDARD


Mr.Murray also when he gave evidence described that time
in a similar way and said he threw the radio down on the
table? - A. I did, yes.

You did that? - A. I did.   I am sorry, it was the
telephone handset that I threw on the table, yes.

Now this disruption, could you compare it with the United
Kingdom when we get a fall of snow?

     THE CORONER:    Say that again.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:    I thought I would put a bit of
humour into it!

     THE CORONER:    Yes, I can see what you say.

     MR. MANNING:    Paralysed!

     THE CORONER:    Yes.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:     I was trying to get the feel of the
disruption.

     THE WITNESS:   I had not considered it on those
lines, but it was - yes, paralysed.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:   Now the radio was out of action one
minute, or possibly two minutes... - A. No, the radio was
down for one or two minutes, but out of action is another
matter.   If I cannot transmit - at some previous stage
the communication engineer who would be in the gymnasium,
realises I have a fault on my transmission, the radio
therefore is down, out of action, for a much longer
period of time than it being turned off.

You have got a period where it is turned off for a couple
of minutes, yes, but prior to that there is a much longer
period where the radio is basically inoperative.

Would you say it was quite a short time? - A. It seemed
an eternity - absolutely.

You said that the two minute seemed like two hours? - A.
Yes.

Do you think people who are responsible for the safety of
the public should keep calm in a crisis just in case they
are unable to think properly?   This is just a general
question.

     THE CORONER:   No, I do not think that is a...    The
jury will think about that, I'm sure.
                                                     M. GODDARD


Q.        MRS. MCBRIEN:   Now the safety of the public was
     paramount inside the ground, wasn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. All the people inside that stadium, which was private
   property, had been invited there and were entitled after
   producing their admission tickets...

          THE CORONER:    Just a minute, Mrs. McBrien.   You
     are not allowed to make a speech and I made it perfectly
     plain that we can ask this Officers on matters within his
     knowledge and competence but not on the laws of licensees
     and matters of that, nature.   That is not a proper
     question for this Officer, in other words.

          MRS. MCBRIEN:   Sir, would he know that the people
     inside the stadium would expect a reasonable amount of
     safety in there?   Is that a proper question?

          THE CORONER:   It is not really a fair question, but
     I will let you ask that:

Q. Would you have expected...   You yourself, would you have
   expected the public to expect that they would be
   reasonably safe if they came in? - A. I would, sir.

Q.        MRS. MCBRIEN:   That was the intention of the match
     going ahead? - A. Of course, yes.

Q. The whole intention as put down in the Operational Order?
   - A. It was in the Operational Order.

Q. That the Officers would have read if they had      looked at
   that page in the Order?   - A. Yes.  That just   doesnot
   come on a semi-final Order, it comes on every Order.

Q. The club, as owner of the stadium, which they were,
   weren't they?   The club was the owner?

          THE CORONER:   No,   Mrs. McBrien.  Why should you
     ask this Officer anything regarding the club?   I am
     sorry.   You had plenty of opportunity to ask that when
     Mr. Mackrell was here and Mr. Lock was here.   If you did
     not take it then I am sorry, but this is not the right
     person.

          MRS. MCBRIEN:    So I cannot mention the Safety
     Certificate?

          THE CORONER:    No, not at all.
          MRS. MCBRIEN:    Could I ask this question:  that the
     Police Officers who were policing the match that day, had
     they taken the responsibility that day to ensure the
     safety of the public?    Was it their responsibility?
                                                             44

                                                      M. GODDARD


          THE CORONER:   No, Mrs. McBrien.    We have already
     asked all the senior Officers, if you like, and quite a
     few others, that question.   What I am interested in from
     this Officer is what he can tell us happened within the
     Control Room and what is within his knowledge.    You have
     asked those questions of others, I am sure youwill
     remember and there is noneed to ask them again.
     Anyway, he is not the right person to do so.    I hate
     keeping saying no to you but I have got to.

          MRS. MCBRIEN:   I probably forgot to include all
     this and so I thought I was going to slot it in.   I have
     said this before.

            THE CORONER:   I know!   Well, I am not going to let
     you.     Let's press on.

Q.       MRS. MCBRIEN: Now the first request by
     Superintendent Marshall to open the exit gates to allow
     entry of fans came at 2.47, didn't it? - A. Yes.

Q. I believe Superintendent Marshall contacted Hammerton
   Road Police Station at 2.44 and that coincided with an
   incident on the bridge when a youth went past him and
   gave his ankles a sharp push.

Q.       THE CORONER:    Do you know anything about that?   - A.
     I don't know anything about that, I'm sorry.

Q.       MRS. MCBRIEN:   I was going to ask you:  did you know
     about this and the message he put through to Hammerton
     Road Police Station? - A. No.

Q. You didn't? - A. No.
Q. It is possible the radio was down then and that is why he
   contacted Hammerton Road? - A. I'm sorry, I was totally
   unaware of that.

Q. If Mr. Marshall's request was for one gate to be opened,
   as you said, Sergeant, it would be a vague request?
   Would you know which gate he was talking about if he
   said, Open a gate"? - A. That was my belief.    I do not
   know what Mr. Marshall has said before these Inquests,
   but I know that was my belief in relation to the gates.
   I say that because I know that there are three big gates
   on Leppings Lane end; A Gate, you have got a wall at the
   side of it so there is no way people can go there.   The
   only one where you can get people out of a crush on to
   the South Stand Lane is C Gate, and that is why
   presumably, rightly or wrongly, I assumed it was C Gate
   that required to be opened because you could pull people
   out of a confined space into a larger area and so relieve
   the crush at the turnstiles.

                                                       M. GODDARD


Q. Yes, but he made four requests, and would he have said
   "Gate" on four occasions? - A. Well, you say four, I can
   only remember three.

          THE CORONER:   He can only remember three.

Q.        MRS. MCBRIEN:   Well, even three.   Now when I
     questioned Mr. Marshall he was not aware of the lettering
     of those gates and definitely he categorically said,
     "Gates," and it was my understanding that most people
     thought it was "Gates that was the request. - A. He did
     say Gates," yes, and I said, "Open the gates," but I
     personally believed - and I did say "Gates" and I said
     that in the plural - I did honestly believe myself that
     it was C Gate that required to be opened, for the reason
     I have just outlined to you.

Q. You put the message over, "Open the gates"? - A. I did.

Q. That is clear to me now.   You said you thought Gate C
   had burst open.   We have heard that once or twice.    I
   suppose it would be difficult to assess things properly
   from the Control Box, would not it? - A. If we are
   talking about Gate C, to get a picture of Gate C from the
   Box, yes it is, because all you have got is a sideways on
   view.   You have got no front view, or no view at all.
   It is directly in line with the Box or almost in line
   with the Box.   From the camera it is at a slight angle,
   but as I say, you don't see the full gates at all.

Q. You weren't aware it was to eject a fan?     You had no
   record of that? - A. No.

Q. You did not know that that was what was actually
   happening at the time because of the view you had? - A.
   Yes.

Q. The first request that was made for the opening of the
   gates did not refer to crushing outside, did it? - A.
   That is something I cannot tell you.   The request was
   made to open the gates and obviously it was
   Mr. Marshall's reasoning, his decision, as to why he
   wanted the gates open and he no doubt would have said
   something, but within a very short space of time after
   him saying that the gates did open, albeit for a brief
   period.

Q. So it was authorised by Mr. Duckenfield, obviously, and
   you put the order out.   When you received a request -
   well, I have got it down at just before 2.58, I didn't
   know the exact time when you got the request to open
   Gate A, so I have assumed that it was just before because
   you said, "Immediately the request came..."

     THE CORONER:   We have had a lot of problems with
that, Mrs. McBrien. Do not worry about the time.    Ask
the question.   I don't want to go over that again.    We
have explored that.   Mr. King and I had a good try, I
think it would be fair to say.

     MRS. MCBRIEN:   It is just that you said you
immediately activated that, you see.   I wrote that down,
that once the request came then you said, "Yes, open the
gates"? - A. I immediately responded to it, yes.




        Q. So, from what you

                                                                M. GODDARD


        Q. Prom what you have said today I thought that it could
           be that time and that was from Sergeant Higgins to open
           gate A? - A. Yes.
    B
        Q. That request was the one that was accompanied by the
           statement "Somebody is going to get killed", wasn't it?
           That was the request? - A. That was the request from
           Sergeant Higgins. He had said, "Can we open gate A?"
           It was words to the effect, "Can we open gate A or else
           someone is going to get killed?" In fact you had got
           two requests at different periods of time both stating
           the same, that someone is going to get killed. One was
           from Mr. Marshall and one was from Mr. Higgins.

        Q. You said yes to that because you knew Mr. Duckenfield
           had already authorised the opening of the gates
           earlier, didn't you? - A. Yes.

        Q. So it was quite in order for you then to say yes right
           away? - A. It would have been, yes.

        Q. No doubt you thought it should have been already opened
           in any case? - A. No.

        Q. You did not? - A. No. As I say, I believed it was C
           gate only but bear in mind I do know, as I outlined to
           you, the layout of Sheffield Wednesday Football Ground
           and I know that should you open gate A they will not go
           on to the concourse. They will go to an area by the
           North Stand.
        Q. Did you ever receive a request for gate B to be opened?
           - A. Not specifically, no.

        Q. PC Buxton's request to delay the kick-off, that came
           before Sergeant Higgins' request to open gate A, didn't
           it? - A. That is something I don't know. I cannot tell
           you.

        Q. You do not know the time? - A. I just don't know that.

        Q. But we do know he was told,    Did you tell him that it
           was too late? - A. Yes.

        Q.   You said, "No, we can't delay it"? - A. Yes.

        Q.    Did   the opening    of   gate C have something to dowithit,
             that because the gate had been opened that may be it
             was too late? - A. You are looking at a stage where a
             team ran out on to the field. The request was made as
             they ran out. There were a number of factors but one
             factor is that because the gates had been opened the
             crush has been relieved outside and you would think



H
                                                               48
                                                        M. GODDARD


     then with a few more minutes that more people would be
     in at the start, of a game but I did also say that
     whether it be a Semi Final or not you would never get
     everyone in on time. You always hope to but if a
     person chooses not to come on time I would say that is
     something we cannot cater for.

Q. You said it was very difficult to send the players back
   in once they had come out. That would be a very
   difficult thing to do? - A. It would be a situation I
   had never heard of before certainly.

Q. You would say that was a unique situation, sending the
   players back? - A. I am sorry.

Q. Would you say that would be a unique situation, to send
   the players back in? - A. I think it would, yes. I
   have never known of an occasion where players have been
   out on a field ready to start a match where they have
   been taken off. I could be totally wrong but I have
   never known an occasion.

Q. The players were taken off at 3.06, weren’t they? - A.
   Of course.

Q. They had to go off then? - A. Yes, the match was
   stopped.
Q. If it would have been really necessary it could have
   been done earlier? - A. It could. It could have been
   done.
Q. So would you agree it is never too late to do the
   correct thing and go by the rules of the Safety
   Certificate?

Q.       THE CORONER:   You do not have to answer that
     question because that may be an incriminating question
     but you cam do if you wish. - A. I am sorry, I have
     lost it.

          THE CORONER:   Repeat the question, Mrs. McBrien.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN: Would you agree it is never too
     late to do the correct thing and keep to the rules of
     the Safety Certificate? - A. That is correct, yes, I
     would.
Q. It was obvious from what you said yesterday that the
   assessment that was made from the Control Room about
   the conditions in the pens on Leppings Lane terrace is
   totally unsatisfactory. You cannot get a true picture.

                                                         M. GODDARD


          THE CORONER:    No, Mrs. McBrien.

        MRS. McBRIEN: I am not being very critical but
   what I am trying to say is —

          THE CORONER:    It is sounds very critical to me.

        MRS. McBRIEN: It may have come over like that but
   you cannot really get the true sense.

Q. You said you could not even see what was happening in
   pen 6 or how many people were really there, could
   you? - A. You can see heads in pen 6 but what I do say
   to you is that the Control Room is part and parcel of a
   larger area in relation to heads. It is not just one
   box that says we have sole responsibility for that,
   that and that. Other people will assist us and that is
   why we talked earlier on about a team effort and that
   is why I relate to a team effort.

Q. Yes, that is how I understand it and you also have to
   look at the whole ground, do you not? - A. Yes.

Q. It is not a case of just looking at pens 1 to 7 on the
   West Terrace? - A. It is the total ground.

Q. You have got the stands and you have got the Spion Kop
   and so you may not choose to look at that area at a
   particular time because you may be concentrating on
   another part? - A. You may be but certainly on this
   particular date the great concentration was given to
   the Leppings Lane end. Very, very little was given to
   the Kop at all.

Q. Even if Officers, as you say, were looking at that
   particular area that day and there were even Officers
   on the perimeter track who were there to do that as
   well in close proximity to the centre pens weren't
   there standing on the perimeter track? - A. Yes.

Q. There were also Officers in the West Stand?

        THE CORONER: Mrs. McBrien, I do not think we need
   to go into that. I think we will stop at this point
   for a few minutes.  I am not stopping you but I think
   we need a break. We will stop until twelve o'clock.
   How much more have you got?

          MRS. McBRIEN:    I haven't got much at all, half a
  page.

          THE CORONER:    We will still stop.

                                                             M. GODDARD


                             (Short Adjournment)

Q.       MRS. McBRIEN: Sergeant Goddard, it seemed that
     the only way that Police Officers could have
     satisfactorily assessed the true situation in those
     pens was to be in the pens themselves. Would you agree
     with that?

          THE CORONER: No. That is not a proper question
     of this Officer. I am not saying that is the answer
     but I am just saying, it is not a proper question.

Q.       MRS. McBRIEN: Would you say from their positions
     though, in the Control Room, the perimeter track and
     the West Stand, their reactions - and I am not
     criticising them for it - were slower than they might
     have been had they been positioned on the terrace?

          THE CORONER: No, I do not think you can ask that
     either. You can ask, which you have done, whether the
     view from the Control Room had limitations. That is I
     think what you are asking, is it not? That is what you
     are saying?

             MRS. McBRIEN:    Oh yes, definitely.

             THE CORONER:    That is the point, is it not?

          MRS. McBRIEN: Yes, and also the other views seem
     to be having limitations too.

          THE CORONER: Yes, but he cannot give evidence of
     that because he was in the Control Room.

             MRS. McBRIEN:    Of course.

Q.        THE CORONER:   Is it correct, Sergeant Goddard,
     your evidence is that the view of the terraces and
     indeed other parts of the ground from the Control Room
     is limited because of angle, distance and location? -
     A. It does have its limitations, sir, yes.

          THE CORONER: That is right, is it not?        That is
     what you are trying to establish?

             MRS. McBRIEN:    Yes, thank you.

             THE CORONER:    That is legitimate and I do not mind
     that.

             MRS. McBRIEN:    Yes, thank you.

        Q. You had seen very large crowds outside the turnstile
           area before gate C was opened, hadn't you? - A. Yes.

    B   Q. It appears that no one in the Control Room saw anything
           unusual happening when those crowds went into the
           ground. They did not notice anything unusual on the
           terrace as a result of the opening of the gate? - A.
           No, that is correct, nothing untoward, no.

        Q. If the Control Room would have noticed something or let
           us say if somebody in closer proximity to the things
           that were happening in the terrace had alerted the
           Control Room before dangerous densities had been
           reached then obviously the Control Room would have
           taken immediate action, would it not? - A. Immediate,
           yes.

        Q. Of course, it was realised at some point that there was
           a serious situation there when the game was stopped,
           was it not? - A. It was realised there was a serious
           situation prior to the game being stopped, yes.

        Q. So at that stage were you asked to put an emergency
           coded message out that day once the situation was
           known? — A. No.

        Q. Would you agree that would have helped all the people,
           the Officers and the fans in the stadium if there would
           have been a message? - A. No.

        Q. You don't? - A. No. You have just asked about a coded
           message. How would the fans know what the coded
           message would be about? That would be my first
           question. I take it you are talking about the Mr.
           Meadows message, is that what you are meaning?

        Q. Yes. - A. That is in relation to Police Officers and to
           stewards. The crowd, and bear in mind the Sheffield
           crowd now know what that is all about, but we are
           talking of Nottingham and Liverpool who would not know
           what the heck was happening there.

        Q. No, I quite understand, but the Police Officers would
           go to their various positions once they had been given
           am instruction, wouldn't they? - A. Yes, they would.

        Q. So they would have been assisting the fans then once
           they knew the situation? - A. No, they would have gone
           to gates all around the ground. Where the assistance
           was required was a specific area on Leppings Lane and
           what we would have got was a diversification of Police
           Officers all over the ground and so, no, I don't
           believe that would have been a correct measure at all.

Q. You could not have put out an emergency message that
   day? - A. An emergency message could have been put out,
   yes, which would relate to the Police and to the
   stewards but what we are doing there is that you are
   taking them away from the place they are required to
   other areas of the ground, to all the other exits on
   the ground.
Q. Could you put a message out asking the fans to move
   right out of the tunnel from the back of the pens?

            THE CORONER:   That is a different question.

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN: So that there was a way clear to
     get at the injured people? - A. This was done. This
     was done on tannoy.
Q. It was? - A. Yes. Repeated messages went from the
   tannoy, not from me personally but I know that they
   went out asking the fans to move back, yes.

Q. Yes, I know there was a tannoy message put out to ask
   people to move back but that would not be enough, would
   it? They would not realise perhaps that people were
   injured at the front of the pen. They would wonder why
   they were being asked to move back?

          THE CORONER: I do not think you should explore
     that, Mrs. McBrien. We have to accept the situation as
     it is or as it was.
Q.        MRS. McBRIEN: There may have been injuries, and I
     stress that word really. I am not being callous in any
     way when I say that but we do know that it was only a
     possibility of serious injuries and deaths outside.
     That was an assumption really, wasn't it?

          THE CORONER: No, I do not think, Mrs. McBrien,
     that is a proper question to this witness. No, it is
     not a proper question to this witness. I know it is a
     point you are anxious about but it is not a proper
     question.
Q.          MRS. McBRIEN: Whatever the situation there we
     know   that some measures were needed to be taken and
     some   were taken, weren't they? Extra Officers were
     sent   there and tannoy messages were put out there.
     Some   things were done, weren't they? - A. They were,
     yes.

                                                         M. GODDARD


    Q. We do know that there were lots and lots of Injuries
       and 95 deaths after gate C was opened, don't we? Those
       are facts? - A. Those are facts, yes.
B
    Q. You were very familiar with the ground, weren't you? -
       A. Yes.
    Q. You had readily accepted the tried and tested system of
       Mr. Mole? - A. Yes.

    Q. The 'find your own level' and you had seen it working
       very satisfactorily at the 1987 and 1988 Semi Finals? -
       A. Yes, plus other matches, yes.

    Q. Even without Police control on the terrace the system
       did work? - A. Yes, it did work.

    Q. It had been proved to work? - A. Yes.




                                      /Q. But on both those.

Q.-But on both those occasions Leppings Lane was not
   closed to traffic before the match, and exit gates had
   not been opened to allow the entry of fans, had it? -
   A. I don't know about the traffic part, I honestly
   cannot tell you about the traffic part, but certainly
   the exit gates had never been opened, yes.

Q. No. You say you don't know about LeppingsLane.          A lot
   of evidence ....

          THE CORONER:   Mrs. McBrien, no. He has said he
     does not know, that is sufficient. What is the
     question?

Q.        MRS. McBRIEN:   So it would be extremely difficult
     for Police Officers to cope that day once those
     decisions were made, would you agree with that?

          THE CORONER:   No, Mrs. McBrien.  It does not
     matter whether he agrees with it or not.

          MRS. McBRIEN:    That is all.   Thank you very much.

                Cross-Examined bv MR. RUSSELL

Q. Sergeant, I have only got a very few matters Iwant        to
   cover with you. First of all, do you know
   Superintendent Greenwood? - A. I do, sir, yes.
Q. Can you please confirm for me    whether this is right,
   namely between about 2.30 and    3 o'clock can you confirm
   that Superintendent Greenwood    did not visit the Control
   Box? - A. What was your first    time, sir?

Q.       THE CORONER:     2.30. - A. No, he didn't.

Q.        MR. RUSSELL:    Are you sure about that? - A. I am
     positive, yes.

Q. Yesterday when you were giving your evidence you
   described Superintendent Greenwood being behind the
   Leppings Lane goal, trying to transmit on the radio, is
   that right? - A. Yes, that is correct, sir.

Q. Signalling to the Control Box with his arms? - A. Yes.

Q. And subsequently running onto the field to stop the
   match? - A. Yes.

Q. Subsequently in your evidence you described the role
   played by Chief Inspector McRobbie? - A. Yes.

Q. I just want to clarify the order of your observation
   and try and establish precisely what you saw and when


                                24 6
                                                             2J

                                                   M.GODDARD


     you saw it. First of all, Mr. McRobbie's role: as far
     as you knew what was the purpose of Mr. McRobbie
     leaving the Control Box and going down to the pitch? -
     A. It was in relation to the Police lady who was by
     Gate 1, that she appeared to be unaware of what was
     happening and the fans were coming onto the track, and
     so to take them off, open Gate 1 and put them into Pen


Q.    So the role assumed by him was to shepherd or direct
     fans towards Gate 1? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. I wonder if you might be helped as to when that
   occurred in view of the order you gave your
   recollection yesterday, by looking at C534? - A. Yes,
   sir.

Q. Can you see Mr. McRobbie in that photograph? - A. I
   think he is at the bottom right hand corner.

Q. With his left hand outstretched, pointing to the left?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Apparently directing people to the left? - A. Yes.

Q.    Is that in accordance withyour recollection of what he
     set out to do when he left the Control Box? - A. Yes.

Q. That photograph, Sergeant, was taken at exactly 3
   o'clock. Would that be in accordance with your
   recollection of when he left the Control Box in order
   to do that? - A. Approximately, yes.

Q. Just for completeness you can see, can you not, that
   the gate open in the perimeter fence towards the left
   hand bottom corner of that photograph is, in fact, Gate
   1?- A. That is correct, yes, sir.

Q. That would be almost immediately below the Police
   Control Box? - A. Yes.

Q. Can I then move on in time and try and put in order the
   events that you described yesterday? You described
   Superintendent Greenwood behind the Leppings Lane goal,
   making a signal to the Control Box? - A. Yes.

Q. Can you remember what that signal was? - A. He was
   crossing his arms.  It was just like an arms crossed
   signal.

Q. I wonder if you would be assisted by looking at
   photograph C529? - A. Yes.
                                              M. GODDARD


You can see there Superintendent Greenwood, can you
not? - A. I can, yes.

Is that the position he was in when you recall him
making   the signal to Control? - A. No, not at all. He
was on   the ground, he was by the goal, and thatwas my
recollection of Mr. Greenwood, not as on that
photograph.

He does appear in that photograph to be looking at the
Control Box? - A. He does, yes.
And making some movement with his arras, making some
gesture with his arms? - A. Yes.

As I understand your evidence you don't recall seeing
him in that position? - A. I certainly can't remember
seeing  him in that position at all, no, sir.

I see.    Do you have any recollection of seeing
Superintendent Greenwood at that position up on the
fence? - A. No, sir, I don't.

You say you saw him trying to transmit? - A. Yes, it
was fairly obvious he was trying to transmit to us.

I wonder if you could look at another photograph," C530?
This is a photograph taken a minute or so after the
last one you were shown, Sergeant, and in the top left
hand corner can you see Superintendent Greenwood? - A.
Yes, I can.

He appears to be using his radio? - A. Yes.

But as I understand it, your recollection of him trying
to transmit was an effort made by him from a position
other than the one we see him in, in that photograph? -
A. Yes, that is my recollection, yes, sir.

Do you remember, you say you saw him trying to
transmit, whether he had any success? Was there any
message received from Superintendent Greenwood in the
Control Box? - A. There was one message received from.
Mr. Greenwood, and that was, "Stop the match". That
came through loud and clear but it had been fairly
obvious that he had been trying beforehand, we had •
received nothing whatsoever, then this came through,
"Stop the match .

But as I understand your evidence, you understood first
of all from the gestures that he was trying to
communicate that to the Control Box? - A. Yes.

                                                M. GODDARD


Q. But then finally his actual radio message came through?
   - A. His actual radio came through, "Stop the match",
   and then the next thing I saw was he was going on the
   field.

Q. His going on the field was to stop the match and you
   saw him stop the match? - A. Yes.

Q. Finally, Sergeant, can I ask you whether you received
   any message from Inspector Charles in the immediate
   aftermath of the match being stopped? - A. I did, yes,
   sir. The message from Mr. Charles was he had got 5 and
   50 available for deployment.

Q. Right, pause there. What did you understand he meant
   by 5 and 50? - A. Five Sergeants, 50 men.

Q. That is five serials, would that be right? - A. Five
   serials, yes.

Q. Please carry on, what was the rest of the message? - A.
   He asked for deployment.

Q. So he was contacting the Control Box, finding out what
   he should do with his five serials of men? - A. That is
   correct, sir.

Q. Who gave him any instructions as to deployment? - A. I
   don't know if it was Mr. Murray or myself, but I know
   what the instruction was.

Q. What was it? - A. The instruction was to go down the
   tunnel and clear as many fans out of the central pens
   as possible.

Q. From the back? - A. From the back, yes.

Q. You were dealing, no doubt, with a series of radio
   messages in the Control Box at that time and I wonder
   if we can try and fit in when the message came through
   and the instruction went out to Inspector Charles in
   relation to other messages that you received. First of
   all, can I establish do you remember precisely what
   time Inspector Charles radioed to the Control Box? - A.
   No, I am sorry, I can't, sir.

Q. Do you remember there being a time when Operational
   Support was requested?- A. Yes.

Q. Can you confirm that the message from Inspector Charles
   was before the request for Operational Support was
   made? - A. I believe Mr. Charles' message, or Mr.
   Charles came through before Operational Support.

Q. We know, or we have an idea when that was you see,
   Sergeant, but I described it as being in the immediate
   aftermath of the match being stopped. Would that be a
   fair description of the timing of Inspector Charles'
   message?- A. I don't know, sir. That is something I
   don't know. I didn't see the match stopped at all. I
   was totally unaware of that.

Q. Did you subsequently see Officers arrive at the back of
   Pens 3 and 4? - A. I did, yes, sir.

Q. When you saw that did you make any connection between
   that sight and the radio conversation with Inspector
   Charles? - A. Yes, my first thoughts were, "John
   Charles and his blokes". All I could see really was
   helmets. I couldn't see individuals, but helmets.

Q. So quite clearly the radio conversation with Inspector
   Charles preceded your sight of those Officers in the
   back of Pens 3 and 4? - A. Yes.

Q. Thank you very much, Sergeant.

        THE CORONER:   Mr. Maxwell?

        MR. MAXWELL:   No questions, sir.

        THE CORONER:  Just one minute, Mr. Payne. I have
   got a few from the Jury and then I will let you go.

                  Further by THE CORONER

Q. These are questions from the Jury, okay? - A. Yes.

Q. On the day of this disaster can you remember Mr. Murray
   actually turning down any suggestions which you might
   have made to him? - A. No, I can't, sir.

Q. On how many different occasions, if you are able to
   say, have you worked with the other Police Officers who
   were with you in the Police Control Box, prior to 15th
   April, 1989 - as a team, in other words? - A. As a team
   certainly for one full season, and with P.C. Ryan - he
   was there when I went in the Box.

Q. Would you be there as a regular team when matches were
   on? - A. Yes, sir.
Q. Apart from the Coventry and Leeds match where the kick-
   off was delayed, which I think you can remember? - A.
   Yes.

                                                M. GODDARD


Q. Have you been involved in any other match where kick-
   off was, in fact, delayed? - A. No, sir, not pre that
   semi-final.

Q. Yes, that is what the question is. In your time as a
   radio operator at the Ground did you previously have
   any sort of problems with the radio transmissions? - A.
   Yes, I think it was '88 our transmissions again were


Q. Perhaps I ought to say apart from interference from
   local radio. You don't have to explain that, we have
   heard of that, but apart from that? - A. Not
   particularly. The radio was not probably as good as it
   should be because of the age of it, and a lot of it
   again depended on the weather.  Sometimes when the
   weather was not very good the radio communications
   would not be very good, but on that particular day it
   was a very, very fine day and I would have anticipated
   the radio frequencies would have been okay.




                             /Q. So no significant

                                                    M. GODDARD


Q.   So no significant problems apart from the interference
     in 1988? - A. That is correct, yes.

Q.   That would be right, would it? - A. Yes.

Q.   Were you aware of any objects being thrown at the
     Control Box by fans in an attempt to attract your
     attention to the terraces? - A. None whatsoever, sir,
     no.

Q.   Nothing like that?'- A. No, not at all, sir.

Q.   You did not hear anybody call or shout into the
     Control Box? - A. No. One of the things that I have
     never explained is the noise levels within there. You
     wouldn't hear individual shouts by any stretch of the
     imagination. It just could not be done.

Q.   But you definitely did not hear coins or objects? - A.
     Not at all, no sir.

Q.   I want to ask you one other question about something
     which I should have done and forgotten, a message.
     Apart from Superintendent Greenwood whom you said you
     could see was having difficulty with his radio and
     then eventually it did come through, can you recollect
     whether any track Officers around that time, by which
     I mean between 2 minutes to 3 and 5 minutes past 3, or
     thereabouts, attempted to communicate with you? - A.
     There was one message, and I don’t know who it was
     from, but it was certainly from Leppings Lane track.
     Now who the author was I do not know, because it was
     broken, but we got Leppings Lane track, but who it was
     I don't know.

Q.   Is that all the message that you can remember? - A.
     That is all I can at this stage remember, yes sir.

Q. I am not asking you to give me verbatim what it was,
    but that in itself is meaningless, is it not? - A.
    Yes.

Q. Was it any more meaningful on the day? - A. With the
    volumes there, I can only assume, and it is only an
    assumption now --

Q.   No, no, I want to know what you heard. - A.    At that
      time, no.

Q.   I do not want you to reconstruct what it might have
      said. What I want to know is what you heard. - A. No,
     as I say, all I heard was something about Leppings
      Lane track, but what the gist of the message was, it
     was totally broken, I just didn't know.

           Cross-Examined by MR. PAYNE:

Sergeant Goddard, just one general question, please,
prefaced with this. Can you tell the Jury how long
you have been a serving Police Officer? - A. I was a
Cadet for Sheffield City in 1959 and appointed Police
Officer in 1962.

For how long have you been a Sergeant? - A. October
1976.

Without going into detail, as part of your duty you
have to attend at all manner of events and
emergencies? - A. Yes sir.

I want you to put the event when you were in the
Control Box and you started to receive the calls from
Mr. Marshall outside to open the gates because
otherwise someone would be killed, just put that in
the circumstances in which it happened, put that in
the context of your experience as a Police Officer.
How does this rank in terms of emergencies that you
have been involved in? - A. The most dire emergency
certainly. I had never known anything before like
this at all.

     THE CORONER: Sergeant Goddard, I am most
grateful to you for being here. Thank you very much
for helping us.

     What we are now going to do is we are going to
hear Mr. Bichard in a moment. We are going to press
on today, but what I want to do is you will remember
you were asking about the video, and I think we will
show this video now of the scene as far as we have got
it at Leppings Lane. In fact, it was, of course,
taken by Mr. Bichard so it is a convenient time to
actually look at it, but I am going to get Mr. Killoch
who has actually selected the piece out that we need
to describe it.

              JOHN KILLOCH Recalled

                 By THE CORONER:

Give your name so we know who you are. - A. Sergeant
John Killoch, sir, West Midlands Police. I have just
taken a short sequence from one of the South Yorkshire
Police videos, which shows pictures taken from one of
the CCTV cameras situated at the ground on 15th April.
These show scenes inside Leppings Lane of the Leppings
Lane pens, the West Stand.  I should mention, sir, I
think the Jury are already aware but some of the
                                                 J.   K IL L O C H


     pictures are in what they call time lapse, so that it
     will jump.

          THE CORONER: Yes.   It is not very long, about 10
     or 15 minutes.
Q.   Before we start, can you remember what time the
     sequence begins? - A. It starts, sir, at approximately
     15.02 and the first few frames are actually shown on
     the concourse area, and then the camera moves into the
     West Stand.

     MR. BEECHEY:   That is C.539.

     THE CORONER:   Have got an identification number or
something on the tape so that we know?

     MR. KILLOCH:   Yes, sir.   The original
identification is TB.l.   That is the West Midlands
Police reference.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Maxwell?

     MR. MAXWELL: ..Sir, I am here today as you might
have guessed in order to present to you written
submissions on law of the Sheffield City Council.    I
would normally do that, of course, at the end of the
evidence.   That may yet be possible, but perhaps not
today, but we obviously want to comply with your
timetable.   At the moment it is a bit like Blue Peter,
"Here is one I made earlier"!   Sir, in due course, it
will be presented.
     Sir, there are certain matters I would wish to raise
with you now and which might be better dealt with in the
absence of the Jury, with our leave, sir.

                (The Jury left Court)

     MR. MAXWELL:   Sir, I have kept up with the evidence
in these Inquests with my daily dose of transcript and
the comments I make to you now concern the ending of
these Inquests and the ending of the evidence.   They are
intended to be helpful.   I hope they are not taken as
some forensic cri de coeur, but there may be an element
of that in it.
     Sir, you may remember that case where the evidence
that went before an Inquest was likened to the tip of an
iceberg.   Normally, of course, icebergs get smaller but
there is at least a risk, sir, of the evidence here
getting larger in quantum and may be getting unbalanced.
Alternatively it may be that the Jury is about to be
asked to look unnecessarily below the water .line.

     I know you have considered this already but there
are reasons why in my respectful submission you could
reconsider the point.   Messrs. Goddard, Bichard and Ryan
have run as a trio, or Goddard and Bichard as a duo, for
a long time in these proceedings.   I know you have
considered already just how far one should go with their
evidence*

     Sir, I comfort myself in asking you to reconsider
the position with two thoughts.   The first is that you
have always shown that as your own man, and as very
                       255
                                                          64




clearly master of your own court, you take a flexible
approach where it is necessary and are prepared to
reconsider decisions in the interests of justice and
never so as to produce an injustice. We are all very
much aware of that and have seen that constantly
throughout these Inquests.

     Sir, the second matter I draw to your attention is
that the Jury has now heard the senior man of the three,
Sergeant Goddard.   The question I raise for you to
consider, sir, is this: is it necessary now for the Jury
to go further into the evidence of Police Constable
Bichard or, if it was still your intention, Police
Constable Ryan?   I pose the question in the form: does
justice require that?   It may be there is not now any
dissenting voice that would say that justice does require
further evidence to be called.

     Sir, we have just seen what may be the most moving
end to the evidence that could have been imagined and
that is that video we have just seen.   We all
appreciate, sir, that you have made great efforts and
have succeeded in large measure in producing an orderly
version of the evidence and your determination is quite
clear in producing that.

      I come back, as you know, intermittently.   May I
put it this way, I feel at the moment as though I am a
spectator where I see these finely tuned athletes who
have been competing in some marathon going towards the
finishing line and as I perceive it, going over the
finishing line.    Sir, you may now, with the greatest of
respect, be in overrun.    That is, you may have gone, and
in my perception and I say it with respect, have gone
over the finishing line.    I would invite you to consider
then whether it is necessary to go any further with the
evidence.    I say that with great respect, knowing from
the transcript that you have considered the matter
carefully.    Now you have gone part way with the evidence
of those Officers in the Control Box, it would be
appropriate, I respectfully say, to reconsider that.'

     THE CORONER:   Does anybody want to add anything?
As I understand what you are saying, Mr. Maxwell, is that
having heard Mr. Goddard is there really any need to hear
Mr. Bichard?

     MR. MAXWELL:   Exactly.
     THE CORONER:   Mr. Ryan I had definitely decided not
to hear.   I can tell you that already, on the basis of
what I have heard and also what I have read, of course.



                        256
                                                         65




     It is just really a question of whether we have
Mr. Bichard or not.   Mr. King perhaps you want to say
something?

     MR. KING:   I may need to have my memory refreshed.
The only matters I would want to examine Mr. Bichard on
may have been examined, bar one.     Sir, the position of
the cameras and, sir, my recollection is there is one
camera in the middle of the South Stand which provides a
frontal view of the terraces and that would include the
frontal view of pen 6.     Sir, if that is already in
evidence, then I am ..content, but I know I would get that
evidence through Mr. Bichard.

     THE CORONER:   I think we have had it tangentially.
That is in fact the way the camera looks, but that is in
fact the way we have had the evidence as well.

     MR. KING:   Sir, there were two cameras in relation
to the Leppings Lane end, as I understand it.   One which
you could look along - parallel - with the fence and be
inside the terrace if you wish, and one where you can
look frontally.   As long as that is in evidence, sir, I
am content on that aspect.
      Numbers 2 and 3, sir, is a matter for you, because
it raises the issue of the message which left the Control
Box possibly, but certainly left Snig Hill to the
ambulance service, as to what had happened.    There are
two aspects to that, one is the the message we^know^which
left the Force Room and whether or not any Officer is
prepared to say anything from the Control Room side as to
how that happened. The second aspect is the direct
question which I raised with Mr. Jackson and raised with
Mr. Duckenfield as to whether Mr. Duckenfield ever said
in their presence, or obviously Mr. Duckenfield said an
explanation which was to the effect the gates had been
stormed, broken down or so forth.    You will know, sir,
from the transcript of Mr. Bichard at the Taylor Inquiry
that he gave evidence that he heard him say words to that
effect.

     It is a matter of ruling for you, sir, whether that
is a matter I can go into.
     There is the cameras matter, sir, which may be dealt
with and the narrow issue which I do not want to abandon,
and I will abide by your ruling.




             THE CORONER:   As you know

                         &0 <
                                                          6 6


     THE CORONER: As you know we discussed this when
Mr. Jackson was here and it is quite clear in my mind
in so far as the question arises as to whether that
caused any deaths the answer must be no because
whatever Mr. Duckenfield may or may not have said
within the Control Room at whatever time it was, 3.30
or thereabouts - so the only point at issue is the
point as to whether or not it is necessary to explore
them for the purpose of the Inquest from the point of
view of credibility.

       MR. KING:   Absolutely, sir.

       THE CORONER:   You would agree with that, would
you?
       MR. KING:   I agree entirely, sir.

     THE CORONER: I have got very mixed feelings about
it because my inclination is that it will not be of
very much assistance to us.   I have got no objection I
think - I mean what we are now saying is what I tried
to suggest yesterday, that we pick out from these
gentlemen the bits which we have not yet heard. We
have taken Mr. Goddard in considerably greater detail
and that makes it a lot easier with regard to Mr.
Bichard. I am inclined to call Mr. Bichard and
restrict his evidence to what we absolutely essentially
need, namely to sort out the camera angles which is the
point you have raised. I think we have explored the
message side. I will think about it over lunch and I
will come back in the absence of the Jury. We will
reconvene without the Jury so that I can tell you what
I think about that definitively, so to speak, on that
point.
     MR. CATCHPOLE: Is it possible for you to indicate
what other evidence there may well be called?

     THE CORONER: The only other evidence there is is
Dr. Slater who we have messed around from pillar to
post and whether we can get him this afternoon I do not
know now because I thought we would not need him.
There is only Dr. Slater which is about a five minute
job, if I can put it like that, just crossing a few Ts.


    Secondly, I did say we would have a look at the BBC
video tape with the sound edited out, if you remember ,
from five past to quarter past. It is Mr. Motson's
commentary in effect and I did say that we would see
that. In any case I know Mrs. McBrien was very keen to
see it again. It is very difficult to actually focus
on what is happening when you see the match play. So I
want to show that.

                             258
                                                          67
    The third matter is that I want to deal with about
four sets of documentary evidence. They are all
totally non-controversial. I am sorry, there are five
sets of documentary evidence. One is PC Smith's
statement. I want to formally declare the post mortem
reports form part and parcel of the Inquest
documentation. I do not intend to read 95 PH reports.
It is never my habit to do it. I have done it twice
actually but in this particular case we have heard all
the salient evidence. I did not in so many words in
each of the interim Inquests and say, "What is more the
document on which this evidence is based forms part and
parcel of the Inquests". I want to say that, if you
like, because it forms part of the caucus of knowledge.

    I also want to say the same with regard to the
questionnaires. I had sent out questionnaires to all
the families after the event where they confirm name,
address, age, that sort of thing, and that was all
referred to in the interim Inquests as well but again I
merely referred to it and I want to say that this
constitutes part and parcel of the documentation so
that we have got it right, so to speak. Unless
somebody raises a specific point I do not intend to
read it again because we will hear it all during the
summing up, all the relevant bits, or during the
conclusion.

    We had to send out a few more questionnaires to a
few families were there were youngsters where we needed
to know something about the mothers and matters like
that. That is it. So there is not really very much
left evidentially. Certainly 95 per cent of it is
totally non-controversial and is merely a matter of
tidying up. Can I take it nobody is going to want me
to read again every single PM report because I do not
think there is any benefit in that?

     MR. KING: I always hesitate to say anything
without receiving instructions but my initial
inclination is that I do not. Sir, can I just draw
your attention to the transcript of Mr. Bichard at the
Taylor Inquiry, page 68, the afternoon cross-
examination by Mr. Gibson-Watt which is the
conversation I would want to have a look at in -
examination with him and at pages 75-56, sir, where
matters are put to him by Mr. Kalipetis about the
messages which were emanating from various sources
round about eight minutes past three to thirteen
minutes past three as to the cause being in some way
the gates having been collapsed by spectators. There
were three sources from which it was being put out and
whether he had any knowledge of how that came about
given his position within the Control Box.

     THE CORONER: It is the bottom of page 75 and the
top of page 76, is it not?

     MR. KING:   Sir, yes, indeed.

     MR. ISAACS: It is also on page 54 where he also
gives evidence about those matters saying that he
believed they could have been through a monitoring of
the personal radio channel No. 25 and, therefore, not
emanating from the Control Box. It is page 54E-G.

     MR. KING: It is obviously a matter for
investigation, sir, and you will see his reply at page
76B of the transcript-

     THE CORONER: May I just look at page 75 of the
transcript? I did look at these last night but I need
to refresh my memory. It is fair, Mr. King, that on
page 76 he denies sending that message.

     MR. KING: Undoubtedly, sir. The difficulty I am
in, sir, is that it is a matter for assessment by the
Jury when they have heard - there is no...

     THE CORONER:   There is no Jury here.

     MR. KING:   Is the witness here, sir?

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Bichard has gone.

     MR. KING: It is a matter for the Jury to assess
whether, given all these denials from a Control Box
which on one view of the evidence was instrumental -
take the calling for ambulances and so forth - that
those are denials which they can accept and if they
cannot accept them then that reflects on the general
credibility of the witnesses from the Control Box on
every issue they have been asked about and that is why
it is important, sir. That is what I would ask you to
consider.

     THE CORONER:   Did you want to say something, Mr.
Payne?

     MR. PAYNE: While you are considering the matter
over the adjournment, our submission is that the
question is, in what respect is this relevant to the
question of how the disaster occurred? That is really
what we think might be helpful.

     THE CORONER: I can see both sides of the coin.
Clearly if you say to me, did this disaster occur
because something was said to somebody whcih was
incorrect, let us assume that for a minute that that is
the case, did that cause the disaster? The answer must
be definitely not. The point that Mr. King is making -

                                                          69

and you would accept that, would you not - is that if
somebody cannot be believed on (a) then can you believe
him on (b)?

     MR. PAYNE: Actually on this point there is an
explanation for it because it was I who introduced this
transcript and the witness who was dealing with it said
that he thought it might have been overheard by the
radio operator at Snigg Hill on the general chatter
that was going on with the talk through.

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Bichard says at page 55--

     MR. KING: This is all a matter for argument but
it all has to tie in with evidence, if it comes out, on
what Mr. Bichard may say if you allow me to ask him the
question as to what Mr. Ouckenfield said in the passage
I have referred you to.

     MR. ISAACS: One of the things that concerns me
with the approach which may well be adopted and which
is being suggested by Mr. King, that is taking snippets
here and there and asking Mr. Bichard just about this,
is that contrary to what was being suggested, if I may
say so with respect by my learned friend, Mr. Maxwell,
it starts to take things out of context again. I
hesitate to say it but as we had with Mr. Crawford
(sic) there was something there for everybody if I
could put it that way and only to take those little
bits of Mr. Bichard's evidence where there may be
something in it for Mr. King again seems to me to be,
with respect, unfair.
     THE CORONER:   You mean Sergeant Goddard but you
said Crawford.

     MR. ISAACS: Yes, I do apologise, I meant Mr.
Goddard. It does appear to me, sir, to echo what Mr.
Maxwell was saying, you have to start thinking very
carefully where are some of these issues leading us.
How far do they help us with the question how? How far
do even these question of 'credibility' help the Jury
in relation to the how? We have got no issue between,
as I understand it, anybody saying one thing and
anybody else saying another so that the Jury if they do
not like Mr. A's credibility can choose Mr. B's. That
is not the situation we have here and this is not a
criminal trial.   I do ask you to think very seriously,
sir, before we start going down the paths which have
been suggested. That is really all I want to say. ^ We
could just put an end to it, to echo my learned friend,
Mr. Maxwell, now.    There was something for everybody
with Mr. Goddard quite clearly having regard to the
length of time he was giving evidence.

     MR. KING: Believe it or not, sir, I was only
trying to be helpful to identify the issues which we
have not been over and I was mindful of your words
yesterday that you did not want repetition in going
over old ground that had been exhausted. I accepted
that, sir, and I have merely identified because you
invited me to whether any additional points which I
considered had not already been dealt with and I did.

     THE CORONER:  Indeed and I have understood you. I
have also understood Mr. Isaacs. Let us have lunch and
I will come back at two o'clock and hopefully by then I
will have got something inside me and will have
clarified my mind. ._
                 LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENT




                           262
            (In the absence of the Jury)

     THE CORONER:   Mr. Maxwell, I always listen to you
with the greatest of attention, as I hope I do to you
all, because I know that your interventions, which are
infrequent, are always thoughtful and done with a view
to assisting me in coming to a decision, but I think in
this particular instance I will call Mr. Bichard.
There is no point in repeating what we already know and
I therefore intend to take him as shortly as is
possible.

     The second point is the issue which you have
raised, Mr. King, with regard to the overheard
conversation.  I have been reflecting on this and my
position basically is exactly the same as it was when
this issue came up with Mr. Jackson, so my ruling on
this is that I think it will be proper to ask - indeed
I may well do it myself with a view to establishing
what, in fact, happened in the Control Room - what I
would consider to be improper and going beyond the
scope of the Inquest is to draw the conclusions from
it, because that is a matter in the end for the Jury.
So I will accept that we can explore what he said
happened in the Control Room within his hearing. We
don t know what he is going to say but if need be we
can show him the transcripts, and if need be we will
show him all three pages.

     With regard to the order, I think it would be
right in the circumstances if Mr. Isaacs goes last and
you immediately precede him, if that is satisfactory.
So I will start, Mr. Manning can follow -- Mr.
Maxwell,   if he has any questions.

     Mr.   Maxwell, I am very conscious, of course, that
you are sitting here and you may feel that you don't
want to be here, but it is to do with the legal
submission. I don't know what to say to you on that
point. It seems to me we will not finish all the
evidence today whatever happens, because Dr. Slater has
disappeared, if I can use that word, for the weekend,
so I cannot get him here this afternoon, so whatever
happens we have got to run into Monday on his evidence,
which is   brief and not controversial. Depending on how
long we take with Mr. Bichard, if it is quick then I
might read Mr. Smith's evidence today because then we
have finished for all practical purposes matters which
are likely to cause contention, and Mr. Smith's won't
cause contention - if I thought it did I would not be
able to read it. So it is up to you whether you feel
you want to stay, whether you feel you want to give me
your submission with the reservation that you might
want to amend it in the light of anything that is said,
                                                      72




I don't know. I want to be as reasonable and as
helpful as I can be.

     MR. MAXWELL:   I will hand it in today with that
reservation, which is highly unlikely to be taken
advantage of, thank you.

     THE CORONER:  Are we clear as to what we are
doing? Jury and then Mr. Bichard.

     MR. ISAACS:    I was going to say      one thing,sir,
only because it appeared to me, and this is really in
deference to you, that when Mr. Goddard gave evidence
yesterday, I know we were all keen to get through the
matter as quickly as possible, but it certainly did
appear to me that you were going very, very quickly
indeed. I know that you would not want to give that
impression to the Jury, and when I say      going very
quickly indeed, the questions were coming and the
answers were coming thick and fast. It was something
that was very obvious to us.

     THE CORONER:   You are probably right, I was going
a bit faster than usual.  I will try and slow down a
bit.

     MR. ISAACS:    I am not concerned about taking the
note, I am only concerned about the impression that you
were creating, and I don't think that you appreciated
that in your desire to get on.

     THE CORONER:   I am grateful to you, Mr. Isaacs,
thank you. Mr. King, can I ask you something? There
is another documentary statement which needs to be
read, by Patricia Owens.  It is another correction.
Can you make sure that I do not forget about it,
because it is one that has come from your side of the
table and I might overlook it.

      MR. KING:      I will, sir.

      THE CORONER:    There is nothing controversial in
it.

     MR. MANNING:   What time do you have in mind
generally to finish today?

     THE CORONER:   I want to finish not later than 4
today, whatever happens.

hi re     to / h n b e r l i n e        and    was       number        1Q.        We       departed          f rom t h e       garage            at

          fm (1015)               and    travelled             along       the     M62        towards         Manchester.                   On

the     journey            the     coach       driver          made       an a n n o u n c e m e n t         that      it w a s        likely

we    would        be      stopped        by P o l i c e         en    route       to       the     ground        to    check          if

anyone        was        carrying         alcohol.               I did       not       see       anyone       on m y        coach        with

any alcoholic                 drink       whatsoever.                  From       the       M62    we    picked         up    th e       Ml      and

had     quite        a     pleasant           journey.              Although           the re we re           roadworks             and

holdups         we       had a      good       driver          who     seemed          to     know      the     best        lanes        to

take.         As      we     took       the       motorway          turn     off       fo r      S h e f f ield,       I saw        a Police

stop      check          point      where          they       had     stopped          a    number       of m i n i         buses        but

our     coach was             not       stopped.

We    eventually arrived                          at    the    coach        drop       off       point       at F l e t c h e r s        Bakery

early.          Most         of    the       people       got       off     the    coach          and    made        their      way         to

the     ground.              .Roy h a d a          chocolate           biscuit             with     him and a           packet           of

glucose          tablets           when       he       left    th e    coach       to       make     his      way      to    th e

g round.            I stayed            on    the       coach and asked                    the    driver        if w o u l d        be

alright          if      I stayed            on    the     coach       during          th e      match.         He     said      it w o u l d

be,      so    together            we    watched           the      in-coach           television.                The       last       of     the

people         on     the     coach          left       for    the     g r o u n d at         about      1 . 3 5 pm     ( 1 3 3 5 ).          The

driver         then        got     off       the       coach and went              for        something           to    eat      while           I

stayed         on     th e    coach.              He    returned about                 45     minutes          later,        locked           th e

door      and       went      for       a sleep          in his        sm a l l    bunk.

I then         fell        asleep        at       a b o u t _2 . 4 0 pm     ( 1 4 4 0 ) , as        although           the     television

was      on,     the       sound was              turned       off.         The    next          thing       I knew         I. w a s     woken

up      by a y o u t h w h o            knocked          on    the     coach window.                    He w a s       with      two        girls

and    they were              crying.             He     had      been     on       our     coach         earlier           and      so      I. w o k e

the    driver           and       he    let    them         on    the     co a c h .        He     said      that       6     people          had

been    killed.               We       turned        th e    sound        of     th e     television              up a n d         watch          the

tragedy        unfold             on    th e   television.                 It w a s         about         3 . 2 0 pm    ( 1 5 2 0 ) at            this

time.         People          soon        started           to    stream         onto       t he    coach         p ar k      and       past       ou r

c o a ch .     From what                they       were      saying         it      sounded         as     though           th e     number            of

dead     was    going             up a n d     up.          At     1555    hours          (1555)          someone           said        the       game

had    been     abandoned.

The    majority              of    people          had      returned           to    th e      coach        but    Roy        had       not

returned.               1    became          very worried                about       Roy       fearing           that       he     might          be

dead.

                                                                                                                                   I cou 1d

wait     no    longer,             so     I left          the      coach       to    go     and     l oo k       for    Roy.            At    the

entrance           to       the    coach       park         I saw a u n if or me d                 Police         Constable               who      was

directing            the      traffic.               I asked         him       if    he     knew      how        many       people           had

been     i n j u r e d at          th e      ground         but     he    had       no    idea      nor      could          he     find       out

on    hi s    ra d i o.           I started            to w a 1 k to           the       ground       and        many       people           were

walking        past          me    so     I kept          looking         out       for     Roy     but      he w a s n ’t a m o n g s t

them.         On     the w a y          to     the     ground        I asked             another          Po l i ce O f f i c e r            if    he

had a n y      information                   but     he     c o u l d n ’t g i v e        me     any.         I eventually

reached        the          ground        and went            to    the       gates       leading           into       th e      Leppings

Ln    end     of     the      ground.              There         were     Police          Officers            outside            th e     gates

and     I again             asked       them       for       information             about         th e     injured.               They

couldn't            g i v e me         any     news       but      advised          me    to     r in g     the     emergency

telephone            number            w h i ch    I had a l r e a d y           noted         down       from      the       television.

Actually            a Woman            Police        Officer         wrote          the     number          on    the       b a ck      of    my

hand.          I then walk ed                  away         from    the       ground and            started            to     look        for      a

telephone.                  1 went        to      a house          just       two      streets        away        from        the       Leppings

Ln     end     of    the      ground           and     knocked           on    the       door      of a       private            house.

The     couple          there          telephoned             the    emergency              number          for    me       several            times
                                                                                                                                              PAGE
                                                                                                                                              S298

for     about    twenty        minutes               but     the      line       was      permanently                 b usy.

I then made           my way          to    the       ground          again       and      spoke           again          with       the

Police      on   the      gates        explaining                my     dilemma.              I told            the       Policeman                that

I could        easily        identify            Roy       and      I told        him      that        he w a s           wearing             a    very

distinctive           pair       of    baseball              boots       ’'Lotto''        make         and       also       that          he       had

been     wearing         spectacles.                  The      Policeman              took      me     into          the    area          just

outside        th e   ground          near       th e      players         entrance.                  I saw          that       a    lot          of    the

Police       were     called          inside          the      ground          for     what       I believe                was       a    de­

brief.         The    Pol i c e m a n       took          R o y 's n a m e       and      description                 and       just          at

that     t i m e w e we re          joined           by    two      Geordie           lads       who       were       also          enquiring

about       someone       they        had       lost.          The      Policeman             went         away       and       came          back        5

or    10 m i n u t e s    later.            He       told      us     that       we    would          go    on a          coach          to

Hammerton         Rd Police            Station             where        they      had      set        up an          incident             room

and     I could        possibly            find       out      s o me    information.                      The       Policeman                took

i nto    the     ground        and we           walked         around          the     pitch          towards             the       S p o rts

Hall     Just     outside           the     ground.              I saw         that       there        was       a    number             of

Police       in the       main        stand          who     were       j u st    sitting             d o wn.         I also             saw       th e

Leppinqs         Ln    end     of     the       ground         I saw       that        on e      of    the       crash          barriers

on    s t a n d i ng a r e a     was       broken           down.

We    then     went       past      the     Sports           Hal 1 a n d         were      directed              by       the       Policeman

to    a double         decker         bus       on    the      road      outside           which           he    said       would             take

us    to H a m m e r t o n     Rd.         We    waited          for     a while           and        the       Geordies             became

impatient         and      said       they       would         find      their         own       way       there.           By       this          time

i t was      6 . 0 0 pm    (1800)          and       I was       becoming             very anxious                   so    I went             back

to    the    Police        outside          th e      ground          and asked            if     they          could       get          me       to

the     Police        Station         as    s o o n as         possible.               I heard             one       of    them          say       that

two     white     coaches           had     already            left       to     take      people           wh o      were          worried

about       missing        persons          to       the      Police       Station.               These          tw o      coaches                had

in f a c t      been      parked       in th e            same      coach        p ar k    as     my       coa c h .        One          of       the

Senior       Officers          amongst           the        group       outside           th e    ground             told       o ne      of       the

other       Officers              to    take        me     to       the    ground.            The       Officer           went        away       for

five     minutes,             presumably                  to    ge t      permission.                I then            asked         another

Officer,          th e       senior          one,         to    see       if he       could        ge t      through           on     his     radio

to    see     if R o y        ha d      returned               to    the       coach       park      just         in    case         I had

missed        him.           He    tried           but     could          not    get     through             on     the      radio.           The

other        Police          Officer              did     not       come       back     so    I went           back       to     th e      bus     and

he    took       me     to H a m m e r t o n            Rd Police              Station        o n that            bus.

When      I arrived               at    the        Police           Station          I saw     a     large          group        of     people

outside          apparently               waiting.                  They       were     making          enquiries              just        inside

the    Police           Station           at       on e    of       those       partition            windows.                I waited            for

about        15 m i n u t e s          when        I said           to    one    of     the    Policemen                that         it w o u l d

save      him      time       if we           wrote        ou t      a description                 of     our       various           missing

relatives              and    friends.                  This        I did.           I was     then          given a           cup      of    tea        by

one     of    the       volunteers                 who     was       there.           I was        then        taken         to a n o t h e r

room where              a Detective                 Constable asked                     me    questions                whilst         he     filled

a    form        in.

1 was        then       told       to        go    to     the       boys       club     next       door        to      the     Police

Station           w here      I could              wait        for       any    information.                   I spoke           to a

minister           there          who        said       I could           use     his      phone        to     phone         home.           I did

this      and      asked          my     s o n - i n - l a w , ______________________ - if he w o u l d                                 come       to

Sheffield.                In the             boys       club        there       were       groups         of      people         al1

obviously              waiting            for       news        of m i s s i n g        p e o p l e . I spoke                with       a Social

Worker,                                   I d o n ’t k n o w              her    surname           off h a n d , but             I do        have        it

on     re c o r d ,     and       she        said       she     would          try    to     find       out       something             for      me.

She     went       away            tw o or         three        times          but    could        not f i n d a n y t h i n g             out.          At

various           times            the P o l i c e         would          come       into     th e      room and             read       out      the

names        of    one       or        two    people.

We     were       then       told        that        we    were          going       back     to     the       ground           to    the

gymnasium              sports           hall.                               and      I go t     on a d o u b l e             decker          bus    and

He    arrived         at       the      ground         and      went      to    th e    area          just         outside          the

gymasium.             At       th e     doorways           to     th e    gymnasium              there            were    groups          of

people        waiting           to      ge t     in.       We     were     told        to       stay      on       the    bus       until       our

name     was       ca l l e d .         The      people         outside         the     door          were         called       in at

quarter        hour        intervals.                  I had         been waiting                for      a       long    time       and       almost

all    th e    other           people           had    got      off      the    bus.            I got         off    and       approached

one    of     the     senior            Officers            and      asked what             was       happening.                I then

waited        at     the       doors         into      th e     gyrrmasiun\ w i t h

                     We    had         been waiting               fo r    a very           l on g     time,         when       eventually             we

went     into        the       Sports           Hall    which          I saw     had        a    partition               across          one    half.

On    ou r    side        of    the       partition             were      desks        w h e re       I saw P o l i c e m a n             taking

statements            from          people.            We w e r e        then      taken         into         a    different             room

where        I was        shown         photographs               of     dead      people            which         were       pinned       to

boards.

1 saw        two     pictures             which        I felt          either         one       could         have       been       my    son.

I told        the     Police            Officer         this         and asked             him       if he         could       check       what

footwear           the     two         men      in t h e      photographs              had       been wearing                  because          he

would        be a b l e        to      t e ll    if    o ne     of     them was            Roy       by    his L O T T O        baseball

boots.          He     came         back        about       5 minutes            later          and       said      that       neither          one

of    t hem was           wearing            boots      of      that      descripton.                     I remember            that       the

photographs               I had          picked        out      had      th e    numbers             33 and 65            on    them.           I

asked        him     to    check          again        so     he w e n t        away       and       came         back    and       said       to

me     'P E M B E R T O N ' as           though        he w a s        asking         if    that          meant      a n y t h i ng       to m e .

I said        yes      and        he     said       ’I think           we've       found         him.’

We    then went            into          the       gymnasi a m ,                                     1,    and      immediately                they

pushed a            stretcher             t rol 1 ey        towards         us..       They          s h o w e d me       a    body       on the

trolley         and        I positively                identified               him    as       my    s o n Roy.              Roy    was

still        wearing           his L O T T O          baseball           boots.            The       O f f i cer     1 i d e n t i f i ed m y

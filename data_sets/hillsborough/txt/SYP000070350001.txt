          I saw on top of the tunnel                     a letter      ’B ’ a nd thought          that     is w here we

          had to go.            There was a police \(jfficer at the                    tunnel      entrance,           he

          onto     the terrace           in pen 3 .       It was a b o u t 2 . 1 5     pm    (1415)      and    there were

          what     I expected.                                                                     \

          w hi l s t            w an t e d   to s tand further         back.     The     crowd s t e a d i l y built

          s i n gi ng and       chanting       and everyone was          in good spirits.

          At about 2 .45           pm    (1445),    there was a gradual              push from the             back     but    it

          w a s n ’t excessive and we w ere able                  to    push back and stand normally.

          The    crowd had built              up a lot     now and      it was     now      really      packed a r o u n d

over     the tannoy w hen there was a n e xc essive surge a nd the next thing                                             I

knew     I was       pinned up agai ns t           the fence.         I c o u l d n ’t move at all.               The

heat was           unbe ar ab le   but    I c o u K ^ still        breathe    normally.            After    this

s ud de n surge,           I had split w ith                   ,    I c o u l d n ’t see w here        he had

gone.       My face was            pressed against          the f e n c e .    I had turned my head

the    left and the fence was against my right                              cheek.        I d i d n ’t see the

kick-off.            The    pressure a r o u n d me got greater.                  My    chest      hurt and       I

was    b e gi nning        to have    difficulty        in breathing.             I was shouting and

s c r e a mi n g    for help.        I was    shouting a p o l i ce ma n          in front of me to help

me but he said,              " D o n ’t panic,      i t ’ll be a l ri gh t     in a bit."

Some     s u pporters        had   climbed      over the fence and onto                   the    pitch.         Other

s u p o rt e rs were shouting at              the    police        that    people were          dying on the

terraces.

By now the           feeling a m on gs t      the    crowd had        changed,         people were

p anicking and shouting                  for help.

I could feel            s u pporters      climbing      up and t re ad in g on my s h o u ld er s and

head as       they climbed over              the    fence.

At this       time      I couldn't move at all,                the    pressure was           intense and all

I could see was more and more                       suppo rt er s     gett in g    onto      the    pitch.

I d i d n ’t think          I was going       to get       out.      I thought         I was     going     to die.

My b r e a t hi ng      had become        faint,     I felt        really tired and the heat was

tremendous.             I seemed to have            been    in this        position for ages.

Some     supporters,          once    they got       out    onto     the    pitch,      were     collapsing.

Eventually           the    pressure      s ub s i d e d and   I was able         to breathe         easily.          I

still     had a pain          in my      chest and      I was able         to move my face             from the

f encing      and     I heard                shout    to me.         He    came over and           I was    then

able     to turn myself a r o u n d and my back was a g ai ns t                         the fencing.

I could see           that    there were        a lot of dead bodies               on the floor,            it was

a h o rr i fi c      sight.                said to me,         " D o n ’t look,        keep w a l k i n g . "

I had to step over             the dead bodies          to get    to the back       of the        terrace.

I was    very upset and was             crying.

The    crowds    on the t er racing           had eased and       I was X b l e    to walk        to the

back with the help of                     |.    I was shaking and         in a\ state        of    shock,

it was the worst             thing   I have ever        seen.

We then w al k e d back         along     the tunnel an d        into the    are a be hi nd the           West

Stand.      There were a lot of               police an d St Joh n A m b u l a n c e m e n    tending         to

injured fans.          I could breathe a lot easier                 but my     chest    hurt with

e very breath.

A St Joh n A m b u la nc e      loosened the top of my blouse                 so   I could breathe

easier and then told                      and me to go and sit            in the ambulance.

We sat there        for about 5- 6 m i n ut es         then someone       collapsed outs id e             the

ambulance       so we got out          so he could       receive    treatment.

A doctor      came over and told me to take                  deep breaths and we were

r ecovering      for about        10 minutes,       sitting      on the floor.

         (/as w o r r i e d for         |, we had not        seen him since we split                up in

the ground.         We then       left the ground a short while                later,    I had       now

lost all      track of time.

E v e n t u a l l y we saw           outside      the gr ou nd    in L ep p i n g s Ln and we made

our way back        to the      car.

Later    that e v e n i n g    I went    to




The    pressure and heat w it h i n the              crowd was     the major       factor,        in my

opinion,      in the deaths and           injuries       to the supporters,          plus w he n       fans

fell    to the floor          they were       t ra mp le d on by other      fans and they had no

chance.

              I would         like to state that             there was a lack of medical           e q u i pm en t   to

              help the          injured s u pp or te rs who were          su ff er in g with breathing

              problems.           The s i t u at io n w hen     people    reali se d that   some    s u pp or te rs       had

              died       became    utterly     chaotic,        everyone was      panicking and the         police,

              once       they    realised the s er io us ne ss          of the situation,     were getting

              stuck       in,    helping    the fans         out.     A lot of   p olicemen were      being      shouted

              at by supporters             but m a i n l y    in frustration.

              I think         the FA should have a l l o c a t e d Li ve rp oo l      supporters        in the S p io n

              Hop end of the ground as we have more                        support   than N o t t i n g h a m Forrest.

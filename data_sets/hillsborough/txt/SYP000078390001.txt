At    2.30     pm     <14 3 0     h r s ) I returned                  to     the    frontage             of    the R a i l w a y

Numerous         were       drinking            from       cans       of     beer      and     lager.




At    2.50     pm     (14 5 0     hrs)         we    commenced walking                     down Halifax               Rd       towards

bodies        behind        t hi s    area,          he was          obviously            shocked.             I then walked

towards          Leppings            Ln and        several        f ans    shouted       “ I t ’s y o u r     fau l t " ,

obviously             d i r e c t e d at      the     Police        but    they    did       not    say what         the      reason

was.        As    I was         stood       in L e p p i n g s      Ln    the    fans    who       had    been      evacuated

from    the       ground         appeared           very       shocked and ang ry and were                        also     angry

about       the       press      taking        photographs               and    together       w i t h PC     Shipman          1 had

to    escort          one    photographer                well     away     from    the       ground.         He     was    wearing

an Official              Press        vast.         Numerous         fans       had minor          injuries,         cuts,

limping          and     grazes         and were           asking        about    their       friends        wh o    were      in the

stand with             them.          I advised            them     to    stand    on the          pavement         opposite        the

ground and             see      if    they     could        see     t h e m as    they       came    out.




At    4.40       pm    ( 1 640       hrs)     our     Serial        attended       at W a d s l e y B r i d g e        Railway

Station          to    see      the     returning           f ans    on    to    the    Special          Train,      they      were

obviously             sad    but      there        was     no a n g e r    or    bad    behaviour.




At 5.45          pm    (1745         hrs)     I returned            to C l a y w h e e l s   Ln a w a i t i n g      the      arrival

of    the    remainder               of S e r i a l      37.



At    6.25       pm    (1825         hrs)     we    were       transported         back       to M a i n St         P s tn,    going

off    d u t y at        7 pm    ( 1 9 0 0 hrs).




Whilst       on d u t y         in H a l i f a x      Rd    outside        the    Railway Station                 I saw       two

young       men       enquiring           of L i v e r p o o l      supporters          if    they       had a n y     spare

tickets,          this       happened          on     two      occasions         but    I cannot          state      whether

they were             the    s ame      two    men.

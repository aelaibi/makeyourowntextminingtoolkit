              I am lir Ian John CLARKE and I live at the above address with my

              mother and father and two s i s t e / s .

              I have been a .Liverpool s u pg o /t er for all of my life and I have been

              going to matches since                      I was      10.      First of all with my father and

              secondly on my own recently but only to home matches.                                              I only go to

              an away fixture               if it is an important mat ch.

              On Friday 7th April                  1989 I went with my friend                                              of

                                      Li ve r poo 1             to the ground at Anf ield and we both Jaought

              tic ke ts for the match on Saturday 15th April                                     1989.      I paid £6.00 for

              it and it was for the Leppija-gs Lane t e r r a c e , gate B .

              On Monday            10th April           198^4              and I went to the offices of the

              coach company, HOME JAMES (Topping)                                  in High S t r e e t , W a v e r t r e e ,

              Liverpool            15 to get coach tickets to go to the match.
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                   SS1

The tickets were £6.00 each return, my mother had phoned around for

me to find the cheapest.

The    coach was to leave from outside the coach company offices                 in High

Street,    Wavertree at 1100 am on the Saturday so I spent the Friday

night    (14 4 / 8 9 ) at my nans in              Liver poo 1         11 is only a

short distance from the

I went round to              address at 0900 am on the Saturday morning to

make sure that he was up and at quarter to 1000 am we left                           and

caught the bus to the High Street getting there sometime before half

past    1000 am.

The    coach was late arriving and d i d n ’t get there until          10 past     1100

am.     It was an executive     coach and when we got on the driver checked

our tickets.       The coach filled up and we set of at ha I.f pa s t 1100 am

this    is half an hour   lat

We we nt non stop to SJne f f i e 1 d with no problems except for being

delayed on the M62/oy traffic jams that kept on holding us up.                      It

was no sooner(j*Man you had got through one that 5 minutes                 later

you were    in another one.

We got to Sheffield,      some where     close to the ground, when the coach

was stopped and a couple of uni fu          a <1 Puli, ce Officers    looked in the

coach.     One went upstairs and the other         looked in on us in the rear

lower section.      He d i d n ’t check our bags or a n y t h n g .   I d i d n ’t see

anyone drinking on the coach but I presumed that that was what he was

looking for.

We arrived in Sheffield at a b o u t 25 past 1400 pm and the coach

dropped us off somewhere on the road up to B a r n s 1ey up From the

roundabout near to the g r o u n d .    There was a Gateway supermarket on

the right nearby.

We walked quickly to the ground,                and I, and it only took us

about 5 minutes.       I wanted to get there quickly because my watch was
                                                                                          PAGE
                                                                                          S31

    broken and I      knew that we were          late and I had to ask people the

    time.     1 d i d n ’t see        any problems or anyone drinking from where we got

    off the coach to the ground itself.                  Everyone was very good natured.

    I arrived at the ground just after half past                   1400 pm and that was

    where    I saw the first Police since being on the coach.                      They were

    outside    the entrance to the gates to the Leppings                lane turnstiles.

    There had been a lot of coaches on the way to the ground and there

    were alot of people walking to the ground so I s urni s e d that the re

    would be a lot of people waiting to get                 in.

    I saw that there was a big crowd back out into Leppings Lane                        itself

    with a couple of dozen Police Officers on foot and 6 on horse back

    outside the gates to the t ur ns t il e s.            They were regulating the number

    of people going through to the courtyard and the turnstiles.

    However m o s t of the o f f i c e rs were covering the entrance to the

^
    turnstiles for the seats .. . .   .
                                           in the West Stand and there were only 2 on
                                                 - --                    — —   —



    horseback covering the turnstiles A to G which lead to the Le ppings

    Lane terraces.

    The turnstiles       1-16 for the West Stand were for home supporters                  I

    think because there was a sign saying Horne Supporters by there and

    away supporters by turnstiles A - G .               There   is a wall and railings

    seperatig those two turnstile courtyards.

    The Police for turnst iles              1-16 had got people     into queues but the two

    Police on horse back were telling people to w a i t before going through

    the gate to the courtyard for turnstiles A-G until he moved the horse

    to let them through a few at a time.                 However the horse was moving

    from side to side and people were nipping t h r o u g h .

    I must admit that I was surprised at the small                  number of turnstiles

    for peopie going       into the Leppings Lane terraces.

    I saw no stewards there at all.

    When    I was   let through by the Police            I went   into the courtyard where
                                                                           PAGE        *
                                                                           S31

there were 3 or 4 Police on horseback trying to control the crowd

waiting to get into the turnstiles-          There were no queues and the

officers were trying to form them but the horse was moving around and

as everyone was moving away to avoid getting kicked it was just a

crowd.

I went through turnstile          (gate) 8 and handed my ticket in to the

steward.     I d i d n ’t see any stewards other than the ones actually

operating the t ur ns ti le s .

I had no difficulty knowing where to go because there were            clear signs

saying which way to which turnstile,         even though I had never been

there before.

I had some difficulty getting to the correct turnstile though because

the crowd pushed me over to one side.

I d i d n ’t see any other gates open other than the turnstiles and I

d i d n ’t see anyone fighting or drinking or climbing over or anything.

Everyone appeared to have tickets           and everything was   normal   except for

the fact that it was      packed.

Once   I got through the turnstiles       I d i d n ’t see any signs directing me

where to go and there were no Police or stewards there either.

However    I knew where to go because as       soon as I    came through the

turnstiles    I could see the tunnel        and the pitch   beyond leading down

to the terraces,

I went through the t u n n e l , everyone was walking normally,      and there

were no problems.      I d i d n ’t see any Police or stewards.    Again   I

d i d n ’t see anyone drinking.

When   I came out of the tunnel       into the terrace I went to the right of

the dividing fence with                The pen was pretty full    right to the

back   1 would estimate that there was       room for maybe 100 more people

and pen 4 was the same.

I worked my way forwards to get the best view until           I was about h a 1f
                                                                             PAGE      5
                                                                             S51

way to the front and 9 or 10 feet from the dividing fence between

pens 3 and 4.      I   took up my match viewing    position at about quarter

to 1500 prn with          standing   immediately to my r i g h t .

The   push from behind was more than 1 would have expected and at that

time the re was getting to be no room to move where I w a s .            I was

standing normally and people were        pressing against me from all        sides.

11 was getting uncomfo rtable .

Just after that the pressure of the people from behind continued to

get worse and I was slowly being pushed forwards towards the front

fence.     There were no fights or anything       it was just the number of

of people in the pen.

By about    10 to 1300 pm things were getting bad and I could see that

people at the /front were in a bad w a y .       In fact the re were     people that

looked as though they may have been dead by then.

I was now about 5 or & rows of people back from the front fence

about 9 or    10 feet from the dividing fence for pens 3 and 4 a n d it

was about the same sort of distance to the front fence.

I could see that the gate onto the pitch was over to the right but that

the worst    crush was at the front near to the dividing fence btween

pens 3 and 4.

The   crush continued to get wars,/ and I was       pushed   forwards.    I was

about 5 people to the left o jr       one of the barriers when it broke and it

caused a surge f o r w a r d .V_>fs the barrier went down it knocked people

in front of it slowly to the floor because everyone was so packed.

The thing that sticks with me         most   is that before it snapped people

were being crushed against       itand their mouths we re open and        they were

screaming.    Their faces stick      in my mind as they changed to a ye I low

colour and then to a blue and a purple c o l o u r and then they would

slump and hang over the bar or the people next to them.              They were

being held upright by the barriers and the pressure of the people

around them.

There was half a dozen or so of them mostly lads in their 2 0 ’s with a

couple of older men.       I cant described them or their        clothing really.

S o m e of the people in front of the barrier were crushed as they were

knocked to the floor and trampled.           There was nothing anyone could do

about    it because they were just pushed forwards from behind into the

small gap made by the person going down and that then caused more of a

push against the poor people at the front.

There was a little boy with black h a i r and a lad about 20 w ith blond

hair and he had blood coming from his n o s e .          One man was bout 30, and

six foot tall,    broad with short blond hair.           They were all   in front of

the barrier and were knocked down when it broke.

                                                                I remember him

saying    "Help me,   I *rn going to die."    I don't know if they survived or

not.

I was pushed forwards until       1 was 4 or 5 feet from the fence but with

still    the same number of people     in front of me.

I think that the barrier broke just before the game was stopped and

shortly after    I noti ced that the jgate towards the right hand end of

pen 3 was open onto the pitch.                /

Before the match was stopped people/at the front were t rying to climb

over the f ence and onto the p i t W u

One Police m a n, X cant describe him but he looked young and I have

seen a picture of him since       in one of the p a p er s, cl imbed up onto the

fence and was shouting for people to push b a c k .          I saw several Police

Officers    pushing people back who were          climbing up over the front

fence.     It looked to rne as though they thought that they were dealing

with a pitch invasion and d i d n ’t realise what was really going on.

It was a good 5 minutes before they realised what was happening and

started helping people out and it was then that the match was

                                                                                S31

stopped.

As this went on, a couple of minutes after the match was stopped,                  it

seemed to ease where          1 was and a space of a couple of steps opened up

around me.

All   in front of me was        like a mass of bodies all entangled in each

other,    people had been climbing over them to try and get out over the

fence and onto the pitch.

I could hear that some of them were            crying for he 1p and together with a

couple of fans and a Police Officer who had arrived,              I started pulling

people out of the t a n g l e .      I d o n ’t know whi ch were dead or just

passed out and injured but we were helping them and giving some of

them the kiss of life.

One that sticks out in my mind is that as we moved one body of a man

from the tangle near to the middle of pen 3 at the front              I saw the body

of a man lying face downwards with a body of a little boy still on

his s h ou l d e r s .   His arm was reaching out towards the g a t e .

Just after this we were taking more bodies across to where they had

gulled open the fencing to get them out and I remember that there

was another       push from the back.      1 was just   lifting up a dead man

and as the push developed it pushed me into the pile of dead bodies

and I    took tha^t mans/place.        The other bodies were   pushed on top

of me and I blk^J^je^t o u t .

I came around on the pitch and the same po 1i ceman that had been

helping m e from the start was with me.            He told me that he had

dragged me out onto the          pitch by the edge of the penalty area

across by the fence between pens 2 and 3.

That same Policeman,          when we were moving the bodies had been

pulling on one mans arm when someone moved the body on top that

was holding him down and the Policeman fell back and knocked his

head on the stepes of the terrace.            It knocked him out cold and I
                                                                                 PAGE     S
                                                                                 651

helped him and gave          him the kiss of life until he came around.

We both then got on          with helping to move the bodies.        It was

one of those situations where you d o n ’t think of yourself you

have a chance to get out but you just get on and help everyone

who *s h u r t .

As we were moving the bodies out            several Policeman were     coming    in to

the pen to help butit was all ready            that there was too many people

in the pen and to an extent the i r comi ng in made matters worse.

When I had come round I had no movement            in my right leg,     it was

without any f e e 1 i ng at all and the Poli ceman he 1ped me to my feet

and helped me to walk until          I could stand on my own.        There were still

so many people         lying there outside the pen and on the pitch.

There were Policemen inside the pens helping to drag people

out and so together with the same           Policeman Ihelped to       get

the advertising hoardings and put           people on them to      use as

stretchers,

I c o ul d n’t walk     properly and I was dragging my right leg but we

managed to carry a good number of peopie to the other end of

the pitch,         through the ^lleyway between the North Stand and the S i o n

Hop and to the Gymnasiuin where the Saint Johns Ambulance were                  looking

after t h e m ,

One ambulance         came onto the pitch   between the North Stand and the Spion

Hop and drove down to the pens.
Two we re between the West Stand and the. South S t a n d and ambulance were

by the side of the gymnasium and the north stand queueing up to come

in along Penistone Rd North behind the Spion K p .               As one drove out

with someone another would come in.

I kept on until everyone had been moved and then I went to the

Lapping    lane terrace to look for             because we had become seperated

in the crush inside         pen 3 when the barrier b r o k e ,

I couldn't see him and one of the St John's Ambulance took me all

through the people     in the gymnasium to see if I could find him but he

w a s n ’t there.

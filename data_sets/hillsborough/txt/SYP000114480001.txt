              replacement I was pleased tosee my                       old friend Ala n Hampshire.

             The mood amongst           us as usual          was h appy and jovial,                   oh how that was to

             change.        Briefing         from Inspector B.

             After    "vanning       up" we travelled to the ground a g a i n muc h good humour

             from all.         O n arrival,         parked our van in a prominent                       posit ion renewed

             old a c q u a i n t a n c e s and s t r utted about.

             Briefing       in the     stand by Ch. Supt.             Duckenfield             plus the usual array

             of speakers,          yeah,     y e a h heard    it all      before,         j^d u    c a n ’t tell me

             a n y thing    I've been here before               numerous       timwfe.            Wrong.

             As Serial       21 we were standby              in L e p p i n g s / a n e     pen.      We took up our

             before without          incident       how do you         prepare      or expect what            lay ahead.

Pe n istone R oad       I paired wit h J o h n Trew i c k at turns t i l e s a l l o w i n g

Notts.      Forest    fans     into the kop.           As   in the    past fans are       in the main

friendly and well             behaved with the odd exception.

A number of fans had cans of beer and were a s k e d to finish                             it before

entering the ground,             no problem,          just one or two moans about               the

purchase      price,      it sounded as          if local     shops had put up the          price       of

alcohol      for the match.           I a s s i s t e d Andy West to eject a L i verpool                fan

for jumping the turnstile,                   usual    routine,    to the Pol i c e      room,    details

and ejected^          I remember       thinking at the           time how busy the         charge

room w a s /      We couldn't       get      in and did the nec e s s a r y outside.             Time

1 4 1 3 p m Cr o w d s b u i lding now but a g a i n apart           from the odd drunk all

quiet and well          behaved.        I returned to Joh n Trewick              on the

turnstiles.          Dick B r o u g h a m    (E2)    had duties at the P e l i c a n      crossing          in

front    of us.       Dick a r r e s t e d a very drun k e n fan I a s s i s t e d him to the

Police      room w h i c h now is t h r o n g e d w ith bobbies and             respective

prisoners,        very noisy a lot of scouse accents,                     raised voices.          After

making      sure Dick was O.K.              I returned to the turn s t i l e s       passing a

number of my C          & V work mates carrying, dragging 2 or 3 prisoners who

were throwing         them s e l v e s about,        shouting,    swearing.        Two of the

officers were J o h n Trewick and Andy West.                              »

I went outside          the    ground again by now very hasy many                   people asking

about tickets         "Where     can we buy t i c kets"          b^th Notts a n d Scouse          fans.

All   the    lads are      now returned we dlscussr their arrest.                       I don't

remember      how or w h e n     it must have          beesf 2 . 5 5 pm   (1455)    we were      called

into the ground an d sent along the                     trerimeter track.          I was at or near

the front of the           unit.      I r e m e n ^ e / looking      down the front       of the

N o r t h Stand    it seemed       like      chaos,    a line of bobbies were            facing       the

crowd as we a p p r o a c h e d the L e p p i n g s Lane         end of the stand         people were

all   over the track.            I saw a special            an d a lad    (D1   1785)    served as a

cadet wit h him,         strug g l i n g with a fan and           losing.       I went    to their

assi s t a n c e and got the fan           in an a r m lock and m a r c h e d him back to the

charge        room rushed him through the office are a w h i c h was full and

straight        into the    cell.      This was also full         of drunken blood           covered

fans and about 5 bobbies               just to keep the         peace.     The a t m o s p h e r e was

very volatile.            T here were about         12 prisoners all       but 2 or 3 were

screaming and s h o uting about              they w a n t e d to w a t c h the game.         It

seemed that these           crazed animals w o u l d die         if the game went on

w ith o u t   them.      I remember       hating    them for   their m e n t a l i t y    I do not
                                                                                                                  I

I remained        in the    charge     room for a couple of minutes                because       I

thought        it was going        to erupt a n y second.       The odd one was            pulled out             i




to be booked in.            A b s olute    chaos.     A fan w ith a beard w ith            cut       lips

and blood all           over his face was          going   berserk.      I tried to calm him
                                                                                                                  !
a n d sit him down.          He sprayed blood          in my face as he s h o u t e d and

swore.        The match,     the match.
                                                                                                                  !


M y first       thought was you        "dirty basta r d "      Aids.      I decided to leave

the    charge     room a n d get      back outside,        there was en o u g h bobbies              there.

O n leaving       I w a l k e d towards the m ain track gates.               The    radio was

garbled and frantic.                I saw a line of Police         dogs and handlers                 from

near    the gym door        right     round to the ground gates,             where       they were

i n t e r mingled w i t h horses and bobbies.               I began to     run my min d w o r k i n g

fast.         I thought    i t ’s really blown now the           crowd was very noisy.                   I

am on the        perimeter        track now running towards           the L e p p i n g s Lane

people an d some          bobbies ahead.           I thought   here we go.         P et er Barnes

running a long the          right wing,       nice    foot work    leaves 2 players and

crosses the ball.            I look forward again.             People     e very where       outside

the fence at L e p p i n g s Lane end.              Best   get there quick.          O n arrival at

the other end,           very strange scene          people sat down by the fence

w a t ching the game whilst            others frantic        looking     in towards the

fence.         I pushed thro u g h to the fence            near to the gate far            right.

The     holding are a was still             near full      fans      pouring out. I look          inside

and     see And y Just i c e spread eagled agai n s t               the fence.           Protecting a

bobby between his              legs giving m o u t h to m o u t h and cardiac massage.

Bo t h their faces are strained.                   Andy    is being knocked all                over    by

fans    rushing        past towards the open gate.                I forced my way to the gate

and    climbed above           the escaping      fans forc/ng my way through.                     I

.reached Andy.              We broke awa y the f e\jcVng w i t h other, Pol iee outside

a n d fans      inside.        E v e r y t h i n g was so frantic       (it    is difficu lt      to

describe        the    complex        mental pictures),      the fans just kept                pulling      at

the     fence even after it was broken.                   I forced them off              and we got the

body out.         Thoughts,          thank goodness t h a t ’s all            over.    In my mind the

van moving a n d the scene unfolding                    is like theatre            curtains      being

raised.         As And y and I m oved towards the                centre of the           pens    "Oh fuck"

another      two bodies         right down at the front under the fencing.                             Blue,

dead eyes open.               B o t h of us went      to them and each sjmr t e d m o u t h to

I he s i t a t e d for a second whilst             I thought Aids / I d o n ’t know this man.

Get    on wit h       it.     S ound of moans and groans a/ air forced                     in and then

For a few seconds             chaos.       Moving again,        look at the w a s t e of young

life.      Call     comes t h r o u g h this ones alive             I shout    repeatedly         in a

choked/voice,          "This one alive."            Fighting        back tears.         B r o k e n bodies

beinaf dragged apart trapping                  each other.          Bags of sand.

A1JT out onto the           pitch,      make shift - s t r e t c h e r s and away.            Notice     for

^The first time gaffers are now about.                        Where      have they been.             Wh y was

the o r g a n i s a t i o n so     late.    Thought.        A n y w a y goo d to see them in with

the   lads.

F e e l i n g s - very proud of            colleagues,      personal      feeling      of being

inadequate.         Why did this happen,            will     the    body I b r e athed        into    live

or as    I suspect a l r e a d y died,          but the text         books say if y o u do m outh

to m o u t h and cardiac m a s s a g e they will              live. Did I do          it right,          is

it my fault.          Who     is or was he.

All   the bodies are out on the                 pitch now bobbies w o r k i n g a w a y on them.

Walk ing and        lying w o u n d e d everywhere.           Fit    fans venting a nger blaming

us.     "You're all         useless b a s t a r d s . "     Yes they are       right.         Loads more

abuse.      For m a chain across              half w a y line Notts        fans   chanting,          they

don't know.          Sc o u s e    fans want someone         to fight w i t h trem e n d o u s

feeling     of tension.             Where A ndy Justice.            Found him feel        c onfused

lost.      We go back to the fence dazed.                     Along w ith some F Div.                C & V

and Andy went         to rear of L e p pings Lane.                 Fire engines        everywhere.

D own by the        river,        no no,   no, more       bodies    covered.      X    want to do

something,        that    is wh y I am w a n d e r i n g around.         Let me        help,    give me

             A lad called                  barely conscious       laid by the fence amon g s t             the

             dead.    N e a r b y a son sits by the           covered body of his dead father.                    Try

            and keep               conscious.         Hold his hand talk to him.                 Doctor

             examines.       Seri o u s    he must    be next.       My w o r l d    is very small       now and

             personal,    the only other            in it is A n d y Justice and                                 goes

             in the Ambulance.             I help    lift him    in.     Please       be well.     W h e r e ' s Andy

            F o u n d him my coat hat and            radio are missing,             where are they,       who    cares.

            Back     into the ground.          Onto the       pitch find others          in the unit       re­

             group.    Now    it starts to hit home.

            We   return to the fencing a scouse                 lady    comes       round.   We are just

            standing staring.             She holds our arms and says,                 thanks    lads.     I begin

            to cry.

            Sometime     later we van up.             Where   is the friendly           chatter    now.

            This account        of my experiences         on that day is garbled an d               blurred,

            there are thoughts            that have not       been     included.        Ho w can y o u describe

            s uch an event.        It     is impossible,      I feel     to surround a reader wit h

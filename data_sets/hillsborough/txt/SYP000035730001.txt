Perimeter fence to p i t c h solution Safety rules should have had emergency
exits written into them, especially        to name   k   responsible persons to be
placed at s;V*.a tegic places of pitch, with cutting equiptment, Gates can
also cause injury.
P/A System cannot be properly heard by crowds in panic, look at possibility
of all g r o v n d a bein^ equipped with visual inforay iion boards.


Ground Official ./police/Football Association must look at ways of r e ­
routing fans. , to enable largest groups to be in maximum capacity area.


L .MEDICAL SFRVICK3 AT GPOUND
I must admit to being incensed at some of the comments made by 'the           Prof of
Medicine* De fibrillators would be expensive, require daily checking to make
 ure they are functioning, are dangerous in hands that do not use them regular
  y (including a Prof; essors)    and    cannot be used if there are crowds of
people around. Eesusitafeon teqkniques, require regular refresher courses to
minimise damage that can be done, like wise Oxygen equiptment. I feel it
is better to get everyone out of the crush situation and to hospital
immediately, only immediate resusitation should, be given, our ambulence staff
and aiabulences are equipped to deal witli these, solution... maned members ol
the Police could be trained in majofc accident triage, and could then co­
ordinate with the Medical Staff available. It is often impossible to triage
       the disaster site due to panic.


5.POLICE
The gate was opened, by the police, who have done this before, with little
Bletr'emgntal effeet( except to the clubs pockets* ) It is ludicrous to expect
to have a large police force outside the gates after the match, has begun,
solution... no gates to be opened. Need for more turnstiles, delay start of
match, or have all fans inside ground before kick-off time. khat do other
Countries do?. Can all walkie-talkies be clearly heard?


6.AMBULANCE      SERVICE.
 We have an excellent staff and service, but even they           would not be trained
to deal with so many deaths (will need some support/councelliag) problems
were experienced in getting through the traffic.solption... to bring in
legistlation to compC* all traffic to move to the leit and stop, and stop at
all junctions.


"/.HOSPITALS
I was impressed "by the efficiant way casualties were dealt with, could they
 looX at p o s si M l i t i of having Kajor Disaster Triage team to g0 t0 site...

‘ 8 .1'FcESS/llEDIA
I must admit tcb being disgusted at the number of immediate statements
published, many people make remarks is stressfull times, which are often
 quite uninformed.This adds to the distress of all concerned, and gives much
false informntion...solution.... Press ban on all personal statements made
 immedietley, until subject is less emotive, subjective, and able to look at
 the wider issues involved.




                 Bo hope these comments are of use.

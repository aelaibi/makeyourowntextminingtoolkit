FATHER                        SAME ADDRESS   WAS A MATCH WITH CALLER
I DID NOT SEE MUCH HAPPEN BUT NOTICED A LOT OF PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE
FENCES IN THE WEST STAND. I BECAME VERY CONCERNED BECAUSE ONE OF MY FRINEDS
WAS IN THE WEST STAND. I AUTHOMATICAALY RACED OVER THE PITCH TO FIND OUT
WHAT WAS GOING ON AND WAS PUSHED AWAY BYSOME POLICE OFFICERS. WHEN I ASKED
WHAT WAS GOING ON NOBODY SEEMED TO KNOW.THERE WERE NO STEWARDS ANYWHERE AND
THE POLICE SEEMED LOST. THE ONLY ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH WAS MADE OVER THE LOUD
HAILERS WAS TO KEEP OFF THE PITCH. IF ONLY SOME INDICATION HAD BEENGIVEN TO
WHAT WAS GOING ON IT WOULD HAVE HELPED. I THINK THIS IS WHAT CAUSED AN AWFUL
LOT OF PEOPLE TO PANIC.

PROBLEM IN THE LEPPINGS LANE TERRACE. THE AREA BEHIND THE GOAL WAS COMPLETELY
FULL AND THE AREA TO THE SIDES WAS VIRTUALLY EMPTY. AT 2:50PM NOBODY HAD
MOVED OUT FROM BEHIND THE GOAL, AND IT WAS GETTING WORSE.THE GAME KICKED OFF
ANDIT WASNT UNTIL THE PC RAN ONTO THE PITCH TO STOP THE GAME THAT WE REALISED
THERE WAS A PROBLEM. A LINE OF PCS STOOD INFRONT OF THE NORTH STAND AND THEY
TOO DIDNT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON. IT WASNT UNTIL THE INJURED WERE BEING
BROUGHT UP TO OUR END THAT WE REALISED WHAT HAD HAPPENED.

INFO      >>   I FEEL THAT THE MAIN CAUSE OF THESE PROBLEMS WERE DUE TO THE
               TRAFFIC JAMS ON THE M62. THIS WAS CAUSING ALOT OF THE FANS TO
               ARRIVE AT THE MATCH LATE. I DIVERTED IN ORDER THAT I COULD
               ARRIVE AT A REASONABLE TIME. WHEN I EVENTUALLY ARRIVED AT 2.20
               OUTSIDE THE GATES, PEOPLE WERE QUEING AT THE TURNSTYLES QUITE
               NORMALLY. THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY PROBLEMS THERE THEN.

                DETAILS UNKNOWN.           IS THE FRIEND OF
DETAILS CAN BE OBTAINED FROM HIM IF REQUIRED.
AT APPROXIMATELY 2.20 WE WENT DIRECTLY TO NORTH STAND. OUR TICKETS WERE
CHECKED BY MARSHALS BEFORE WE ENTERED AND AS WE NEARED OUR SEATS. AS I
LOOKED AROUND THE GROUND WHILST THE PLAYERS WERE WARMING UP I COULD SEE THAT
THE TWO TERRECES INM WEST STAND WERE CHOCK A BLOCK. I COULD SEE PEOPLE
CLIMBING OVER THE WIRE FENCES NEAR TO THE ALLEYWAY TRYING TO GET INTO THE
OlgKER TERRECES, WHICH WERE ALMOST EMPTY. AFTER SOME TEN MINUTES OR SO I
COTLD HEAR A RUMBLING NOISE COMING FROM THE WEST STAND AREA. IT BECAME
APPARENT THEN THAT THERE WERE PROBLEMS. PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FRONT
FENCES TRYING TO ESCAPE. PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED AGAINST THE FRONT FENCE
AND HAD NO ROOM TO MOVE. THE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES WERE
BEING TOLD TO GO BACK BY THE POLICE. AFTER A SHORT TIME THE POLICE APPEARED
TO REALISE THE PROBLEMS AND STARTED TO HELP THE SUPPORTERS OVER THE FENCES.
THE FIREBRIGADE THEN ARRIVED AND STARTED CUTTING THE FENCES DOWN AND HELP IN
GIVING RESUSSITATION. THERE WERE SUPPORTERS BEING PULLED UP INTO THE SEATING
AREA OF WEST STAND. YOU COULD SEE THE SUPPORTERS AT THE BACK OF WEST STAND
ALSO GETTING CRUSHED. I FEEL THAT HAD THERE NOT OF BEEN SO MANY PROBLEMS
WITH TRAFFIC HOLD UPS THAT THE SUPPORTERS WOULD HAVE ARRIVED EARLIER, AND
THIS WOULD HAVE PREVENTED SUCH A RUSH AT THE LAST MOMENT TO ENTER THE GROUND.

              »
             ARRIVEED AT THE SAME TIME ABOUT 2.45, AND THIS YEAR I NOTICED
             THAT I COULDN'T SEE THE ENTRANCE TO THE NORTH STAND BECAUSE THERE
             WERE SO MANY PEOPLE. I ASKED A POLICEMAN WHERE THE ENTRANCE WAS
             AND HE POINTED IT OUT, BUT TOLD ME IT WOULD BE BETTER TO WAIT A
             FEW MINUTES TO LET THE CROWD DIE DOWN, BUT IT WAS ALREADY LATE.

I MANAGED TO JOIN THE QUEUE, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO ORDERLY QUEUE. LAST YEAR
THERE WAS A BARRIER SOME WAY FROM THE GROUND AND IT WAS MUCH BETTER
ORGANISED. HAVING JOINED THE QUEUE, I SAW BILLY LIDDELL, AN EX-PLAYER FOR
LIVERPOOL, AND I MANAGED TO GET HIM INTO THE QUEUE IN FRONT OF ME, AND WE
FINALLY MANAGED TO GET THROUGH TO THE NORTH STAND ENTRANCE. THERE SEEMED TO
BE A LOT MORE FANS THERE THIS YEAR, BUT LESS ORGANISATION. THERE SEEMED TO BE
ORDERLY QUEUES EVERYWHERE LAST YEAR, BUT THIS YEAR THERE WERE NONE. THERE WAS
A POLICEMAN AND A POLICEWOMAN AT THE TURNSTILE ENTRANCES BUT THEY DIDN'T SEEM
TQaBE DOING ANYTHING.
ilCULD SEE THAT BEHIND THE GOAL WAS A LOT MORE FULL THAN IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN
 AND THERE WAS AN EMPTY PEN IN BETWEEN THE PENS BEHIND THE GOAL AND THE NORTH
STAND. I THOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN KEPT EMPTY FOR NOTTS FANS.
I WAS WITH THREE OTHER PEOPLE:
              [MY BROTHER-IN-LAW),                     LIVERPOOL     PHONE
HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW,                 FROM           WAKEFIELD
              PHONE              HE LIVES IN                   WIDNES.

OF PEN 3 AT THAT STAGE, THERE WAS ABOUT 10 OR 20 POLICE PUSHING PEOPLE BACK
INTO THE PEN, AT ONE STAGE I BELEIVE THAT THE GATE TO PEN 4 WAS OPENED BUT
CLOSED AGAIN. I COULD SEE IMMEDIATELY THAT SOMETHING WAS DRASTICALLY WRONG,
BEFORE KICK-OFF, THERE WERE STILL PEOPLE BEING PASSED UP TO THE STAND ABOVE
AND I WOULD SAY THAT JUST AFTER KICK-OFF, IT WAS APPARENT THAT SOMETHING WAS
TERRIBLY WRONG. HOWEVER, THE 10 OR 20 POLICE THAT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN
LIFTING PEOPLE BACK INTO THE PENS WERE NOW HELPING THEM OUT. THEN I WAS
HORRIFIED TO SEE ABOUT 200 POLICE MARCH ONTO THE PITCH AND IT WAS OBVIOUS
Th J| THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DEALING WITH DISORDER OR A PITCH INVASION. ALSO
THE NOTTS FORREST FANS WERE CHANTING ABOUT LIVERPOOL NEVER GETTING INTO
EUROPE NOW, THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, BUT I COULD SEE INTO THE STAND AND I
COULD SEE THAT PEOPLE WERE DEAD AND DYING. I WISH TO MAKE A STATEMENT IN AN
ATTEMPT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS KIND OF AFFAIR NEVER OCCURS AGAIN. I DON'T
WISH TO POINT FINGERS, BUT THERE ARE SO MANY AREAS THAT NEED ADDRESSING.
INITIALLY I BLAMED THE POLICE ON LEAVING THE GROUND, BUT NOW I FEEL THAT
BLAME CANNOT BE APPORTIONED AS EASILY AS THAT.

              HAD STARTED PEOPLE STARTED TO CLIMB OVER THE FENCES AND THE

   I FOUND THAT THE SERVICES WERE REACTING VERY SLOW AT THE SCENE OF THE
INCIDENT THERE APPEARED TO BE TOTAL CONFUSION AT ONE POINT JUST AFTER THE
CROWDS HAD STARTED TO CLAMBER OVER THE FENCES THE POLICE ARRIVED IN GREAT
FORCE AND WE ALL THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE ALL COMING TO HELP AND I WAS AMAZED
TO SEE THAT JUST STOOD SHOULDER TO SHOULDER FACING THE NORTH STAND EVENTUALLY
THE SPECTATORS STARTED TO RUN AROUND COLLECTING THE AVERTISEMENT BOARDS TO
USE TO CARRY THE INJURED PERSONS. LATER I SAW A POLICE OFFICER WHO WAS
OBVIOUSLY A BIKE RIDER HE WAS VERY DISTRESSED AND HE WAS THE FIRST TO TELL US
T H M PEOPLE HAD DIED IN THE CRUSH.
I mb FIND THAT TOWARDS THE END THE CROWDS BECAME VERY AGGRESIVE TOWARDS ALL
OF THE SERVICES BUT I FEEL THAT IT WAS MERELY BECAUSE OF THE TENSION IN THE
AIR. I DID NOT SEE ANY REAL VIOLENCE.

FENCES AND RAILINGS TO THE SECTORS ON THE SIDES OF THE AREA BEHIND THE GOAL (
P r o 2 & 5) THAN THEY WERE JUMPING OUT TO THE FRONT,OVER THE SPIKES,AND
OUERS WERE CLIMBING UP TO THE SEATING AREA ABOVE THE PENS 3&4.THERE WERE 3-4
POLICEMEN STANDING ON THE TRACK WATCHING WHAT'WAS GOING ON IN THE PENS AND I
AM SURE THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT WAS GOING ON BUT LET THE MATCH GO ON.THE

THE FIRST AID WAS DIABOLICAL****20 MIN AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED THE ST
JOHNS AMBO MEN WERE STILL TALKING ON THE SIDELINES.
ALSO THE DIRECTIONS TO THE GROUND WERE ALL WRONG,THEY WERE SENDING PEOPLE
JUST ONE WAY ,AND THIS CAUSED A CONGESTION,WE KNEW OUR WAY AROUND SO WE

WE MISSED ALL THE TRAFFIC,THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALTERNATIVE WAYS IN.

I AM IN MY FINAL YEAR AT MEDICAL SCHOOL. I WENT TO THE FIRST AID STATION
WHICH WAS ON MY LEFT AND SAW ABOUT 150 POLICE OFFICERS STANDING THERE. I
ASKED A POLICE MAN IF THEY NEEDED HELP. HE SAID HE DIDNT KNOW AND TO GO AND
FIND AN INSPECTOR. I WAS UNABLE TO DO SO.

THERE WAS A POLICE HORSE CAUSING A BIT OF TROUBLE IN THE CROWD.
WHEN I GOT INTO THE STAND THERE WAS JUST ONE POLICEWOMAN ASKING IF WE HAD OUT
TICKETS, THEN I SAW THE SURGE IN THE TERRACES AND I THOUGHT IT WAS TROUBLE.
I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN I SAW PEOPLE FALLING OVER AND GETTING
HURT, AND I SAW ONE FELLOW BEING PUSHED BACK IN.
THE POLICE DIDN'T WANT TO LISTEN TO US, JUST KEEP THE FANS OFF THE PITCH.

INFO      » I WENT INTO THE GROUND AT 1430HOURS VIA THE TURNSTILE, THERE WERE
            A LOT OF PEOPLE, BUT THE CROWDS WERE MOVING THROUGH. ONCE IN MY
            SEAT I NOTICED THAT THE MIDDLE TWO SECTIONS OF THE TERRACE IN THE
            WEST STAND WERE PACKED FULL BUT THE OUTER SECTIONS WERE EMPTY.
            LEADING UP TO THE KICK OFF MORE PEOPLE WENT TO THE MIDDLE
            SECTIONS, SO THST WHEN THE MATCH STARTED THE PEOPLE OVERFLOWED
            ONTO THE PITCH. THEE

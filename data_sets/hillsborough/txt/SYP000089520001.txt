                  At about 4.45                pm,    (1645)        that      day I got a call              from                              the

                  I got to the hospital                          at about 5.00 pm             (1700), and at first was                     in the

                  went     to the           p laster        room at tjrte hospital,                whi       was     being                 to keep

                  What         I a c t u a l l y did was           to assist         two Police          officers,         a   w o m a n . and a

              at    the hospital.

              I only remember details                of two of the bodies             I handled that day and

              then not       in much detail.

              One was a youth          in his t e ens w h o ^ a d        his hair         parted    in the middle and

              %wept    to each side of l~|is h e a dland the other was a large ma n                             in his

              details       of the    clothing       being w o r n by an y of the deceased.

              As well as me and                   there were a number             of other         p o r t e r a/^orki r

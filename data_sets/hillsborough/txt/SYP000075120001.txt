                           I have been a life               long s upp or te r            of Li ver p oo lx F . C . , but have only

                           the turnstiles.

o p e n e d by the      crush of the          c r o w d . I think        the whole         idea of that

e x c e rc is e was to m i n i m i s e       the a mount        of    people queu ei ng at           the

turnstiles,           due to the volume             of    people      it was a fjjrfrlTie exercise.

At the       perimeter        gate    I saw four m o u n t e d PoJMrtie O f f i c e r s , who a p p e a r e d                 j

to be      in the m iddle         of the      crowd anch-tfllable to do a n y t h i n g ataJHt''.

Just     by the gate          I saw a p p r o x i m a t e l y half a d ozen foot Qj^fieers, a

couple of Off ic er s were              trying       to    push the gates sfWt a nd the others

were     s ho ut ing at the          crowd    in an effort            to get them back,            but     it was

an    i m po ssi ble    task for them.             I was    in this        crowd a w a i t in g    e ntry

t h ro u g h the gate,         I w o u l d descr ib e       this      crowd of       people as       being

s im il ar    to the equi va le nt           of    last years m a t c h w h i ch was of no problem

at this       time.     As    people    began to gather               o ut side a n d the volume              became

greater,        so did the        pushing and s ho ving               till    e v e n t u a l l y the gate

o pe n ed a nd       I was    f orced th ro u gh          w it h the crowd.        Once    inside       the   gate

the    crowd of        people     b etween the            gate a nd the t u rn st il es were

tr emendous,          I could b arely move.               I was      not f r i g h t e n e d m y se lf   but      it

was quite app ar en t           that a few other              people did not              like the e xp er i en c e

of the       large     crowd.     I was      in the m i dd l e        of the       crowd I could see that

people had           children on their            shoulder s         in an effort          to keep them

out    of the        pushing a n d shoving.

I could see there were                 four or five t ur ns t il e s a h e a d of me a nd                     I

o r i g i n a l l y made rny w ay to the one on the                     right,     but     it was an

they were         pointing towards          the gate                                                                   By

this      time    it w o u l d have    been about         five^o       lh r \fr    (1455) , even thou gh

pressure         or at    least    it did not make a great                 deal     of d if fe r en c e to me.

I was       to the    left of the         crowd a nd more          towards        the turnstile.             I was

able      to get th ro ug h to the t u rn st il e a nd gain a ccess                      to the ground.

The a re a here was           quite    sparse      of people.         I then made my w ay to the

tunnel.         I did not     look    for any d ir ec ti on al         signs.       I had been to the

g ro u nd before a nd was            familiar w it h the fact              that     I could turn right

or    left either         side    of the tunnel          to get     to the terrace.              T here was

free a ccess         to the tunnel a nd t h er ef or e             I chose        to go t hr o ug h       it.      I

I made my way            into P en 3 w ithout any d i f f i c u l t y what so ev er ,                  in this         I

good m a t c h viewing           position.       I was    prob ab ly half way            into the         crowd

w h en    I became       static.                                                                           -

that      there were       people a lr e a d y     climbing        over   $he     p fa n t    fence a nd onto

the      p i t c h . There was a large           number    of people         climbing         the fjywes           but

I am unable          to e stimate      just how many.             I could see         no,^sfpparent reason

for      this    behavior at       this    time.    I could 'also s e ^ X h a t              the Police

over      the fences.        I saw one y ou th witr^jjj.if'nger hair                clirnb back up the

fence       from the      pitch a n d sh ou t ed for people               to move      back.       I then saw

him      run from P olice Of fi ce r         to P ol ic e O ff i ce r and then                lead some

people onto the            pitch.     I had still         not     r ea l is e d the    reason for this.

positioned.          I experienced              no e xces si ve     crowd of         people or     crowd

pushing       or surging.           As well as being a w a r ^ f                people       climbing onto the

pitch at the front,                 I was also awa pe ^o f            people     climbing        from the

w h e re    I was a nd      I w o u l d be alright.

I do       not quite      know w h en          I became a wa re       of the e no r mi t y of the

situation,          I realised the m atch had s to p pe d and that more a nd more

people were          e nd e a v o u r i n g    to climb over        fences a n d get out           of the

was    quite happy VLe^stay w her e                   I was.     Once    the    crowd had cleared

see    that    there was a rnetal Vbaj^r'ier c om p le t ed bent                       to the fj^eror it

hadn't       come out of the ground,                   just     to the     right      of        g a t e , there

were       quite a few people o bv i o u s l y dead                 dr   injured*. The gate was               open

a nd a few people             had been taken t h r o u g h j o n p o           the    pitch.    There were a

lot of people a s s i s t i n g               e ach,o th er    to help the       injured.        T here were

people o bv i o u s l y alive anu/ngst the dead a n d a lo ng with o t h e r s I h elped

people a s s i s t i n g      others.          I think all        in all    I may,         a long w it h others,

have a s s i s t e d about a d ozen                people to get a w a y from that area.                    None of

these       people were         k nown to me or are k nown to me since.                         All    these

people were either                tee na ge r s     or adults.        I eventually           left the g ro un d

the    control     of the    perimeter        gate    s ho ul d have        been more objective,                I

feel    there was a        lack of o r g a n i s a t i o n and        c o mm u n i c a t i o n b et we en the

m o u n t e d P olice and the foot Officers,                 but      I also     realise the

difficulty        they had from their             p o si ti on in g    in the      crowd.    I think      that

whatever      the outcome         that    once the d e c i s i o n had been made               to o pe n the

gate,    it was     the    correct       d ec i si o n as due to the volume of                 people

ou tside a nd the         crushing,       I could foresee             people    being     injured,      as far

as the tunnel         is conc er ne d a nd my         presence         in aA m uc h as there was

no-one    to direct me,           I felt    that g re ater ^rtfntrol s hould have                  been

t a ke n to direct        people     either    side cpr the tunnel a nd gain a cc es s

the    side   entrances,      a nd    if n e c e s s a r y , to block        the tunnel

off.

T h er e was a poor use of the              public a d dr e s s        system,      the first time

I was/aware        of the s y st em being used was some                     time    poss ib ly a r o u n d

t w en t y five    to four     <1535)      when    I h eard a request              for D r ’s in the

crowd to       come onto the         pitch.    I think       it s h ou l d have been used to

i nform the       crowd what was h a pp en in g a nd to a ss is t w it h d i r ec t io n s                   to

 olice a nd S tewards.            Crowd    control      i n it ia ll y was o b v i o u s l y a big

factor,       it also     gives    cause    for    concern as          to how the       close     circuit

television        screens were        used on that day a nd why this d i d n ’t give

spontaneous        overall     control      to a p ro fe ssional            body present,         they seem

to act as       indi vi dual s as o ppo se d to a m e m b e r of an o rg an isation.

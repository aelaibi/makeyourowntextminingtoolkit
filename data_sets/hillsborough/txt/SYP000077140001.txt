              On S a t u r d a y      15th April            1989      (150489),           I attended,            together        wi th my

               girlfriend                                      , the        FA Cup        S emi    Final        being    p l a y e d at

               I obtained            our    tickets        from N o t t i n g h a m        Forest        and made        our     way    to    the

              match      in m y       own     vehicle-           We   h ad    no     difficulty             in g e t t i n g    into

              Sheffield,             but    experienced            s om e    difficulty            in    getting        through        the    town

               centre.          We    eventually            parked      our    vehicle            in a s m a l l       car     park    just    off

              Harries       Rd South,
                                                                                                                                    PAGE
                                                                                                                                    S2140



As     we    drove          through           Sheffield,            saw      numerous          sE>ppo rte rs        drinking           canned

b e e r , also             noted       people         outside          Public       House       drinking           alcohol,

although           I never             witnessed            any     disorder            or    drunkenness.



At     approximately                   1410        h o u r s , we        arrived         at    the    ground and              e n t e r e d the
      C A T
S pi on K o p          end     of      the     g round       via            the    turnstiles             numbered       49     to 54. I

noted        that          the re w a s        one       Police        Officer          to    each    turnstile.




There       was        also       numerous            Officers           directing            traffic       and     people        on

th e    main       Penistone                Rd.




We     experienced                no    difficulties                at      the     turnstiles            and were        able      to

enter        the       ground          easily.               \




By     1420       hou rs,         myself           a n d rny g i r l f r i e h d        were    in the           Spion    Kop     terrace.

On     entering             the     g r o u n d , I d i d see               a few       sbkQporters         drinking           cans      of

beer        but    again          I never           saw     any     s or t     of    disorder.             I did       note     th at

there        was       a    lack       of     signs       telling           you where          to    go    o nce    inside        the

g round.




Approximately a                     couple          of    minutes           after       the    game       ha d    started,        I noted

that        there          were     Liverpool             supporters              standing          behind       the     goal,      on    the

track,        at       the     Leppings             L.n e n d     of     the      ground.           They    all     seemed        to     be   in

th e    vicinity               of      t he    goa l.                               \




After        a few m i n ut es                I cou 1 a\5e^e t h at               there       was    people        climbing         over

the     top       of       barriers           at    t hat    end       of    the    pitch,          and    then     shortly         after

t he    match          wa s    abandoned.

Once     t he    players             had      left        the      pitch        there       must       have       been about            three

to     four     hundred             people         come      onto         the    pitch.           At    this       p o i nt      we    had    no

idea     of     what       was       going         on a n d       there         was    no a n n o u n c e m e n t s        made        over       the

loud     s peakers.                 Because          of     t h is    people          in the       Spi on Kop were                    becoming

ag i t a t e d , not         knowing              the     full       extent       of       what    was       happening.

It w a s       only whe n            ambulances              were         brought          onto    the       pitch        did     it    become

obvious         that       people          had       in f act         been       injured          in the          incident.




si n o t e d    t h at     at a p p r o x i m a t e l y            twenty        to    f ou r     the       Police        brought        on a

1 i\e    cr£ dog          men who          all       stood         in f r o n t       of    the    S p i o n Hop.               People

arounViiegan to s h o u t                         in a n n o y a n c e      towards          these          dog    men     to     "get       down

t he    other        end       of    the      pitch,         t h a t ’s w h e r e          the    disturbance               is    going       on".

This     gave        me    the       opinion             t h at    people        at    that       stage       were        s t il l     not

aware      of w h a t        was      g o i ng o n .



At     approximately                 1 62 3       hours,          an announcement                 was       made       o ve r    the    loud

speakers         thavvthe             match          had      been        officially             abandoned,             but      still       no

mention         w as      madsMof          what          had a c tually           happened             at    the       other      end    of       the

ground.          I therefore                  left        the      ground with              my    girlfriend.




During         the     incident            there          were       approximately                te n L i v e r p o o l         supporters,

who     I saw        run a c r o s ^ th e                pitch       towards          the    Spion          Hop and         incite       the

continually               beckoning               towards          the     stand       before          he was          eventually

challenged             by a P o l i c e m a n             n ear      to    the    North          Stand       seats.




Although         most          of    the      Liverpool              fans       behaved,          there       was       a minority            of

supporters             who      caused            problems           on    the    pitch wit h               their       behaviour.

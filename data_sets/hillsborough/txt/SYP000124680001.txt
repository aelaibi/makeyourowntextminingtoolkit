 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE POLICE SHOULD HAVE CONTROLLED THE CROWD OUTSIDE LEPPINGS LANE.           THERE

 SHOULD HAVE      BEEN BETTER COMMUNICATION      BETWEEN   THE POLICE AND STEWARDS.   THERE

 SHOULD HAVE      BEEN BETTER COMMUNICATION      BETWEEN   THE POLICE OUTSIDE THE GROUND

 AND THOSE INSIDE       PARTICULARLY BETWEEN     THE CONTROL BOX AND THE POLICE BY THE

 GATES.     THE   KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN      DELAYED   WHEN IT BECAME APPARENT THAT

 l J^SE   NUMBERS OF FANS WERE STILL OUTSIDE.

 IN THE DEATHS OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 ONE OF THE MAIN FACTORS WAS THE GATES OUTSIDE OPENING.       NO DIRECTIONS AT THE

 A i N I N G PEOPLE IN THE CENTRE PENS WHICH WERE SERVING NO PURPOSE. POOR LOUD­

 SPEAKER ~ YOU HAD TO STRAIN TO HEAR    IT.

 ABOUT 4PM <1600).

 <352

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q33

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D , AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 THE COMMUNICATIONS WERE P O O R . WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN INFORMED WHAT WAS HAP P E N I N G .

 THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICEMEN JUST STANDING A R O U N D , DOING NOTHING.


G 19



 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS

 VITAL TO THIS JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE OFFICIALS OUTSIDE THE GROUND SHOULD HAVE MORE POWER TO SAY THE GAME WILL

 BE DELAYED,    IF THIS HAD BEEN DONE I'M SURE THE CRUSH OUTSIDE SHOULD HAVE

 C E A S E D . UNDOUBTEDLY THE POLICE CONTROL COULD SEE THE CENTRE PENS WERE FULL &

 SHOULD HAVE COMMUNICATED SO THE TUNNEL WAS B L O C K E D .

 I THINK THE SIDE FENCING SHOULD BE R E M O V E D .

 I ATTENDED MATCHES AT LAST YEAR'S SEMI-FINAL AND A LEAGUE GAME AT SHEFFIELD IN

 FEB THIS YEAR    <0002895. AND THE POLICE WERE WONDERFUL,            PEOPLE WERE GETTING

 MARCHED,    TICKETS CHECKED & THE CROWD FILTERED,           IT JUST D I D N ’T HAPPEN THIS

 Y E A R . THE GAME START SHOULD HAVE BEEN D E L A Y E D ,

or                  corner      of the N o r t h Stand and Leppi rigs Lane                    terrace.         After    1 had had

                   a hot       drink at       the    rear       of the North S t a n d near         to the Police Room                  i

                    collected a stool               and went       to take       up rny position on the track.

                    Once      the gates       of the ground had been opened a steaay trickle                                 of

                    supporters         began to enter             the ground and          I noticed that          the Kop end

                    of the ground began to fill                     faster       than my end..          Several   Liverpool

                    s upporters        who    had    come       into the North Stand began to                  corns clown to

                    the wall      at    the    bottom of the             stand near       to the     pitch'.      I engaged         in

                    could smell         drink       on nearly all            of them,,     Tney were however            quite

good matured and well                behaved        part    from jokingly trying                to get onto

the    pitch.        About    this     time    the    terraces       behind the          goal    at Leppings

Lane wre       beginning       to fill        up,    but a gain      compared to the.Kop end they

a p p e a r e d empty.

As m o r e    and    more Liverpool           supporters       filled       the    Stand     ana     terraces

the    usual    football       chants       began.

At about       1 pm I went        into      the Gym        for a hot meal,          after w h i c h       i

returnea       to my section of track.                     I noticed       that the Liverpool                 part

of the ground was             still     empty       compared       to other       parts.        Sup po r t e r s     in

the North S tand a p p e a r e d to be ma i n l y              families,,         c o u p l e s o l d . and

young    people of both sexes.                  The    supporters          on the L a p pings L a n e

terrace 'and the            raised section           next    to the N ortn Stand, a p p e a r e Q              to be

mo s t l y young men and by this                time       I could see       that most were             the

worse    for    drink.        At this stage           some    supporters          on the     terraces were

beginning       to    climb    into the        elevated sect i o n of the North West

terrace.        The moo d of the            crowd     in front       of me was        quite      ouoyant with

the    usual    cracks and jokes.               Several       fans    in the North Stan d wanting

to move       into    the    t e r r acss/were       direc t e d    back    into     ine Stand,         it being

ex p l a i n e d to them thatyCeing all                ticket,,      they should get             back     to

t h e :lr seats.

When the       teams             out    for a warm u ^ o c k             abcmt     the    football        chants

climbing       the    fence    that     separates          the North Stand from the Leppings

Lana    terrace.         These were         o b viously      trying      to get      into the North

With a couple             of    other officers,            from        the    ones just         coming       onto the

track,          I went    into the Stand to try to                      prevent them from               climbing

over.           These men were          on the fence          just about                'A"    entrance,        when   X

reached them,             one    had    cl imbed back,            after       shouts          that   the Police        were

toniing,         another       was almost       over and as             I reached             up to him he fell

heavily onto             the    seats of the stand.                    The    fans on the            other    side of

the       fence    became       very hostile at              this thinking 1 had                 pulled him

down.           I tried w i t h other          officers       to drag             this    person away from the

seats but was             unable       to move      him.

He was          vary heavy and appea r e d the worse                         for       drink,    as were        the fans

on the other             side    of    the fence.          These were              trying       to grab me and

throw       punches at me,              with    the    po s s i b i l i t y       that the fallen            person was

injured          I looked back at the ground                      to    see       if    I could      catch the

a t t e n t i o n of a St.        Johns a m bulance            man.           I had my back            to the    pitch

all       this    time and was          not aware       of     anything wrong                  at this time       except

the fans          near    to me were         very t hreatening                and       loud.

As    1 looked ar o u n d         I saw what a p p e a r e d            t                                   i o n from

behind          the Leppings          Lane   goal     with    fany^climbing                   over   the    perimeter

1 decided to go back down to the track as I went past                                                'A* entrance in

the       stand scores          of fans were          coming       out       of    it onto       the   seated area

of the stand and                pushing all         before        them.           1 tried to teljl them to go

back       but    it was       useless,      the amount           of    p e o p 1 e^j^wrTfng up the           entrance

was unbelievable. . They kept                       coming        out and          pushing and overflowing

onto       the track.           1 forced my way onto                   the    track and made my way to

the       people    on the       pitch..       I still       thought          it was a pitch               invasion but

whe n      i saw some          of the    fans    close       up    I could see                it was more       than

that.           However    I tried to direct               fans        back       into    the terrace         via Gate

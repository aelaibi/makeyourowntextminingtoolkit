          SIR JOHN WHEELER'S FOOTBALL (OFFENCES) BILL: COMMITTEE STAGE

          The Chief Whips Office have advised us this morning that the
          Committee Stage of Sir John Wheeler's Football Offences Bill
          in the House of Lords is to take place on Tuesday 4 June.

          Either Lord Ferrers or Lord Reay is expected to be available
          for the Committee Stage.  We will let you know who has agreed
          to be Government spokesman as soon as possible.

          I should be grateful, therefore, if any notes on clauses
          together with a draft speaking note and any necessary
          background material, could reach me by 22 May 1991.

          It would be helpful if, nearer to the date you could let
          Mr Wheeler (ext 3526) know which officials will attend the
          debate.

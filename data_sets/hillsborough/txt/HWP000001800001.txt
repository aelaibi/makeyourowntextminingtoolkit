. Hillsborough Disaster Working Party

 The Committee considered the proceedings of the
 Hillsborough Disaster Working Party of 22nd January.

 Motion by the Chair,
     duly seconded,

 That the proceedings be approved.

 Amendment by Councillor Eileen Devaney,
     seconded by Councillor Peter Millea,

 That so far as Minute 12 (Judicial Investigation) is
 concerned, this Liverpool City Council is acutely aware of
 the outrage from its citizens following the Home
 Secretary's presentation of Lord Justice Stewart-Smith's
 report as to his investigation of the Hillsborough inquiry,
 in which the decision was to take the -issues no further.

 This decision flies in the face of numerous evidence and
 has left the families, the City Council and citizens
 stunned beyond belief. Lord Justice Stewart-Smith quite
 clearly, on his arrival in Liverpool left many people in no
 doubt that he would produce a negative report.

 This City Council therefore calls upon the Home Secretary
 to look again at the evidence provided by the families and
 many others, and set aside Lord Justice Stewart-Smith's
 submission. Furthermore, this City Council continues to
 support the Hillsborough Family Support Group until justice
 for the 96 victims is finally achieved.

 The City Council further calls upon all Party Leaders at
 Westminster and M.P.s' on Merseyside to continue a campaign,
 for the rejection of Lord Justice Stewart-Smith's findings
 and for the Home Secretary to institute a new inquiry.

 Failing to do so would be an affront to the families and
 the victims.



 With the permission of the Committee, Councillor Jack
 Spriggs addressed members on this matter.



 During the course of the debate the Amendment was accepted
 and on being put as the Substantive Motion and carried it
 was resolved accordingly.

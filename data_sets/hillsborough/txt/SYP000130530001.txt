                Further to my st at em ent /r ec o1 lection dated the 28th of April         1989

                <280489)    concerning my duties at the FA cup semi final at Hillsborough

                stadium I would like to add the following.

                I attended a pre-match bri efing on F r i day the 14th of April            1989_____

                (140489) at Hi ll sbo rou gh stadium for Inspectors and above.             The

                briefing was conducted by C hi e f Superintendent DU C K E N F I E L D .    He went
                 I■■■■—— ----------- --------- -— —-----         _
                through the Operational      order for the match and gave the overview

                policy.     Views and   comments were asked for and exchanged although I

                c a n ’t be any more specific about what was said in any detail.                 The

                events that happened after the briefings have made more of an

                impression on my mind rather than the briefings themselves after a

                period of 15 months.

               At the conclusion of Mr DUCKENFIELD'S briefing,            sector   commanders were
                                                                                                PAGE        2
                                                                                                S21

    invited to brief their sub sector                           Inspectors.   To do this we split into

    groups with each Sector Commander speaking to the Inspectors who would

    be under his command.                       There was probably 20 Inspectors or their

    Sergeant        representative amongst our group.

    My GREENWOOD then reiterated the points already outlined by Mr

    DUCKENFIELD and was then more specific about the duties of each serial

    under his command.

    As can be seen by the police o rder,                          for all 3 phases of the match I was
        ,   —                       ---
    under the direct                command of Mr G R E E N W O O D , in practice for the first

    phase I would be more                       involved outside the ground which was undg-r the

t   command of Mr MARSHALL.
N__________ __________________ __________________
    At the pre-match briefing with Mr GREENWOOD he made particular

    reference to Liverpool                      fans gaining access to the Spion Hop,         this part

    of the ground being                    reserved for N o t tingham Forest suppo rt ers.          He
    ^                                  "   ■"


    qualified a point in the match order stating that under no

    circumstances were these                        "foreign*    fans to be moved from the sterile

    area without his express permission and under his personal                              direction.

    He qualified this by referring to the 13&*1 <000081) FA cup semi finals
    *



    ‘where a large number of Tottenham supporters were either transferred

    from the Spion Hop onto the Leppings Lane terraces or had been allowed

    access into these terraces on production of a Kop ticket.                               On this day

    the transferring of the supporters                           caused serious public disorder as

    they were marched past the Wolves fans.                            Coins were thrown, abuse

    shouted and insults exchanged.                         This also    caused serious    crushing

    problems on the Leppings Lane terraces.

    I particularly recall Mr GREENWOOD saying this as it meant so much to

    me.      I was actually on duty with Mr GREENWOOD at the 81                          (000081)    game

    on the perimeter track when the crushing took                             place.   In view of our

    experiences on that day Mr GREENWOOD asked me for my opinion of his

    containment strategy.                        I fully endorsed his views that the fans
                                                                                PAGE       :
                                                                                S21

          shouldn't be moved from the sterile area.

          I attended a further briefing on the 15th of April        (150489) at the

          ground which was attended by all     personnel on duty that day.     It was

          given by Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD.         He covered the main points

          that he had spoken of the day before.      Other    people followed briefing

          us on their   particular aspect   ie organisation intelligence.     I c a n ’t

          remember whether Mr GREENWOOD briefed us again that day or not but I

          certainly spoke to him on various matters.

          I then briefed my serials on their individual duties and logistics.              I

          had no reason to speak regarding the transfer of Liverpool        supporters

          from the Kop as my serials duties were in the Leppings Lane end.

          As far as I am concerned the briefings that I attended were well

          conducted,    informative and professional.

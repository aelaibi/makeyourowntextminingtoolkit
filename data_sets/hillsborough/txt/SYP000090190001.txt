I did        not    see a n y           fighting          or a n y        other        disorder          inside       the     ground.

We     had a free              passage          along         the    tunnel/ whi ch was                  virtually          empty.           I

did     not    see a n y P o l i c e m e n               or    stewards           eithei^Vl^the               entrance           to    the

I did        not    see a n y           people       drinking             inside        the      ground.

At     the    end       of     the      tunnel,          it w a s        very     busy      on the        terraces.              We w e n t

to     the    r i ght        hand       s i d e at       the       end    of    the     tunnel         and    into w h a t        I no w

know     to be          pen t h r e e .          I think            the    reason          for     going      to     the    r i ght     hand

side     was       because           we    had been            in    pen       t h r e e at      the     same m a t c h       the y e a r

before.            We    pushed           our w a y       diagonally              through          the    crowd,        towards         the

centre        of    the        pen.        It w a s       packed          in the        pen,       but    we w e r e       still       able

to     get    through             the     crowd.          We       eventually           took       up a      p o s i t i o n w h i c h w as

to     the    right          of    this     centre            of    the    pen,        t h a t ’s as y o u         look at        the

pitch        from       the       stand.         I was         a    couple        of    steps       back      from a        crush

b e h i n d me.        Because        I am      not    that       tall,     I always             stand        in f r o n t                  of         the

other     lads.         We    took      up     this    p o s i t i o n at a b o u t            quarter        to       three

(1445).         I have m a r k e d           this     position        on the          separate             grid         plan             using

the    figure        one.       Although          it w a s      packed      in the             pen,    I still                 had a

reasonable           amount        of m o v e m e n t .      During        the       next       five m i nu t e s                 or         so,

there     was a        lot    of    swaying         backwards         and       forwards.              The        swaying                   was

more    than you          get      at a n o r m a l       match,      even a             cup semi          final.                 I felt

that    it w a s       too    busy      in the        pen    for a f o o t b a l l             crowd and             it wa s

beginning         to    become        uncomfortable.                After        a few mi n ut e s                in t h a t

right     hand       side     I was       now     pinned        up a g a i n s t         the    people        in f r o n t                   of me

and    could      see     nothing         at all       of    the     pitch.              I started          having                 problems

with    my    breathing            as m y a r m s      were       pinned against                 my     chest.                 At         some

stage     the     game       kicked       off,      I didn't         see    the          kick    off,       but         people

around       me w e r e      saying       that      it h a d      started.               I h av e     no    recollection                               of

events       on the       pitch.          I became          aware     of    people             shouting           "Let             them             out,

let    them     out."         There       were      also     shouts        of    “T h e r e      being        c r u s h e d at                      the

front,       p u s h back,         push      back."         I would        estimate             that       I was            trapped                     in

this    position          for a b o u t        fifteen minutes,                 after          which       time,            I began                    to

feel    di z z y .      I started            shouting        out m y s e l f .            Somehow          I was            turned                  to

my    left    hand      side,       and      ended     up    looking        across             the    crowd,            towards                     the

N o r t h Stand.          After       fifteen minutes                or    so,       I caught          a glimpse                      of

              who      was    about       two     feet      b e h i n d me,      to the          right.              I shouted                         out

to              and managed             to     smack      him     on the        back       of    the       head.                                    saw

me an d      shortly after,               at    least       two    pairs        of       hands       grabbed            hold             of me

and    started         dragging         me     sideways         through         the       crowd       I think               it w a s

                       crowd,         towards              the    dividing           fence      between          pen     two a n d         p en    three.             At

                       the      fence,           I was       literally             thrown       over      infeo              two,         without         touching

                       down.          Whilst           in    pen two          I became          concerned about                   my      brother

                      wanted          to go           back       into    pen t h r e e       to      look       for    him,       so      I went         to    the

                      When       I got           to    the       gate,       I heard        shouts        from        the    seating          area above                  me,

fifteen minutes,                   during       which       time     he      d i d n ’t a p p e a r       to    respond.           After

fifteen minutes,                   other      Policemen           helped         the      blond      haired          policeman

carry      the      lad out         of    the      pen,    through           the     gate      in the          front       fence    and

onto     the     pitch.

blond      haired P ol ic ema n was                   in t e a r s .         I ’m not         sure what          happened          to

the     lad a f t e r .         All      I remember          of    the       lad     is X h a t      he w a s a w h i t e m a l e .

He was      aged       early        twenties.             He w a s      a b o u t J&' IQ^Co,                          a n d was

quite      skinny.           He     had      light       brown     coloiy                            Ich w a s        cut    short.

He was      clean shaven and                    did      not w e a r M a s s e s .             The       lad w o r e       blue    denim

jeans      and      he m a y       have      had a d e n i m       jacket          on as w e l l .             The    lad w o r e

whiteish         coloured           training          shoes,       he     lost       one      of    the    training          s h o e s as

he w a s    being         carried         through         the     front       fence.

During      the       course        of    the a f t e r n o o n      I did         not w i t n e s s       anything          that       I

                     Further to my previous statement dated the 26th of September                         1989

                     (260989).

                     On Thursday the 12th of October                   1989 (121089),    I was seen b

                     BROUN and                     of the West Midlands Police at my home address.

                     I was shown video recordings and albums of photographs taken at

                     Hillsborough football stadium on Saturday the 15th of April                         1989

                     <150489).

                     I was unable to identify the person I described in my previous


4*                   statement.        However   I can identify what I feel

                     where this person was being given first aid,
                                                                                         is the scene    in the pen

                        S/17,    I particularly remember a young fair haired policeman who I

                     believe      is pictured in this photograph,

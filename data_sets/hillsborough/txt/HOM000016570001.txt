      The Home Secretary has asked me to thank you
for your letter of 20 April, with which you
enclosed a copy of the evidence you have submitted
to the    inquiry into    the   tragic  events  at
Hillsborough.   He is most grateful to you for
keeping him informed, but of course is not able to
comment on the conduct of Lord Justice Taylor's
inquiry.

My Lord Ju stice Taylor.
     I should like to formally present evidence to your’ enquiry on

the Hillsborough d isaster'.
     I attended the match and have been a t approximately 25 other semi­

Football Committee, a previous Parliamentary Private Secretary to Mr.
Denis Howell the M inister for’ Sport in the Labour’ Government, and served
on the standing committee of the Safety of Grounds B ill following the
Ibrox d isa ste r.
    I am also a Sheffield Wednesday shareholder, and a member of the
House of Commons Home A ffairs S elect Committee which inv estig ates Police

Procedures.                                                                        /

                                Submission from Joe Ashton MP




    1       I have attended 25 Semi Finals a t Hillsborough and years ago there wax
    no trouble because large numbers of fans arrived by tra in a t Wadsley
    Bridge Station h a lf a mile away in good time.         On the day of the disaster
    only 500 travelled th a t way.
    2       I drove to the ground from my home in Sheffield a t noon for the o ffic ia l
    reception and easily parked in the s tr e e t 100 yards away.        Yet even then
    fans were standing outside pubs well away from the ground, drinking.
#
          Many pubs a mile from Hillsborough and down side s tr e e ts erected large
    impromptu signs saying "PUB GRUB" with arrows pointing o ff the main road.
    4     On Sunday morning several observers telephoned Radion Sheffield with
    sto rie s of excessive drinking and these tapes and witnesses should be

    a v a ila b le .
    5       I t is ci’ucial to re a lis e th a t i f the same events had occurred on a
    dark January night for’ a mid-week cup t i e i t would have been even worse,
    as i t was for the overcrowding during the Luton v Millwall t i e in 1985
    which re su ltin g in Luton banning away supporters.
    6     I f the proposed membership card had been in operation a t such a replay
    (and there would have been one the following Wednesday had the game been 4
    t ie ) then the darkness would have made rescue v irtu ally impossible.
    7     I t is well known among football fans th a t i f they go without a tic k e t
    and get squeezed into a tu r n s tile i t is p ractically impossible for them
    to be ejected back out of the tunnel because of the pressure of the crush.
    The tu r n s tile operator has no option but to allow them to climb over the
    gate.     Often a bribe is offered too; and these extra spectators may not be
    reg istered on the running to ta l of the admissions computer' in the control

    centre.
    8    I f the proposed government membership card scheme was introduced and
    an id e n tity card had to be pressed face down on a computer, or s lid through
    i t then undoubtedly some id io t would stick chewing gum on the face of i t and
    render admissions inoperable causing further delays, anger and chaos.
    9    On several occasions I and other members of the Commons Football
    Committee have v isited the Home Office and previous M inisters of Sport
%       discuss these problems but have found i t extremely d if f i c u lt to convince
    them and th e ir c iv il servants, especially, without being disrespectful,
    Southern middle class women c iv il servants,as to the problem of big grounds
    lik e Hillsborough or Old Trafford having to l i t e r a l l y swallow 35-000 fans
    in 35 minutes through 90 tu r n s tile s .   Many of the advisors, including ministers,
    have no personal experience of the problems or dangers of adding to the delay
    a t a time when the crowd is anxious and travel weary and kick o ff time is near.
    10 The quickest simplest solution to the problems is to in s is t th a t a ll
    big games where tic k e ts are in short supply should be played liv e on television
    preferably on Sunday afternoon where the t r a f f i c does not clash with shoppers.
    This is one of the reasons why there is l i t t l e trouble a t televised games
    from Wembley.
    11 Could I beg the enquiry not to rush into the idea th a t a l l seater stadiums
    are an instance panacea.      Ten years ago in Paris the Leeds fans were a ll
    seated and a fte r a disallowed goal promptly smashed the p la s tic seats with
    th e ir bower boots and threw then as jagged m issiles in to the French crowd and
    on to the pitch.
 12 At Coventry fans used to standing, simply in fu riated the re s t of the
 spectators by standing on the seats and forcing everybody else to stand on
         »
 th e irs too to see the game. Eventually they were taken out. In any case
Liverpool had 4 .OCX) more seats than N otts.Forest did on the day.
 13 In s ta llin g seats would not oily reduce the ground capacity by h alf i t
would make i t even more d i f f ic u lt to get tic k e ts , re su ltin g in even more
 fans turning up outside without one and hoping to buy or ste a l one from a
tic k e t to u t.   This too could lead to trouble.
 14 Because seat tic k e ts cost two or three times as much as standing for a
big game the poorer fan, mainly young, is going to be priced out of i t .                The
advocates of the much vaunted American stadiums do not mention how these
are invariably fille d with afflu en t middle class fam ilies and not those who
live in the ghettos of the Bronx or Harlem.           I t does in fact cost $40 to
watch the New York Giants.        One of the reasons why our inner c itie s have a
much smaller drug problem than the USA is th a t football is the "opiun of
the poor" presenting a very cheap form of asp iratio n s and release fran a
menial l i f e .    Few of the supporters can afford to pay £20 for a tic k e t and
take th e ir children a l l the way to Wembley for every big game.
15 Stadiums do have to be re-designed but there w ill always be a t least
5.000 young fans who prefer to stand and junp about behind the goal.               A

re la tiv e ly small nunber like th is can be handled with police s ittin g in front
on the touchline aided by video cameras.         This was the practice for generations
u n til the pitch invasions te r years ago,which were caused not by violence,
but by id io ts try in g to stop the game when th e ir team was losing.        The FA
put an immediate end to i t by awarding the match to the other side, but
by then sorae police forces in sisted on perimeter fences.          These must, must,
now be taken down.
    16 The current practice of allowing each Chief Constable to persue
   individual policies on crowd control must cease.          I t is a hotch potch of rules
   with some of the 43 d iffe re n t a u th o rities in sis tin g on morning kick*Offs a t
   Christmas (usually so th a t th e ir policemen can fin ish early) which creates
   even more of a mad dash down the motorways with an early s t a r t in the
   frosty dark mornings. The Home Office must le g is la te on national safety
   rules and procedures rath er than leave them to individual forces and back
^ ^ t h i s up by specialised tra in in g a t Bramshill Police College.    Otherwise when
   a big team like Liverpool is drawn away in the cup to a semi*rural small
   fourth division team the local force have no experience whatsoever.
    17 The cost of a lte rin g our grounds w ill be enormous.       Clubs like Sheffield
   Wednesday have spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on safety.            So much
   so th a t th is season th e ir own spectators demanded the resignation of the
   Board for not spending i t on player’s and only achieving modest playing
   re s u lts.     Fans say they pay to look a t a team not a ground.
   18 That is why the theory th a t football wastes money on transfer’ fees is
   fal9e.        Transfer fee money simply moves around fYom club to club like a
   daisy chain and eventually returns.        Whereas money spent on the ground is
   d if f ic u lt to recoup unless the team does well and is a much more speculative

   venture.
   19 While tb*Football Trust does an excellent job in helping clubs pay for-
   ground improvements, the government s t i l l takes 42 % of the football pools
   income as a levy, plus 15% VAT from the gate and tra n sfe rs yet gives nothing
   back to the game.
   20 Undoubtedly big grounds lik e Hillsborough have a s t a f f with a wealth of
   experience of big crowds,yet th is is not true of other clubs which rarely
   stage a semi fin a l.     The Football League must se t up crowd control training
courses too with a relevant proficiency c e r t if ic a te ,o r q u a lific a tio n ,fo r an
executive member of the club s t a f f on a ll grounds.        This should be a condition
of granting a safety licence.          Furthermore i t should be ille g a l for clubs
to discrim inate against away supporters by often lim itin g than to substandard
accomodation a t higher prices than those charged to the home crowd,because
th is often causes annoyance and fric tio n .

          En    r o ute     to     the      ground         we    did    not       stop anywhere                       but we         were     delayed           by

          football          traffic          coming          off     the     motorway.                     We    arrived          in S h e f f i e l d at

         *71.30    pm     ( 1 3 30     hrs)       and      parked       on a P u b l i c               House          car    park       I think           the

          name     of     the      pub      is     called        the    Bassett              Hound          or    similar.              It's       situated

          about      tw o     miles         from       the      ground.           We        got       to    the       ground         from     the N o r t h

          along      Leppings              Ln.




          Upon     arrival            at    the     ground         there         w as       no    queues          or     crowds         waiting           to    go

          in t h e r e      was       people        making         their         way        into       the       ground          but    no    one w a s

          forcing         their        way       in.       Just      outside            the       ground          I was          directed          by a

    C/    Policeman           on      horseback            towards          an    open           g a t e w a y at       the       side       of    the

          turnstiles.                 This       was      the    first       direction                 I h ad         been       given       by    the

          Police        I also         saw       that      there       wasn't           a    lot       of       police       presence

          outside         the      ground         except         for    two       officers                 on    horseback             and    one

          policeman           standing.

          1 went        through            the    open       gate      not       using           my    ticket.              Upon       entering

          the     ground         I went          i n to   a open area and                        I seem          to    remember          a    number

          of    policemen             to m y      right         standing          there           I also          saw       s om e     club       stew a r d;

          with     t h e m.        They were              forming       a    line           ip w h a t          appeared          to me

          across        the      o p e n ar ea.




          I then made              my way         towards          ffite t u n n e l         w h ic h w a s           in f r o n t      of me        I.

          walked        into       the      tunnel        andr u p o n       getting              in t h e r e         it    seemed          packed        with

          people        but      no m o r e       than       any    other         football                 match.           As    I walked           down

          the     tunnel         it    seemed          that     there        was        more          and more          people          and       you     could

          only     go     the      one      way     towards         the      end        of       the       tj^rfne 1.        I was       be i ng

At    this       t i me    I was wi t h my                brother         and              r iend                                     Upon

entering          the      t e r r a c e s we         we re     crush^n           forward and               then        it     eased        up a n d

then      a few         seconds         l a t er      I was p u s h e d             forward          again        unt i l       I came          up

against          a barrier.                My    b r o t r         was    b e h i n d me        and                     wa s    b e h i n d me

and      to m y      left,       at    the       time        1 was       up a g a i n s t       t he    barrier              1 had my           arm

by m y       side       and     I couldn't              move       anything.              The    barrier            was        also       in my

stomach          but      I could          j u st     about        br e a t h .




To m y       r i g ht     was    another            youth      about        18 to S O y e a r s              1 think            he    had       dark

h ai r    I ’m    unable         to     remember             what      he w a s      wearing.               He    wa s       screaming              in

fact      everyone             was    screaming              for     help.          He    was    shouting               help.         A    fe w

seconds          later,         but    it       seemed        to     take      a n age,         he     stopped           screaming              and

went      lifeless             with    hi s      head        falling        on m y        shoulder.               He     c o ul d n * t fall

to    th e     ground          I saw       t h at     his     f a ce     and      lips     went        blue.           This      was       just

after        kick       off.




At    th e     same       time       I saw a P o l i c e m a n            at      the     front        fence           shouting           and

waving         his      a r m s for        us    to     push       back     but      we    couldn't              m o ve,




A few moments                  later       I got        pushed a matter                   of    a few        feet        to m y       left          and

off      the     end      of    the    barrier.               I then        felt         someone        under          my      feet       but       I

c o u l d n ’t see         him       under       t he     crush.          I then          tried        to    p ic k      him     up       but       as

I bent         over       I was       pushed          down     on t o p        of    him,       with        people           climbing           on

top      of me       pushing          me    down.            Somehow        my      brother          and                     managed           to

pull      me     back      up to m y            fee t,        I d o n ’t k n o w w h a t             happened            to     the       man       on

the      floor       and       I d o n ’t       remember           what     he w a s       w/aring.



I was        then       pushed        over       to     my    left       a g a y f up against                the       fencing            at    the

           brother           and                     Inside       the w a l k w a y       w as    a Policeman             I shouted            for

           h im    to    h e l p me.           He    bent    down and             cupped       his    hands       through        the        fence

           so     I could          climb       over       I stood       on    his       hands     but      I c o u l d n ’t get         over

           because           I h'ad no         strength.            I shouted            that      I had     got     to     fall       on    him

           which        he    t o l d me       to    do.     After          getting       over       the    fence       I was        picked        up

           by a n o t h e r        Policeman          and    two       other       f^ffs .       1 then made            my way         through

           the     bottom          g at e     onto    the    pitchj


                                              v
           On     the    pitch          I saw v^L-«# n       on     the      floor       and     I started          shouting           for     h im

           to     get    up       but a P o l i c e m a n        t o l d me       to    stop     saying      it's       too     late        for

           him.         He    then       put a       jumper       over       the       man's     face.




           I then went               o v er    to    the    fencing,          at/'t he     e d ge     of    the     pitch a nd          he 1 pe d

           others        who       were       pulling       on    the yn re m e s h            w hich was         directly           behind        the

           goal s .          As    we    pul le d     on^it^^^bent                 and    other       people       started           pulling

           people        out.           I also       prilled s o m e         people       out.




     ,    After         a while          it s t a r t e d    to    get       too       packed     round      the     fence       so     X moved

           Whilst        at       the m a t c h      I was       wearing          an    ordinary          grey    shirt       l o ng    sleeve;

                   beige          coloured          trousers .



           Whilst        the       whole       of    this    incident             was    going       on    I could        see    that        s o me

           Policemen              seemed      to     be    doing       nothing          just     walking         rou n d,     bu t     there       wa?

           others        who       did a       very       good    job       helping       with       their       jackets        off     and

           giving        people          First       Aid and       pulling             people     out.




           I think           the     incident         was    caused          by    giving        us L i v e r p o o l     S u p p o r t e r s the

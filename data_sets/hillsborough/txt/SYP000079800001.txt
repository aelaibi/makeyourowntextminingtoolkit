I then heard a radio message,                            about 3.05      pm      (ISOS),     asking     for all

ava i l a b l e     officers       to e nter        the ground.          Initially,          I set off     running

down       the d r i v e w a y    to enter         the    ground but,         together with        1 believe POL

PC 3 21 7 and 3162,              was    told to      remain at the barrier                  by POL PS729.         This

we did and,           at this          stage,      a ss u m e d there    had      been a pitch        invasion.

This was           confirmed       by a tannoy message                asking        fans    to leave     the
                                                                                                                                   P AGE
                                                                                                                                   S2406A

               playing          area.

                I then      heard a request                 for an amb u l a n c e         and    shortly a f t e r w a r d s an

               a m bu la nc e     a pp ro a c h e d a l o n g L e p p i n g s Ln and turned                  into the d r i veway

                to be an         injured        person         being     carried by four               people    just ap p r o a c h i n g

               the     gates.          There was,           by now,       a mass      of    people        in the are a        between

                the    gates and t ur ns t i l e a rea and                   the West S t a n d building,                  part i c u l a r l y

               near     the      centre       tunnel        w hi c h    leads to the standing area.                        N u m erous

                fans were         shouting and              swearing at us,             saying         it was    our       ’fucking

               fault*      and     5go and get              s o mething      done’.

                I saw     people        in tears           a n d / l n a very d i s t r e s s e d state.            I started

                running         towards       the t u ./m e 1 , following POL P C 3 2 1 7 and again

               abuse      was     shouted at us and                    calling us       'murdering           bastards’.          POL

               P C 321 7 was       gree t e d          by a w oman who was             carried         out uncons c i o u s      by some

                fans and she was                d r op pe d near         that    o f ficer's          feet and. she         commenced

                tending         her.        I c o n tinued       towards        the   tunnel          amid great abuse and saw

               a ma n     carried out who was                    blue     in the face and a p p e a r e d dead.                    I

               assisted          carrying         this m a n       into a more         open area and             left him with

                some    fans      offering             first aid whilst            I r e t urned to the            tunnel.         There

               were     dozens         of    'walking wounded'               and      I carried two more               people      out

                previ o u s l y    been on duty.

                I then a s si st ed and gave                    basic     first ,4id to 4 or 3 men who were

               o bv io u s l y alive          h n je    poorly,        and ass i st ed other            officers       t o ca r ry

                1 then went            to the a ss is t a n c e          of one middle aged man who was                        being

I s* #»        tended      by some           fans,       one   of who m said he was an o f f-duty f i r e m a n .                         He

          / M r was    bleeding         from the m ou t h and               convulsing.               A man then a p p r o a c h e d

                                                                                                               SS406A

saying       he was a d o c t o r (I have                since       recog n i s e d him as Dr AS H T O N

L i ve r p o o l    Uni v e r s i t y ) .   He    said the man was              bleeding       internally and

as k e d me who was               prioritising.              I said    I did not know,             he a sked who

was    in charge.                I looked a r o un d and            saw no Senior O f f icers           so    replied,

” 1 am."           He said we must            prioritize,            this man     is first         for an

a mbulance.            As he said this an a m b u l a n c e a r r i v e d and                  I flag g e d    it down

a d ja ce nt       to us an d       I a s s i s t e d to      place    this man        in the a m b ulance
                            A/
together           with Dr A SH M O R E and two other                  fans.

I then a s s i s t e d         placing a second               injured      person      in the      same ambulance.

I then went            to assit         two more      recently a r r i v e d          injured fans who were

propped up agai n s t               the     perimeter        wall     near     the exit gate.           One was

n ak e d from the waist                 up and s h ivering with either                   cold or shock.            I

gave     him,       and a s s i s t e d him to        put on,         my   police anorak.

I then       looked over            to the       other       side    of the / d r i v e w a y where,     by now,

some S---10 a p p a r e n t l y         dead bodies were              1a j/d   out.     I saw a pol i ce w oman

(P QL P C 3 162 ) kne 11 down g i v i ng                 car di a / m a s s a g e t o o ne of the            bodi es

w h i ch had been            presumed        dead.       A            1a n c e ina n was also         just

a t t e n d in g    the    same     person and        I went         over and     commenced giving mguth

t.o m ou th        r e su sc it at io n to the man w ith the aid                      of a    ' resusciaid' .

This     continued           for about        10 minutes            whilst     the ambu. 1anc:e rnan and

anot h e r     a tt en d i n g     doctor     fitted a drip to his arm.                       Prior    to being

placed       in the a m bu la nc e           it was      stated that           he had a pulse.

I then       remained,         in that       location gen e r a l l y tending                the   injured until

a 11 had       bee n t rans ported            i n a m b u 1anc e s .

                                                                Date:       II-    October 1997




Thank you for the letter which you handed to me on 8 October during your family’s private
meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith.

You ask for a full copy of a video film showing the temporary mortuary which was set up at
the Hillsborough Football Stadium on the day of the disaster. The video belongs to South
Yorkshire Police and Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has no power to release it to you without their
consent.

I have however discussed the position with them. The video (which the Judge and I have
had to see as part of the Scrutiny) does as you say show scenes in the temporary mortuary,
with the bodies of those who had died laid out on the floor. The police tell us that they are
willing to release to relatives’ families, or to others who have a proper interest, copies of stills
from this video which show individuals who died.

But they will not release stills which show the bodies of other people who died or copies of
the video itself. These are distressing scenes and the police take the view that it would not
be proper, and could be upsetting to the surviving relatives of many of those shown on the
video, to allow others to have access to these pictures of their relatives or to moving images
from the video.

That as I say is the position which the police take. We cannot require them to surrender this
or any other material to you. If you or Mrs Sefton would like access to a still from the video,
or to take the matter further, I would suggest that you do so with the police.

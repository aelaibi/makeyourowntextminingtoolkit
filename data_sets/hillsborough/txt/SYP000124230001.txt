  I DIDNT SEE ANYONE ACTUALLY DIE ALTHOUGH I DID SEE DEAD PEOPLE ON THE PITCH

  IN THfe PENALTY AREA.

  G48

  DID YOU ASSIST ANYONE WHO WAS DEAD OR INJURED, IF SO, BRIEFLY EXPLAIN.

 NO WHEN I EVENTUALLY GOT OUT OF THE PEN I WAS COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED.

  I WAS JUST STAGGERING ABOUT AND COULD NOT DO ANYTHING AT ALL.


G17

i G49

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER WAS A FACTOR IN THE DEATHS,

 OR THE INJURIES TO ANY PERSON?

 l H " H E SIDE FENCINGS IN PEN eT'g-NAND 4 HAD NOT BEEN PRESENT THE
                                      \                O f T               C O K / U
 PEOPLE WOULD HAVE HAD AN ESCAPE RO^TE.        THERE WAS NO PROPER ORGANISATION

 OF THE QUEUES OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES        NO\ FILTERING OF FANS BEFORE

 THEY REACHED THE TURNSTILES NO OBVIOUS SICRfS DIRECTING FANS TO THE SIDE

 AREAS AND COMPLETE LACK OF POLICE/STEWARDS IN VICINITY OF TUNNEL TO

 DIRECT PEOPLE TO EITHER SIDE.

 Q50

I WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 4.25 (1625)



 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OWN ACCORD


G18

  G52

 DID,YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

  I SAW ONE MAN BEING HIT BY ANOTHER BUT FEEL THAT IT WAS ONLY IN

  FRUSTRATION AND ANGER AT WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE THIS OCCURRED NOT LONG

  BEFORE WE LEFT THE GROUND.
                                                                                  PAGE    9

 G53

 DO YOtl HAVE ANY VIEWS OR O B S E R V A T I O N S ^ THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I SAW A LINE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED OFFICERS ACROSS THE PITCH WHICH I FEEL WAS
                                                                           v       -



 TOTALLY WRONG.  THERE WAS A SLIM POLICEWOMAN TRYING TO GET INJURED PEOPLE

OUT OF THE PENS OVER THE HIGH FENCING WHEN STRONG POLICEMEN WERE STANDING

DOING NOTHING.     THERE WAS A TANNOY POLICE ANNOUNCEMENT WHICH SEEMED RIDICULOUS

ASKING LIVERPOOL FANS TO GET OFF THE PITCH AND BACK ONTO THE TERRACES

ABOUT (3.25)(1525) THERE WERE A TOTAL LACK OF STRETCHERS FOR THE INJURED

AND I SAW ONLY ONE AMBULANCE.

G^|

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 I AM CONVINCED THAT THE MAIN REASON WHY SUPPORTERS WERE LATE ARRIVING AT THE

MATCH WAS NOT DUE TO THEM DRINKING FOR LONG PERIODS IN PUBS BUT BECAUSE

OF THE TRAFFIC DELAYS CAUSED BY ACCIDENTS, ROADWORKS AND ALSO THE POLICE STOP

CHECKS OF VANS AND COACHES NEAR TO SHEFFIELD.         I FEEL THAT THE PRESENCE OF

THE FENCING AT THE GROUND WAS A MISTAKE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND SHOULD BE

REMOVED FROM ALL GROUNDS.       IN PARTICULAR THE SIDE SEPARATING FENCES.

 THERE WERE THINGS Cdlti^G OVER ON THE TANNOY, BUT YOU COULDN'T MAKE THEM

 O U T , THE POLICE INITI ALLY'TREATED THE INCIDENT AS A PITCH INVASION WHEN

 OBVIOUSLY IT WAS NOT.     THEY WERE SLOW TO OPEN THE GATES AND ONE YOUTH WAS

 PREVENTED FROM PULLING AT THE F E N b ^ 3 IN PEN 4, ON THE FIRST OCCASION, BUT

 LATER HE WAS ASSISTED BY TWO POLICE OFFICERS TO RIP DOWN THIS FENCING AND

 PEOPLE GOT OUT.     THE GROUND AUTHORITIES FAILED TO EXPLOIT ANOTHER MEANS OF

 C^UNICATION,      THE ELECTRONIC SCORE BOARD, THEY COULD HAVE GIVEN DIRECTIONS

 ON THIS BUT INSTEAD WERE ADVERTISING HOLIDAYS WHICH I THOUGHT WAS TASTELESS.

 THE CORDON OF POLICE ACROSS THE HALFWAY LINE WAS A WASTE OF MANPOWER, AND

 THEY HAMPERED     THE MOVEMENT OF THE INJURED AND DEAD TOWARDS THE NORTH EAST

 CORNER OF THE GROUND.

 THERE WAS NO-BODY AT 15.30 HRS (1530) WHO TOOK CONTROL OF THE AREA WHERE WE

 WERE TAKING BODIES, UNDER THE NORTH STAND, I REMEMBER ON OCCASION WE HAD TO

 SEARCH FOR A SPACE TO PUT THIS LAD DOWN THERE WAS NO DOCTOR TO SAY WHO WAS v.

 ALIVE OR WHO WAS DEAD.

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE GAME SHOULD HAVE NEVER STARTED, WITH THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE IN THE TWO

 CENTRAL PENS,    I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHORITIES WERE NOT AWARE OF THE

 CROWDING THAT WAS TAKING PLACE IN PENS 3 AND 4 AS THE FANS IN THE GROUND WERE

 AWARE OF THE CROWDING, MYSELF INCLUDED.

TOTAL LACK OF CO-ORDINATION AND ORGANISATION: If POLICE.        IT COULD HAVE BEEN

CAUSED BY LACK OF EXPERIENCE OR TRAINING.       LACK OF MEDICAL TEAMS AND ACCESS TO

^ E     GROUND.   ALL THE MEDICAL SERVICES WERE THE OTHER END OF THE PITCH,      IT

NEEDED SOMEONE TO TAKE CONTROL.

Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

THE FENCES SHOULDN’T HAVE BEEN THERE.       THERE ALSO SEEMED TO BE A LACK OF

COMMUNICATION FROM OUTSIDE THE GROUND       TO INSIDE.

THE ACCESS TO THE GROUND WAS N ’T ADEQUATE    FOR THE SIZE OF CROWD TRYING     TO GET

 IN.     IT NEEDED A FILTER SYSTEM NEAR THE GROUND TO CONTROL THE FLOW TO THE

|pUND.       SO MANY THINGS HAPPENED THAT WENT WRONG.     THAT ALL ADDED UP TO THE

TRAGEDY.      THE MAJOR FACTOR WAS THE DESIGN OF THE GROUND, THERE WERE

 INSUFFICIENT TURNSTILES FOR THE CROWD.      THE MOUNTED POLICE WERE TOO NEAR THE

TURNSTILES THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN FURTHER AWAY DOING A FILTERING JOB.

 G5Q

 WHAT TIME DID YOU LEAVE THE FOOTBALL GROUND?

 ABOUT 4.30 PM (1630).

 G51

 DID YOU LEAVE ON THE DIRECTION OF EITHER A POLICE OFFICER, A STEWARD, A LOUD

 SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 OF MY OWN ACCORD ALTHOUGH I DID HEAR THE LOUD SPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT SAYING THAT

 THE GAME HAD BEEN ABANDONED, BUT ASKING PEOPLE NOT TO LEAVE UNTIL THE

 EMERGENCY SERVICES HAD DONE WHAT THEY HAD TO DO (THAT WAS AT ABOUT 4.05)

 (1605) .


Qlfl^

 852

 DID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CRIMINAL OFFENCE?

 NO.

 Q53

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 WHEN I FIRST SAW FANS CLIMBING OVER THE PERIMETER FENCING I THOUGHT IT WAS A

 PITCH INVASION ALTHOUGH I COULDN'T SEE ANY MOTIVE FOR IT.     I SAW POLICEMEN

 Sj^pPING THEM FROM GETTING OVER AT FIRST, THEY POSSIBLY THOUGHT THE SAME AS

 ME.    EVENTUALLY I DID   SEE POLICE OFFICERS HELPING FANS OVER THE FENCING.

 Q54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 •1. THE SIGNS DIRECTING PEOPLE TO THE TERRACES WERE NON EX ISTENT.   THE TUNNEL

 APPEARED TO BE THE ONLY ACCESS TO THE TERRACES.     WE ALSO LEFT THE GROUND VIA

 THE TUNNEL NOT REALISING THERE WAS ANY OTHER EXITS.

 2. I FEEL BETTER POLICING OUTSIDE FORMING QUEUES WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE

 CROWDING OUTSIDE.         •,             <^cy*-v

  THERE WERE FOOT OFFICERS STANDING OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES, AND TWO MOUNTED

  POLICE OFFICERS IN FRONT OF THEM. THEY WERE GETTING ANNOYED AT THE LIVERPOOL

  F 0 P AND TELLING THEM TO PUSH BACK. OBVIOUSLY THEY COULDN’T BECAUSE OF THE

  FORCE OF PEOPLE BEHIND. THE HORSES BECAME A DANGER, BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE BEING

  PUSHED INTO THEM. EVENTUALLY THE HORSES WERE TAKEN AWAY AND THE CROWD WERE NO

  LONGER BEING CHANNELLED TOWARDS THE ENTRANCE. THE CROWD SURGED FORWARD INTO

  THE GAP THE HORSES HAD LEFT AND THE POLICE OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE TURNSTILES

  WERE BEING CRUSHED AGAINST THE WALL BY THE CROWD. FANS HAD TO PUT THEIR ARMS

  EITHER SIDE OF THE OFFICERS* HEADS & PUSH OFF THE WALL. EVENTUALLY THEY WENT

  THROUGH THE TURNSTILES TO GET OUT OF THE CRUSH.

 YES.   IN PEN 3 WHERE I WAS STANDING THERE WAS A BARRIER IMMEDIATELY BEHIND ME

A ^ P TWO LADS (ABOUT 14? WERE CRUSHED AGAINST THE BARRIER. THEY COULDN’T MOVE

AND THE CROWD HAD BENT THEM DOUBLE OVER THIS BARRIER. ONE I COULD PULL OUT

 WITHOUT TOO MUCH DIFFICULTY, BUT   THE OTHER WE COULDN'T MOVE HIM. FIRST OF       ALL

HE TRIED TO GO DOWN, BUT HE WASN’T QUICK ENOUGH AND HE WAS TRAPPED       BY THE NECK

 & UPPER CHEST, AND HIS MOUTH CAME OPEN AND ALL SPIT CAME OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

 ABOUT THREE OF US PUSHED THE CROWD BACK AGAIN, AND THIS YOUTH TRIED TO CLIMB

OVER THE BARRIER. AGAIN HE WASN ’T QUICK ENOUGH AND ONE OF HIS LEGS GOT CAUGHT

BETWEEN THE BARRIER AND THE CROWD. HE WAS OBVIOUSLY IN A LOT OF PAIN

 THROUGHOUT ALL THIS; HIS FACE WAS BRIGHT RED. AFTER ABOUT A COUPLE OF MINUTES

l^pfREED THIS M A N ’S LEG, BUT I’VE NO IDEA WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

 I C A N ’T DESCRIBE HIM, APART FROM SAYING HE WAS ABOUT 14 YRS AND WEARING JEANS,

 WHITE, 5 ’9, SHORT HAIR.

 I ALSO HELPED SOME MIDDLE-AGED FELLA STANDING NEXT TO ME. IT WAS WHEN THE

 CRUSH WAS REALLY BAD AND HE SAID TO ME, "HEY LAD COULD YOU HELP ME UP OVER THE

 TOP BECAUSE I THINK I’M GOING TO   COLLAPSE. *'   I HELPED HIM OVER THE SIDE

 FENCING AND DOWN OVER THE TOP OF   PEOPLE’S HEADS.

 WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THERE WAS A POLICEMAN STANDING IN THE STAND LOOKING DOWN ON

 PEN 3. THE PEOPLE IN CROWD WERE SHOUTING TO HIM ASKING FOR ASSISTANCE, PEOPLE

 ALSO IN THE STAND WERE TRYING TO GET HIM TO DO SOMETHING, BUT HE DID NOTHING.

 THE POLICE OFFICERS.AT THE FRONT WERE JUST TELLING THE CROWD TO MOVE BACK, BUT

 WE COULDN’T BECAUSE OF THE CRUSH.         O M    T O         \        __

 PEOPLE DID NOT REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING, THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION

 BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND THE CROWD, TO INFORM THEM OF THE SERIOUS NATURE

 OF THE DISASTER, HAD THAT BEEN THE CASE, NOTTS FOREST FANS WOULD NOT HAVE

 BEEN CHANTING AT LIVERPOOL FANS, AND LIVERPOOL FANS WOULD NOT HAVE RUN UP

 THE PITCH IN RETALIATION - NOT ENOUGH STRETCHERS.   I DIDN'T SEE MANY ST JOHNS

 AMBULANCE,   I DIDN'T THINK THERE WAS ENOUGH POLICE IN THE GROUND, THEY DIDN'T

 APPEAR TO BE AROUND THE PERIMETER FENCES WHERE THEY USUALLY ARE.

 END OF THE GROUND.

 COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.                     I       WAS STUCK THERE FOR SOME TIM E UNABLE TO MOVE,                               I THINK

 THE FIREMAN CUT THE FRONT FENCE OPEN TO GET PEOPLE OUT,                                                   WHICH EASED THE

 IT    STRUCK ME THAT THERE WERE TOO MANY D I V I D I N G FENCES MEANING THAT IF

 PRESSURE B U IL T UP THERE WAS NO WHERE TO ESCAPE TO.                  T H E LACK OF SIGNS DIDNT

         MATTERS,       PEOPLE WOULDN’ T KNOW WHERE TO GO,            THE GATES O N T O THE P ITC H

 ANNOUNCEMENTS TO CLEAR THE P IT C H ,            THAT WAS ANNOYING.

 D ID YOU WITNESS ANYTHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE A CR IM IN A L OFFENCE?

 NO


G"I8

 G33

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE IN C ID E N T WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 I T WAS JUST CHAOS ON THE P IT C H ,           NO AMBULANCES OR ADEQUATE FIRST A ID

 ^PM EN T.          XT   ALL CAME TOO LA TE .

 THE POLICE D I D N ’ T REACT TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING. AT THE START THEY WERE

 PUSHING PEOPLE BACK WHO WERE TRYING TO ESCAPE AND THE WERE IGNORING                       PEOPLE

 WHO WERE SCREAMING FOR HELP.

 THERE D I D N ’ T SEEM TO BE ANY KIND OF RESCUE OPERATION ,            THE PO LICE SEEMED

 MORE INTENT ON CONTROLLING A CROWD PROBLEM THAN TRYING TO A S S IS T AND

 HELP ANYBODY.

 G53A

 D ID YOU ATTEND THE GAME LAST YEAR?

 #            -

G19

 G53B

 CAN YOU COMPARE THE P O L IC IN G OPERATION?

 LAST YEAR THERE WAS A L IN E OF POLICE BY THE BLUE IRONGATES,                    DOING A QUICK

 BODY SEARCH AND CHECKING TIC K E TS SO THERE WAS NO BU ILD UP AT THE TU RNS TILES .

 YOU COULD GET STRAIGHT            IN .

 G54

 I S THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL I S V IT A L TO T H IS

 J U D IC IA L    INQUIRY?
 THERE WAS A LACK OF COMMUNICATION,           NOBODY KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.          AN

 ANNOUNCEMENT OVER THE TANNOY SYSTEM WOULD,               I THINK HAVE BEEN GOOD, BECAUSE

 THEN PEOPLE WOULD KNOW I T       WASN’ T A P ITC H   IN V A S IO N .

 THE KICK OFF SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO ALLOW INCOMING FANS T IM E TO GET IN

 AND PREVENT A RUSH TO THE CENTRE STANDING AREA.

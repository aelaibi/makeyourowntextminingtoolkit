            Dear

            Thank you for your recent letter.           I apologise for the delay
            in replying to you.

            Unfortunately I am unable to send you a copy of Lord Justice
            Taylor's Final Report on the Hillsborough Stadium disaster.
            However, it is available for Her Majesty's Stationery Office
            bookshops (code no ISBN 0 10 109622 4) at £10.50.  Your
            nearest HMSO is at 71 Lothian Road, Edinburgh, EH3 9AZ
            (031 228 41810.  I hope this information is of use to you.

                                                                       Yours sincerely

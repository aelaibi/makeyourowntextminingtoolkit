EC AID FOR HILLSBOROUGH

We discussed a little while ago Mr Williamson's letter of 3 May
to Sir David Hannay announcing the Commission's grant for 100,000
ECUs for the victims of Hillsborough and their families.

As I recall, we left the issue with you considering whether ECD
would provide a draft response acknowledging the grant.

I have not seen anything since then, although I have provided
details of the Hillsborough Disaster Fund's bank account t h ^ Q a n
Hingston at UKRep to Paolini at the Commission; Alan will ensure
that we know when monies are actually paid over, to enable a
thank you letter to go at that point if it has not already done
so.

I would be grateful if you could confirm that you are still
leading on this.  Copies of this letter go to Alan Hingston at
UKRep, and Tony Budd at the Cabinet Office.

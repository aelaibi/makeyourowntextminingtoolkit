                             Account of Events


Background

I travelled with my brother and three friends to Sheffield by car departing
from the 'Gardeners Arms', Liverpool, at 11.15 a.m. We are all season
ticket holders at Anfield. We travelled via the M62 and M1 to Sheffield.
The M62 heading towards Manchester was fairly busy with traffic travelling
to either Hillsborough or Villa Park with scarves flying from windows
showing the destinations of the cars. There was congestion on the M62
as we rounded Manchester to the north and headed towards the Pennines.
The stretch of motorway up to Saddleworth was very busy and was in fact
at a standstill for perhaps 3, 4 or 5 miles on that stretch of road. There
was stop-start motoring for perhaps half an hour. We arrived in Sheffield
at about 1.20 p.m. and parked the car in Avisford Road approximately half
a mile from the Ground.

At that comparatively early time there were numerous Liverpool fans in
the vicinity. We called at the local off-licence where I purchased two
cans of lager. Fans queued outside the off-licence while the manageress
let us in two at a time. Others queued patiently for fish and chips.
None of the pubs were open. We sat down on a wall adjoining the
dual-carriageway, enjoying the sunshine, anticipating the match and
discussing the team Liverpool were going to field for the match. Streams
of fans passed heading for the Ground. At about 2.25 p.m. we started to
make our way to the Ground. At that time cars and coaches were still
coming down the road, dropping fans off, and looking for places to park.


                                 SECTION 2

                         Events outside the Ground

As we approached the Ground we passed underneath a railway bridge, passed
two stone cottages on the left-hand side, an industrial estate on the
right-hand side, preceded by an old style coaching inn also on the
right-hand side, we came upon some waste ground on the left-hand side,
at the side of which a group of policemen were standing blocking the
pavement. The group was fronted by a big policeman with a beard. The
group of policemen were preventing fans from going beyond that point with
any alcoholic drinks, cans or bottles. I did not see anybody who was
incapable through consumption of alcohol. We stopped briefly to finis
off a can and proceeded towards the Ground. We crossed over the
dual-carriageway adjacent to a traffic island and bore right towards the
Ground. The number of people heading towards the Ground was similar to
what I had experienced at similar junctures heading towards Anfield on
match days. We arrived at the perimeter of the Ground at approximately
2.35 p.m. There were a number of policemen standing on street corners
and the neighbouring streets to the Ground were coned and blocked-off with
fencing. At the edge of the Ground, to the left, were the queues for the
turnstiles for the stands in which the Liverpool fans were to be placed
and slightly to the right was a gate through which I could see a throng
of fans waiting to get through the turnstiles for the Leppings Lane end
of the Ground, for which I had a ticket. At this point our group split
up, my brother and two friends had stand tickets, one friend and myself
had tickets for the 'B' Section of the Leppings Lane enclosure. As we
walked towards the Leppings Lane queue, there must have been more than
a thousand Liverpool fans making their way to the two sets of turnstiles
in addition to the numbers inside the first entrance gate to the Leppings
Lane end, through which I could see quite a crowd building up trying to
get through the turnstiles. As we passed through the outer gate for the
Leppings Lane end, I was aware of a number of policemen, a couple on
horseback, most on foot, standing still in pairs and a minibus full of
policemen, parked in what may have been a slip road on the right-hand side.
Straight ahead through that entrance gate was a sizeable crowd with one
policeman on horseback. There was no indication of any other policeman
in the vicinity between the entrance gate and the turnstiles. The space
between the entrance and the turnstiles, appeared to me to be similar to
a courtyard, was roughly square and full of Liverpool fans clamouring to
get through the turnstiles. To the left in the courtyard were some fans
sitting abreast the wall and moving towards the turnstiles and some climbed
over the top of the turnstiles. I assume that this handful of people,
perhaps a dozen at the most, had no tickets. The crowd of people within
the couryard filled the entire area and appeared to me to be out of control
at that stage. The policeman on horseback appeared very agitated in what
was a vain attempt to impose some sort of control on the crowd. There
were a number of shouts from the crowd to the police begging them to impose
 some order and gain some control. There was tension within the crowd
 frustrated in attempts to enter the Ground. There was also tension etched
 on the face of the mounted policeman as he berated those in the crowd who
 were complaining at the lack of control. Apart from the policeman on
 horseback, there was no attempt to try to partition the crowd or to
 establish ranks or columns for orderly queues. Because of the numbers
 in the crowd, and the general milling and shoving around, it was not clear
 to me at that stage how many turnstiles there were at that enclosure.
 I think there were perhaps six or eight at most. What was clear however,
 was that the number of turnstiles was not accommodating the number of
 people seeking to gain entry at 2.40 p.m.

Although we had entered via the gate to the left of the courtyard, movement
in the crowd was such that we found ourselves being flanked to the right.
We were in that crowd for between 10 and 15 minutes. I remember thinking
that we would be lucky to get into the Ground before kick-off time. At
this stage, in apparent desperation, some fans were actually climbing above
the turnstile walls to gain entry to the Ground. I watched three fans
scale the turnstiles in this fashion. These people were in the crowd near
the turnstiles, it is not clear whether or not they had tickets. We w®r®
within perhaps fifteen or twenty people of the turnstiles, at between 2.5
and 2 .5 5 p.m, when a concertina metal door was opened at right angles to
the turnstiles. Seeing a way out of the troubles, we made for the gate,
which was held open by a policeman, and were among thefirst dozen or so
people to pass through that gate. As we passed through the gate, two or




                                   - 2 -
three people in front of us fell over, and I was shoved, along with several
other people to the ground. Although I was on the ground for no more than
a couple of seconds, I was shaken by the experience and struggled to keep .
hold of my glasses to prevent them being broken. Someone in the crowd
of people, yanked me up and yelled to others to get up and suddenly I was
on my feet once more. We were then inside the Ground, my ticket was still
in my wallet, nobody asked to inspect it, to check it or to tear off the
stub. My friend was in the same position as I was, he too had been shoved
to the ground and picked up again and he too had a ticket which had not
been inspected by anybody.

                                 SECTION 3

                             Inside the Ground

We were thus inside the Ground, ahead of us was entrance 'B', with a big
gate and a tunnel, through which I could see the playing area. There were
no stewards or police to give directions or to channel fans into the
relevant enclosures. As my ticket was for enclosure 'B' I made to head
for the tunnel. My friend, who had been in that section of the Ground
at the same game last year, told me that we would be safer keeping to the
right, round what appeared to be the side of the Stand. Others headed
for the tunnel. We went down a passageway with a cast-iron staircase on
the left-hand side, a brick wall on the right, at the end of which people
were standing on the terrace and the Ground was before us with the Forest
fans straight ahead at the other end of the Ground and in the Stand to
our right. There was plenty of room still on the terrace where we were
standing and we were able to select an appropriate vantage point.
This was the first time I had been to Hillsborough, and X remarked to my
friend that it appeared different than it does on the television. Within
thirty seconds or so of arriving on the terrace, the tannoy announcer read
out the Liverpool team. I was pleasantly surprised to hear the name of
Alan Hansen included in the side. I noticed also for the first time the
Liverpool section of the crowd in the rest of the Leppings Lane terrace,
divided from the rest of us by iron railings. I was at a loss to
immediately comprehend why terracing for the entire away section of the
Ground was divided into pens in this fashion. Moreover I could not see
any gap in the railings. I was not surprised to see the fencing at the
front of the crowd separating the enclosure from the playing area. I did
not pay any attention to whether there were any gates within that fence.
There was no time to dwell on any of these matters, because the Liverpool
 team appeared at that moment from the tunnel. The Forest team then
emerged and the two sides warmed up for perhaps two minutes at the most
prior to the kick-off. I was relieved to be in for the kickoff as the
game started. My watch said bang on three o'clock. My section of the
Ground was still nowhere near full. I did not pay much attention to this
 as I watched the game unfold. What did strike me however at this time,
was the vast number of people in the kop enclosure at the opposite end
 of the Ground. I was irritated that this section of the Ground had been
 allocated to the Forest supporters rather than ourselves.

The early play in the game was frantic as one might expect. As Beardsley
hit the bar there was movement in our section of the crowd. This was no
different to that which one experiences in the Kop under similar
circumstances. Immediately after this moment of action, my attention was




                                   - 3 -
distracted by a group of fans appearing from the left-hand side and
spilling towards the pitch and by perhaps two young people climbing over
the fencing behind the goal. This number was quickly added to and several
youths ran onto the pitch to attract the attention of the referee and the
police. The police appeared to be arresting and holding people who were
scaling the fences. Policemen were standing next to the fencing and
yelling at the fans to get back. Fans were pleading with the police trying
to explain to them what was happening. The police could either not hear,
or took no notice of the cries. Fans continued to spill onto the pitch
and policemen continued to try to contain them. Several fans got onto
the pitch amongst the players. There were yells of disapproval from the
crowd. The referee called all the players off the pitch. Suddenly there
was a considerable number of fans on the pitch. The police had still not
appreciated what was happening. A number of fans were lying down on the
pitch and groups of fans were running round trying to help and see to them.

The police then appeared to grasp the true situation and thoseon the other
side of the fencing started to try to help those people eitherclimb
through the gates or, where   possible, to climb over the fencing. I watched
two or three policemen jump into the crowd from the fencing to try to help
the situation. Fans were desperately trying to climb the fence from within
the pen. I could not see any stretchers or any sign of mass activity to
try to help. There was some anger in the crowd at this stage as the Forest
fans jeered at what must have appeared to them to be a pitch invasion.
Fans were now starting to rip up advert hoardings to use as stretchers
to carry away the injured or the dead. Some fans were trying to pull away
the perimeter fencing from the pen. Groups of fans were gathered round,
some dazed, some injured and a significant number milling round seeking
to help those who were injured or needing resuscitation. First aiders
and some of the police at the Leppings Lane end were helping with this
process. However I am left with the overall impression that the police
were of the opinion that this situation was borne out of a crowd invasion
rather than anything else - concerted police action took the form of lining
up a stream of policemen across the centre of the pitch, with the obvious
intention of containing the crowd or a crowd invasion. Although I am not
fully aware of the rationale for this, I can only assume that it was to
prevent a crowd invasion by Liverpool fans towards the Forest end. If
the intention was to help alleviate the crowd congestion or the obvious
distress of the Liverpool fans, this was not immediately apparent. After
stretcher bearers had made several runs to the opposite corner of the
playing area, an ambulance drove slowly around the perimeter of the Ground
and stopped behind the goal. It was patently obvious that a serious
situation had unfolded. Efforts at resuscitation and rescuing of the
injured or dead continued both on the pitch and on the section of terracing
affected. My mind is full of images of people being carried out over the
top of the fencing unconscious or even dead and of crowds of people
including policemen, fighting desperately to resuscitate people on the
ground in front of me. I was numbed by what I was seeing. My friend said,
"Let's get out of here its just like Heysel all over again". I felt unable
to move.

As the severity of the situation became apparent, supporters of both clubs,
all around the Ground applauded the efforts of the fans and the police
to ferry the injured people out of the Ground.
My friend turned to me and said that we needed to make more room in our
section of the terrace to try to ease the congestion in the centre of the
terrace. We started yelling for the crowd around us to move to our right.
In shock, people followed the instruction. Unfortunately this did not
make any material difference to the situation.

The stretcher bearer shuttle continued for perhaps twenty-five minutes
or more with people lying around dead or injured. The next memory I have
of any change in this pattern was when a youth was seen to be clambering
on the crossbar of the goal at the Liverpool end. There were expressions
of displeasure from the crowd at this until it was realised that the youth
was in fact helping to remove the net. I had my personal stereo tuned
in to Radio 2 at this time and almost absentmindedly I flicked across to
hear what was being said. The commentator appeared to be as bewildered
as other people within the stadium and was reporting on the number of
people who had been carried out on the makeshift stretchers. He remarked
even at that stage that the game had to be abandoned and that the situation
was severe. I switched off the radio and watched as further advertising
hoardings were ripped off the walls to help make more stretchers.

It is difficult to remember clearly what happened from thereon as the
number of stretchers and number of injured blurred into one long moment
of anguish. One moment which remains in my mind however is that of a
person attempting to resuscitate a lifeless body and calling for an oxygen
cylinder from the St. John Ambulance. This cylinder was brought but
appeared to be useless.   The body being attended to was then carried off
down the Forest Stand to our right.    I could see no movement on the
stretcher. There were small children and teenagers amongst the bodies
on the pitch.

I could hear on the tannoy system vague attempts by an announcer to give
a message to the crowd.   Although I was close enough to a tannoy to have
heard the pre-match team news, I could make no words out that were being
spoken at that time. I tuned in once more to the radio to see if I could
ascertain any further news from that source. The radio commentator said
that they had unconfirmed reports of five people dead. Although this news
was shocking enough in itself, it did not tally in my own mind with the
sheer number of people and the sheer effort of people concerned in helping
the numerous injured and with the number of stretchers and advertising
hoardings I'd seen in use.

Kenny Dalglish then appeared on the steps of the policebox to our right
and went into the box. A minute or so later he emerged still ashen faced
and made his way down the steps. Immediately over the tannoy suddenly
a voice was clear, the voice of Kenny Dalglish relaying a message to the
crowd giving an indication of the seriousness of the situation and asking
people to remain calm and to assist the police in their efforts to stablise
the situation. This was the only communication which I heard over the
tannoy.

I noticed for the first time at this stage some firemen among the people
assisting on the pitch.

Time completely passed me by and I remember an announcement over the tannoy
at about 4.15 p.m. that the game had been officially abandoned. We were
requested to remain in our places until all the injured and dead had been
removed from the scene. We stood by until immediately after twenty to
five when we made our way silently towards the exit. At the exit was a
queue of people waiting to get out held up by the police whilst the injured
on the other side of an exit gate were removed to hospital and safety.
After what I had just witnessed I was apprehensive about joining any crowd,
and instead kept to the left-hand side near a wall, just on the edge of
the line of officers shepherding fans through the exit when it was opened.
We talked to a policeman last in the line nearest the wall who was perhaps
in his mid forties. None of us seemed to be able to make much sense of
what we had seen or indeed what we were saying. The policemen and women
appeared as shocked and horrified by what they had seen as we were. Mr.
Robinson, the Chief Executive of Liverpool with two others, passed by
looking pensive. Five minutes or so later we went through the exit in
silence and made our way back to the car. People in the crowd heading
back up the dual-carriageway were commenting on the tragedy and speculating
on the causes thereof. We saw one of our friends near the waste ground
on the dual-carriageway and walked up the hill exchanging some impressions
of what we had seen. I told him that the radio had talked about five
people being dead. He like us was horrified at five deaths. When we
arrived at Avisford Road, I was very relieved to see my brother and our
other colleagues. I switched on my radio once more and was overwhelmed
by grief when I heard that suddenly the figure of deaths was seventyfour.
Shaken we all made our way to the car to set off for home. We switched
on the radio to hear more news of the tragedy. As we were queuing waiting
to turn right onto the dual-carriageway we heard reports after five o'clock
of eightyfour casualties. We drove up the dual-carriageway until we found
a garage on the right-hand side and a residential road on the left with
a phone box near the corner. We all made phone calls home to advise of
our safety. The journey home was unreal.

                                 SECTION 4

                                  Comments

There has been much speculation in the press and on television and many
interviews conducted with people who had witnessed the disaster. I do
not wish to fuel any speculation or to support anything whichI have heard
or read about the incident. However, what follows are my over-riding
impressions of the factors which contributed to the disaster.

1.      Ticket Allocations

I find it difficult to comprehend how a club with an average attendance
of 40,000 fans receives Less ticket allocation for a major occasion, such
as a semi-final, than a club with an average crowd of round about 25,000.
To my mind, it was common sense to allocate Liverpool the larger standing
terrace to accommodate its larger number of travelling fans.

There were some Liverpool fans who had travelled to the ground without
tickets. For any big game there are always Liverpool fans who travel
without tickets. I have been approached outside Anfield, outside Goodison,
outside Wembley and elsewhere by fans seeking "Spares". I was approached
in this way by no more fans than outside other ticketed matches at which
I have attended. Similarly there were obviously ticketless fans in the




                                   - 6 -
crowd swarming outside the Lickers Lane turnstile. X assume that there
were fans without tickets who climbed over the wall or along railings above
the turnstiles to gain entrance to.the Ground. There was not however a
great number of such fans entering the Ground in this way. There was no
check on tickets prior to entering the perimeter of the Ground and, as
noted above, my ticket never even left my wallet, let alone was it
inspected by any official or policeman.

2.      Behaviour of the Fans

I have been to many big games with Liverpool, the behaviour of the crowd
was no different at this one, either outside or inside the Ground.
Certainly there were fans who had had alcohol, I had consumed alcolhol
in the period leading up to the game, but I did not see any evidence of
above-average high spirits and did not see anyone who was obviously the
worse for wear or incapable of conducting himself. I was impressed by
the police in their attempts to prevent alcohol being carried near the
Ground. Equally I did not see any evidence of any fans either confronting
this barrier or wishing to by-pass it carrying any alcohol.

The behaviour of the crowd outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles was
disordered but not disorderly and was to my mind out of reasonable policing
control. This, it is my opinion, was a result of the number of people
enclosed in that courtyard and of the lack of control by the police in
that courtyard. In the courtyard fans were shouting at the police and
pleading with them to impose some control over the movements of the crowd,
and there were genuine concerns about safety outside the turnstiles. I
can only contrast, in my own mind, the difference between the crowd control
at Hillsborough and that which I experience regularly outside Anfield.
Where there is order imposed and maintained at Anfield, there was none
on Saturday.

3.      The Police

It was a policeman who opened the gate to the side of the turnstiles which
allowed me access to the Ground. I was grateful for being out of an ugly
situation. However, there was insufficient crowd control outside the
immediate turnstile areas, and there was no police presence inside the
Ground to shepherd and marshal to the empty sections of the Ground the
numbers coming through the turnstiles and through the gates when they were
opened. In my opinion, this was a significant contributory factor in the
stream of fans making for the tunnel and enclosure ’B' and into the central
pen where the deaths occurred.

It is my impression, within the Ground, that the police were preoccupied
with the possibility of crowd trouble and "hooliganism". It is my view
that this preoccupation contributed to the police failing to respond in
a positive and speedy manner to the situation which unfolded in the middle
pen. In the early stages of the incident, when perhaps some positive steps
may have alleviated the situation, the police were actually preventing
people leaving the terrace. The gates in the fence, such as they a^®>
were not opened in time. No immediate attempts were made to help lift
supporters over the barriers. Moreover, given the appalling situation
outside the Ground, I am amazed that the kick-off was not delayed quarter
of an hour or so - the situation had been developing to my personal




                                   - 7 -
knowledge, since my arrival at the Ground at 2.40 p.m.

I was dismayed at the response of the police given the situation as it
unfolded, to preoccupy themselves with lining up policemen across the
middle of the pitch when there were so many dying and injured on the
terraces. Again it is my opinion that the police were preoccupied with
preventing hooliganism and not with the safety of the crowd.

4.      The Ground

I was struck before the incident by the presence of cast iron barriers
partitioning the terracing into three sections. I thought, even at that
stage, that supporters must be regarded more as animals than as human
beings in that the pens were similar in style to that reserved for sheep.
I have already referred above to the ticket allocation position, and it
is my opinion that the Ground Authorities should have had more regard to
the relative ticket merits of the two clubs. The safety or otherwise of
the fencing enclosing the terraces from the playing area is not to my
knowledge uncommon to other perimeter fences at other Grounds, but I
consider that it was the barriers on the terraces which caused or
contributed to the problem. Without such barriers, the crowd would have
dispersed quite naturally regardless of the entrance by which people
arrived on the terraces. Events have shown that there was no way out of
this pen on Saturday and I am surprised and amazed that this had not been
identified previously.

I was struck on Saturday by the absence of any stewards within the Ground
to marshal and direct supporters to their places on the terraces or in
the stands. Again I can only compiare with the practise at Anfield where
there are always stewards in great numbers around the turnstiles.

D e a r _____________

                        R   v Anthony George KOUNTIS and Dean KOUNTIS

       You will no doubt be aware of the Learned Judge's remarks on the conclusion
of the above case at Liverpool Crown Court on 3rd September 1986:-

                               .so far as Mr                 is concerned
                            who came to the aid of the police in awfully
                            difficult circumstances when this man was
                            laying about him, he is to be thanked and
                            awarded the sum of £50 from public funds."

       I should like to associate myself with these words and to thank you for
your co-operation and assistance in what proved to be a most violent incident.
Your physical and moral help to the police officers on that day was greatly
appreciated.

                                                   Yours sincerely,

       Sir H Livermore
       Silverman and Livermore
       11/13 Victoria Street
       LIVERPOOL 2


       Dear Sir                                                               '':X.v                                               v';-:"::.""

       1 have just listened to a statement by 11 believe' a Mr Miller
       the Chairman or Spokesman of the Sheffield Police Confederation
       on BBC Breakfast Time, at approximately 8:15, 19th April in
       which he stated that in their opinion most of the trouble was
       caused by drunken fans arriving late.

       I was at Hillsborough and would like to put my version of what;
       happened outside the ground on record.

       I drove to Sheffield with my; 17 year old Son and one Friend.
       We arrived in Sheffield at approximately 2:00 pm and parked
       in the Gateway Supermarket Car Park, about h a mile away, and
       proceeded to walk to the ground. Whilst walking to the ground
       I was quite impressed with the strong Police presence and the
       good humoured banter between the Police and Fans.   I also
       noticed that ALL the Side Streets had barriers across with
       between 3 to 5 Policemen behind each barrier. There was the
       usual FEW groups of drunken people, but on the whole a orderly
       procession heading to the ground    On arrival at the Lemming ■
       Street entrance at 2:20 pm we were confronted by a mass of
       people trying to get into the ground.   I was amazed to find
       that both seating and standing tickets were being directed
       towards the same turnstyles. There was absolute bedlam with
       people already being crushed, and amazingly hardly any Police
       in this area. I counted 5 mounted Police, 4 foot Patrol and
       1 Officer in a Land Rover, trying to direct the crowd which
       was several 1000's strong. Plus one more Officer by the
       turnstyle who did not even have a Radio.

       There was no way we would join the mayhem, so we stood back,
       along side a row of houses with quite a few other people, who
       were also too frightened to join this mass of bodies being
       pressed tighter and tighter together.

       I noticed, with some surprise that my two Brothers and Nephew
       were also standing back and looking o n . We joined them and
       they told me that they'had arrived at 2:10 pm, and they would ;
       not join the chaos for fear of their lives.

To whom it may concern




Dear Sir

I have wrote this letter in the hope that it may determine
who was at fault, and possibly help in any enquiry.

May I add that I was at Heyshel.  I never thought I would see
horrors like that again, but it has happened, and happened
in our Country, in one of our safest grounds.

I personally will never go to an away match again, and I have
followed Liverpool F.C for 35 years.

Sir Harry Livermore,
Silverman & Livermore,
24 North John Street,
Liverpool, L 2.
Merseyside.

Eear Sir,
        I must apologise for writing to you inthis way, but due to the
Liverpool Football disaster at Hillsborough I thought I must put pen to
paper.
       Watching the T.V. during this ternole disaster 1 was impressed
both by what Hr. John Ashton said at the time of the incident and at
interviews that followed, that me being an ex. Liverpool Fire Brigade
and Liverpool City Police, I must urite to him.
       This I have done and in fairness to all concerned I have sent both
you and Mr.Rex Makin a copy of what I have written to Lr. John Ashton.
       I do not know what to say over this terrible disaster, but having
served in both the Scotland toad and Westmister Itoad areas of this great city
our hearts go out to all the people of Liverpool.
       Words can never replace people, but at least you will know that
down in Somerset there is at least my Liverpool I'aitiily saying prayers for all
the people affected by this.terrible disaster.
       What makes it worse for us is that in oux opinion it-should never have
happened.
                                       Yours faithfully.____

       Sir
         I*fully support your thoughts and feelings following the Hillsborough

       It is hard for me to convey to you and all the friends and relatives of
the dead and injured from this disaster. I speak on behalf of myself, wife and
family, our deepest sympathy is with all of you.                        t •
       There is no accountability today. I am of the opinion t^at the Police
Officer concerned should be severely dealt with, infact is not his action tantamount
to criminal negligence. Over 90 persons have died and several more injured
through this one act.                                                                                        .
       I was amazed to see that the Chief Constable of Yorkshire asked for
assistance from the Chief Constable of the West Midlands to carry out an
investigation.                 ^   ^                       ^        ^                            ^                                ^   surely

f   is out of the hands of the Chief Constable of Yorkshire to set up such a major
 encuiry off his own bat. Surely such a request should be instituted and set up
 by'the Home Offioe. Further especially in this case, no Police Farce should be
 invesUgged^by^other^Follce^Force^Old                   code ^   can be punished

May I point out that we certainly did not have SCO ;:.en ...ore like 80 to
100 men. with Mounted Police back-up. We controlled the crowds-no problems.
     Everytime poor Liverpool gets it, I am sure even the Government
treat-Liverpool as we used to treat our coikonies, take all,give nothing.
     We where even let down in the police strike of 1919. Very few backed
Liverpool up, the result, the strike collapsed.
     I am of the opinion that we should always bring those responsible
for disasters to trial, no, what happens, enquiry set up, may take years,
findings published, no action. In this case possibly the Police Officer
may go out on a good pension, this is wrong he has caused a disaster.
     The whole disaster through his action has killed over 90 people
and injured and caused distress to a lot of people.
     There hAs' got to be accountability. I am of the opinion that legal
action should be taken against the Police Authority under the terms of
•Vicarious Liability* This is an incident that should never have happened.
     I am still pursuing the Manchester Aircraft disaster because again
I am of the opinion that this was a 100% survivable incident and because
of this it has taken the enquiry panel over 2 years to publish their

     I^’
       nave asked Mr.John Prescott M*P. Shadow Transport Minister to
examine the report in detail.
     My opinions
          1. Aircraft on the runway
          2 . Pilot aborts the take off cue to engine fire,
          3. Turns off the runway
          5. Finishes up not very far from the Airport jure Station.
          6. All major airport crash tenders turn out and go to the
              fire on the engine at the front.
          7. No major Foam Producing Fire Tenders go to the rear.
     Result. Fire was driven towards the rear of the aircraft. £ad

     S e ^ r S c u ^ o f aircraft occupants takes precedence over all other
     S e r f u S S J a until it is established that there 1S no further

     Cabin^terapratures may become unsarvivable in seconds or minutes,
     insulate th e fu se la g e and keep exit routes clear. Two very simple
     procedures. Oneof the findings of the enquiry was to remove seats
     to gain access to exit doors. This is of no use if people cxe
     going to land in a sea of flame. Two very golden rules in ^ r a f t
     f i r e fighting on airports. Insulate the Fuselage with foam (To
     p r o t e c t f r o m radiated heat) and cover escape routes. When everybody

     is out then tackle the fire. Major extinguishing media is very
     limited on airports. I f you tackle the fire first, you will run
     out Of media a£d not put the fire out. Then you have Prooxems.
                  I hope you find this letter interesting ana we have got _
     to h a v e accountability and finally the P o l i c e should not investigate
     themselves in such a serious matter „ ^ s U v e r p ool mcldent.

      F S. On the question of lolice Coinrcunications ^ti£dio) we did not
           have radio in my day, but the sergents made sure there was
           always contact from within the ground to those on the outside.
           At half-time the Police Officers on the outside duty went
           inside the ground and those on the inside caze outside. In
           this way you got to know tne ground inside as well as outsiae.

                     (Aged 24 years) of
Liverpool    will say:-



On the 8th May I will be leaving this country to go to Australia on a touring

visa for twelve months.



On Saturday, 15th April my father and      I   went to the football match at

Sheffield.      We got to Sheffield at about 1.30 p.m. and went into a public

house about five minutes walk from the ground for a drink.            The public

house was fairly full but there was no drunkenness everybody was in very

high spirits.      We left the public house about 2.25 p.m.          The public house

was emptying out then.      We walked towards the ground.        I    saw no hooliganism

or vandalism.       People were all happy and in good spirits.            Families with

children walked along together.



When we got to Leppings Lane end where I understood we had to go through

 the doors to get to    the North Stand where our seals were it was already

 crowded in the area and people were already bunched up.         There were no

 orderly queues as I would have expected to see and I have been to a great

 number of football matches.      I have never seen anything like the bunching

 up that I saw at the Leppings Lane       end when I arrived for the match.                 I

 did not like the look of things and I said to my dad "Let's go down to the

 other end of the North Stand and see if we can get in there".               The police

 let us through and we made our way to the other end of the North Stand.

 There were 200/300 people just filtering into the stand.             The steward would

 not let us in so we had to make our way back to the Leppings Lane end.                         I

 did explain to the steward that it was very busy at the Leppings Lane end

 but he would not let us in.      We got back to the Leppings Lane end and it was

 worse than when we had first been there.          People were shouting "Come on let

 us in we have paid     £14 for a stand ticket".       There were two policemen on

  horseback and they were appreciably shaken.          We got through the crowd and
a gate was opened leading to the North Stand.       It was an Exit gate and

we got through that.     We never went through a turnstile.     The gate I am

referring to was not the blue gate over which there has been so much

discussion.     As far as I saw all the exit    gates were opened to allow the

people to get in not simply the blue gate in respect of which there has been

so much controversy.       There was nobody to inspect the tickets.        Therewas

a surge into the North Stand area.     There was a line of policemen just

inside the gate through which I had come and I was pushed against one of the

policemen.      I could not help myself it was quite accidental.    Having

jostled into him quite accidentally I moved away but he grabbed      me on my

right shoulder, turned me round and grabbed holdof the top of my shirt

at the front and pushed me against the wall so Iwas on my toes       with my

head raised.     He said to me "It's people like you that's the cause of this

pushing and trouble that is going on           I said "It is not my fault I could

not help it".      He said "Well don't do it again", (whatever that meant) and

let me go into the crowd of people that were coming into the stand.          When we

went up the gangway there was no control whatsoever, nobody checked our

tickets and we just walked into our seats.        I saw what happened both immediately

before the match started, after the match had started and after the match but

I can only speak in general terms and that has already been well reported.



I was mainly concerned with what the position was in trying to get^nto the

ground at 35 minutes before the kick-off.                              j


I have got my whole ticket at home and will bring it in.

TUESDAY 18TH APRIL 1989




I am neither a drunken lout nor a "beast" but a 40 year old married
man with 2 children - a Driving Instructor - and an ardent Liverpool
Supporter.

Since the Hillsborough Disaster - which I attended - I did not feel I
could really contribute in the way of evidence as enough people appeared
to be doing that already. However/ it is now 3 days past the tragic
events and I feel an increasing sense of outrage at the fact that the
blame is slowly now being turned around and placed at the door of the
Liverpool Supporters. I have just heard a conservative MP on TV claiming
that Police officers have told him they encountered drunken fans an
were attacked and urinated on whilst attempting to save lives - which I
find totally unbelievable.

For the record the following are my own personal observations:-

I went to the match together with my brother-in-law and 2 friends by car.
We all had tickets. We left Liverpool at approximately 11 am. and
encountered hold ups on the motorway and passed a Police check on leaving
the Ml where it appeared mainly coaches were being checked. We arrived
in Sheffield at approximately 1.30. None of us wanted to go for a drink
but even so we did not even see a pub which was open. We parked in a
side road off Halifax Road and walked towards the ground. We then split
up with my brother-in-law going to the Leppings Lane Stand and myself
making my way to the North Stand. We saw the following:-

POLICE PRESENCE -IN THE AREA AROUND THE GROUND

I remarked to my brother-in-law that there were Police more or less on
every street c o m e r and groups of Police standing at various points as
we walked.

 IMMEDIATELY-OUTSIDE THE GROUND

 Outside the ground we only noticed 2 policemen on foot. This was at
 approximately 2 pm. By this time the queue for getting into the
 ground was very heavy. The first Policeman I met outside the ground, I
 asked if I was in the right place and showed him my ticket. He seemed to
 be more interested in checking whether it was a forged ticket (examining
 front and back) and I don't think he even noticed which part of the ground
 it was for. He then pointed to a direction and told me that's where I
 should go. My ticket was for North STand, Gateway D. The queue for the
 turnstiles at this time was disorderly. It took a good 10 15 minutes to
 qet into the ground because of the amount of people waiting to enter.
 When I actually arrived at the turnstile itself I found there was a Policeman
 carrying out individual body searches on nearly every supporter before each
 one went through the turnstile.




                                                 cont./.

INSIDE THE GROUND

Once on the other side of the turnstile I encountered 1 Policeman before
reaching my seat.

I first realised something was wrong when I noticed a supporter actually
running into Bruce Grobelas's goal/ this would have been soon after
kick-off. After that everyone seemed to spill onto the pitch. The few
Police that were on view ran to the goalmouth and then when the Police
appeared to realise something really was wrong extra Police came into the
ground NOT AS I HAD FIRST THOUGHT to help with the situation behind the
goal but a line of Policemen stood along the front of the North Stand. By
this time things behind the goal looked to be out of control. Supporters
in the stand were confused as to what was happening behind the goal or
how serious the problem was UNTIL stretchers were going past with people
lying on them with their heads covered. Even then no-one could comprehend
that any of these people were dead. People around even thought that they
were badly injured and had asked to be covered up. Until a few of the
people around realised that people were dead when they were stretchered
past with their heads covered and their arms hanging limply from the
stretchers.

While supporters - who were obviously hurt themselves - were giving aid to
other supporters worse off than them. The Police who were still lined
up in front of the North Stand stood and watched. Whether these Policemen
were under orders to stay in this position I don't know. I JUST FOUND
IT TOTALLY INHUMAN TO THINK THAT THEY COULD NOT OFFER ANY ASSISTANCE. If
it wasn't for the assistance of the so-called drunken Liverpool louts or
"beasts" the situation could have been much worse.

Hopefully, I will never be in that situation myself - but if I ever am
I hope that I am surrounded by these same people. It is so annoying to
hear Chiefs of Police/ M.P.'s and Heads of UAFA who can stand on their
soap boxes and be seen and listened to by millions of people when the true
supporters can never put their case. I only hope that our own MP's and
lawyers can put our case forward and defend usI

19 April 1989


Dear Sir
I am writing to you regarding the events on Saturday 15 April,
at the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest FA Cup Semi-Final, at
Hillsborough, which resulted in 95 deaths.

I attended the match and was involved in some crushing outside
the ground, eventually taking up my seat in the north stand just
prior to kick-off.   I was very concerned about aspects of the
organisation of this match, primarily crowd control. Hopefully,
a full independent enquiry will find the reasons for thls
tragedy, but I am concerned that the views of spectators will not
be taken into account due to the large number involved and the
fact that they are individuals and not from any 1b o d y 1, hence my
letter to you.
To blame the fans is totally wrong and I feel that this could
happen unless all points of view are aired. I would stress tnat
I am not anti-police, but on this day they were the body
responsible for crowd control and safety.    They were totally
unprepared and their activities were not co-ordinated.     They
failed in their duty and got it wrong on the day.

The problems arose because a large number of people with tickets
tried to gain admittance at the same time.   Impulsive decisions
were made and could have been avoided as the situation was
clearly predictable
        a.   the traffic situation on the motorways was well
             known
        b.   close circuit TV would show the position both in
             and outside the ground

        c.   the computer controlled turnstiles showed the
             number in the ground and the number still to take
             their places

        d.   the problem was evident by merely looking at the
             Leppings Lane end and was clear to all present.




                                    1
With the known shortage of tickets, the whole situation should
  ve been anticipated and panic avoided.  At no time did X see
any  disorderly  conduct,  everybody was good humoured     and
apparently in possession of tickets.

Whys

       a.    Why was there no filtering towards the turnstiles
             ~ as there was last year - to prevent the crowd
             build up?

       b.    why was the kick off not delayed as has been done
             several times this season, including the match
             involving only 10,000 spectators at Tranmere.

       c.   Why having opened the gate were arrangements not
            made to stream fans to the sides and to evacuate
            those already packed in.

       d.   Why were no     announcements   made,   no   use   of
            megaphones.

I have heard it said that an unruly mob was responsible.  This
was not the case, the sheer weight of numbers, created by poor
organisation, created it.

I understand that a decision was made to open the gate to
prevent loss of^life outside the ground.   I feel that this was
a real possibility.      However,  the decision was made in
isolation, without^ regard to the serious problem which was
already clearly evident inside.    The problems could not have
been made clear to the police inside the ground by their
superiors as they were deployed in the wrong places and ill-
informed.   This was clearly illustrated by large numbers of
police with dogs guarding the stands (for the wrong type of
situation) when they should have been elsewhere.

There were plenty of police about (I understand in the region of
800) but in the wrong places at the wrong time. The lower ranks
clearly thought violence was taking place, their superiors would
have known that this was not the case, but failed to instruct
them properly.  One young constable, frightened, criticised his
superiors in front of us.

There has been a great deal of media attention and whilst I can
be influenced by various debates or my own emotions, I can
clearly recollect three impressions on that day:-

       1.   On reaching the ground there was no filtering -
            merely all persons allowed to make their own way.

       2.   On entering the ground, one section was clearly
            overcrowded and two other areas fairly empty.
     3.   A lack of medical facilities and only two
          ambulances were seen in almost one hour of panic.
          Volunteers did nearly all the work.

The police seemed very complacent and the lower ranks harassed,
unco-ordinated and lacking leadership.     There was a complete
absence of planning and direction and I am convinced that this
could have been avoided had a predictable situation been tackled
properly.   The   Liverpool police have dealt with large crowds
over many years without incident.

I feel that the planning of such events should take into account
the views of supporters, including various associations which
now represent them.   The recommendations of Liverpool FC were
rejected for this match.

I know a lot of people share my views who attended the match.
Should you feel   that I can be of any further assistance, please
do not hesitate to contact me.

I would like to record my admiration for the fans who assisted
the casualties and the attitude of Liverpool FC over the last
few days.

Yours faithfully




P.S. Since starting this letter, I have heard comments emanating
     from the Police Federation alleging that drunken fans
     started this incident.   THIS IS UNTRUE.

     There was no evidence of this, the cause was their
     inability to, on a gradual basis, to stream arriving
     supporters, as they had done successfully the previous
     year.  For some reason, they failed to do so and this must
     be highlighted.  I am deeply concerned that one isolated,
     inaccurate statement from a recognised body outweighs the
     more accurate reports from so many witnesses.

     Football supporters, unfortunately, are perceived by those
     who do not attend matches as those few seen in newsclips.
     The fans last Saturday came from all walks of life.    For
     example, our party of 4 were 30/40 years of age, married
     with children. We noticed no less than Billy Liddel having
     difficulty - hardly a hooligan!

                                              Kirkby


Dear Sir,

I am writing this letter as I feel I owe it to all those fans
who died or who were injured in such tragic circumstances at
Sheffield Wednesday's ground on April 15th.

Firstly I would like to relate to you my experiences at the same
ground last year in the semi-final between Liverpool an^,
Nottingham Forest.   My 11 year old son, his friend and his
father and myself obtained tickets for the Leppings Lane part or
the ground.  To get into this part of the ground, after passing
through the turnstiles, we had to pass through a narrow tunne
beneath the West Gate stand.   There were many, many fans heading
for this tunnel and it became very congested many yards before
entering the tunnel.   There were no police officers or stewards
to control and marshal the fans through this tunnel and once in
the tunnel the congestion obviously greatly increased.

Now although the tunnel is relatively short it took some time to
actually get through it.   Inside the tunnel there was jostling
and pushing and many people were stumbling.   My s o n during this
time was being severely crushed and had difficulty in
breathing.  I'm 6ft 2" and weigh 16 stone and had extreme
difficulty in pushing people away from him but fortunate y I
managed to hold on to him.

Eventually we moved out of the tunnel but if anything the
situation became worse and the pressure of the crowd behind
became worse, causing many fans to stumble and fall down the
steps only to disappear under the crowd.  Even once through
the tunnel it was impossible to move sideways as the
momentum of the crowd continued to push us forward.  We were
forced to duck under metal barriers or suffer even more
crushing.  Finally we were forced right up against the
barriers which prevent the fans from getting on to the
pitch.  During the match we had to constantly bear the
crushing force of the crowd swaying forward from behind.   I
would not have been so bad if we had been able to move
sideways, away from this central part, but it was so packed,
and the constant pushing, jostling and surging of the fans
made this prospect appear even more dangerous.
During the game some fans actually collapsed or fainted and
were passed over peoples heads towards the front of this
section of the ground.  We were by the gate in the barrier
fence just behind the goal and witnessed the following:—


   Some fans tried to open this gate but it had been
   padlocked. Some fans attracted the attention of a
   policeman or steward, I can't remember which, but he
   appeared to be totally unaware of the situation.  As a
   result these fans became extremely agitated and tried to
   force the gate open but eventually an official obtained a
   key, the padlock was opened together with the gate, and
   the distressed fans passed to safety.

   During the whole of this game we were very concerned for
   the safety of our youngsters but the police were only
   allowing injured fans through the gate.  After the match
   finished we all vowed never to enter the Leppings Lane
   end ever again.

As far as I am concerned, when there is a large crowd
entering this part of the ground, it will always be a death
trap.  It must be on very rare occasions when Sheffield
Wednesday have enough visiting supporters to this part of
the ground sufficiently to fill it completely and I believe
they are not aware of how dangerous it can be.  The whole
layout for entry into the Leppings Lane end of the ground
and the layout inside the ground is a major hazard when
there are lots of fans entering the ground.

Under the circumstances I have described to you and the
additional events which occured at this semi-final - large
crowds, gates being opened to allow more fans in, lack of
police and stewards to act as marshals who would guide and
control the passage of fans into the ground, apparent lack
of police communications, then it is not surprising that
today, innocent people were injured and even more
tragically, lost their lives.

At this semi-final we had tickets for the West Gate stand
which is built up over the Leppings Lane part of the ground
and it was from here that we were to witness the harrowing
and heartbreaking chain of tragic events.
                           - 3 -




The match had been started for about 5 minutes when we saw a
slowly growing number of fans trying to ascend the barrier
which is supposed to keep them off the pitch.  At first we
thought that this was due to hooliganism and violence going
on unseen beneath us or even just a pitch invasion bu as
the events unfolded, we soon realized that many fans had
been seriously injured.
Even so the police took a long time to open the gates in the
fence - were they reluctant to do so or were the gates
padlocked once again.  Even when the gates had eventually
been opened the police were pushing fans, who had climbed
over, back through this gate into the ground where people
were still being crushed to death.  The police on the pitc
seemed to be the last people in the ground to realise a
major tragedy had happened and confusion amongst them
increased.  Some police were helping fans to climb over the
fence while just a few yards away other officers were
preventing fans getting over the fence by pushing them back.

Now everyone in the ground were dismayed and unable to
believe what was going on before their very eyes.  People
lay all over the pitch, some appeared to be in agony, some
had collapsed once they got onto the pitch, still yet others
were carried, apparently unconscious to us, and laid down on
the pitch.  St. John's Ambulance men, nurses and even fans,
were giving heart massage, mouth to mouth resuscitation and
all sorts of other first aid.  Some policemen were also
trying to help but the vast majority were either spread
along the half way line or huddled in groups, apparently
bewildered and lacking any directives, as to what to do,
from their superiors.

During this time we did see one police officer spat at by a
Liverpool supporter close to the gate behind the goal but
can imagine him being incensed because the police were
pushing fans back into the gate.

I also saw two scuffles between fans on the pitch itself but
it was against police officers who were just standing round,
seeming unwilling to help.  I can understand the frustration
of these fans towards these particular policemen.

We saw angry Liverpool fans run up towards the Nottingham
Forest fans, the latter had been jeering and booing, the
former had been trying to save lives.  We saw angry
Liverpool fans scuffle with a cameraman, he had been taking
pictures of the injured and dying, while they had been doing
their best to save them.
                            -   4 -




Even more astonishing events were to take place.  It
appeared that when the ambulances eventually arrived they
had difficulty in getting to the dying and injured.  Then
the majority of fans who were on the pitch, who had not been
seriously injured, but obviously suffering from shock, began
to rip down hoardings and use them as stretchers to ferry
the injured, and unknown to us, many dead.  The fans carried
them from one end of the pitch to the other in a seemingly
endless relay.  Again stewards and other people helped but
again so few policemen got involved as they still stood in
groups or in a line across the pitch.

Later, having learned that a gate had been opened,by the
police, to let fans in, it became obvious that this must
have been a major contribution to the tragic disaster that
occured.  These fans headed for the same tunnel I described
earlier and what was to happen is to me inevitable.   I feel
great sympathy for the policeman who gave the directive for
the gate to be opened, in his opinion, lives were at risk
outside the ground and he took the action he considered the
best under the circumstances known to him.

The factors which have contributed to   what happened as far
as I am concerned are


1)   Police stopping coaches well before the ground so that
     fans had a 20 minute to 30 minute walk to the ground.
     This could be a likely cause of the late arrival of
     fans and the consequent build up outside the ground
     just before kick off.

     We consider ourselves extremely lucky as our coach
     driver dropped us off as near to the ground as possible
     even though police wanted him to turn round and drop us
     off a lot further away from the ground, despite the
     fact this would have resulted in us arriving even later
     at the ground.  We had a 10 minute walk to the ground
     and arrived at Hillsborough at 2.35 p.m.  If we had
     been dropped off where the police-wanted them we would
     have been arriving in the ground at the same time as
     those unfortunate supporters who were to be involved in
     those tragic circumstances.


2)   Police not taking immediate control of the fans and
     getting them to line up in an orderly manner.   There
     appeared to be more police on duty miles away from the
     ground than there were directly outside it.   This
     shortage of policeman immediately outside the ground
     must surely have resulted in total lack of crowd
     control.
                            -   5   -




3)   The entrance to the Leppings Lane end and this part of
     the ground itself is a death trap when large numbers of
     fans are trying to gain entrance.


4)   The ultimate responsibility of what happened must lie
     with F.A. Authorities.  For the second year running
     they gave Liverpool fans the smaller part of the
     ground, even though they must have an average of 15,000
     to 20,000 more fans attending their home games.  This
     was despite the fact that Liverpool F.C. appealed to
     the F.A. to either give Liverpool fans the other end of
     the ground and so more tickets or choose an alternative
     ground which would be able to accommodate their fans.
     The F.A. officials with characteristic lack of interest
     in the problems of the fans, coldly dismissed
     Liverpools claims.

     The people who deserve commending are the Liverpool
     supporters who so bravely helped their injured
     colleagues who lay dying and injured on the Pitch.   The
     ambulance men, nurses, stewards and firemen who also
     put in tremendous effort.  The Nottingham Forest fans
     for their behaviour after they became aware of the
     extent of the tragedy unfolding before them.   And last
     but not least those few policemen who did try their
     best and the people of Sheffield for showing such
     generosity and help to those fans in need of it.

     My condolences and heartfelt sympathy goes out to those
     families who have lost their loved ones in such tragic
     circumstances caused by the negligence, incompetence
     and ignorance of the F.A. and other officials.

     From a very sad but very angry Liverpool supporter, who
     stood there and watched, helpless to do anything.  I'm
     not a fanatical or completely biased supporter, what I
     witnessed on both occasions is the truth.


     Yours sincerely,
17th April 1989




At approximately 1.10 p.m. today I took a telephone call from a gentleman
who   introduced himself as a 'retired Liverpool city    police      officer.


He said he wanted to offer some comments about    what   hehad seen on television

on Saturday afternoon.


After he had been talking for a few moments I began to record the     call
but   before I had done this the caller made comments suchas:-


1.     He was applauded at the ineptitude of the police.


2.    The conduct of the police was deplorable.


3.    I have never seen such inefficiency (by police).


4.     I think the police are almost entirely to blame forthis disaster.


5.    The senior police officer at the gate is most definitely to blame for

      what happened.


A transcript of the remaining comments is attached.
    Having so many policemen, they had about 800 of them deploy Liverpool managed
    the very biggest matches with half that, 400.      Even Manchester United they
    don't have at the very most any more than 500 even at the most important matches
    now they had far more policemen but they were not in evidence.      They were not
    properly utilized, they wereJfproperly deployed.     There should have been a
    large number deployed to organize the entry through the turn styles in the
    first place to stop that huge build up which was allegely the reason     why the
    Senior Police Officer ordered the gates to be opened he apparently ordered

t   them to be opened against the will of an official of the club.
    with him not to the open the gates.
                                                                       He pleaded
                                          I saw a comment about this in the paper
    and there was a young man interviewed on television who had heard that said
    the official pleaded with a senior police officer the police officer said
    we are having the gate open but as you quite rightly say they should have
    been 20 or 30 policemen at least inside to direct them to the wings where
    there was apparently quite alot of room.     Anyway we can all be wise after
    the event but I do feel that the police organisation of the whole thing was
    absolutely deplorable.


    I then asked the caller if he was speaking from experience, had he in his
    serving career been engaged in the marshalling of crowds at football matches.
    In response he said ...
c
    I was on football matches, yes.   And I had alot to do with the training of
    police officers this is going back many years, I have long been retired.


    I understand that police offiers who were off duty and at the match, at least
    one has written to Sir Harry I understand.
   do not like to denigrate police officers, I am an ex police officer myself
but on this occasion with such disastrous results I think amounting even to
criminal negligence if this had happened in these circumstances on the
continent or in other countries the senior police officers chargedwould be
facing very very serious charges.


I hope that with the enquiry by the other police force, West Midland Police
Force, there is going to be no white washing.


(By me ... are you afraid there might be a white wash.)


I am afraid there might be I am sorry to say.


Even when it got really bad and all those police officers where about they were
standing about like zombies.     Even the carrying away of people, I am sure
there were many dead already being carried away on these makeshift strechers
I never saw     a single policeman with his coat and his hat off getting stuck
into the job.


I was cH-mrnigigiiiri, that is the only word I can use for it.

     to the Police outside ?
Lastly of course there is why were Liverpool allocated less tickets
than Nottingham Forest.    tiie have twice as many regular supporters as
NQttingham Forest and were given 4,000 or whatever less tickets than
them.    In fact people who got into the ground when the gate was
opened by the Police had tickets which they had bought from Nottingham
Forest fans.    The Police say it was easier to control us and the
traffic* if we were given the Lickers Lane End.      This has been proved
to be totally untrue as there was no crowd control outside and most of
the people arrived late because of traffic problems, not to mention
Police holding up coachas and checking for alcohol, and being made
to walk files from their coaches to the ground.     This has happened
many times to us, most recently at Coventry and prior to that at
Aston Villa when Liverpool played Arsenal in the Littlewoods Cup.
So there is no way giving us fewer tickets can be justified.

We will never forget the scenes we saw and people being dragged out
of the paddock below us and thrown on to the pitch and left to die.
People trying to get out through totally inadequate gates and being
pushed back by the Police at first.   People being carried away on
hoarding by the Fans not ambulance men, policemen or stewards.
Why weren't the stretchers there where were they ? Where were the
ambulances ? Why weren't wire cutters used in the fence more quickly ?
Why didn't the Police react quicker to this terrible situation ?
Why were there no announcements over the loudspeaker made to inform
everyone who didn’t know of the problem ?

WHY was this terrible thing allowed to happen ?

We will never be able to forget it anyone who was there and especially
those who have lost loved ones and friends until we get some answers
to the above questions.

We are enclosing an article which we think answers those questions
but we hope and pray that some one can show us some other reason
to keep us sane.

Dear Sir




I

The events of Saturday April 15 and consequent inflammatory statements
have forced me to write to you in the hope it will aid your work in
bringing the culpable parties to book.

My experiences underline how badly organised the whole event was,

I was misdirected by three Policemen;   forced to crush rather than queue
for forty minutes; (to move just twenty yards) and refused assistance by
Policemen when attempting 'to ease the crush around two women who were
being squashed.

I feel I am a level headed person who is paid to work under pressure every
day without losing control.

The events of Saturday lead me to get very angry and frustrated, £Uch was
the extent of stupidity shown by S.Yorks Police.  Bearing in mind the
area I entered the ground from was relatively quiet "God knows" what the
standing area was like; a detailed account follows.




Yours sincerely




Registered at London No. 997411. Registered Office—East Lancashire Road, Liverpool L10 5H8   Holding Com pany—The General Electric Com pany, p ic
I am a resident of Barnsley and therefore did not approach Sheffield by
Police prescribed routes.  I was driven to a point within two miles of
the ground and walked in.

I reached the ground at a point adjacent to the South Stand and asked
directions of a Policeman as to the quickest route to entrance 'A* of
the North Stand.  My ticket was for Block 1R * Row 40 Seat No.163.

The Policeman directed me toward the Spion Kop end and said I should
walk past the Kop and turn along the side of the ground and walk up
to entrance 'A*.

On reaching the corner of the Spion Kop I asked another Policeman just
to verify I was on the correct route and he told me I could not go any
further and must re-trace my steps all the way back around the ground.
This I did asking again for directions as I neared L .ppings Lane.  This
Policeman informed me he was from Doncaster and was not familiar with
the ground.

I eventually joined the queue at entrance   *A' at 2.15 p.m having wasted
20-30 minutes being misdirected.

At 2.15 p.m I was twenty yards from the turnstile, there was only a mass
of people and no Police ensuring queues were formed. The only Police in
evidence were those stood against the wall next to the turnstiles; one
Constable to four gates.

Initially the crowd though not organised was not crushed and was in good
humour.  The speed of entry was pitifully slow.   At 2.35 p.m - 2.40 p.m
the crush began to increase and two females close to me began to become
frightened.    At this point people asked the Police to break the crowd
and help the females.  Two Constables did not move.

The people in the crowd now are beginning to get frustrated by the lack
of Police supervision and the slow progress.

At 2.45 p.m the crush became so bad a group of us had to link arms and
make a circle around the females who were beginning to cry with the weight
of the crush.

People were now very angry and demanding, in very direct terms, action
from the Police.  The Policeman at the gate I entered wanted to help but
just did not know what to do, he looked helpless.

I entered the ground, crushed and breathless at 2.50 p.m-2.55 p.m, just
as the roar, to indicate the teams had "come out", went up.  As I moved
along the passage toward my seat I saw Stewards and Police by the exit
gates begin to draw the bolts.

Once at my seat, I spoke to the people around me who all complained
about the poor organisation of queuing.  It is also worth noting that
others had also been misdirected.
Those arriving after me, entered via exit doors   and had their tickets
still intact.  It is worth pointing out that at   £14 per ticket these
were not cheap seats and therefore attracted an   older more mature
cross-section of fans. Bearing this in mind one   would expect a level
headed response to any situation.

To a man those people sat around me were very angry at the poor
organisation, and especially the ineptitude and apathetic attitude
of the Police.  It was the most badly organised sporting event I
have ever visited in twentyfive years following sport.

I hope this information offers some help to you, please be aware I
am prepared to stand-up and be cross examined on this statement if
required.

20th April 1989

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

Dear Sir

I as one of the victims of the terrible series of events which happened on
Saturday afternoon on the 15th April 1989 at the Hillsborough Footbglj.
Ground I feel compeled to write down my account of the same, so that they
can be brought to light at the ensuiriQ'i enquiries.

I arrived with my two workmates at the Leppings Lane end of the ground at
about 2.30 pm. There was a large crowd outside the closed turnstiles but
no sort of queue had been formed by the mounted police.

In my past experience of going to     football grounds the police always make
us form a queue.  I was amazed at     the lack of order in any shape or form
in this instance.

As I got nearer the closed turnstile it became apparent that the crowd was
not moving quickly enough thereby causing a terrible crush.   The metal
railing gates through which I had already passed, were closed behind me by
the police. As far as I could see this was in order to clear the immediate
area in front of the turnstiles.   This area was by now very crowded so my
friends and I moved to one side along with a number of other people to ry
to allow the crowd to clear somewhat.

A couple of minutes later at approx 2.50 pm the main double gates alongside
the turnstiles were opened by the police.

 My friend and I (by this time were already seperated from our other friend)
 were allowed through these gates along with hundreds of other supporters
 without being asked to show our tickets.

 We asked police and stewards which way to go and, were d i r e c t e d down the
 tunnel. When we got to the end of the tunnel we could see the immediate
 area behind the goal was already crowded.

 We had been informed by friends in work,both Liverpool and Everton fans who
 had visited the ground before that this area was dangerous so try to get to
 the sides. We tried to move over to the sides but this was impossible as
 we were forced forward by the sheer number of people behind us.  I assume
 this must have been because the metal railing gates outside had been
 reopened.

 We were forced forward under extreme pressure until we reached a P°i^t of
 about 15 feet from the front fencing. Within seconds of reaching this point
 a lot of people were already shouting to the police on the touchline behind
 the goal to do something that people were being crushed.  This, in a matter
 of seconds, turned to them screaming and pleading with the police telling
  them that people were dying.
The answer from the police was to push back.      This answer surely proved they
could understand what was being said.

Some people at the front were by now starting to climb over the fence, on y
to be confronted by the police telling them to get back.  I was by this time
terrified for my life.  The kick-off must have been only seconds away an
nothing was being done about getting us out.  It was then I noticed that t
lad next to me was limp and totally motionless I could only assume
passed out or was dead.

Then the match kicked off this was evident as I could hea^
That was my worst moment I thought I would die because I knew that nobody
had realised what was happening and it would be sometime b e J ° ™
would start to happen to relieve the unbearable pressure.    I then stopped
shouting for help to conserve my energy so as I could breath easier.

Even when the game was stopped and people were starting to get out unto
the pitch I was still terrified.

It was about 3.20 pm before enough people were c l e a r e d allowing me t0^ ^
back sliqhtly. I then saw four people who were definately dead,
I helped to be passed out over the heads of the people in front of me. I
then moved to the side of the terracing climbed over the side fence along
with several other people and went down the steps, out of the small gate
 and on to the pitch.

 As I came to the   gate a policewoman told me to sit down       and asked me if I
 !as o T ? I said   yes, just help them and pointed to the       terrace behand the
 goal.

 After a few minutes I     stood up then looked around for my friends.    Sometime
 later I did find   them and was very relieved.

 Even at this time actually seeing people dead we had no idea that the
 eventual loss of life would be so great.

 As vou can appreciate I have suffered a terrible ordeal along with thousands
 of other Liverpool supporters so I am naturally B P P ^ l e d to hear    °f
 police saying large numbers of fans were drunk, and hundreds di
 tickets.

  Tf this is so whv weren't any drunks arrested, and where did they all _
  disappear to afterwards. Also how can they possible estimate that hundreds
  of fans did not have tickets when thousands of them d *d n ’t even ave e *ave
  tickets checked.  Some of my friends who were in the North stand di
  their tickets checked.

  This brings me to my first point, would it not be possible for all the Pe°P
  who have unused tickets no matter what part of the ground they were for,
  be able to present them at the inquiry to the Lord Justice Taylor.

  Also the Football Association in my opinion                          to justice
  for the unfair way they a l l o c a t e d tickets. I would like the following th
  questions to be asked at the inquiry.

  Who qave the order to open the gates? Remembering if those gates had been
  forced open by fa n s, which was at first suggested, there would by now be a
  nationwide hunt for the persons responsible.

   Also how can police officers who must surely do ^    h    a    v    f    ^
   ignore desperate appeals for help from the crowd,  purely they must have
   known they were genuine, and if theydidn’t realise this why can t they be
   honest and say so.
                                                    -3 -




     Finally in these times where every fan is treated as a hooligan I would like
     to know who was monitoring the close circuit T.V.

     PLEASE D O N 'T LET T H IS HAPPEN A G A IN .



     Yours faithfully




     P.S. I would be willing to appear at the inquiry.

Sir H. Livermore,
Messrs. Silverman & Livermore,
11/13 Victoria Street,
Liverpool.2


Dear Sir,

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER- 15 APRIL 1989

I have been reading the Liverpool Echo printed on THURSDAY 20 APRIL 1989
and note that you are compiling a dossier with regards to the tragic events
which occurred at Hillsborough Stadiun on Saturday 15 April 1989.

You appear to have obtained much of the information as I recall it, however
there is one incident that I have not yet seen or heard mentioned in the media.

I was, thankfully, in the North Stand when the disaster happened.^ At approx­
imately 3.20 pm. some 30-40 Police Officers marched into the Stadium along the
track adjacent to the North Stand. They were applauded by the crowd in the
Stand in the belief that the officers would make their way to the Leppings Lane
end of the ground to assist in the relief work. This assumption was incorrect.
They marched to about three-quarters of the length of the Stand, halted, and
faced the fans in the North Stand. They formed a line along the track, equally
spaced, from about a quarter of the way along the Stand to about three quarters
of the way along the Stand. They stood there for approximately 25 MINUTES DOING
NOTHING BUT LOOKING INTO THE NORTH STAND, WHILST MANY OF THE LIVERPOOL SUPPORTERS
WERE INVOLVED IN HELPING THE DISTRESSED AND SHOCKED SURVIVORS, AND CARRYING THE
STRETCHERS FOR THE INJURED AND DYING.

I would like your dossier to record these FACTS and also for your to obtain
answers to the following questions:-
1)            Who gave the Police Officers the orders to stand in front of the North
              Stand?
2)            What was the apparent purpose for them being there, as their contribution
              to the rescue operation was NIL.

Although it should not make any difference, being a partner in a firm of Account­
ants may give further credibility to the above statement. If you wish to discuss
the point raised in this letter, or any other issue that I may have^ observed,
please do not hesitate to contact me at the above address or on either of the following
telephone numbers:-

                                -   DAYTIME
              _____________ -   EVENING.

I wish you well in your endeavours to have the truth of this tragic event
fully disclosed.


Your§ faithfully,
                                                                                                           D-\ ■ fi^>rvSL %°v>

          Diary of Events and Happenings of the 15th April     1989

                        re the Hillsborough Disaster


Our day started at 10.15 in the morning when we boarded a privately run
coach, which left Townsend Lane Liverpool for Sheffield.
The traffic was fairly busy and we arrived eventually in Sheffield at
 1.15pm, much of the journey had been on the A616 road, which had been
heavily congested. On the road into Sheffield, and some 7 to 8 miles from
Sheffield, the coach was stopped and searched by six to eight policeman
Jooking for cans of alcohol. On our coach they found seven cans, which
P h f 5' rightly confiscated. After taking all details and saying there would
not >e a prosecution this time, they allowed the coach to proceed.

The coach driver drove into Sheffield and passed the ground, which at that
time was starting to build up with people. We stopped for a
pre-arranged lunch at a public house on the Huddesfield road at a place
called Deepcar, some four miles from the ground. We left there at exactly
2pm to go back to the ground. When we arrived close to the ground, it was
just 2.25pm. I looked at my watch when we were getting off the coach, at
the roundabout at the top of Leppings Lane.

Walking down Leppings Lane I, personnally, was asked at least a dozen times
if I had any spare tickets, this compares with not being asked at all last
year. The reason for this, is that, last year people without tickets were
turned back from a barrier at least 600 yards from the ground. This year
no policeman asked any of us to show our tickets, so consequently there
were more people mingling around the outside of the ground, close to the
turnstile, who did not have tickets.

Wher' we arrived at the fated Leppings Lane entrance, my brother-in-law,
hiSv.^welve year old son and myself queued at our entrance, which was
entrance A, for about 10 to 12 minutes, in what can only be described as a
very disorganised manner. Supporters were being allowed to switch from
queue to queue looking for the smallest queue and the quickest way into
the ground. There was little or no evidence of a lead from any policeman,
in attempting to get supporters to form an orderly queue. In fact when we
got nearer the turnstiles, one solitary policeman was standing between two
adjacent turnstiles passing jovialities with the crowd around him. He was
told of the chaos behind us and he said "What can I do about it, you are
just going to have to get on with it".

We then got through the turnstiles and before we could get completely
clear of the turnstiles, I was frisked by a Policeman, thereby causing
more congestion for the people behind, because nobody else could come
through the turnstiles until I was completely clear.
I suggested to the policeman that he should frisk people away from the
turnstile because it was becoming very dangerous outside, from a safety
point of view. He turned on me and said “If you d o n ’t f   well mind
your own business y o u ’ll find yourself locked up".
 We then proceeded into the ground, at this time it w a s approximately
 2.55pm. After the supporters began to spill onto the pitch from the
 Leppings Lane end, at about 3.20pm, my main concern was my son and

 ? h e fw e r e Sa? so S in 't h e             g ro u n d ,       but    fo r tu n a te ly    th e y    w e re   In   th e   sam e    s ta n d
 as me. I went to look for them, they were at the Leppings Lane end of
 North Stand, while I was at the Pern stone Road end of the North Stand On
 walking through the stand and still watching the com™ ° t E l S                   f,e
 I saw a Liverpool supporter punch a photographer, and push a policeman, he
 also picked up and threw the photographers metal box. He was ^ J ® " ^ ^ ®          t
 on by at least six policeman and he was taken from the P ^ c h
 believe that this incident was caused by the policeman holding back
 coat, which was covering the face of a body and              P . ident were
 photographer to take morbid pictures. The crowd arou          c o m m o t io n it
 shouting and screaming at the photographer, but in all the commotion
 was left to the supporter on the pitch to push them ^way.
 p ro b a b ly    th e m ost d i s g r a c e f u l in c id e n t I                     have e v e r w itn e s s e d       i n my l i f e . 1
 swear i f        I had been a b le t o g e t o n to t h e                             p itc h , I w o u ld h ave         done e x a c tly
 the same. I d o n ’t know whether the supporter was ar^ ; t®^e° ^ ® ^ s
 knew the person on the makeshift stretcher.     These are the events as I
                                                                             I                                                       Is
 remember them, on the saddest day of my life. We all       no doubt haveour
 reasons what went wrong, but I feel that there were a la^ e ™ ™ £ e r _ o f                                                                     ^
 things that were very wrong in comparison to last y       ,
    may be easy to correct this years faults, for future matches,

  1. The allocation of tickets by the F A w a s a disgrace.        turnstiies
; 2  There was an absence of checking of tickets away from the
     r e n t i n g ?n a large number of Liverpool supporters trying to get into
     the ground by any means possible.                    turnstiles
  3. Very poor crowd control directly in front of the'turnsti1es.
  4 Supporters leaving it to the last half an hour
     into a large crowd, after having had a drink.

therefore          I   should   go        down      the      tunnel.         No    Police    were

W h e n t h r o u g h the tun n e l I took to the r i g h t h a n d side to be

uncomfortable           as   more     an d m o r e   fan s    kept     coming down        the

Ticket allocations were clearly wrong.  I would suggest
they should be in proportion to the average home gate.   The
parking could have been as on match day, but Forest fans
use Parkside Road to reach Leppings Lane end.


W h y w a s J u n c t i o n 34 o f f the Ml u s e d for N o t t i n g h a m F o r e s t

c o n s i d e r a b l e t r a f f i c delays.


The landlord of            the p u b b y H i l l f o o t b r i d g e , N e e p s e n d L a n e
was interviewed            on ITV on 18 April.' H e w a s d e s c r i b i n g the
v a s t a m o u n t s of   a l c o h o l c o n s u m e d b y fans - b u t d i d not
s t a t e tha t t h e y    were N o t t i n g h a m Forest supporters, instead
he implied they            were Liverpool supporters.


M a n y t h o u s a n d s of F o r e s t fans m u s t h a v e a r r i v e d at the

g r o u n d at 2.35 p.m.


The Police presence outside the Leppings Lane end was
minimal and inadequate.  More officers should have been
there to do an initial ticket check to keep fans without
tickets well away from the turnstiles.


Why did the Police outside Leppings Lane not get the fans
to form queues.  This is surely standard practice.


 When the gates were opened the Police could still have
 collected the ticket stubs as fans entered.

                            of                                 Liverpool __ will
say



I am aged 38 years and I am unemployed.



I went to Hillsborough with my brother                         my brother-in-law

             , my son and two friends.       We went by car.     We parked about

a mile from the ground at approximately 1.30/1.45 p.m. (I am not too sure

of the time.)      We started walking slowly direct to the ground.      We all had

tickets.   Between the six of us we had three tickets for Leppings Lane and

three tickets for the Stand.



It would be about 2.20/2.30 p.m. (or round about that time) when we got

outside the turnstiles.       We did not know where Leppings Lane was and we

asked a policeman.       He said to us your in Leppings Lane.       The crowd was

beginning to bunch up but their -were no queues, not like when we have been

to matches at Anfield.       I saw two mounted policemen in the area and two

foot, policemen.      The two foot policemen were not doing anything.       They did

not know how to handle the crowd which was beginning to bunch up.           One

mounted policeman tried unsuccessfully to form a queue.           There was a crush

of people as early as 2.30 p.m.         I want to make that point quite clear.

Things did not seem to be going right and we eventually got through the

turnstiles with great difficulty.        When we were being crushed to get into

the turnstile people started to shout to a Police Sergeant who was nearby

on his horse, "Do something about it".        He held M s hands out in a sign of

resignation and said "I can't do anything about it I can't get in".              I do

not know quite what he meant by the phrase but that is what he said.              In

fact during the course of getting through the turnstiles my son was getting

crushed by the crowd.       Before we got into the turnstile a young boy was

pushed over our heads.       He had fainted and he was passed to a clear area

at the side of the road.         That is how difficult it was at that time.
When we got through the turnstiles into an enclosed area I saw one policeman

standing close to the turnstile through which we had come but I did not see

any stewards about.     I cannot say that there were no stewards about all I

can say is that I did not see any stewards.     We did not know where to go.

There was nobody directing us and I did not see any signs.     We saw a tunnel

in front of us and we went into the tunnel.      I would say it was then about

2.45 p.m.     All the times I have mentioned are approximate because I was not

taking a great deal of notice of the time.      The centre of the terrace of the

Leppings Lane end was very crowded.     My brother and my son, aged thirteen,

were with me.    We decided to see if we could get a space on the terraces.

We moved 2/3 deep into the crowd.      It was so crowded that it was hopeless

trying to get down to the front.      We came out of the crowd; moved along the

back of the crowd and tried to get into another part of the centre terracing.

My brother tried to get into the crowd but my son and I stayed at the back.

I shouted to my brother "I don't think its safe, I think we should get out".

I turned with my son to go back out through the tunnel.      I had had enough

by then and I thought the position was very dangerous.       As I started to

move along the back towards the tunnel a crowd of 50/100 persons, as far as

I could see all men and youngsters, came through the tunnel with a rush and

caused crowding in the area.      That was just a group of people and we managed

to walk back through the tunnel away from the terracing.      The people rushing

through were not all that many and they made way as I moved through with my

son.    I told my son we were going to leave the ground because it was not

safe there.     A stranger, who was a Liverpool fan, came towards me and said

he had been at Hillsborough the year before.      He certainly was not a steward.

He said "Come with me I know where there's some room".       He took me round

the corner into an area which was between the back of the terracing and the

wall where the turnstiles were.      In other words he did not take me out of

the ground and we moved round a curved part of the wall to an entrance

nearer to the North Stand.     There was plenty of room there.     You could
walk freely in   the terracing and pick where you wanted to stand.       We got

near the front   because therewas so much space.



As I looked to my right I saw people in the Leppings Lane end trying to climb

over the fencing on to the pitch and there were police officers preventing

them doing so.I definitely saw two officers preventing         the people from

climbing over the fencing.    They were putting both hands through      the railings

and trying to push them off the fencing.     I     did not hear what they were

saying because there was a lot of noise but Idefinitely        saw that happening.

The crowd was frantic by this time and the police officers did not succeed

in preventing the spectators climbing over the fencing.        After I saw the

pushing I saw people coming through the gate.        I cannot say when the gate

was opened but I did see people coming out of      the gate.    I saw a lot of

distress and people lying about on the field.      I do not need to detail the

events which subsequently happened because they are, I understand, well

documented.



I would like to add that at a later stage when it was obvious that something

was terribly wrong I did see two police officers helping people over the

fencing.          „

REPORT ON THE HILLSBOROUGH FOOTBALL DISASTER BY Mr. F.J. ECCLESTON (SEEIIOR NURSE


                                            Address:
                                                       I     _   i Wirral.

I arrived at the approach to the Leppings Road end of the Hillsborough
Stadium at llu 2$ hours.     I was accompanied "by my 27 year old son and
a young man of 17 •        all had a valid ground ticket.     The immediate
approach to the turnstiles, a distance of some 70 yards, was full of
a jostling crowd of ticket holders tiying to make their way to the
turnstiles.      There was no semblence of orderly oueues, with some kind
of order tiying to be maintained by three mounted police officers.
Despite the lack of organisation and frustration the mood of the fans
remained reasonably co operative.      To emphasise this, one of the horses
was very close to me and accidentally almost knocked xny spectacles off.
The officer apologised and we exchanged smiles and I stroked the horse's
nose.


The nearer one got to the actual turnstiles the pushing and crashing
became severe.      After approximately ten minutes all three of us were
literally catapulted through the turnstiles.       Over the last ten yards
one had no control whatsoever over our movements.


Once through the turnstile all three of my party came together.      Vfy son

attempted to remonstrate with a police officer regarding the lack of
organisation on the approach to the turnstile.      He was warned by a
steward standing alongside the officer to keep quiet because other fans
who had made similar protests had been forcibly     -ejected from the ground.


Ve then moved away and vent to use the toilet situated in front of us
 under the stand.      As we came out of the toilet we were directly facing
 the rear of the turnstile area and were immediately aware of the
 opening of one of the gates alongside the turnstiles.      The time was now
 just after lU.UO hours.      Anticipating the ensuing rush I took   my
 companions to the right, aiming to take our place high up on the terracing
 to the left of the Lepping Road Stand facing the playing area.      The
 previous year's experience had alerted me that this was a sensible area
 to stand, both from a safety viewpoint and it also provided an excellent
 view.        I have a vivid mental picture, as we hurried past the now
 infamous tunnel leading to the ill-fated sections, of turning my head
 and noticing there was nobody to be seen, either spectator or official.
The high up area we entered was very full, but with no crush.         We

positioned ourselves within feet of the blue boards.      Looking down from

my high vantage spot I could see the two middle pens immediately behind

the goal were .jammed to capacity with a seething mass of people.      To my

surprise, the pens on the left and right were half empty.      The area on

the far right around the electronic scoreboard was also half empty.

The time of this observation was 14.50 hrs.



   attention then became diverted when the Liverpool team took to the

field, followed a couple of minutes later by the opposition.        At the same

time I was conscious of a few people entering our section behind and

alongside me.     There was no large influx just before the kick-off where

I was standing.



The game had been in progress for some five minutes with Liverpool pressing

home an attack at the far end, with a corner followed by a shot which hit

the woodwork.     I believe this shot to be significant because it meant

a tremendous surge down the pens behind the Liverpool goal to try and see

what was happening.    This is the normal reaction on the terracing at any

football match.        Prom my vantage point I was then immediately aware

of fans trying to come over the metal fence behind the goal.        Some had

been successful and were being led down the touchline by the police.        Others

were being stopped climbing out of the pens despite their obvious protests.

At the same time a senior police officer ran from behind the Liverpool goal

and approached the referee.     He immediately stopped the game taking both

teams off the pitch.        B y this time a few more fans had managed to

escape from the pens.      One fan on the field of play appeared to be

pleading whilst he was being forcibly led to the side of the playing area.

Behind the goal the two pens were a seething mass of people with little

 or no movement either backwards or forwards.     A few people were being

 passed from the back of the pens to the front.       The front of the pens
next to the fence seemed to he flat without the usual bobbing heads.


Within two minutes of the teams leaving the field I realised something was

very wrong.      On reflection I have come to the conclusion that my alarm was

confirmed due to a combination of medical experience combined with an

intimate knowledge of years of attendance at football matches on the

terracing.


I quickly realised that help would he required on the pitch.      I informed my

son what I was doing and because I was so close to the entrance to the

terracing I had entered I quickly made my way down the stairs to find a

Steward to get me to the side of the pitch.       I quickly found a Steward who

accepted what I was telling him and he took me through a tunnel under the main

stand where a Police Officer again accepted my explanation of being a trained

nurse and let me on to the pitch.


I raced to the area immediately behind the goal net.      The narrow gate belonging

to the pen behind the net was open with police officers trying to pull flaying

bodies through the narrow opening.       Other officers appeared to be trying to

instruct the fans to push back in the pens.       I helped officers pull people

through the gate.       We were nulling any part of their body we could get hold

of.   On reflection I realise now because their bodies were level with the

bottom of the gate that they must have been lying on top of people because

the gap between the bottom of the gate to the floor of the terracing was some

three feet.



The first casualties I helped pull through the gate were conscious, but very

shocked.      I attended to them at the back of the goalmouth on the netting.

Their recovery was comparatively quick and simple were moved away from the

immediate area.        Very quickly I was aware that we were pulling out

Tinconscious bodies.     I can next recall working on a young man who once he

was conscious seemed to have chest injuries.      I looked around the goalmouth

for a stretcher or something to remove him to a place for him to get treatment.
The scene around me remained completely chaotic with everyone trying to do

their own thing, fans and police all mingling together.      I eventually found

a stretcher lying on the pitch with which I quickly returned to the injured man.

I literally ordered three police officers to help me lift the patient on to the

stretcher.    H y this time he was complaining about the pain in his chest.          We

quickly made our way to the corner of the field between the main stand and the

Kop and took the young man behind the stand to the St. John’s Ambulance room.

I then ran back on to the field to the goalmouth.     In that short interval of

time a lot more bodies were lying behind the goal.      People of all descriptions

were attempting mouth to mouth resuscitation and cardiac massage.      On the right

tand side of the goal net a young girl was being worked on by a man who stated

he was a surgeon.      I moved to the body next in line and worked with a young

police officer until the patient appeared to be starting to come round.          I

then moved on to the next person itfho was lying unconscious and unattended in

the goalmouth.      I was working alone in this instance giving both mouth to mouth

and cardiac massage, an impossible and hopeless situation.     The patient started

vomiting to complicate the issue.     I was conscious of an elderly white haired

St. John's Ambulance man working alongside me.      I requested some swabs to clear

an airway, all that was forthcoming was a dry sponge.       By this time it was

after 15»30 hours and we still had no equipment of any sort to work with.        It

was just after that that I was conscious of the first ambulances beginning to

make their way on to the pitch.      Eventually I realised that I had lost the

battle for this young man's life.       I looked around but I could not see anymore

unattended bodies.      By that time our ranks had been swelled by ambulance crews

and firemen with some oxygen.


I next left the field making my way behind the main stand to the gymnasium where

I understood some of the injured were being taken.      Again I found another scene

of   chaos.   The only entrance to the gym was a door of similar dimensions

to that found in any household room.     Directly outside this door was the

St. John's Ambulance Room.       The space was becoming jammed full of people

with comparatively minor injuries.     The area was also rapidly filling with

people presumed dead.
I next assisted police to make some sort of pathway to the door of the gym by
helping and organising the movement of both the prospective dead and the

seriously injured.      Inside the gymnasium the space was roughly divided

into two, half for the dead and the rest for the living, with tables set up

to interview the relatives.    I began to work with the injured in the

gymnasium at around 15*55 hours.    I was conscious of around three doctors in

attendance, but when I arrived there there was still no medical equipment of

any sort.     One doctor shouted across the gym for some drugs to treat an

injured fan who was in obvious pain.    There was nothing available so I

volunteered to go to the St. Johnfs Ambulance room.       I was informed that

they were not allowed to carry any drugs.      I rushed bade to the gym asking

some Senior Police Officer on the way if they could obtain some equipment

for us.     Quickly three small plastic boxes arrived with medical equipment

plus an emergency case with drugs in it.     I began passing out the meagre

items of equipment to the doctors present.     There were still only roughly

a dozen injured in the area.    I prepared ten intravenous lines ready for the

Medical Officer to set up, and we commandeered police officers to hold the

I*V. packs because we had no stands to attach them to.         By then some

semblance of order was being maintained in the part of the gymnasium given

over to the injured.      The other side of the gymnasium was rapidly filling

with the piYQ.C£*>*^T'dead.    One of the doctors present had taken one of the

three stethoscopes available to enable him to declare them clinically dead.


I next tidied up the medical equipment as most of the injured were being

rapidly removed to hospital.    I then began to realise the full extent of

the disaster for there were already over fifty bodies lying on the floor.

My final act in this carnage was to comfort and stay with the husband of the

young girl whom I had seen attended to behind the goal.      At least I knew

she had had the best of attention that had been available in the

circumstances.    I stayed with him whilst he gave the necessary details

to the police, and then a local vicar took over from me.

When I left the gymnasium, to my amazement it was still only 16.45 hours.
The longest hour and a half of my life.
PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS



1 . Comparison of the organisation with the previous year.

     The previous year I arrived at the same area of admission at 14*50 hours

     with my daughter.   Before we reached the turnstiles at Leppings Lane

     we had to go through a police filter system, whereby it was ascertained

     that we did have the appropriate match tickets.

     This year no such system was set up.



2.   Both years I was delayed because of travelling difficulties.     The

     appropriate Authorities had decided to initiate roadworks on the M62

     to commence around a week before each game.      Surely the matches could

     have been taken into consideration when setting up these roadworks.



3.   When we came through the turnstiles for the 1988 game we were met by a

     line of stewards and police officers who gently but firmly prevented us

     from entering the tunnel to the middle sections.     It had been decided

     that these sections were already full to capacity.

     This year no such precaution was in operation.



4.   I can understand the Police Officers at the turnstiles wishing to open

     the gates to relieve pressure and avoid injury to life or limb, but

     in these days of ultra modern and sophisticated personal communications

     surely it could have been done in conjunction with their central police

     control area at the side of the electronic scoreboard.



5.   Very recent national publicity hag assured us that surveillance cameras

     at football grounds means that any problems can be dealt with within

     two minutes of their occurrence.

     Surely with the police central control post with all its battery of

     T.V. monitors available, they should have been able to ascertain the
need "to close the middle sections when they "became full.


6.   Observing from the outside it appears to have taken far too long
     for the authorities to decide that it was not a security problem and

     that the fans genuinely needed help.   Working with and alongside

     the individual police officers in the immediate disaster area, I

     have tremendous praise and admiration for their efforts.   Overall

     at the scene, however, there appeared to be a lack of co-ordination

     and genuine leadership.



     For an extremely long time we were without any form of medical

     equipment of any description.     I still cannot understand why the

     local Health Authority’s Major Medical Disaster Team was not called

     upon.   I understand that all Health Authorities in this country

     have a major disaster policy.    It is impossible to accurately

      estimate the difference this would have made in saving life.

      I do, however, believe that the Liverpool fans should have been

      given the chance.

                                                     25 April 1989

Dear Sir

I am writing to give you an eye witness account of the events that happened
at Hillsborough on 15 April 1989.

I was in a party of ten who travelled to Sheffield in cars, we got there
later than expected due to road works and traffic build up, after parking
the car in a side street there was ample time to have a leisurely drink. We
went to a pub which was full of good humoured fans enjoying the occasion and
the sunny weather.

We left the pub to walk ten minutes down the road to the ground, we all
had tickets. As we crossed the bridge infront of the Leppings Lane
turnstiles the Police were already losing control, they were not organised
and appeared to be panicking. We had tickets so we tried to get to the
turnstiles, as we got near to the turnstiles the Police grabbed myself and
a friend and dragged us under a barrier and told us to go through a gate
that they had just opened at the side. We walked through this gate, we
did not run or surge, we walked. We then went up to the wrong entrance,
for seat^, the Steward and Police told us to go to the tunnel at the back
of the terraces. The Stewards and Police at the tunnel let us go down.
I was unaware of how packed it was. I was also unaware of the two side
entrances to the other sections. Surely the Stewards know how many people
can go down that tunnel, and if so, why didn't they tell us to go to the
other entrances. When in the tunnel I started to realize that something was
wrong, the pressure was getting worse, we were getting forced down the terrace,
the game had kicked off and there were still fans being allowed in behind us.
I could see a frantic Saint Johns man urging us to get back but we couldn't.
A friend got near us and told us the crush was getting worse down the front,
he was visibly shaken. We tried to move back after getting our backs against
a barrier, I went under it and clambered (with other peoples help) my way up
into the stands.      All this time there was no P.A. announcement telling
people that fans were being crushed, yet to the right there was a box over
looking     all the overcrowding^with Police in it. We helped others up into
the stands, the game had stopped people were dead and dying infront of us.
Still it was fttsriy the fans who were stretchering and giving mouth to mouth
assistance.   The majority of the Police were doing nothing, it was as if
they were waiting for orders.

I consider myself lucky to be writing this letter a friend spent 3 days in
hospital as a result of this tragedy. The questions I want answered are:—

1.   Why had the Police allowed the chaos to start outside        the turnstiles.

2.   Why were people allowed to go down the tunnel.

3.   Why weren't we directed to the side sections.

4.   Why wasn't there any communications between Policeinside        and outside the
     ground.
5.     Why wasn't there an earlier P.A. announcement to the crowd.

6.     Why were the Police pushing people back into the crush instead of opening
       the gate, by the time it was opened and the fence was ripped down it was
       5 minutes too late.

I hope this letter will be some help in finding the reasons behind the disaster
and most of all preventing a cover up in evidence already published in pathetic
newspapers.

Yours faithfully




P.S.     I also enclose a photocopy of my ticket with the stub still intact.

Dear Mr.     Livermore,

                          I a m w r i t i n g this letter to you a n d also the other p e o p l e
li s t e d b e l o w be cau se I wa s at H i l l s b o r o u g h last S a t u r d a y a n d feel it is m y dut y
to repo rt wh at I h a d seen. I h a v e a p p r o a c h e d this in an objective w a y a l t h o u g h
it has b e e n d i f f i c u l t after seeing the h o r r o r s lead i n g u p t o , d u r i n g a n d after
the disast er.

             In the light of vari o u s criticisms b y the p o l i c e an d the press I w i s h
t^ yp o i n t out that L i v erpool football fans acted, in the main, in an excellent
iri^ner. I, like so m a n y other people, have b e e n d e e p l y s a d d e n e d b y the disaster
oL. . the a p p a r e n t l y u n f o u n d e d allega t i o n s that have followed. I do not consider
m y s e l f or the vast m a j o r i t y of football followers at the m a t c h as h o oligans and
feel s t r o n g l y e n o u g h to air m y e xperiences in court if nee d be.

                 I w o u l d like to express m y deepest s y m p a t h y to all the b e r e a v e d
re l a t i v e s an d friends. I feel we have all b e e n a f f e c t e d and share in this time
of g reat sadness. F i n a l l y I w i s h those i n j u r e d a s p e e d y r e c o v e r y and hope to
see t h e m bac k at the m a t c h soon.

y fr i e n d a n d I a r r i v e d ou ts ide the L eppings Lane en trance to the g r o u n d at
4.40 hours. As we a p p r o a c h e d there were m a n y pe o p l e try i n g to g a i n entrance.

here we r e o b v i o u s l y m o r e ) w h o were t r y i n g d e s p a r a t e l y to control the crowd,
here we r e ot her p o l i c e m e n on foot but the numbers seemed w o e f u l l y inadequate,
ne senior p o l i c e m a n was tr y i n g to coordinate his me n but w i t h little success.

the c ro wd was p a c k e d v er y t i g h t l y into the c o n f i n e d space f r o m the r o a d to the
uiynstiles. Pe opl e w e r e cl imbing the w a l l s of the g r o u n d in an attempt to
            the crush. I was of the op inion that there was a serious chance of
at ^ xit ie s at this p oint outside the ground. The po l i c e p r e s e n c e was not enough
o p u s h the c r o w d b a c k onto the r o a d if that is w h a t t h e y w e r e t r y i n g to do.
  couldn't u n d e r s t a n d w h y the police ha d n ' t chosen to stop p e o p l e as t h e y
p p r o a c h e d L e p p i n g s Lane and s t a r t e d their control from the r o a d inst e a d of
t t e m p t i n g to do so at the turnstiles.

ea rin g tha t the s i t u a t i o n c o u l d d e v e l o p into a t r a g e d y m y f r i e n d and I m o v e d
w a y fr om the c ro wd a n d w a t c h e d from the b r i d g e o p p o s i t e the ground. We felt
hat we w o u l d not ge t into the g r o u n d until 15.30 at the earliest. F r o m our
an ta ge p o i n t w e w e r e able to assess the m o o d of the crowd. T h e y se e m e d in g o o d
pirit      a l t h o u g h some w e r e u n h a p p y w i t h the a g g r e s s i v e a t t i t u d e shown b y the
o l i c e on hand. I d i d see one or two d r u n k e n fans (who wer e not c a u s i n g an y
roubl e) but I c a t e g o r i c a l l y refute any s u g g e s t i o n that there w e r e "hundreds of
.runken fans" t r y i n g to g a i n admission. Se veral fans w e r e lo oking for tickets
iut we re not t r y i n g to p u s h their w a y in.

.fter w a t c h i n g the BBC c a m er am an get his 5 m i n u t e s of "glory" a n d q u i c k l y
lisappear we d e c i d e d to see if the crowd h a d t h i n n e d out. By this time the

[uickly as po ssi ble .

  g ave a p o r t i o n of m y ticket to the g a t e m e n (who said he di d n ' t care wha t bit

:omplete ti ck et in the air. By now the m a t c h h a d s t a r t e d so we w a n t e d to find a
rood spot to w a t c h from. There were no p o l i c e or stewards a r o u n d to tell us
rhere the en t r a n c e s onto the turn stiles were. I could not see an y signposts
'lthough a d m i t t e d l y m y m a i n con cern was to w a t c h the m a t c h . . W e wen t to toilets
Lnd f o l l o w e d the cr ow d t h r o u g h the tunnel w h i c h a p p e a r e d to be the o n l y w a y
into the ter ra ce s. I v e n tured up the steps at the e n d of the tunnel w h i c h led
into the t e r r a c e s that we r e immedi a t e l y b e h i n d the g o a l .


                                                                        \
)n- . o k t o l d me that the numb e r s in this section wer e d a n g e r o u s l y h i g h a n d so
*e • -rr.ed a r o u n d to try a n d f i n d another w a y onto the terraces. People were
;t:.. co min g do w n the tunnel a n d we h a d to p u s h our w a y through. We n o t i c e d the
entrance to the West S t a n d a b o v e the t e r r a c i n g w h e r e 2 stewards w e r e standing,
fhey t o l d m y fr ie nd that if we con t i n u e d right we w o u l d find an other entrance,
rhis we d i d a n d once onto the te r r a c i n g found that there was m u c h e m p t y space
iround us.      We looked do w n on the sections b e h i n d the goal a n d c o u l d not
aelieve the numbers in there. It was obvious that there w o u l d be m a n y people
lurt an d we couldn't u n d e r s t a n d w h y the p o l i c e had not m o v e d p e o p l e to our
section. By th en it was p r o b a b l y too late as I assume that pe o p l e were b eing
cilled either as we first e n t e r e d the g r o u n d or minutes after we ha d t u r n e d
sack down the t u n n e l .

^ike most pe op le we th ou g h t that the first p e r s o n onto the p i t c h was t r y i n g to
:ause trouble. It di dn 't take long to see that we were wrong. The police
lowever couldn't see this an d were trying to p u s h a n y b o d y that a t t e m p t e d to
: ^ n b over the ra il in gs b ac k onto the terraces. W h e n the m a t c h w a s stop p e d we
? ^ P - t e d the police w h o came onto the p i t c h to give immediate assistance . The y
Instead c o n c e n t r a t e d their ef forts on s t a n d i n g 2 d e e p across the half - w a y
|.ine. An ot he r g r o u p of po li ce d i d the same b y the goal line.

[t was the fans wh o h a d e s c a p e d the c rush wh o were h e l p i n g the others a n d
:arrying the hurt a n d the dead. Some p o l i c e d i d h e l p but m ost c o n t i n u e d to
stand a r o u n d an d watch. W e felt h e l p less a n d s i c k e n e d at wha t we saw but didn't
try to get onto the p i t c h as we thought it w o u l d onl y a d d to the c h a o s ,
Desides I still felt that the police b e i n g the p r o f e s s i o n a l s w o u l d help. Most
iid not. I w a t c h e d p h o t o g r a p h e r s tak ing ph o t o s of peo p l e lying h u r t or dying
-ather t h a n helping. W h e n we saw two or three bodies we did n't hav e the heart
for a n y football so d e c i d e d to leave. I estimate the time t hen to be b e t w e e n
L545 a n d 1600 hours.

: ha v e ne ver felt so upset, frustrated, a n g e r e d a n d s i c k e n e d    than then. In my
riew the o n l y pe opl e w h o came from this w i t h any credit were            the fans who, on
.he whole, a c t e d in a though t f u l , r e s p o n s i b l e manner. Again,   for the m a i n part
.he police who sh o w e d little or no control inside or outside                  the ground, did
m c h to con tr ib ut e to the d i s aster but little to help.

)ne other major c o n t r i b u t i o n to the disaster w h i c h should be m e n t i o n e d is the
.icket a l l o c a t i o n b y the Football A s s o c i a t i o n . It was t houghtless a n d ill
:onceived to give the L i verpool fans the smaller of the a l l o c a t i o n s w h i c h was
ibvious w h e n looking at the spaces on the terraces at the o p p o s i t e end of the
[round.

; hav e t r i e d to be as o b j e c t i v e as I c ould in w r i t i n g this a n d w o u l d be
prepared to stand up in a n y court a n d g iv e m y ac count w h i c h as far as I am
roncerned is honest a n d accurate.

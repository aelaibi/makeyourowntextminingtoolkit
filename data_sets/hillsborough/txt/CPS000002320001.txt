             Dear Sirs

             ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENTBELD AND MURRAY

             You are aware, that Leading Counsel on behalf of our Client and Counsel on behalf of
             Mr Duckenfield told the Stipendiary Magistrate at Leeds of an intention to make
             application to seek Judicial Review of your decision. That intimation will have come
             as no surprise to you since we believe that you had ejected that whichever side felt
             aggrieved by your decision would take such action.

             We enclose herewith a copy of the letter of 22 December from HFSG to this office and
             we refer particularly to the third paragraph.

             At the invitation of the Learned Stipendiary Magistrate it is intended not only to make
             application to seek Judicial Review, but to ask that the proceedings in the Leeds
             Magistrates’ Court be stayed pending determination of the Judicial Review application.

             The Prosecution have already referred to the feet that the announcement of the decision
             caused the deferment of the question of voluntary disclosure by you and South Yorkshire
             Police. We are now writing both to yourselves and to the South Yorkshire Policc to
             suggest that insofar as you are now aware of the intention to lodge the application for
             Judicial Review, and that it will include an application to stay the proceedings pending
             deamination, that you should not give any voluntary disclosure until those applications
             have been determined. Would you please therefore confirm that no disclosure of
             documents will be given until either the determination of the Judicial Review
             proceedings or aua Order of the Court requiring you to make disclosure.

             Yours faithfully

 Dear MrManning,


 I enclose as a matter
 South Yorkshire Pofice Authority. % affects your position.

 Yesterday, counsd instructed by you told the magjstrate that you had decided to applyforjudicial
 review of the decision of the Crown Prosecution Servicenot to takeoverthe prosecution of your
 client and MrDuckenfield It was apparent that you» and MrDuckenfield’slawyers, had taken
 this decision even though you had not received what Mr Harrison described a j “reasops” inThe
 counsel and solicitor meeting andt*pdicywbefore themagistrate.

 The                                             was to cause a
 vohntaiy disclosure of documents by the CrownProsecutionService and South Yorkshire Police.
  Under Order 53 Rule 4 of ihe Rules of th« Supreme Court, it is necessary that any application for
 judicial review should he filed ‘'promptly and in any evait witirin three months”. The decision you
  have made to apply for judicial review causes delay in the matter of disclosure. Since all the
  feaors that have impelled you to announcea concluded decision have been known to youfbr
  several months, there can, I suggest, he no reason why you should not be able to lodge your
  application for leave end supporting evidene® by Friday 8* January 1999, however long a
  Christmasholiday you take. You will have att evidence you need, and the grounds for your
  applicatkmareob\aouslycapableofbeingexpressednow.
 We have suggested in court that you are using delay as avraaponinthecase.iatherthanas a
 gnuSne grieutuioe. If you do not lodge your application for judicial review fey 8* January 1999,
 we give you notice that we shall object, in the absence of t compellmgejqjlanaiion, to the gram
 of love and/or substantive reliefon the ground that you did not apply “promptly*’.

           Dear Sirs

           ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFEELD AND MURRAY

           We acknowledge your fax of 22 December. The answer contained therein is wholly
           unsatisfactory. It is against what Mr Croston told the writer on the telephone when we
           called you from Court on 21 December when it was intimated that a draft reply already
           existed and would be with us no later than dose of business on 24 December. We have
           already noted that we believe that it was quite wrong for foil and cogent reasons not to
           have been set out at the same time as your decision was notified,

           We reserve the right to
           Court that considers an application for Judicial Review of your decision.

           Yours faithfully

        23.12.98

        T/C from Ann Adlington of the 11FSG requesting update of when the decision as to
        voluntary disclosure is going to be made. They are concerned that it should be made before
        Christmas.

        I said that the matter was being considered at the moment, and that either I or someone in
        Loudon would contact them as soon as possible.

        I explained that if the decision of the CPS was to give voluntary disclosure prior to any
        judicial review proceedings then that would be subject to considerations of PIT/legal
        privilege and consultation with the police rc their material in our possession. She now
        accepts the impossibility of dealing with physical disclosure by the CPS before 4.1.99 as
        consultation between the CPS and the police cannot lake place until the first week in
        Jauuary. However she would like some confirmation of our intentions so that she inform
        the Magistrates’ Court at the next hearing on 7.1.99.

        ACTION: GC to inform CN/RB as to conversation                  Latest letters from Walker
        Morris also to be considered rc their complaint that we may not give them full reasons as
        to our decision not to intervene, and that we should not give voluntary disclosure until after
        judicial review.

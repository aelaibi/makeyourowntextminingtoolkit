                  instruction cauie from.          Under normal circumstanccs instruction came from a

                  Serial Inspector or via radio from control.                        I cannot say Irom which the

                  instruction came.



                  Bearing in mind the time lapse and having attended several matches at

                  Hillsborough, it is difficult to relate detail regarding this particular

   ^              match.

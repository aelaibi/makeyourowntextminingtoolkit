          HILLSBOROUGH: HOME SECRETARY'S MEETING WITH LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR
                                  4 AUGUST 1989


          You were present when the Home Secretary had a brief meeting
          with Lord Justice Taylor to thank him for his interim report,
          on the morning before publication. Mr Whalley was also
          present. I set out below those points which arose which seem
          to be worth recording:

               (i)    Lord Justice Taylor said that he had received
                      tremendous support from Home Office staff and from
                      counsel to the Inquiry;

              (ii)    he was sorry the report came down heavily on the
                      police, but unfortunately that was the way the
                      evidence fell. However, he could let the Home
                      Secretary know informally that there were a number
                      of aspects related to crowd behaviour which he could
                      not deal with in his interim report, which he would
                      return to in his final report, such as drinking
                      before the match, people turning up without tickets
                      and ticket touting. This might make the interim
                      report seem somewhat unbalanced. The Home Secretary
                      commented that some critics would be likely to
                      continue to see the hooligan football fan as the key

                      this might be to say that the intention was to deal
                      with crowd behaviour in the final report. He also

              commented that the Home Office had drawn the
              attention of the magistrates and police to the
              powers they had to prevent drinking in pubs before
              football matches, although they did not seem to use
              them very much;

              the Home Secretary said that the football clubs were
              likely to begin to complain soon about the costs of
              the recommendations, particularly the loss of
              revenue caused by the reduction in numbers in the
              terraces. Lord Justice Taylor commented that apart
              from that^ the interim recommendations did not call
              for a great deal of expenditure in his view, though
              the final recommendations might well;

       (iv)   he commented that the interim report had clearly
              been a judicial task, but the final report might
              stray into political areas in which it would be
              difficult for him to express a strong view. He
              might need to come back to the Home Secretary and
              explain that he could only go so far. The Home
              Secretary said that it might well be proper to draw
              a line under his consideration ofso^eissuesand to
              say that he had takenfi\«*v as far as he could in his
              judicial capacity;

              Lord Justice Taylor said that there would be a lot
              to do to prepare the final report. He would wish to
              visit a number of football grounds throughout the
              country and possibly abroad. He therefore said that
              he hoped to have the final report ready by the turn
              of the year.

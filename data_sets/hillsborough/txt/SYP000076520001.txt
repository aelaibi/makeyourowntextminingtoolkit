from A n f ie ld thro u g h the S e a s o n Ticket                 scheme.        I paid £6 for         the

tic k e t .



We    lVft L i v erpool          sho r t lyN^f ter      10am    (1000)    on the S a t u r d a y morning

and we were            s u bj ec te d to travel** delays           on the P e n n i n e s    between

M a n c h e s t e r and ^Sfcieffield.            I'm not sure what          the    cause was,      but we

were     de la y e d     for a cou|>ig of hours.



We a r r i v e d    in S h e f f i e l d at about         1.43pm      (1345)    and stopped       for     one

pint at a local              pub.       We all     left   together       in the     car and      parked up

not     far    from the g r o u n d on a private                car    park.      I'm not sure of the

exact     road,        this w o u l d     be about 2 . 2 5 p m     (1425).



Whilst        trav e l l i n g   to the     ground      I did not witness any other                supporter

c o n suming alcohol.



W h e n we had         parked the         car we were       directed      to the ground by a Police

O fficer.          The    side streets           had been      closed and we found ourselves                    in <

long     proce s s i o n of       people walking           round to the ground.                I did not

match.         I passed t h r ou gh         the gates and made my way towards Block B

t urnstiles,           these were         for the West S t a n d terraces.               The   crowd was

much     the     same a s ' t e f o r e    outside     the ground.         As     I moved towards          the

turnstiles          I saw t h a t \ h e         turnstiles     appeared        to be shut.       At this

the    turnstiles.



One    of the         blokes       I was with,             whose        name    I don't       know knew where            the

West     S ta nd and         the     terraces.             I went        thro u g h    the gate with a large

group       of others.             I can't          put a number            on it.        We w a l k e d thro u g h

the    gate,         you    couldn't          walk     normally through                it was      like a shuffle.

We went        thro u g h the gate and down the tunnel                                 into     the terrace.

We were        going        f or w a r d    into     the     rear of the terracing.



There were            no    police         officers        or stewards at              this     point    in the    ground,

I did not witness                  any disorder             or d r u n k e n n e s s    at    this    point    either.

Ha v i n g   been       pushed     into      the terrace        I came    u p \ gainst a crash barrier,

it    could be          about 4-5 yards into             the    terrace,         Iw W    to the         right     of

the    centre of the           barrier.            I tried to move ar o u n d to the                right    of the

b arrier       in order       to stand        in front     of    it.     I m o v e d my    left ar m aro u n d

the    side     of the barrier and the force                     of th a crowd pinned               it against

the    edge     of the      barrier.          The    pain got worse




The    game     had kicked of f ' b y          this    time,     it w o u l d be about         one minute

Eventually           I got my a r m free and m a n a g e d             to hold    it upright,             I pushed

backwards        through to the              back    of the     crowd.        A supporter who            I d o n ’t

know grabbed my shirt and star t e d to help me to keep on my feet.



A few other           suppo r t e r s   then a s s i s t e d me up and over             the heads         of the

other        supporters       in the     terrace,       and     p^Tt me forward over                t±u?ir heads

As    I got to tiqe gate            people were         trying     to get       out,    I reached over and

were    stuck,         A po 11 c \ a n n,who had b e en s t a nding on the                pitch,         I now

pulled me out.             He was       in shock       himself.        I got out.         The       policeman

put his arm a r o u nd me and took me                     to h a l f w a y across       the    pitch.        He

    then went                    back   to the         e r ra c e .    Two St Joh n A m bulance             came over    to rne

    a n d they                  took me    to the first a\id room and sat me down.                             One of them




    By the door                    of the       first aid        room     I could see        bodies       on the floor.        On

    the           beds a r o un d me            there were            people who were        still and men were

    crying              openly.           The    first aid            room was    full.      The St Johns         people were

    w o rk in g            outside.




    The           only surge            that     1 witnessed            inside    the    terrace was w hen          people

    were           coming          down the          tunnel    onto the stand.              I did not witness anyb o d y

    dying,              m a i nl y due      I    think      to the fact          that    I was        in pain and     I was

    trying              to keep my arm                up and out of harms way.                    I    could   not assist

    a n y o ne who was                  injured,



    I think                the     reason       people      died       in the Pens was           that    there were     too

    man y          people          in the       pens an d there was              no way out once            inside.     The

    gates were                    shut and       there were           fences     down the        sides.



    W h e n the                 crush was       on    in >4;ie stand       it was       evident        to farts on the

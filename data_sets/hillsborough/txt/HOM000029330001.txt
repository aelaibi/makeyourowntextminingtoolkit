TIMINGS OF THE OPENINGS OF THE PERIMETER GATES IN PENS 3 AND 4

I am afraid that of all the video tape we have in our possession there is
no footage available which shows the actual opening of the perimeter gates
with their relevant timings.

Attached hereto are schedules relating to the times of persons who exited
from pens 3 and k which, in the absence of the above information, may be of
some help to you.   It should be noted that the times referred to in the
schedules relating to the gates are the actual times at which the gates are
seen open for thefirst time, rather than whenthey were actually    opened.

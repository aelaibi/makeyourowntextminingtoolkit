I am -a Season Ticket holder in the Kop end of Anfield and on April 15th I left my home
in Romiley, Stockport, at 12. a.m.     Cue to roadworks on the M 62 there was a build up of
traffic and the hour long journey took two hours.     I arrived at the ground at 2.15 - 2.20 pm.
There were long queues but everyone appeared to be happy and cheerful.       I saw only one
mounted policeman and one policeman on each turnstile.
At 2.25 approximately I went through turnstile B - Leppings Lane Stand.       On passing through
the turnstile I looked for the marked entrance to the terraces.       I did not think they were
clearly marked.     I did not see any steward or policeman directing fans into sections of
the ground.   There appeared to me to be only one clearly marked entrance straight ahead.
I went through this and into the tunnel along with a large crowd, although nothing unusual.
I 1>hen turned to my right and moved about ten yards, so that I was more or less level with
the end of the tunnel.
At this time I tried to read my programme but because of surges this was impossible, and
by about 2.35 the cage was full to capacity, whilst there was plenty of room in the side
pens.   I lost my shoe in the crush.    Buring the next few minutes I was pushed further and
further down the terraces and was unable to regain my position at the back because of
sheer numbers.    I estirate the time to have been 2.40 - 2.45*   After this time it is not
possible for me to give an accurate assesment of the timing of the events which followed.
The surging and crushing took me down against a crash barrier.        By this time I realised
something was seriously wrong.    People were screaming in agony and shouting to three
policement behind the goal to open the gates because people were dying.        At this time a
young boy standing next to me aged approximately 14 collapsed and fell dying to the floor.
People tried to help him, they tried to move to pull him up but this was impossible.
Nobody could move.    Two or three fans climbed over the fence behind the goal but were
pushed back in by the police.     Things got worse and we could not move an inch, the
pressure was intense and I could not breathe.     My hand was crushed against my stomach
and the pressure caused me to vomit.     At this point the gate in the wire fence was opened
and fans started to empty out onto the pitch.     At this time the crash barrier started to
bend and people were screaming, and shouting for fans to move back.       All around me people
were being crushed and dying.    The barrier totally collapsed.   S o » people must have then
fallen, but the density of numbers must have held up others.      I was crushed and being
pushed forward and under me was a young man my own age slowly slipping under.       I tried to
help him up and talk to him but was too exhausted to do either.       He slipped further and
further down, and I could feel myself slipping down also.     I believe he died.    I tried to
make a space for myself to breathe but I could do nothing further and gave up trying to
do anything more.    I believed I was going to die.   I could not see anything now, but could
still hear people moaning and screaming.     I was going down then.    Someone grapped my hair
and shoulder and started to drag me out.     I opened my eyes and saw a row of people who
had died or were dying.    I was pulled to a small space and five or six men lifted and
threw me on top of the wire fence into the pen to the right of the goal.       I was unable to
move and was pulled and caught by people on the other side who carried me across the pen



                                                                                                 4

onto the pitch, where I was helped to recover alongside the advertising hoardings.
After a short time fans started to rip up the hoardings to use as stretchers and
then a young fan helped me to the other side of the pitch where I lay for about
one hour.     I had lost all sense of time.     When I checked my watch it was 4*15 P>m.
I thought it must have been 8 p.m.        At approximately 5 p.m.   I made my way back to
the car still very shocked.
As I was     sitting recovering on the pitch I did not see any looting or fighting. I
did see a camera    man being       jostled andlurched when he was taking pictures of the
dead and      dying. Many fans      were giving artificial respiration.
As I was     walking away from      the ground I witnessed a group of Notts. Forrest supporters
iron across the park and attack Liverpool fans accusing them of causing the trouble.
The Liverpool fans responded by telli rg them people were dead and dying and then they
retaliated.
The accurate timing of events is difficult but I believe fans started dying
approximately 2.40 p.m. - 2.45 P*m.
I have written the above account whilst events are still very real to me.         This is
the best I can do and all that it is possible for me to remember of the terrible things
that happened.

Dear Sir,
I am enclosing a copy of               batement, a copy of which I have forwarded to
the Police Investigation and the Public      Enquiry.    I do not know if I have sent
this statement to the correct people.      I want to make sure that
testimony as to the behaviour of the Liverpool fan's is not overlooked.
We are a                      and   have lived in Romiley for the past twentythree
years.   Ve were heart-broken at the allegations made by the Sheffield Police and
the Press and feel helpless to do anything.             ind his friends witnessed no
bad behaviour before the game.      I am sorry to burden you with this statement, but
hope that if we have not sent it to the correct authorities you will kindly do
that for us r
Ve will never know who pullec             to safety - there were so many heroes on
that terrible day but our heartfelt thanks and prayers go out to them.         Our joy
at              return was not a cause for celebration just a deep sense of grief
and sorrow for all those relatives whose loved ones would never return.        Ve have
returned to Liverpool with _______ a number of times so that he could share in
the healing understanding of just being with the people of Liverpool.        No words
were spoken as they were not needed.       Our prayers go out to all those who are
suffering loss and pain, and all those suffering trauma through their experiences.
Yours faithfully.

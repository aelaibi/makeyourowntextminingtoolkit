 Dear c o lle a g u e s ,

 Social Workers Support Group
 You are probably aware that a group of Social Workers who
 are dealing with bereaved relatives following Hillsborough,
 have been meeting regularly.
 The purpose of the meetings are to share feelings surrounding
 the work and to discuss any information or developments
 relevant to Hillsborough.

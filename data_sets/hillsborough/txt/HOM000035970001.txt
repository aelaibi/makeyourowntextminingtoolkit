HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

I refer to Mr Walker's letter of 25 January and my letter of 26
January to Mr Farmer, Lord Chancellors Department, which were
copied to you, about the possibility of the South Yorkshire
Police Authority making compensation above the "statutory"
bereavement provision. I now attach a copy of Mr Farmer's reply
of 30 January for your information.
2.   Mr Farmer mentions that the Lord Chancellor is conducting
a review of the level of bereavement damages and that in some
recent cases settlements have been made for sums above the
present statutory level of £3,500.      (In the Zeebrugge case
payments in the region of £10,000 were made and in the Kings
Cross disaster the minimum payment was set at £7,500.) He also
points out that the level of settlement must always be a matter
for the parties concerned.
3.   Mr Walker said that a figure of £10,000 had been discussed
by the Authority's insurers and the Steering Committee. South
Yorkshire are asking us whether any payments beyond the statutory
requirement, which the Authority considered to be appropriate,
would be grant-aided.

4.   When South Yorkshire Police Authority asked us whether the
Home Office will consider giving further special assistance to
them in connection with uninsured compensation liabilities which
might arise out of the Hillsborough disaster, we said that our
expectation would be that the Authority should take steps to
cover this contingency from its own resources (including the
grant it receives from the Government).
5.   I consider therefore that we must agree to pay police
specific grant at the usual rate on any compensation payments
agreed between the parties. If their legal advice is to offer
a payment for bereavement above the statutory provision then
police grant should be payable on those amounts.      However, I
consider that we do have a right to know and comment on amounts
which are well beyond the statutory bereavement figure, but I
would have considered payments up to £10,000 to be reasonable in
the circumstances.
6.   According to Mr Walker 44 of those who died have families
who would be entitled to bereavement damages; there are possibly
25 more.   If settlements were made at the £10,000 level there
would be costs of at least £440,000 and a maximum of £690,000
depending on the final number of payments. We would be expected
to meet 51% of this cost. South Yorkshire are insured for claims
of up to £8 million in all.
6.   I attach a draft letter to Mr Walker giving our views
these payments and I would appreciate your comments before
reply.

                          HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - COMPENSATION PAYMENTS

                          Thank you for your letter of 25 January about the
                          possibility of the South Yorkshire Police Authority making
                          compensation payments above the statutory bereavement
                          provision of £3,500.     You asked whether such payments
                          would qualify for police specific grant.

                          We understand that the Lord Chancellor is to review the
                          statutory provision for compensation and that there have
                          been some recent cases where payments have been made above
                          the amount specified. Ultimately it is for the parties
                          involved to negotiate the level of settlement in each
                          case. As far as the grant position is concerned, I can
                          confirm that if, on legal advice, your Authority proposes
                          to settle at a higher level then the statutory figure than
                          police grant will be payable on these amounts.

Obviously we have a direct interest in the level of
payments in public expenditure terms and therefore if your
Authority proposes to settle at a figure in excess of
£10,000 per case we would like to be consulted beforehand.

    Hillsborough Disaster - Compensation Payments

    Thank you for your letter of 26 January in which you asked
    whether this Department has any views on the funding of
    settlements above the statutory bereavement provision.
    As you know, the Lord Chancellor is conducting a review of the
    level of bereavement damages and he will be issuing a
    consultation paper shortly which will invite views on whether the
    present level should be raised and, if so, what new level would
    now be appropriate.
    I am aware that in some recent cases settlements have been made
    for sums above the present statutory level. However, I do not
    think it would be proper for me or anyone else in this Department
    to comment on whether a higher sum would be appropriate in any
    particular case, since settlements must always be a matter for
    the parties.
    I am sorry that I cannot be more helpful.

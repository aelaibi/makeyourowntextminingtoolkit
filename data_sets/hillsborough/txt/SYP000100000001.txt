 Dear Sir

 HILLSBOROUGH MOUTHY’

 I refer to your letter of 20 August 1990 requesting copies of West Midlands
 Police composite Album 1 and 2.

 Although these photographs and other documents and statements were available
 for the Public Inquiry of Lord Justice Taylor the situation changed at the
 commencement of the criminal investigation.

That investigation, supervised by Captain E N Taylor of the Police Complaints
Authority is still on going and all relevant material is subject to that
investigation.

I am not therefore in a position to release these photographs at this time.
However, if the situation changes I will of course contact you.

Yours faithfully

 Dear Sir

 HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY

 I refer to your letter of 20 August 1990 requesting copies of West Midlands
 Police composite Album I and 2.

 Although these photographs and other documents and statements were available
 for the Public Inquiry of Lord Justice Taylor the situation changed at the
 commencement of the criminal investigateon.

 That investigation, supervised by Captai n E N Taylor of the Police Complaints
 Authority is still on going and all rele vant material is subject to that
 investigation.

 1 am not therefore m a position to reie:ase tftese pftotograpus at this time,
 However, if the situation changes I will of course contact you.

 Yours- faithfully

Dear Dr Popper,

RE:     RELEASE OF WITNESS STATEMENTS

You may recall that shortly after the Hillsborough tragedy during the time
evidence was being taken at Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry I made a request
on behalf of the Solicitors acting for individual injured and bereaved that
copies of the statements which their clients had given to the \vest MidlancU
Police in the course of their enquiries could be released to the Solicitors.

 The reasons for that are self-evident.   Reliving the disaster is traumatic
 and if clients are asked to make a statement again "from scratch' that does
 cause distress to those individuals.

 At that time the West Midlands Police were working under the direction of Lord
 Justice Taylor and yourself and by agreement t h o s e statements were made
 available to t h e Solicitors which was of great assistance.

 Once the matter had been referred to the DPP by the C h i e f Constable of South
 Yorkshire Police the procedure was changed as the DPP would naturally no
 allow release of any witness statements which might be statements of potential
 witnesses to a criminal trial or potential Defendants.

 Now that the DPP is no longer interested and his decision has been made I v*ould
 be grateful if you would consider again authorising the West Midlands Pol ice
 to release individual statements to Solicitors upon written request, inose ^
 statements would of course only be those made by thexr own individual c l i .
 or, in the case of witness statements, statements of witnesses who gave stated
 authority for t ie release of a stateinent to a particular Solicitor.

  I appreciate that at this moment you are particularly busy but would be gi ateful
  if you could deal with this request •

  Every good wish.

  Yours sincerely,

 and      19th O c t o b e r      1990 as well           as my          instructions           it

 seems plain             that     most   of      the    documents            and      mate r i a l

 with which           I am concerned              came       into      existence for the

 purpose of          the      Judicial        Inquiry         and      the      Coroner's                         i

 Inquisition;              some     further m a t erial                was obtained            to

Were      ° btalned        t0 c o n s i d e r    whether          there         had   been     any

mis-conduct              by a Police Officer                  as a result, of an

investigation              into    six c o m p l a i n t s .
                                                                                                              §




          The C o r o n e i     a Inquisition            is d u e        to c o m m e n c e    on      19th

November          1990 and        no disciplinary                 p r o c e edings will           be

held until          after       the conclusion               of    the Inquisition.



3.        As a general           rule „© d o c uments                 or material           ought

to be disclosed               unless civil p r o ce e d i n g s have                    been

commenced          and    d i s c o v e r y -is due      to       take' place and the
documents                                   ought          to    be       disclosed            to      the

Court       under         the      ordinary             Rules          of    M - . e r ,            as       being

either       .supportive               of     the       Plaintiff's                 c a se     or       dancing

to    that     of       the     Defendant               (see          Evans        V The C H i c f C o n s t a b l e


of    S ur r e y       1088     3 WL R           page      127).



           I note           that       a number            of        potential           Plaintiffs

 their       witness            statements.                     At     first        sight         it        might     a tp

 unreasonable                 to r e f u s e          to    provide              c o p ies.         However           I

 u n d e r s t a n d        that       some       claims                    thought          to        be    bogus.

 Further           the. I n q u i s i t i o n           and          the    subsequent                 disciplinary

 prejudice              ei t h e r .         I    therefore                 advise       against              disclosing

 any       material             unless           there          is    a     clear     obligation                to do

    I advise         that       they       should        not     be    disclosed           and        that     the

    opposing         disclosure.                 It     is    impossible          for me          to a d v i s e

    if any      such       representations                    will     succeed         without             seeing

    the d o c u m e n t s       concerned             and     without        having        f ur the r

    instructions               as    to    the    nature         of    the      prejudice             w hich

    th o se    responsible                for    discipline            feel      might       occur.            I

    suspect         that       the    coroner           faced       with     s uc h     representations

    woul d     have       to    balance          the     question          of    p r e j u d i c e as        against

    the need         for a full             and       proper        investigation                in p u b l i c

    as    to   the m a n n e r        in w h i c h       the     people         concerned             met    their

    death.          He m i g h t      well        feel       compelled          to o rder             disclosure

    despite         the    r isk      that        the    disciplinary             hearings              could       be

    prejudiced.                Fortunately              any      disciplinary             hearing            is held

    before      a discipline                 b o a rd      and    in    some     circumstances                 before

    the C h i e f C o n s t a b l e          rather          than      a Jury      and      therefore              it    is

     unlikely         that any            adverse          publicity         attendant                upon    the

     Coroner's         Inquisition                will       affect      the m i n d s           of    the

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER REQUESTS FOR DISCLOSURE

I have now given detailed consideration to Counsel's advice on the subject
of disclosure of material that case into existence in connection with the
Hillsborough disaster and note the advice as being against disclosure of any
material before the conclusion of the Inquest and subsequent disciplinary
enquiry unless there Is a clear obligation to do so.

It has always been accepted that If disclosure Is ordered by any court,
including the Coroner's Court, disclosure would occur. How an obligation other
than by order of the Court could arise is not clear. It would be most helpful
if examples could be given of situations that might arise which would create
such an obligation.

I note the advice that in general nothing should be disclosed "unless civil
proceedings have been commenced and discovery Is due to take place." Could
it be said that the circumstances set out in paragraph 3 of the advice exist
in relation to the present state of any of the civil proceedings arising from
the disaster? If the answer to this question is negative In what other
circumstances would disclosure be proper?

Almost every complaint is an allegation that crime has been committed by «
police officer and this Is true with the Hillsborough Enquiry. It is in my
view a misconception to think of a complaint investigation as meaning an
investigation leading to possible disciplinary proceedings. The overwhelming
majority of ccnplalnt investigations are criminal enquiries which may result
in criminal or disciplinary proceedings.
16 November 1990

S Walker Esq

It was generally thought in police circles that public interest immunity
encompassed all material that came into existence in the course of an
investigation into any complaint against police and that this notion was
unaffected by the possibility of the material being used in forthcoming
disciplinary               T h e __________ I
             proceedings. The
(HaclDlinary Droceedings.                   complaint investigation you will
                                            |complaint
know had to do with a serious crime and was not confined to purely disciplinary
matters although the evidence was held to be subject of public interest
inmnity. The!             case was certainly after and not before the
disciplinary hearing.

It W as thought that "no power of waiver of public interest immunity exists,
either belonging to the force or to the individual making the statement. Any
disclosure (other than to prevent a miscarriage of Justice, to the Home
Secretary, to the Coroner or to the force’s legal advisers) could not occur
without the prior consent of the court." This thinking that the P°X*C® *v®
n o power to disclose now seems unsound for it has been put to me that this
conflicts with counsel's advice. Is there any doubt in this area?

i should be grateful if you would consider these questions as quickly m
Dossible so that with the benefit of advice I can then assess the appropriate
m m a m of action in respect of each of the different requests for disclosure
received.

         Dear M i s s .

         Re:    Release of W i t n e s s               Statements.

         Thank you for your                   letter of the 5th of November.         I am sorry about         the delay
         in replying.

         I note that you are restr ic tin g your request to w i t ne ss statements of your
         clients together w i t h those statements of w i t n e s s e s w h o have given a signed
         au th ority for release to a particular solicitor.

         Speaking for myself, I do not have any p a r t i c u l a r ob je cti on to copy
         statements of this nature being released to the solicitor concerned, though I
         must say that just at the moment, we may be p h y s i c a l l y unable to comply w i t h
         any requests.

         I suggest that if you can write to the West Midlands Police with the names of
         the people who you have in mind.  They will then look into the matter, and no
         doubt will deal with it as far as they can.


         Yours sincerely,

      Dear S tu a r t

      HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER
      REQUESTS FOR DISCLOSURE

      Thank you f o r your l e t t e r o f 16 November which I discussed in some d e t a i l
      with Superintendent Fell l a s t Friday.                   So as not to confuse, my f u r t h e r
      comments are r e l a t e d to p a r t i c u l a r paragraphs in your l e t t e r and f o r ease of
      r e fe r e n c e th e s e have been s u b - t i t l e d .

      Second Paragraph - Obligation to Disclose
      I can th in k o f no s i t u a t i o n s which might a r i s e to c r e a te an o b lig a tio n to
      d i s c l o s e o th e r than by order of th e c o u r t . As S t u a r t Sleeman p o in ts out,
      t h e r e i s no o b li g a tio n in c i v i l proceedings to d i s c l o s e u n til a f t e r the w r it
      has been issued. No c i v i l proceedings a f f e c t i n g any o f those who have so
      f a r requested information have been i n s t i t u t e d , th e r e f o r e no o b lig a tio n
      presently e x is ts .

      Third Paragraph - Civil Proceedings

      I am not aware of any c i v i l proceedings p r e s e n t l y underway in which
      d i s c lo s u r e would be required in th e circumstances s e t out in paragraph 3 of
      Mr Sleeman’ s advice. However, I t h i n k your question o f p r o p r ie t y i s r a t h e r
      put the wrong way round. P ro p rie ty in my view i s not in q u es tio n . I t would
      be proper i f you so choose to make any r e l e v a n t information a v a ila b l e to a
      p ro sp e c tiv e p a r t y to c i v i l proceedings in advance, even though t h i s is not
      o b l i g a t o r y . This i s on the b a s is t h a t most of the information e i t h e r in
      your possession or control i s not p u b lic i n t e r e s t immune. The q u a l i f i c a t i o n
      to t h i s p r o p o sitio n i s the dnmme n t a t io n a c q u ir ed       speci f i c a l l y   f or
      complaint s made by M                     e     s         s      r     s    k      n            d
                      which c l e a r l y is ’pu blic i n t e r e s t immune’ because i t has been
      acquired f o r t h a t purpose and no o t h e r .
Fifth Paragraph - Makanjuola
I tu rn now to th e Makanjuola case and the p erceived confusion concerning
public i n t e r e s t immunity from d is c lo s u r e of sta te m e n ts/e v id e n c e acquired fo r
the purposes of a complaints ag a in s t p o lic e .

As you q u ite r i g h t l y p o in t out, th e iss u e s in th e Makanjuola case were
considered by th e co u r t a f t e r the d i s c i p l i n a r y hearings but I do not
consider t h i s to be o f any import. The p r i n c i p l e s enunciated in e a r l i e r
case law and confirmed in Makanjuola apply i r r e s p e c t i v e of time.            If
statements have been taken f o r the purpose o f an i n v e s t i g a ti o n in to a
complaint, they are pu b lic i n t e r e s t immune. This includ es th e complainant’ s
own statement (a p a r t i c u l a r p oint decided by Makanjuola).

Many, i f not most complaints which are i n v e s t i g a t e d , will have a crime
component but th e case law supports the view t h a t where i t i s th e complaint
which    d riv e s th e i n v e s t i g a t i o n , public i n t e r e s t immunity a p p lies to
statem ents taken in th e course of i t .

Two statements from th e Judgment of L J Fox in th e Court of Appeal decision
in B la ir Peach in 1986 are i l l u s t r a t i v e of the way in which the courts t r e a t
complaints a g a i n s t p o li c e in determining whether p u b lic i n t e r e s t immunity is
a p p lic a b le .

The f i r s t quote was from Lord J Denning in th e e a r l i e r case of Neilson v
Laugharne when he d e a l t with th e nature of statem ents taken by po lic e in
t h a t case.            "Statements were taken on the b a s is t h a t they were to be used
f o r a p r i v a t e i n v e s t i g a t i o n , to see i f the Police had      acted improperly in
any way, and i f they had acted improperly, to be used in criminal or
d i s c i p l i n a r y proceedings a g a in s t th e p o l i c e . " I t i s noteworthy t h a t in t h a t
case, th e complaints r e l a t e d to t r e s p a s s , damage t o p rop erty, f a l s e a r r e s t ,
wrongful imprisonment and a s s a u l t ; th e r e f o r e th e i n v e s ti g a ti o n had t h i s
crime component.

L J Fox then went on to say in r e l a t i o n to Neilson v Laugharne "the present
case i s , in my view, e s s e n t i a l l y d i f f e r e n t in i t s n a tu r e . B l a i r Peach had
died a v i o l e n t death. I t was a m atter of p ublic concern to e s t a b l i s h the
cause o f his death and t h a t would have been so whether th e r e was a complaint
a g a in s t the p o li c e or n o t ."

That sta tem ent, i t seems to me, r e f l e c t s the p o s i t i o n in "Hillsborough"    with
which you are p r e s e n t l y g r a p p lin g . The decision to hold a j u d i c i a l enquiry
and subsequently a crim inal in v e s ti g a t i o n , was not taken because of the
complaints a g a in s t P o lic e . That i s why, in my opinion, th e sta tements taken
in th e course of those i n v e s t i g a ti o n s are not public i n t e r e s t immune,
d e s p i te the f a c t t h a t they were to be used f o r the purposes of the
complaints.

Let me t r y t o exemplify t h i s by use of another hypothetical s i t u a t i o n which
i s not wholly beyond th e bounds of p r o b a b i l i t y . I f a p r i s o n e r d ie s in his

     assessment, be subsumed in th e much more se rious enquiry in t o a death                                 in
     p o l i c e c e l l s . Any statements taken in t h a t connection would n o t, in                        my
     opinion, be public i n t e r e s t immune and t h e r e f o r e would be s u s c e p t i b l e            to
     d i s c lo s u r e in any subsequent c i v i l proceedings.

     Sixth Paragraph - Waiver of PubTic Interest Imunity
     There i s no power to waive p u b lic i n t e r e s t immunity and I cannot find
     anything in S t u a r t Sleeman’ s opinion which c o n f l i c t s with t h i s p r i n c i p l e .
     There i s no doubt whatsoever in t h i s area.

     I f th e r e are any oth er p o i n ts which a r i s e or you r e q u i r e                    further
     c l a r i f i c a t i o n , perhaps we can d is c u s s t h i s on the telephone. A l t e r n a t i v e l y ,
     I would be happy to v i s i t Headquarters to d isc u ss the is s u e s f u r t h e r with

              REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

              I refer to your letter of 16th November, 1990 in which you indicate your intention
              to make requests for copies of Statements.


              The policy on the release of information is as follows s-

              The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West Midlands Police
              back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
              In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
              were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.  Consequently the "ownership"
              of all the information gathered is vested in the Chief Constable of South
              Yorkshire Police.

              The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
              Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
              Police Complaints Authority), and. the Coroner. I now have to look to South
              Yorkshire Police, as owners of the information, for the policy in responding to
              your request.

             At the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
             release any information to any party until they have sought legal advice on the
             disclosure issues,  I suspect in due course on receiving legal advice they will
             direct me as to how to respond to your request and others.

              I ajr. sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained at the
              present time I mus t decli n e your request.


              Yours

 The stat e m e n t s m ade to the Wes t M i d l a n d s Poli ce wer e ma de fa i r l y
 close to the event and it is e x t r e m e l y help f u l to S o l i c i t o r s when
 t a k i n g de tails f r o m the ir cl ients to be able to use t h o s e s t atements
 to avoid u n n e c e s s a r y r e p e t i t i o n and m i n i m i s e th e trauma for th e
 particular c l i e n t .

 At an early stage d u r i n g th e Taylo r I n q u i r y we ask ed that clie n t s
 s t atements c ould be r e l eased to the S o l i c i t o r s ac t i n g for th e
 p a r t i c u l a r clients and that a u t h o r i t y was fr e e l y given.     Cop ie s of
 man y such stat e m e n t s have b een s u p p l i e d to S o l i c i t o r s and for the
 reasons set out above have b een e x t r e m e l y us e f u l in e s t a b l i s h i n g
 facts and m i n i m i s i n g trauma.

 W h e n the DPP came into the p i c t u r e and th e Wes t M i d l a n d s Pol ic e were
 answerable to h i m for very u n d e r s t a n d a b l e reasons thi s f a c i l i t y was
 withdrawn.

 W h e n the DPP had a n n o u n c e d his d e c i s i o n as far as c r i m i n a l p r o s e c u t i o n
 was c o n c e r n e d aSs we u n d e r s t a n d it the Wes t M i d l a n d s Pol ic e wer e the n
 once again o p e r a t i n g u nder the d i r e c t i o n of H M Coroner and I made
 a p p l i c a t i o n on behalf of the S o l i c i t o r s to the Coro n e r to res to re
 the p r e v i o u s p o s i t i o n w h e r e b y state m e n t s were supplied.

 As you will see from his lett er the Co roner has no o b j e c t i o n to the
 previou s p r a c t i c e b e i n g resu m e d but it appears f r o m Mr M e r v y n Jones'
 letter that t e c h n i c a l l y such s t atements are wi t h i n your 'ownership'
 and thus u ntil a u t h o r i t y comes not only f r o m the Coro n e r but also
 fro m you t hese state m e n t s must be withheld.

 I have w r i t t e n to you d i r e c t l y in case t h e r e is any m i s u n d e r s t a n d i n g
 as to the extent 6 f i n f o r mation w h i c h is r e q u e s t e d and th e rea so n
 for that r e q u e s t .

 As far as the extent of i n f o r m a t i o n is c o n c e r n e d that is r e s t r i c t e d
 to s t atements f r o m Soli c i t o r s own individual clients (those who were
 in jured or bereaved) and state m e n t s fro m w i t n e s s e s who hav e s u p p l i e d

Dear Madam

RE:    HILLSBOROUGH RELEASE OF CLIENTS' STATEMENTS

Thank you for your letter of 21 November 1990 concerning the release of
statements made in connection with the Hillsborough Enquiry.

I see from the copy correspondence you enclosed that HM Coroner has suggested
that you indicate more precisely the statements you have in mind.    It would
certainly be   helpful if an indication could be given as to which are the
statements of your clients and which are the statements of others.

Legal advice given to me ^uggergts that release of any of the material should
not occur at least while the inquests are in progress.   It may be that the
generality of this advice would be reconsidered in particular circumstances
but.de^ailed-information is needed before any departure from legal advice can
be             You   will, I know, well understand the issues involved   and the
necessity ofhaving a consistent policy in this area.

I am informed that HM Coroner has instructed that all persons giving evidence
before him who have made earlier statements may                    . This
would seem to be most helpful.

Yours faithfully
                                                                       I           i

HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - REQUEST FOR INFORMATION

I re fe r to y o ur le tte r of                                   in which you re q u e st a
copy
The policy on th e release of inform ation is as follows.

The Chief Constable of South Y orkshire Police invited th e West Midlands Police
back in A pril 1989 to u n d e rta k e th e investigation into th e H illsborough D isaster.
In fulfilling th is in v estig a to ry role th e West Midlands Police constitutionally were
actin g as th e ag en ts of South Y orkshire Police. C onsequently th e ’’ow nership” of
all th e inform ation g ath ered is v ested in th e Chief Constable of South Y orkshire
Police.
The policy on the release of inform ation h as variously been determ ined b y Lord
Ju stice T aylor, la te r th e D irector of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction w ith th e
Police Complaints A u th o rity ), an d th e C oroner.    I now have to look to South
Y orkshire Police, as ow ners of th e inform ation, fo r th e policy in respo nd ing to
y o u r re q u e st.
At th e p re s e n t time th e policy of th e South Y orkshire Police d irected to me is not
to release any inform ation to an y p a rty . T his is based on legal advice th a t th ey
have been given which indicates th a t inform ation should only be released on the

  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE

  I re fe r to y ou r le tte r dated 27 November 1990 in which you advise me of p ro g ress
  you have made tow ards identify in g y ou r policy on disclosure of inform ation. I am

  I have noted th e contents of y o u r second p a ra g ra p h in which you say you in ten d
  to follow th e legal advice and n ot to approve th e disclosure of any m aterial before
  th e completion of th e In q u e sts.

  I also note th a t if a C ourt of Law issues an in stru ctio n to release inform ation th en
  you would follow th a t cou rse. I note th a t direction includes an y th a t H M C oroner
  would make in th e circum stances.

  With re g a rd to th e mechanisms to be adopted to pro cess re q u e s ts , I would su g g e st

  In view of y o u r intention not to release any inform ation except on th e o rd e r of a

              With reference to the letter of 28 November 1990 from Deputy Chief
              Constable, Cheshire Constabulary on which you asked my views, there
              are two points for consideration.

              1.     Ownership - Although there is an assertion that 'ownership' of
                     the material is with South Yorkshire Police, that is an assertion
                     capable of challenge, While ever we do not have to assert it
                     I think we should not seek to deflect anyone's efforts to assert
                     it on our behalf.

              2.     If you agree the mechanics as suggested by Mr Jones you will be
                     kept in the dark as to the content of the requested material.
                     Your position will rest solely on legal advice.   If you obtained
                     a copy of the material subject of the request your greater
                     knowledge might lead you to vary the general decision perhaps
                     by obtaining further advice on the particular material. On the
                     other hand ignorance may be bliss.

        Dear Mr Anderson,

        Thank you for your letter of the 27th ultimo, the contents cnr wrrrx^n— r— n u u ^ r

        It may be that you are not aware of the way in which the SteeringCoimnittee
        operates.

        As Chairman of the Steering Committee I have no personal clients at all although
        some members of the Steering Committee do.

        We operate as a Co-Ordinating Body, to deal with general matters with the Insurers
        and Solicitors, to deal with test cases and joint representation where generic
        matters are concerned.

        The "clients" are clients of individual Solicitors who are members of the Group.
        Those clients are people who were either injured or bereaved as a result of

%       the Hillsborough Disaster and who are pursuing claims for damages for personal
        injury and loss sustained as a result of the tragedy.

        In any case of a claim for damages for personal injuries the individual making
        that claim has to establish the claim - i.e. the circumstances of the accident
        or incident giving rise to the claim for damages and also the injuries and
        loss sustained.

        The Insurance Companies will clearly not accept an unsubstantiated claim and
        this is entirely proper.

        As a result any Solicitor who is instructed has to take a very full statement
        from their own client in relation to the circumstances of the particular accident.
        In cases - such as road traffic accidents for example - where statements have
        been made by individuals to the Police when copies of those statements are
        made available upon request to the Solicitors acting for the particular individuals

        this has a double benefit.

    Firstly, because those statements were made at a time very close to the accident
    or incident they are likely to be more accurate than a reflection some months
    or even years after the accident.

    Secondly, particularly when one is dealing with an incident as traumatic as
    Hillsborough if the Solicitor can use a prior statement as an aid memoire for
    one client then the length of time needed to take a statement and the depth
    of the memory required is so much less.    As I indicated earlier medical reports
    also have to be obtained and clients have to see Psychiatrists where once again
    a reliving of the incident is made more painful if the statement made at the
    time is not available.

    As far as who are the clients concerned a Solicitor would have a duty to inform
    you or the West Midlands Police of the name and details of the client for whom
    they are acting and with whose authority they seek that statement.

    As far as the statements of witnesses are concerned we are not seeking disclosure
         a 1 1 witness statements (which would be the normal position in say a road

    accident case) but are limiting our request to the statements of individuals
    w h o give written and signed authority to the Solicitor concerned for the release
    of their statement.

    It is impossible for me to say - as there are something well over 1,000 cases
    still outstanding - precisely who those individual witnesses would be, but
    they are most likely to be friends or acquaintances of the injured client who
    were also at the ground on the 1.5th April 1989 and who had given a statement
    to the Police.

    I note that the Coroner is allowing all witnesses who are called before him
    to refresh their memories by reading their statements before called. It is
    simply to refresh the memories of clients and witnesses before their Solicitor
    or medical consultant takes a history that we wish access to those statements.

    In many cases the civil claims will be met and finalised before the Inquest
    is concluded and of course during the time that the investigation was under
    the control of Lord Justice Taylor statements of the client we are now requesting
    were made available.

    I trust this assists you and look forward to hearing from you that authority
    will be given for statements to be provided.

    All good wishes.    Yours sincerely,
                                                              ACC{DftC)/KIH

                                                            5 December 1990

             DISASTER - RBQOBST FOR DISCLOSURE

Thank you for your letter of 28 November 1990, and the draft response to
persons requesting statements obtained for the inquiry.  We wonder if you
would be prepared to slightly alter paragraph 2 by virtue of the deletion
of the final sentence commencing "Consequently. . .”?

We feel that the word 'ownership* could create an assertion capable of
challenge and while ever we do not have to assert it, it may be better not
to seek to deflect anyone's efforts to assert it on our behalf. I hope you
agree.

Thank you for your consideration.

     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE




     Thank you for your response of 5th December 1990, in respect of my letter of 28th
     November, 1990.

     Of course I have no objections to the modification you request to mv draft, for
     all said ana done it is technically "your’ letter.

     Furthermore, in view of the change you have requested, would it be appropriate in
     the penultimate line of the third paragraph to change "owners" to "principals"?

     I look forward to your response.

 RE MR

 I refer to the above named and your request for a copy of a statement made

 In view of the current criminal investigation taking place under the

REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

I refer to your letter of        in which you request a copy
of

The policy on the release of information is as follows

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West Midlands Police
back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.

The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
Police Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.  I now have to look to South
Yorkshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in responding
to your request.

At the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
release any information to any party.  This is based on legal advice that has been
given which indicates that information should only be released on the order of a
Court which could include that of the Coroner.

I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained at the
present time I must decline your request.

Yours




S BEECHEY

             Dear Mr Anderson,

             Further to my letter of the 4th instant I look forward to hearing from you
             with substantive reply.

             In the meantime I received a letter from Mr Mervyn Jones of the 11th December
             to say that at the present time the policy of the South Yorkshire Police
             directed to him is not to release any information to any party. He said
             in his letter that this was based on legal advice that had been given which
             indicates that information should only be released on the order of a court
             which could include that of a Coroner.

             As you may know I was present at the Inquests yesterday the 19th instant
             (as our Counsel was unavailable that day) and did make a formal application
             to the Coroner setting out the restricted release of witness statements
             as detailed in our correspondence namely :-

             1•         Statements of any individual client to be released to that
                        client1s own Solicitor and

             2.         Release to individual Solicitors acting for a particular injured
                        or bereaved person of a statement made by a witness provided
                        that witness authorised its release to that Solicitor, that
                        authority being in writing and signed.

             The Coroner indicated that he could see no objection in principal to such
             release and that had he the power to make such an order he clearly would
             have done so. He expressed the view that his powers did not extend to those
             who suffered injury only but the clear indication was that certainly for
             his purposes there was no requirement to restrict the release of copy
             statements on the limited basis set out above.

             We would be grateful if in the circumstances you would put this letter before
             your legal advisor to reconsider the matter. I look forward to hearing
             from you that release is now authorised.

                C/ tnd




                I may say in passing that the application was made at the conclusion of
                the Inquests but at a time when all the various Police Officers and the
                Police Authority legal representatives (in connection with the Inquests)
                were present and that there was no substantive points put in in opposition.

                In practical terms T appreciate that the only question which is still
                outstanding (and which does not affect the clients of our Group at all)
                is the question of any internal disciplinary proceedings which the Authority
                may be considering against any of the officers concerned.

                With respect I would be surprised in view of the number of witnesses which
                have already been called in open hearings before fetae Lord Justice Taylor
                and Dr Popper if the release of a statement of an individual fan or fans
                present on the day would be in anyway prejudicial tosuch a decision and/or
                hearing if and when it takes place.

                I look forward to hearing from you and trust that we will not     have tomake
                a further application to the High Court to obtain anorder in respect of
                a matter which, although relatively minor, is of considerable importance
                to a number of those affected by the Hillsborough tragedy.

                I look forward to hearing from you.

                All good wishes.

                Yours sincerely.

    To:      Assistant Chief Constable, Mr Anderson            Date:       20 December 1990



            SUBJECT:      APPLICATION FOR RELEASE OF WITNESS STATEMENTS.




            I would report     that on 19 December 1990,     at the conclusion of       the
            Hillsborough Inquest. and in the absence of     the Jury, Counsel for       the
            bereaved,               made  application beforethe Coroner, Mr Popper,     for
            the release orcertalin statements which were believed to be under           the
            control of the South Yorkshire Police.

            The request was for the release of statements made by
            clients, together with any statements where written authority is obtained
            prior to the release of the documents.

            The Coroner replied that in principle he could not see any good reason why
            he should object to the application, but referring to the Blair Peach
            case, accepted that his powers were limited on this particular issue.

            Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police, Mr Payne, made representation
            stating that whilst he would not want to be obstructive, the proper way to
            resolve this matter was for a written request be made to the South
            Yorkshire Police, setting out the reasons for wanting those statements.

            Mr Popper summed up by saying that while he was doubtful as to whether he
            had authority to order release of any statements, he- could not see any
            good reason why the statements should not be released and if he had the
            authority he would excercise it in favour of

            I am aware that the South Yorkshire Police are already in possession of
            correspondence    from                Chamber,  requesting  release  of
            statements.    This report, together with a transcript of
            application, is submitted for your attention prior to a further written
            request from




            Detective Chief Inspector,

                   It is not an application in relation to
witnesses, but there is a matter and I was hoping to speak
to Mr. Metcalfe before I raised it with you.    I raised it
wit h him directly and it is in relation to the release of
statements which are, I think, within your purview and
that of the South Yorkshire Police.

     As you know we act not only for the bereaved who are
here today but also as a steering committee for solicitors
acting for the injured and bereaved involved at
Hillsborough.   I don't know if you would take this
application now, but when Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry
was on we made an application that the statements which
were made to the Uest Midlands Police were made available
to the solicitors acting for those individual clients.
The reason for this is straightforward.   It was a
distressing time for all of them.   The statements were
made close to the time and it saves worry, anxiety and
problems being exacerbated, particularly in relation to
medical evidence as well.

     When the matter came into the DPP's control, very
properly that freedom of access to clients  individual
statements stopped.   I understand that those statements
are now effectively the South Yorkshire Police and under
your control and that of the South Yorkshire Police.   I
have been making application to see whether we could have
the same facilities, which are not intended in any way to
run contrary to these Inquests or to prejudice them in any
respect, but limited purely to the statements which
clients have made being released to their solicitors.
Also if there are witness statements where the witness
gives his authority in writing, very often friends who
have been with the people, that those statements could be
released through the West Midlands Police to the
solicitors concerned.
     THE CORONER:   Just to make sure I have got this
right.  What you are asking me is where, for instance, you
were representing a particular person, and there is a
statement of that person somewhere in the system...

                   That's right,   sir.

     THE CORONER:   ...and you would like to see it, or
your client would like to see it, it is those statements?

                   It is those statements.

     THE CORONER:   Plus any statements where people
authorise in writing their release?

                   Yes, indeed.   One would not seek and
would not asK tor general statements, but the object of it
is to try to relieve problems, anxieties and re-living the
events more than is necessary.




            THE CORONER:    Is there anybody
                                                 69




     THE CORONER: Is there anybody who wants to say
anything on that to me?

     MR. ISAACS:  Just so that I can understand fully,
what I understand my friend to be asking for are those
statements of clients of hers, let us say.

       THE CORONER: Yes,   just for the sake of brevity.

     MR. ISAACS:  And those statements of people who
have given her authority to ask for copies of those
statements.  In those circumstances, certainly I do
not object and I do not think that one would have good
cause to object.  Those people are clearly entitled to
see copies of the statements they have made some time
ago, but on that basis and that basis only.

     THE CORONER: I understand.     That is exactly what
you are asking for, is it not?

                   That is exactly what I am asking
for.   Those are the limits, sir.

     THE CORONER: Is there anybody else who wants to
say anything on this?  I think the only thing that I
can say is insofar as it relates to people who were
injured, as opposed to have died, I have got no
authority at all, I am sure you will appreciate that.

                   Yes sir.

     THE CORONER: Even if I wished to give authority,
I cannot, because my powers are limited, and I am sure
you understand that.

                   Yes.

     THE CORONER: With regard to the rest of it, in
principle I cannot see any good reason why I should
object to what you have said.  I am in a slight
difficulty because, as you know, I think it is the
Blair Peach case, where the powers of coroners to
release statements other than those which either he
took himself or alternatively which have been used in
the evidence is dealt with, but it seems to me that in
principle I would not object to such a release.
Whether they should be released via West Midlands, or
whether they come here from another source, I am not
too concerned about.

                   Thank you very much,   sir.

     THE CORONER: That is on the basis which you have
described.  The only other comment I would make is
remember that even if we are only talking about named
individuals, we may be talking about a lot of people
and logistically it may not be as easy as it sounds.

                       The facility was granted for a short
periocT,

      THE CORONER: Yes.

     MR. PAYNE:  I have not risen because personally I
am taken by surprise by this application, and I have
tried to take instructions from Mr. Metcalf but it is
not entirely clear exactly what we are being asked to
do, or exactly what statements are being referred to.
I am rather doubtful about what powers there are, no
disrespect of course to    — C!1'r -— to comply with any
sort of application t h a t i s            making.  We do
not want to be obstructive at all, but I think the
only proper way to deal with this is if
would let us have in writing exactly whatever it is
that she thinks we have got and then we will consider
it.  We do not want to be difficult.

                  I think it may be helpful if Mr.
Payne and I speak afterwards, but just to make it
clear, there has been correspondence and the request
has been made in writing to the South Yorkshire Police
with the reasons, but I will certainly expand on them.

     THE CORONER:  Mr. Payne, as I have said, I have
already mentioned Blair Peach and I am very conscious
that there is a limit to my authority and, in that
sense, I have got doubts as to how effect an order of
mine would be if I were to order somebody to release a
statement.  What I am trying to say is that as far as
I as Coroner am concerned, on the basis as you have :
described it, I personally can see no objection to it.
If it turns out that there are legal objections to it
which are sustainable, then of course that will be a
matter which might have to be resolved in another
place.  I am merely expressing, if you like, my view
that (a) I am doubtful whether I have the authority to
order the release, and (b) with that caveat I cannot
see any good reason why not.   If I had the authority,
I would exercise it in your favour.

                       I am very much obliged.

      THE CORONER:     Does that help?

        ____________   Yes it does,   that is of great
a s s i stance.
     THE CORONER: It is a difficult problem this, as
you know.  If I were a High Court Judge sitting in a
Divisional Court somewhere I would know my powers in
this respect rather more clearly, but it is an
anomalous position, particularly in these Inquests
because the way the statements were prepared and
gathered in the beginning does create quite a lot of
technical difficulties as to their status.

                     Yes, I very much appreciate that,
and dj.au, aa j.l virere, the statements have passed from
purpose to purpose, over the last 18 months.

     THE CORONER:   That is right, yes.

                  As I say, at one time they were
certainly released without question by Lord Justice
Taylor.  Some have got them, some have not, and that
is where we are at the moment.

     THE CORONER:   I understand.

Dear Madam

Thank you for your letter of 20 December 1990. As I have previously indicated
the matter has been referred for legal advice. In order to aid consideration
of this question I should be grateful if you would forward details of the names
of the makers of the statements concerned.

You will recall I requested this information in my letter of 27 November 1990
Mid you replied to say that it was impossible for you to supply these details.
I wonder if that position has now been modified and the specific information
can now be made available by you. Proa the transcript of the proceedings
before HM Coroner it seems to be suggested that these statements are indeed
of clients of yours and those who have given you written authority. I see
that Mr Payne also asked for specifics. Have you now supplied the details
to him please?

Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Anderson,

Thank you for your letter of the 27th ultimo, the contents of which I note.

I thought that I had made my position clear both to the Coroner and to you.
I am Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hillsborough Solicitors Group.
The Hillsborough Solicitors Group consists of a number of firms who have been
instructed on an individual basis by individuals in connection with claims
arising as a result of the incident at Hillsborough.

At its height there were some 150 Solicitors firms throughout the country in
the Hillsborough Solicitors Group. As claims have been settled some firms
no longer have an interest and therefore are not part of the Group on the
other hand new claims are still being put forward and new Solicitor members
of the Group are still joining - although on a more limited basis after
this length of time.

The individual clients of each Solicitor are both known to that individual
Solicitor and recorded on computer by us.   We do not retain details of
each individual claim - i.e. whether it is for physical injury, psychological
injury and whether the injuries sustained are large or small - the names only
are recorded.

Over the time since Hillsborough there have been well over 1,000 - and probably
approaching 1500 individual clients.     Some of those have now settled their
claims and Solicitors have notified us when a claim has been settled so that
the computer record can be adjusted accordingly.  As no doubt some people will
not have notified us when the claims are settled the computer record is not
infalible.

In some cases the statements made by individual clients to the West Midlands
Police have already been provided to that client's individual Solicitor during
the period that this procedure was in force - i.e. for the duration of the
Taylor Inquiry and the period upto the decision of Peter Wright to refer the
matter to the DPP to consider whether any criminal proceedings should be taken.

Whereas I could supply you with a copy of the computer printout and thus to
identify the names of individuals whose statements might be required this would

 not be a definitive list.

 WHat I did indicate to the Coroner is that the individual Solicitors would write
 in respect of a particular client and thus that that name would be identified
 at that stage.

 I trust that this clears the position and look forward to hearing from you
 on the substantive points.

 Yours sincerely,

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

As you know , th e policy on th is su b ject h as been decided b y y o u , th e South
Y orkshire Police, and I am now c a rry in g it o u t. However, on th e la s t day of
th e In q u ests before C hristinas,                 who re p re se n ts th e HiUsbourugh
S teerin g Committee, made application to th e C oroner fo r release of statem ents.

The tra n s c rip ts of w hat was said and th e C oroner's rep ly is a tta ch e d .

The C oroner h as asked me to w rite to you and ask if th e South York sh ire
Police in ten d to review th e ir policy of n o n-release in th e lig h t of what b oth
      and th e C oroner have said on th is su b je ct.

I look forw ard to y o u r resp o n se on th is m atter.     In th e meantime I will maintain
y o u r policy of n o n -d isclo su re.

  PLEASE REPLY TO THE OFFICE A T                 Chester
but it is ray position that if it appears to somebody that
a witness has been left out, or would appear to be crucial
and I ought to consider that witness, then I am quite
willing to listen to it.      Indeed, I will be taking stock
as well of the list, so to speak, and it may well be that
I will be revising it both upwards or downwards as 1 think
in the light of the evidence because to a certain extent
there are so many witness.      We could go on indefinitely
in fact*    One has to take stock and look, but no, I don t
intend the cut-off    to be...    It is very similar to the
3 1 5 cut-off*   It isa marker but it is intended with
s m e flexibility around it, some oscillation perhaps would
be the right word.


                    it is not an application in relation to
witnesses, but w e r e is a matter and I was hoping to
to Mr. Metcalfe before I raised it with you.     I raised it
kith him directly and it is in relation to the release
statements which are, 1 think, within your purview and
that of the South Yorkshire Police.

      As you know we act not only for          b e r e a v e d  who are
here today but also as a steering committee for solicitors
acting for the injured and bereaved involved at
Hillsborough.         I d o n ’t know                         Eq u i t y
anDlication n o w • but when Lord Justice Taylor                       ^
SSs o f i e S a d S i n application that the statements which
were made to the West Midlands Police were made availa
 to the solicitors acting for those individual clients.
The reason for this is straightforward*           It was a
distressing time for ail of them.         Tha ’ tatemants were
made close to the time and it saves worry,                        and
problems being exacerbated, particularly in rel
 medical evidence as w e l l .

       When the matter came into the DPP *s control, varjr
 properly that freedom                        t h a ^ o s e ’statements

     THE CORONER:   Just to make sure I have got this
right*  What you are asking me is where, for instance, you
were representing a particular person, and there is a
statement of that person somewhere in the system..*

                      That's right, sir.

     THE CORONER:   ...and you would like to see it, or
your client would like to see it, it is those statements?

                      It is those statements.

     THE CORONER:   Plus any statements where people
authorise in writing their release?

                   Yes, indeed.         One would not seek and
would not ask tor general s t a t e m e n t s . b u t the object of it
is to try to relieve problems, anxieties and re-living tne
events more than is necessary.




                THE CORONERJ      Is there anybody
     THE CORONER: Is there anybody who wants to say
anything on that to me?

     MR, ISAACS:  Just so that I can understand fully,
what I understand my friend to be asking for are those
statements of clients of hers, let us say,

       THE CORONER: Yes, just for the sake of brevity,

     MR. ISAACS:  And those statements of people who
have given her authority to ask for copies of those
statements.  In those circumstances, certainly I do
not object and I do not think that one would have good
cause to object.  Those people are clearly entitled to
see copies of the statements they have made some time
ago, but on that basis and that basis only.

     THE CORONER: I understand.    That is exactly what
you are asking for, is it not?

                    That is exactly what I am asking
for.    rnose are the limits, sir.

     THE CORONER: Is there anybody else who wants to
say anything on this?  I think the only thing that I
can say is insofar as it relates to people who were
injured, as opposed to have died, I have got no
authority at all, I am sure you will appreciate that.

                    Yes sir.

     THE CORONER: Even if I wished to give authority,
I cannot, because my powers are limited, and I am sure
you understand that.

                    Yes.

     THE CORONER: With regard to the rest of it, in
principle I cannot see any good reason why I should
object to what you have said.  I am in a slight
difficulty because, as you know, I think it is the
Blair Peach case, where the powers of coroners to
release statements other than those which either he
took himself or alternatively which have been used in
the evidence is dealt with, but it seems to me that in
principle I would not object to such a release.
Whether they should be released via West Midlands, or
whether they come here from another source, I am not
too concerned about.

                    Thank you very much, sir.

     THE CORONER: That is on the basis which you have
described.  The only other comment I would make is

          remember that even i f we are only t a l k i n g about named
          individuals, we may be talking about a lot of people
          and logistically it may not be as easy as it sounds.

                              The facility was granted for a short
  B
          peri

                 THE CORONER: Yes.

               MR. PAYNE:  I have not risen because personally I
          am taken by surprise by this application, and I have
          tried to take instructions from Mr. Metcalf but it is
          not entirely clear exactly what we are being asked to
          do, or exactly what statements are being referred to.
          I am rather doubtful about what powers there are, no
          disrespect of course to you, sir, to comply with any
          sort of application that Miss Steel is making.  We do
          not want to be obstructive at all, but I think the
          only proper way to deal with this is if Miss Steel
          would let us have in writing exactly whatever it is
          that she thinks we have got and then we will consider
          it.  We do not want to be difficult.

                                I think it may be helpful if Mr.
          Payne ana i s p e a k afterwards, but just to make it
          clear, there has been correspondence and the request
          has been made in writing to the South Yorkshire Police
          with the reasons, but I will certainly expand on them.

                THE CORONER:   Mr. Payne, as I have said, I have
          already mentioned Blair Peach and I am very conscious
          that there is a limit to my authority and, in that
          sense, I have got doubts as to how effect an order of
          mine would be if I were to order somebody to release a
          statement.    What I am trying to say is that as far as
          I as Coroner am concerned, on the basis as you have
          described it, I personally can see no objection to it.
          If it turns out that there are legal objections to it
          which are sustainable, then of course that will be a
          matter which might have to be resolved in another
          place,    I am merely expressing, if you like, my y iew
          that (a) I am doubtful whether I have the authority to
          order the release, and (b) with that caveat I cannot
           see any good reason why not.    If I had the authority*
           I would exercise it in your favour.

                                I am very much obliged.

                  THE CORONER: Does that help?

                                Yes it does,   that is of great
           assistance.

                    THE CORONER: It is a difficult problem this, as
               you know.  If I were a High Court Judge sitting in a
               Divisional Court somewhere 1 would know my powe rs in
               this respect rather more clearly, but it is an
       1       anomalous position* particularly in these Inquests
               because the way the statements were prepared and
               gathered in the beginning does create quite a lot of
               technical difficulties as to their s tatu s.

                                   Yes, I very much appreciate that.
               and              Were, the statements have passed from
               purpose to pu rpos e, over the last 18 m o n t h s ,

                     THE CORONER: That is r i g h t , yes,

                                  As I say, at one time they were

  Dear Stuart

  HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - REQUEST FOR DISCLOSURE

  Thank you for your letter of 20 and 28 December enclosing various recent
  correspondence touching upon requests for the release of statements
  concerning the Hillsborough inquiries and I apologise for the delay in
  replying,

  I have given very careful consideration to all of the documents and I cannot
  see anything in them which effects the advice contained in the opinion of Mr
  Stuart SIleeman of Counsel. In my respectful view the advice contained in
  the opinion holds as good now as it did then. In these circumstances it is
  quite proper for you or Mervyn Jones on your behalf, to continue to refuse
  to disclose statements, and for that matter other information in the terms
  of the pro-forma letter which you enclosed with your letter to me of 14
  December.

  Having said all that, I note from your letter of the 27 December to Miss
  Steele you asked for further information to aid consideration of the legal
  position and it may be you will consider it appropriate to await a reply, if
  you have not already had one, to that letter before firming-up on your
  appropriate stance on these requests.

  I have spoken to you previously about a request for information from
  solicitors acting for Mr             jnder your reference
  In confirmation I consider it would be appropriate for all requests to be
  dealt with by you or Mervyn Jones on your behalf and therefore I have not
  seen fit to respond directly to Mr          solicitors. No doubt you will
  npif do so.

         Dear Acting Chief Superintendent Fell

         HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER - REQUESTS FOR DISCLOSURE

         I think it is appropriate to confirm in writing our telephone discussion
         this morning. Chief Inspector Brooke of the Force, telephoned to tell me
         that Mr Payne, the Counsel who is acting for the Force at the inquests, has
         n o \s r \ A + r\ U a    I _ r _ n     ■  ■ I            I . . . J.   . 7
         asked to be kept informed of all requests by[                          Ml^
                                                                   of the Steering
         Committee for disclosure of statements etc and also to know the stance that
         is being taken by the Force.

        On 7 January I did write to Mr Metcalfe the Solicitor with Messrs Hammond
        Suddards who are also representing the Force at the inquests, to tell him
        that Counsel’s advice had been sought on this issue and an opinion had been
        obtained from Mr Stuart Sleeman. Mr Metcalfe now has a copy of that
        opinion. I went on to tell him that all requests for disclosure had been
        met with the following statement

                 "At the present time the police of South Yorkshire Police is not to
                 release any information to any party. This is based on any legal
                 advice that has been given which indicates that information should only
                 be released on the order of a court which could include that of the
                 coroner".

        I now understand from you that further information has been received from
                   Jfhich is under consideration and not until this has been
        completed will it be known whether the previous stance of the Force will be
        maintained. However, in the meantime, as Mr Payne is representing the Force
        at the inquests, and I have no doubt the coroner and all other
        representatives there regard him as having that capacity, it is, in my view,

Hillsborough Steering Committee

Castle Chambers

Dear




Having received further advice I am writing in response to your letter

of 2 January 1991-   I note your remarks about the makeup of the

Hillsborough Steering Committee and the difficulties you personally would

experience in providing specific details of the statements       that you seek

but I do feel that the individual solicitors involved must       have the

information regarding their particular clients readily available.

Consequently it ought to be fairly easy for them to supply this

information and if this were used to update the computer record       this might

be helpful to us in our deliberations.




You will be aware, I think, that only a minority of the material gathered

following the tragedy is in the possession and control of South Yorkshire
Police at this time.          Eventually the m a t e ria l will come to Police

H e a dq uar ter s   at S hef f i e l d but at this juncture we ourselves do not have

access to it apart from copies of those statements                that were used for

the enquiry by Lor d Justice T a y l o r and some that relate to the complaint

investigation.




In any event,        the legal advice I am given indicates that none of the

ma t er ial is subject to d i s c ov ery at present.       I propose    to follow this

advice while the inquest is in progress and questions of p ossible criminal

and d i sci pli nar y procee din gs remain.




I wo uld anticipate that there aft er any p a rti cul ar request from any source

w o uld be consider ed as to the purpose for w h i c h the m ate r i a l was required,

the legal implications of disclosure and so forth.                 Be assured that this

will be done w i t h the greatest of sympathy and bearing in m i n d all that

you say wi th regard to m i n i m i s i n g un necessary trauma.




I hope you wi ll find what I have said helpful.               I emphatically am not

seeking to be obstructive but clearly have to have regar d to the legal

advice that I am given.          I am forwarding copies of this correspondence

to Deputy C h i e f C onstable M e r v y n Jones,   Step he n W a l k e r and to Peter

Dear Sir,


REQUEST FOR THE RELEASE OF INFORMATION

I refer to your letter dated 22nd January 1991, concerning your client
         and the request for a copy of his statement.

The policy on the release of information is as follows

The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police invited the West Midlands Police
back in April 1989 to undertake the investigation into the Hillsborough Disaster.
In fulfilling this investigatory role the West Midlands Police constitutionally
were acting as the agents of South Yorkshire Police.

The policy on the release of information has variously been determined by Lord
Justice Taylor, later the Director of Public Prosecutions (in conjunction with the
Police Complaints Authority), and the Coroner.  I now have to look to South
Yorkshire Police, as principals of the information, for the policy in responding
to your request.

At the present time the policy of South Yorkshire Police directed to me is not to
release any information to any party.  This is based on legal advice that has been
given which indicates that information should only be released on the order of a
court which could include that of the Coroner.

I am sorry I cannot be any more helpful at the moment and as explained at the
present time I must decline your request.

Yours faithfully,




 J. Mervyn JONES,
 Deputy Chief Constable.

The position is now reached where the draft I prepared has been
considered by you mid amended on the advice of Mr Metcalf,

 The "Metcalf draft" {incidentally I think the alteration in paragraph
 2 from "none" to "only a minority" is worthy of further consideration)
 has now been considered by Mr Walker and the "Walker draft" now is to
 hand.

 It is not clear why Mr Walker has altered the wording as he has but
 judgement decisions need to be made.

 You may:   1.    Accept the Walker draft - he is your legal adviser.

            2.    Alter the Walker draft.   If you do then you are going
                  against legal advice.

 DRAFT LETTER

Dear

Having received further advice I am writing in response to your letter of 2

January 1991.    I note your remarks about the make-up of the Hillsborough

Steering Committee and the difficulties you personally would experience in

providing specific details of the statements that you seek but I do feel

that the individual solicitors Involved must have the information regarding

their particular clients readily available.   Consequently it ought to be

fairly easy for them to supply this information and 1 f this w«*re used to

update the computer record this might be helpful to us in our deliberations.



You will be aware I think that only a minority of the material gathered

following the tragedy is in the possession of South Yorkshire Police at this

time.   The remainder is with the West Midlands Police and there is serious

doubt in my mind that such material can properly be said to be under the

control of South Yorkshire Police so that I am capable of authorising its
'9 1 01/31 10:35      © 0226-730442             S. Y.   J. S.




  disclosure.      Eventually the material will come to Police HQ at Sheffield but

  at this juncture the only parts to which we have access are copies of those

  statements that were used for the inquiry of Lord Justice Taylor and some

  that relate to the complaints investigation.



  You will of course be aware that questions of possible criminal and

  disciplinary proceedings still remain and will do so until after the

  inquests.   Until these have been completely resolved I would not wish to

  take any action that might be criticised later as having prejudiced any

  subsequent proceedings.     I hope you will readily appreciate the dilemma in

  which I find myself and in these circumstances I consider it proper to rely

  on the legal advice I have received which is that none of the material is

  subject to discovery at the present time.



  I would anticipate that after these outstanding questions have been resolved

  any particular request from any source would be considered on its merits

  taking into account the purpose for which the material is required, the

  legal implications of disclosure etc.     Be assured this will be done with the

 greatest of sympathy and bearing in mind all that you say in regard to

 minimising unnecessary trauma.



 I hope you will find what I have said helpful.         I emphatically am not

 seeking to be obstructive but in the circumstances outlined above I clearly

 have to have regard to the legal advice I am given.            I am forwarding copies

 of this correspondence to Deputy Chief Constable Mervyn Jones, Stephen

 Walker and Peter Metcalf for their information.

 Yours etc

Dear M&daiii
       •' /




Having received further advice I am writing in response tfr^youjy letter

of 2 January 1991-    I note your remarks about the makeup of the
                                                                  «
Hillsborough Steering Committee and the difficulties you personally would

experience in providing specific details of the statements that you seeky

but I do feel that the individual solicitors involved must have the

information regarding their particular clients readily available.

Consequently it ought to be fairly easy for them to supply this

information and if this were used to update the computer record this might

be helpful to us in our deliberations.




You will be aware, I think, thattaese of the material gathered following

the tragedy is in the possession and control of South Yorkshire Police

at this time,   if'ts— fee-be-anticipated that .eventually the material will

come to Police Headquarters at Sheffield but at this juncture we ourselves

do not have access to it apart from copies of those statements that were

used for the enquiry by Lord Justice Taylor and some that relate to the

complaint investigation.




Legal advice tjiart I am given indicates that none of the material should

be-disclosed-end I propose to follow this advice while aver the inquest

is in progress and questions of possible criminal and disciplinary

proceedings remain.
I would anticipate that thereafter any particular request from any source

would be considered as to the purpose for which the material was required,

the legal implications of disclosure and so forth.   Be assured that this

will be done with the greatest of sympathy and bearing in mind all that

you say with regard to minimising unnecessary trauma.




I hope you will find what I have said helpful.   I emphatically am not

seeking to be obstructive but clearly have to have regard to the legal

advice that I am given.   I am forwarding copies of this correspondence

to Deputy Chief Constable Mervyn Jones, Stephen Walker and to Peter

Metcalf for their information.




Yours faithfully

Dear Mr Anderson,

 Thank you for your letter of the 27th ultimo, the contents of which I note.

 I thought that I had made my position clear both to the Coroner and to you.
 I am Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hillsborough Solicitors Group.
 The Hillsborough Solicitors Group consists of a number of firms who have been
 instructed on an individual basis by individuals in connection with claims
 arising as a result of the incident at Hillsborough.

 At its height there were some 150 Solicitors firms throughout the country in
 the Hillsborough Solicitors Group. As claims have been settled some firms
 no longer have an interest and therefore are not part of the Group on the
 other hand new claims are still being put forward and new Solicitor member^
 of the Group are still joining - although on a more limited basis after
 this length of time.

 The individual clients of each Solicitor are both known to that individual
 Solicitor and recorded on computer by us.   We do not retain details of
 each individual claim — i.e. whether it is for physical injury, psychological
 injury and whether the injuries sustained are large or small - the names only
 are recorded.

 Over the time since Hillsborough there have been well over 1,000 - and probably
 approaching 1500 individual clients.     Some of those have now settled their
 claims and Solicitors have notified us when a claim has been settled so that
 the computer record can be adjusted accordingly.  As no doubt some people will
 not have notified us when the claims are settled the computer record is not
 infalible.

 In some cases the statements made by individual clients to the West Midlands
 Police have already been provided to that client's individual Solicitor during
 the period that this procedure was in force - i.e. for the duration of the
 Taylor Inquiry and the period upto the decision of Peter Wright to refer the
 matter to the DPP to consider whether any criminal proceedings should be taken.

 Whereas I could supply you with a copy of the computer printout and thus to
 identify the names of individuals whose statements might be required this would

 not be a definitive list.

 WHat 1 did indicate to the Coroner is that the individual Solicitors would write
 in respect of a particular client and thus that that name would be identified
 at that stage.

 I trust that this clears the position and look forward to hearing from you
 on the substantive points.

 Yours sincerely,

Dear

Having received further advice I mb writing in response to your letter of 2
January 1991* I note your remarks about the makeup of the Hillsborough
Steering Committee and the difficulties you personally would experience in
providing specific details of the stateaents that you seek but I do feel that
the individual solicitors Involved must have the information regarding their
particular clients readily available. Consequently it ought to be fairly easy
for them to supply this information and if this were used to update the
computer record this sight be helpful to us in our deliberations.

You will be aware, I think, that only a minority of the material gathered
following the tragedy is in the possession of South Yorkshire Police at this
time* The remainder is with the West Midlands Police and there is serious
doubt in my mind that such material can properly be said to be under the
control of South Yorkshire Police so that I am capable of authorising its
disclosure. Eventually the material will come to Police Headquarters at
Sheffield but at this juncture the only parte to which we have access are
copies of those statements that were used for the inquiry of Lord Justice
Taylor and some that relate to the complaints investigation.

You will of course be aware that questions of possible criminal and
disciplinary proceedings still remain and will do so until after the inquests.
Until these have been completely resolved I would not wish to take any action
that might be criticised later as having prejudiced any subsequent proceedings.
I hope you will readily appreciate the dilemma in which X find myself and in
these circumstances I consider it proper to rely on the legal advice I have
received which is that none of the material is subject to discovery at the
present time.


                                                               Continued . . .

I hope you will find what I have said helpful. I emphatically am not seeking

          The position is now reached where the draft I prepared has been
          considered by you and amended on the advice of Mr Metcalf.

          The "Metcalf draft" (incidentally I think the alteration in paragraph
          2  from "none" to "only a minority" is worthy of further consideration)
          has now been considered by Mr Walker and the "Walker draft" now is to
          hand.

           It is not clear why Mr Walker has altered the wording as he has but
           judgement decisions need to be made.

           You may:   1.     Accept the Walker draft - he is your legal adviser.

                      2.     Alter the Walker draft.        If you do then you are going
                             against legal advice.

 DRAFT LETTER

 Hillsborough Steering Committee
 Castle Chambers
 Cook Street
 LIVERPOOL
 L2 9SH
 Dear

 Having received further advice 1 am writing in response to your letter of 2
 January      1991.      1 note your remarks about the make-up of the Hillsborough
 Steering Committee and the difficulties you personally would experience in
 providing specific details of the statements that you seek but I do feel
 that the individual solicitors Involved must have the information regarding
 their particular clients readily available.           Consequently it ought to be
 fairly easy for them to supply this information and 1f this were used to
 update the computer record this might be helpful, to us in our deliberations,


You will be aware I think that only a minority of the material gathered
following the tragedy is in the possession of South Yorkshire Police at this
time.       The remainder is with the West Midlands Police and there is serious
doubt in my mind that such'material can properly be said to be under the
control of South Yorkshire Police so that 1           am capable   of authorising its
disclosure.     Eventual!}' the material will come to Police HQ at Sheffield but
at this juncture the only parts to which we have access are copies of those
statements that were used for the inquiry of Lord Justice Taylor and some
that relate to the complaints investigation.


You will of course be aware that questions of possible criminal and
disciplinary proceedings still remain and will do so until after the
inquests,     Until these have been completely resolved I would not wish to
take any action that might be criticised later as having prejudiced any
subsequent proceedings,     1 hope you will readily appreciate the dilemma In
which I find myself and In these circumstances I consider it proper to rely
on the legal advice 1 have received which is that none of the material is
subject to discovery at the present time.


I would anticipate that after these outstanding questions have been resolved
any particular request from any source would be considered on its merits
taking Into account the purpose for which the material is required, the
legal implications of disclosure etc.      Be assured this will be done with the
greatest of sympathy and bearing in mind all that you say in regard to
minimising unnecessary trauma,


1 hope you will find what   I   have said helpful.   I emphatically am not
seeking to be obstructive but in the circumstances outlined above I clearly

have to have regard to the legal advice 1 am given.      I am forwarding copies

of this correspondence to Deputy Chief Constable Mervyn Jones, Stephen
Walker and Peter Metcalf for their information.
Yours etc
     Dear

                                           4 JAN 1991



%       Dear Mr Anderson,
                                 *J S'VlPLINi & C O M '



        Thank you for your letter of the 27th ultimo, the contents of which I note.

        I thought that I had made my position clear both to the Coroner and to you.
        I am Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Hillsborough Solicitors Group.
        The Hillsborough Solicitors Group consists of a number of firms who have been
        instructed on an individual basis b y :Individuals in connection with claims
        arising as a result of the incident at Hillsborough.

        At its height there were some 150 Solicitors firms throughout the country in
        the Hillsborough Solicitors Group. As claims have been settled some firms
        no longer have an interest and therefore are not part of the Group on the
        other hand new claims are still being put forward and new Solicitor members
        of the Group are still joining - although on a more limited basis after
        this length of time.

        The individual clients of each Solicitor are both known to that individual
I       Solicitor and recorded on computer by us.   We do not retain details of
        each individual claim - i.e. whether it is for physical injury, psychological
        injury and whether the injuries sustained are large or small -0 the names only
        are recorded.

        Over the time since Hillsborough there have been well over 1,000 - and probably
        approaching 1500 individual clients.     Some of those have now settled their
        claims and Solicitors have notified us when a claim has been settled so that
        the computer record can be adjusted accordingly. As no doubt some people will
        not have notified us when the claims are settled the computer record is not
        infalible.

        In some cases the statements made by individual clients to the West Midlands
        Police have already been provided to that client's individual Solicitor during
        the period that this procedure was in force - i.e. for the duration of the
        Taylor Inquiry and the period upto the decision of Peter Wright to refer the
        matter to the DPP to consider whether any criminal proceedings should be taken.

        Whereas I could supply you with a copy of the computer printout and thus to
        identify the names of individuals whose statements might be required this would

 not be a definitive list.

 WHat I did indicate to the Coroner is that the individual Solicitors would write
 in respect of a particular client and thus that that name would be identified
 at that stage.

 I trust that this clears the position and look forward to hearing from youi'
 on the substantive points.

 Yours sincerely,

 Dear Sir
 Re:   Hillsborough Release of Clients Statements
 Further to my letter of 2nd ultimo, I look forward to hearing from
 you that you have now received appropriate legal advice and that copy
 Statements will be made available to Solicitors acting for individual
 Plaintiffs in the future.
 I am continuing to receive notice from members of the Group that the
 Statements are being refused. In some cases this is causing
 considerable difficulty and indeed holding up the proper conduct of
 the Plaintiff's Civil Claim for Damages.
 If I may mention one particular case, that of              whose 4^
 Solicitors Messrs Abson Hall Loring wrote seeking a copy of their
 Client's Statement to which was attached his original ticket for the
 Ground.
 The insurance company, as is their right, have requested that the
 Solicitors supply a copy of the documentation - the ticket - to prove
 their Client's location in the Ground. As part of the terms of
 settlement it was agreed that all necessary information would be
 given to the insurance company which would include details of
 precisely where a Plaintiff was in the Ground.
 I understand that the Solicitors concerned made numerous requests to
 you and were given the excuse of the Coroner's Inquest and told that
 the matter was being dealt with by Mr S. J. Walker the Solicitor for
 the South Yorkshire Police.
 M r S o l i c i t o r s have written twice to Mr Walker requesting
 that he forward the documentation to them but have received no
 response.
We look forward to hearing from you by return failing which we shall
have no alternative but to seek a formal Court Order which we trust
will not prove necessary.
Yours sincerely

Dear Mr. Anderson,

Thank you for your letter of the 4th instant, wnich will* have crosse^in fet
post with my recent letter to you.                                     ""

I am sorry if I did not make myself plain in my previous correspondence.

The Steering Committee do hold on the computer an upto date list of all Solicitors
who are members of the Group and the names of their individual clients.

This list changes from time to time as either instructions are received from
new clients or claims by existing clients are settled by the MMI and notified
to us.

Copies of the individual clients statements is not required by every Solicitor
in respect of every client.    Some of the individuals have already received copies
of thei'r statements through the good officegg of the West Midlands Police.Those
statements would be supplied during the period May to August 1989 during which
the arrangements which we now seek were in operation.

You say in your letter that you (the South Yorkshire Police) have only a minority
of the material gathered in your physical possession. This I accept.

The majority of that material is in the possession of the West Midlands Police
who have been responsible to and acting on the directions of different people
- be they Lord Justice Taylor, the Coroner or, as I am now advised, the South
Yorkshire Police.

Therefore, those statements, when requested, are physically supplied by the West
Midlands Police and, certainly in the period mentioned above there was no problem
about finding and supplying those statements.

You say in your letter that once the Inquest is over and possible criminal and
disciplinary proceedings have been resolved you would be prepared to take action.
As spelt out in my last letter some of those statements are needed now - and
for example a copy of the ticket stubb mentioned in my last letter - or individual
Plaintiffs will be unable to pursue and finalise their civil claim as speedily
as they should.

Indeed, if the consideration of criminal and disciplinary proceedings mentioned
in your letter takes some time then it will be necessary for those people to
issue proceedings and thus for additional cost to be incurred ultimately by the
HILXSBOROUGH                     STEERING                COMMITTEE

                  Tel: 051 255 0628 Fax: 051 236 0047 DX 14100




C/tnd.




MMI.

As some people have already been given copies of their statements and others
have managed to settle their cases without reference to those statements, we
are probably talking about a relatively small number of individuals. I cannot
however guess the numbers nor guess the names.

An alternative to my producing a list of names to you which would include a large
number of names not affected by this correspondence would be either for you to
give details of the statements or type of statement which you were not prepared
to release or alternatively for there to be a general authority to release the
statement but subject to each individual enquiry being cleared by the appropriate
officer as not being a person who would feature in any subsequent proceedings
which might be under consideration.

I look forward to hearing from you that you have reconsidered the matter and
I am sending a copy of this letter to Peter Metcalfe and to Deputy Chief
Constable Mervyn Jones.

Yours sincerely,
           !______________

             Dear ■
             RE; HILLSBOROUGH RELEASE OF CLIENTS STATEMENTS
             Thank your for ypur letters of 13 and.15 February. There is nothing further
             in Miss I        letter of 11 February which causes we to advise you that
             you should depart from the policy expressed' in your letter of 4 February
             It appears to;me that the case.of I           Ifsee M1ss          letter, of
             5 February} 1s a red herring, I -have spoken to the MM1 who tell me that
             exception Is not being taken to             [inability to produce his
             original ticket. The Insurers tel I me that in his case the medical aspect
             is being explored. When this has been completed negotiations will continue.
             ’            si       lis informed of this.
                                  lease does cause me content because it would appear that                                                         -   1®
             correspondence from Mr I         Solicitors Abson Hall Loring has not
             received a reply.
             There has been a sustained series of correspondence from these Solicitors on
           ■.behalf of Mr|           |requesting a copy of his statement as well ’as the

Dear Sire



Further to my letter of 4 December 1990 and previous correspondence
concerning your above named client, following legal advice that none of the
material gathered should be subject to disclosure at present, I have decided
to adopt a policy of non-disclosure with regard to any documentation gathered
during the Hillsborough enquiry. I am, therefore, unable to accede to your
request. Deputy Chief Constable J Mervyn Jones who has possession of the
vast majority of this material is aware of ray decision.

Please be assured that I do not seek to be obstructive but clearly I must
have regard to the legal advice which I have been given.

Yours faithfully

HILLSBOROUGH



Following our meeting on 13 March 1991, I contacted Mr Sharp, Chief Constable,
Cumbria, at 4.00 pm on Thursday 14 March 1991.    Mr Sharp was quite emphatic
that he would not be making a press statement, nor would he attend any press
conference or take part in any television programme which may cover the events
of Hillsborough.

He appreciated the fact that we had taken the trouble to communicate with him
and suggested that in any press statement that we might make we may care to
use the words:   "that the Inquiry was one of the most intricate and involved
enquiries ever undertaken in any police force in this country."     I assured
him that consideration would be given to his request.

Dear Mr Anderson,

Further to earlier correspondence with regard to the supply of copy statements
made by Individual clients to the West Midlands Police now that the Inquests are
complete I should be glad to hear from you that your previous decision not to allow
Solicitors copies of their clients statements has been reconsidered.

I look forward to hearing from you with confirmation that those statements - and
those of individual witnesses where the request from the Solicitor is accompanied
by the signed authority of the witness in question - will be made available in
the same way as they were during the Taylor Inquiry.

I am copying this letter to Mr Metcalfe of Hammond Suddards and to MrMervynJones.

Yours sincerely,




MISS

Dear Mias

I refer to your letter of                    H
                            April 1991 in which you raise the question of
the supply of copy statements made by Individual clients to the West Midlands
Police now that the inquests are complete.

You will know that the disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough have not yet been
concluded and, as I informed you in my letter of 4 February, the legal advice
which I have received on the question of disclosure cannot be reconsidered
until this has happened.

However, at that time I will of course deal sympathetically with any request
for information but again it la necessary to reiterate that any application
mist be dealt with on its merits. You will recall from my letter of  h February
that to do so I will need to know from you or the Solicitor concerned the
purpose for which the material is required.

Yours sincerely

 Dear Mr Anderson,

 Thank you for your letter of the 2nd instant, the contents of which I note.

 When are tte disciplinary aspects of Hillsborough likely to be concluded ?
 As you will appreciate the problem over supply of copy statements does
 continue and it would be helpful to know the time table from your point of
 view.

 All good wishes.

 Yours sincerely,

Your letter of 14 May 1991 has passed to me now that Mr Anderson has retired
and I have taken up my appointment.

I an sorry not to be more helpful but at this stage the disciplinary aspects
remain unresolved and in consequence it would not be productive to attempt
to draw up a timetable respecting these matters. Rest assured that as and
when things become clearer and I am able to give you any firm dates I will
do so.

    Thank you for your letter of the 17th instant, the contents of which I note.
    My congratulations and good wishes on your new appointment.

    I note your problem as far as the time table is concerned.   As you will appreciate
    the decision does cause problems as far as some individual Plaintiffs oi* concerned
    - some more severe than others.

    I would like to leave the door open and to reserve the right to come back to
    you on behalf of a specific Plaintiff or Plaintiffs before the conclusion of
    disciplinary proceedings if the failure to produce a copy of the statement
    or a copy of the ticket for example which has been retained by the Police is
    causing unnecessary delay.

    I trust that this is in order.

    All good wishes.

    Yours sincerely,

NOTE FOR F IL E -   1 1 /6 /9 1



Councillor Chase telephoned on behalf of one of the Hillsborough family
which had received a letter from Detective Superintendent Beechey of West
Midlands Police in response to a request for a statement regarding the
Hillsborough Investigation.


Detective Superintendent Beechey had replied that it was South Yorkshire
policy not to release any copies of statements.


Councillor Chase asked if this was the case and I told him that our legal
advice was that we should not consider releasing any copy statements until
after the disciplinary enquiry.


However, it might be appropriate for the family to take their own legal
advice and act in the light of it.   We would respond to their written
request and give our reasons for withholding any statement.

Dear Mr. Wells,

Thank you very much for your letter of the 24th of May. I had already
enclosed with my letter of the 17th of May copies of the letters from
Morecroft Dawson & Garnett, Mrs. Stringer, David Phillips and Partners and
the Reverend D.H. Clarke.

The only additional information I think you need relates to the letter from
Morecroft Dawson & Garnett and I enclose copies of the correspondence dated
the 2nd of August and 9th of August 1990 which mentions the photographs which
they are interested in.

I also notice on my file that I have a copy of MWL10/J33A which I think is
the photograph that Mrs. Stringer is after. I enclose this copy in case it is
of use to you.

Thank you very much for agreeing that I can forward correspondence of this
nature to you. If you prefer that I should address somebody else in your
organisation in order not to have to trouble you personally, please let me
know who you wish me to correspond with on this subject.


Yours siryc^rely,

                                                                                 '   nO U O E

      Having obtained the file frcm our Client's f o r m e r Solicitors we note that
      although they obtained a copy of the Inquest Depositions relating to Kevin we
      cannot trace that we have copies of the statement of PC. 1790 Michael John
      Craighill or Derek William Bruder a Police Constable frcm Liverpool who was a
      spectator or Special Constable 221 Debra Jane Martin. We should be grateful if
      you would kindly let us have copies of these particular statements and confirm
      that we shall be responsible for any reasonable photocopying charges.


       Yours faithfully

         Dear Sirs,

         Re KEVIN DANIEL WILLIAMS (deceased).

         Thank   you for your letter of the 16th of July. It is not my practice to
         issue   statements from people who were not called to give evidence, which no
         doubt   is the reason why you do not have copies of the statements which you
         refer   to.

         A copy of your letter is being referred to the Chief Constable, in case he is
         able to assist you with copies of these statements.


                   aithfully,

Dear Mias

I refer to your letter of 22 July 1991 in which you raise the question of
the supply of copy statements made by individuals in relation to the
Hillsborough tragedy.

You will recall that on 2 May 1991 ®y predecessor wrote to you infowing
you that legal advice which he had received an the question of disclosure
could not be reconsidered until the disciplinary aspect* of Hillsborough
had been finalised,

I note your contents but there is no change in the position at present as
the disciplinary aspects are still to be concluded.

Please be assured that it is not the intention of South Yorkshire Police
to cause delay and distress.

Yours sincerely

            Dear Mr Moore,

            Further to our earlier correspondence I note that a decision has been taken to
            instigate disciplinary proceedings against two of the South Yorkshire Officers.
            I trust that now the evidence which it is intended to use in those proceedings
            will be identified and therefore that statements made by individual Plaintiffs
            and their witnesses which will not be needed in connection with the disciplinary
            proceedings, will be made available to their Solicitors as previously outlined.

            The failure to obtain copies of these statements is causing delay and distress.
            In some instances people are still unable to give full history to the Consultants
            on medical examination and in other cases the Insurers require copies of the
            admission tickets which are held by your officers.

            I look forward to hearing from you that the position has been reviewed and
            copies of these statements will be made available. I do of course appreciate
            that in any individual case if that particular witness is one whose evidence
            will be needed in connection with disciplinary proceedings then it is of course
            your right to withhold the provision of that statement until after the proceedings
            are complete.

            I look forward to hearing from you.

            Every good wish.                                        HOUT H YORK8 , POLICE

     Dear Sir.,

     During the Hillsborough Disaster inquests earlier this year we enquired with the West
     Midlands Police whether it would be possible for us to have any photographic material
     of the disaster. The police indicated that this should be possible.

     The material would be a useful resource for us when working with Hillsborough
     Bereaved Survivors, who are trying to piece their terrible experience together. We
     already have the video material which has been of enormous value.

     Could you please let me know if you can provide us with the photographic material
     now or in the future.

     I look forward to hearing from you.               .________


     Yours faithfully.,




     senior social Worker.

Dear Mr. Moore,

Thank you for your letter of the 29th ultimo, the contents of which I note.

I accept that it is not the intention of South Yorkshire Police to cause delay
and distress but that is infact the result of this particular decision.

We do not propose to rehearse again the arguments used in previous correspondence
 ut cannot see how the^release of these statements (subject of course in the
case of any individuals statement which is to be used in the disciplinary
proceedings for you to have the right to refuse a copy of that particular
statement) could prejudice the disciplinary proceedings.

In any event would you please let me know when the disciplinary aspects are
likely to be concluded.

Yours sinceieLy,




MISS

Dear Sirs.

With reference to our telephone conversations concerning the above,I
confirm that we would like a copy of the photograph shown to us by
police woman Julie Appleton(sorry I can't remember her rank)when we
attended the inquest on 30th April 1990,it showed Marian on the
terrace before the crush.

The police officer in charge of the visual evidence had looked for us
as we didnot want to see any of the photographs with her at the front
of the fence in distress but had asked if there had been any earlier
footage that showed her OK and enjoying herself.

The photo he found showed her on the terrace although not very clear
we could see it was Marian.

We understand that these photographs are evidence and can not be
released until all cases have been heard,but would appreciate your
help in obtaining a copy asap as the months & years are passing by.


Our thanks in anticipation of your help

Yours sincerely_______

Dear Mr. Mole,

Statements made by Police Officers - Hillsborough

I refer to our discussion on Thursday, 30 January 1992, regarding the
supplying of copies of the statements made by police officers involved in
the Hillsborough disaster.

Having discussed this with Mr. Simon Allen of the Police Federation
solicitors, Russell Jones and Walker, I would ask that the following advice
be quoted in your letter to any officer whose permission is sought for his
statement to be released.

’’The advice from the Police Federation is that the decision whether or not to
release his/her statement must be a personal one for the officer from whom
the request is made.   However, any officer receiving such a request should
consider very seriously what possible reasons anyone could have for making
such a request.   Having thought that through, very carefully, the officer
should then make his/her decision.’’

Thank you for all your help in this matter.
                 S                                                                           SOUTH YORKS. POLICE

                 SUBJECT:       hillsborough files



                 In order that we may maintain continuity with regard to our policy and in
                 furtherance of my earlier report concerning the disposal of property I
                 would wish to advise you that it has been my decision that so far as the
                 Hillsborough files are concerned we should for the future keep the
                 original documents and statements together with one full copy of that
                 material.

                 Before we embark upon a full destruction policy perhaps you would discuss
                 with me as to the position regarding typed or photostat copy of originals
                 which are in our possession.

      You will be aware that much debate       is still in existence concerningthis
      incident and the release of information has to be carefully considered,

      For your information, you may contact me on Sheffield (0742)        and

              Dear Secretary

              RE;           HILLSBOROUGH FUND

             iriving to every ground in the Football League. Local press
             ar4<3 radio will be providing details of their visit and the
             intention is that people in vour area bring donations to your
              :iuJb. We would like you to convert this into a cheque which.
             you should bank into the fund whilst giving-^     kandn    La
             •symbolic cheque’ in the form of a team photograph (perhaps a
             cheque glued to the reverse) * By the end of the week they
             Jill have collected team photographs from the 89 clubs
             outside Liverpool together with a club shirt and scarf. The
             scarf m i l fee attached to the oar s?o that as the week builds.*
             interest and publicity value will rise,

             All the cheques will be presented in Liverpool on Sunday 30th.
             April.  IT IS OUR INTENTION TO COLLECT ONE MILLION POUNDS.

             Once the fch&<p©£s are banked we will ’nave them returned and
             together with the scarves? and jerseys we will organise a
             charity auction which will add a substantial sum to the
             '3.r,iginal collection.

              radio stations who will make announcements regarding their
             arrival at your club. The national press will carry details
             of the clubs that will be visited each day and we are hoping
             chat Saint & Greavsie will announce the schema on Saturday«

             vie are already in contact with the UK retailers who have;
             expressed a strong willingness to help as have Texaco who
             will provide petrol and the &A who will help the lads to

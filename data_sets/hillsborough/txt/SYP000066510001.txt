            I am                    and I am a married woman,              I have live at the above

            address for the past                      years *

            I have had 10 years experience of Betting shops, and I am currently

            employed at                                                                           I "ve

            worked there for the past 6 months,              I'm        employed   part time,   16 hours

            a week, and I always work on Saturdays.

            On Saturday 15th April       1989     we opened up as usual at 10 am,               the

            manager                       ind     myself.       Almost immediately, I was aware

            of Liverpool supporters,       corning into the             shop.   I knew they were

            Liverpool,       by their accents and type of dress, because                they had

            Liverpool     scarves and hats on.        I would say          a dozen came in first          of

            all,     they were well behaved       and happy,        they were placing bets,        to     see

            who would be first goal scorer.            At this stage nobody was drinking                   in
                                                                                              PAGE         2
                                                                                              SI 077

               the shop.

               At about    11.00 am, more L iver pool fans started coming into the shop,

               but I noticed they were nearly all dr i nking from cans and b o t t l e s .             I

               d i d n ’t pay too much attention as during this      time I was taking bets

               from   people.    There was a lot of swearing     in the shop but,      no more

               than   usual on   a busy football day.

               From   12.00 pm   to 2.45 pm, the shop got busier still, more supportes

               stared to come in, still drinking from cans and bottles.              During this

               time I got frightened and was careful what         I said to them.       The

               manageress told me to find the number for Hammerton Road Police

               Station,    as she thought there was going to be trouble.

               I remember at about    11 am a supporter     come to the counter,      a Liverpool

      r   'I   supporter,   a young kid about 20 years and said "Do you want a
aXco wM I
               cigarette," and we all       replied "No we dont smoke" he then said,           "Do

               you want to suck my prick then"       I said,   "Dont be d is g us ti n g■"This

               remark really did upet me and everytime         I talk about    it,   it still

               upsets me.     I knew I could n ’t cry at work,    but when my husband picked

               me up from work,    I cried all the way home,      and had to tell him about

               it .

               At about 2.50 pm the last of the Liverpool         supporters    left the betting

  ^            office.     I would think that the last ones to leave would not have got

               to the grounds    in time.     1 also heard that a lot of fans h a d n ’t got

               tickets,    from the way they were talking.

               At about 3.0 pm a lot of the customers were          looking through the door

               up the road toward the               3u b . From what the fans said in the

               shop I found out that there was a fight on.

                                                                                          I think

               100 supporters used the shop         (Signed)

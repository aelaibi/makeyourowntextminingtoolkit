          DR. MATTHEW JAMES B



                     1
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Dr. Ball, you have got my letter
 2       as to the things that we were very anxious to talk to you
 3       about.     I have read, of course, your questionnaire to Lord
 4       Taylor's inquiry;      I have read your statement, which is
 5       entitled "Personal Record of Events at Hillsborough".              I
 6       was not quite sure what date that was.           Do you have a copy
 7       of that?
 8   DR. BALL:     I have not actually.         I have moved house and for the
 9       last two weeks have been searching for this.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Why do we not have a copy of
11       that made?
12   MR. BONE:    Yes,   I will get that done.

F
14
     DR. BALL:     I cannot give you the actual date.
         the month, possibly within a couple of weeks.
                                                              It was within


15   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I have got a Criminal Justice
16       Act statement, which was taken by the police,           I suppose.
17       This o n e .
18   DR. BALL:    Yes, the West Midlands Police.
19   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      The thing that troubled me a
20       little bit is the suggestion           (which has no medical backing,
21       so far as I can see)     that because you certified some twenty
22       people dead in the space of about 2 5 minutes you cannc~
23       have given them a proper examination.           This suggestion has
24       been made by a number of the families whose relatives were
25       certified dead.      It has not,       I think, been made by counsel
26       but I have to address the concerns of these families.              It
27       would help me if you could explain what it is that one does
28       or you did in order to make sure that somebody is dead and
29       roughly how long it takes.
30   DR. BALL:     I will just take one step back,       if I may.   When I
31       was on the field, prior to going into the gymnasium,           a
32       senior police officer asked me to go into the gymnasium,
33       which he said had been set up as a temporary mortuary.
34       When I went in there were rows of bodies - I think four or
35       five rows - each with a policeman standing next to them.                I
36       did not have any medical equipment on m e :          I was a
37       spectator at the football match and certainly was not
38       expecting any of this.
39               Normally, when I would certify people dead I would

                                            2
 1       look for three things:       I would look for the absence of          f
                                                                               i
 2       heart sounds,      the absence of breath sounds and the loss of f
                                                                               3

 3       what we call the pupillary reflex.                                    ^
 4   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       The pupillary reflex?                    ^
 5   DR. BALL:     Yes, that is when the pupils of the eye contract.
 6       What I did does need a stethoscope and a torch.          I was then
 7       given to a police sergeant and asked to see if the people
 8       were dead.       There was a GP, Dr. Redgrave, who did have a
 9       stethoscope, and we decided that we would go through it
10       systematically so that we did not miss anybody.          He had a
11       stethoscope which we shared.
12               The bodies were very close together,      literally a
13       stride between them, and, as I said, each had a police
M        officer next to them.
15               I did not look at my watch at all at the time and I
16       can only go on what the policemen say as to time.          I have
17       no means of doubting or refuting that.
18               I do not think we had a torch.       I listened for heart
19       sounds and breath sounds and closed the lids.          It was quite
20       bright in the gymnasium:       there were floodlights.     I then
21       opened the lids to inspect the pupils to see if they
22       constricted on light.
23               I remember saying to myself,      "I must listen hard" and
24       I remember hearing the footsteps of other people
25       transmitted through the hollow chesr.
26               I did not feel rushed:       the policemen did not rush me.
27       I did not feel under pressure or that I had to get through
28       within a certain time.      There was no pressure.      I felt at
29       the time I took a reasonable time to look at the bodies.
30   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You did not feel under any
31       pressure at all?
32   D R . BALL:   No.
33   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You did not have to get through
34       in any particular time.
35   D R . BALL:   No.
36   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      So you could have taken twice
37       as long, but it was not necessary.
38   DR. BALL:     Yes.    I must admit when I looked at the times I
39       thought that that was short and I had a feeling it would


                                          3
    1       have been longer but, as I said,       I have no method of
    2       proving that because I never looked at my watch at any
    3       time.     I did not write anything down.     I was not aware of
    4       any of the people's names.       I just said,   "I think this
    5       person is dead" and that was relayed to the young PC         (I
    6       presume) who was standing next to the body and also to the
    7       sergeant who walked with me.
    8               I did not know any of their nam e s .   I can certainly
    9       remember some of them still, particularly the children,           the
10          two adolescents.
11                  We did not have a torch.    I think ideally one would
12          have used that to be fully sure, but we did use a
13          stethoscope.     I was confident then - and I have obviously
M           thought about this over the years - and I still remain
15          extremely confident that all the people I saw were dead
16          when I saw them.
17      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Did you take a pulse, or is
18          that not necessary?
19      DR. BALL:     We felt the carotid pulse, the neck pulse.      One
20          usually does that as you are listening to the chest.
21      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      I suppose a number of these
22          bodies were cyanosed, were they?
23      DR. BALL:     Yes.
24      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Were they all cyanosed?
25      DR. BALL:     I do not think so.   I remember one, quite a large
26          chap, he had a very blue face.       We would use the medical
27          term plethoric,    a very blue face.    I remember him, but I dc
28          not think all of them looked cyanosed on inspection.
29      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      You have said that the bodies
30          were laid out in rows.      Were you and Dr. Redgrave going
31          down a row and,    as it were, you did one body in the row and
32          he would do the next one, or how did it work?         Or can you
33          not remember?
34      DR. BALL:     I think we did parallel rows and then swapped over,
35          if I remember rightly.
36      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      What do you mean by "swapped
37          over"?
38      DR. BALL:     I think I went down a row and Dr. Redgrave went down
39          a row and then I think we swapped over and looked at the


                                            4
 1       patients that each other had seen.        I cannot be sure of
 2       that,   I am afraid.     But I remember speaking with Dr.
 3       Redgrave that we would make sure that we did not miss
 4       anybody and he pointed out which people he would see and I
 5       was pointing out who I would see.       There were other medical
 6       personnel there as well, but I did not speak to them.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Somebody has made the point - and
 8       I do not know whether it is correct or not - that in a row
 9       of however many people there were in a row, perhaps 20 or
10       so - you have certified somebody dead there and Dr.
11       Redgrave certified the next body.       The point that is made
12       is that you do say in your statement that you went down the
13       line and this particular person has said that that does not
M        tie in with the fact that you have certified one body and
15       Dr. Redgrave has certified the next door one.
16   DR. BALL:   To be honest with you,      I cannot remember the exact
17       details.    I thought that I went down a line.        I certainly
18       did look at sequential people because I remember stepping
19       over one body to the next.       I cannot be sure of the exact
20       methodology:    whether it was two parallel lines.        I do not
21       think we alternated all      the way down the line.
22   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       Your recollection is that he
23       having done, as it were, one rcw you then checked back on
24       that row and vice-versa.
25   DR. BALL:   Yes, that is my understanding.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      Would that be all within the
27       period of about 25 minutes or not?
28   DR. BALL:   That would be beyond that.       I presume those times
29       are taken from the policemen,       each policeman with the
30       person.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:       I think they must be, but we can
32       check that.    Let us get    the body files, Chris, on two    or
33       three of these.     Let us have Sefton,    Church and Aspinall.
34       We can look at them.       I would imagine that that is how it
35       has been do n e .
36   DR. BALL:    I presume so.    As I say, I certainly did not know
37       their names.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:      So far as you are concerned,
39       there was no other way at that time of checking whether


                                         5
    1         they were dead.        You would have liked to have had a torch
    2         to check the reaction of the pupils.
    3   DR. BALL:     Yes.    It was not rushed, but the impression we got
    4         from the policemen was that we wanted just to make sure
    5         that none of them was still alive.          It to me felt a
    6         different scenario than when I have been in a hospital when
    7         I have been asked to certify somebody dead, when I would
    8         look at my watch, I would write down, I would be aware of
    9         the patient's name and I would be more involved in the
10            paper work side.       But, saying that, it was no less an
11            examination,    apart from the absence of a torch,       in the
12            certification process.
13      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         There was no other equipment

M             that you needed to do this, no other mechanical device
15            which you needed?
16      DR. BALL:     No.
17      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          In the case of Aspinall,
18            P.C. Linaop says that you pronounced life extinct at 15:54.
19      MR. BONE:     With Andrew Sefton, Dr. Ball examined Mr. Sefton at
20            15:50 and certified life extinct.
21      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         And in the case of Church
22            the police constable says at 15:53 Dr. Ball examined Church
23            and certified life extinct.          So that is Sefton at 15:54 and
24            Church at 15:53.
25      MR. BONE:     Sefton was 15:50,      I think.
26      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:         Aspinall.    We had better look
27            at one or two more.
28      MR.   BONE:   The time for Mr. Sefton is taken from Dr. Ball's own
29            statement.     Pages    51 to 59 is the statement of Dr. Ball.
30      DR.   BALL:   I presumed the policemen at the time were        taking a
31            note of the time.        That is where I presume these times have
32            come from.
33      LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:          I think that is right.
34      MR. BONE:     In your statement which I have here, Dr. Ball, you
35            say:    "To the best of my knowledge and belief, listed below
36            are the names of the bodies I pronounced life extinct
37            between 3:50 and 4:15."       The first one on the list is Colin
38            Sefton, so one might deduce from that that he was the cne
39            whom you examined at 15:50.


                                               6
 1   DR. BALL:   I cannot remember their names.
 2   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Let us have a look at the
 3       other ones we have the body files on.        We have got Brookes
 4       and Sarah Hick s.    Have we got Robinson?
 5   MR. BONE:   The police have got Stephen Robinson's at the
 6       moment.
 7   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Do you know Dr. Redgrave at all?
 8   DR. BALL:   No.    I believe he moved away from Sheffield shortly
 9       afterwards.
10   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I will try and get in touch
11       with him to see if he can remember.      There was a time when
12       a whole lot of paramedics arrived at the gymnasium.
13   DR. BALL:   There was certainly another group of people and I
M        remember seeing people I recognized as doctors coming along
15       later and I saw them look at other people.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Hicks.   This one says 16:20.
17   MR. BONE:   This one simply says between 15:50 and 16:15.
18   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is probably taken from
19       Dr. Ball's statement.
20   MR. BONE:   That is taken from Dr. Ball's statement.
21   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Page 102.
22   MR. BONE:   Here is a statement from Constable Williamson,        who
23       was the officer who was standing by Andrew Brookes' body ir.
24       the mortuary.    He does not give a time in his statement for
25       when you declared Andrew Brookes as being dead.
26   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     In this case, P.C. Mounsey says
27       it was 4:20, so that is five minutes later than the time
28       you put in your statement.     Perhaps we should check all
29       these times.
30   MR. BONE:   We do not have all these files by any means.
31   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We can get them, can we not?
32   MR. BONE:   I am going back up there, so I can look through
33       them.
34   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That is interesting:     that is
35       five minutes later than the time you have got in your
36       statement.
37   DR. BALL:   Yes.    Perhaps I was being naive.     I presumed that
38       the times the police told me were accurate.        I have no way
39       of refuting or disputing them.


                                       7
 1   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think there is anything
 2       naive about it at all.     That rather suggests that it is
 3       half an hour rather than 25 minutes and we may find one
 4       which is even longer than that .
 5   DR. BALL:    As I say,   I have no way of proving it, but I am
 6       surprised at the shortness of the time.        I felt I was under
 7       no pressure and I went fairly steadily.        I have said here
 8       that I left the ground at 5:45.        I did have to wait a
 9       while, but I do not think I had to wait nearly two hours in
10       the gymnasium afterwards or an hour and a half.
11   MR. BONE:    The times of 3:15 and 4:15 mentioned in your
12       statement are the times which were given to you by the
13       police rather than times which you checked yourself;          is
|4       that what you are saying?
15   DR. BALL:    Yes.
16   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     We will check that.    Certainly
17       that one seems to be later.        It rather looks as though they
18       have been set out in your statement in the time order in
19       which you actually certified them, so        far as I can make
20       out.    Again, that is something we can      check. I do not know
21       whether I can take this very much further.        If I were to
22       ask any experienced general practitioner,      he would say the
23       same as you about how to do it in these circumstances,
24       would he?
25   DR. BALL:    I would have thought so, yes.     To be honest,
26       thinking back on this, I think I should have kept a note           of
27       the time and the names myself.
28   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     I do not think the names were
29       known at that stage.
30   DR. BALL:    I think perhaps we should have insisted that there
31       were torches made available from one of the policemen.
32       But, as I say, it was very bright in the gymnasium, with
33       large floodlights and on opening and closing eyes there was
34       no response in anybody I examined.
35   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     That would be, in your view,
36       equivalent to flashing a torch in the eyes, would it?
37   DR. BALL:   Yes.
38   LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:     Is there anything you want to
39       tell me about this?     It is obviously not a very nice


                                        8
 1          suggestion to have made, even if it is not supported by any
 2          medical evidence.
 3    DR. BALL:     No, not really.     As I say, I have been reminded of
 4          this over the y ea r s .   I have had several of the parents and
 5          people involved ring me directly, which has given me cause
 6          to think about this episode again.        I have thought about
 7          the children particularly when the suggestion came out that
 8          some of the people may have been alive later.         I felt
 9          confident then and I still remain so that everybody I saw I
10          thought was dead.
11    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        It is not a particularly
12          difficult thing to determine, presumably.
13    DR. BALL:     At the time I remember the difficulty was that I

Ik4         could hear people's footsteps through the chest and I
15          thought I must be careful not to misinterpret the
16          footsteps.
17    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        For a heartbeat.
18    DR.   BALL: Yes,    so I waited until somebody had stopped walking
19          past and then listened out for a heartbeat.
20    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That would be a risk of
21          mistaking the footstep for a heartbeat,        in which case you
22          would not say the person was dead.
23    DR.   BALL: Yes.      I would wait until that person had gone past
24          and then wait until the chest fell silent.
25    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        Of course,   all these people were
26          people who either police officers or ambulance attendants
27          had already considered to be dead, as I understand it.
28    DR.   BALL: Yes,    as I recollect,   the impression was given tc me
29          by the senior police officer that I was just to go to the
30          gymnasium to make sure they were dead.         I do not remember
31          at the time the idea being conveyed that I would be
32          officially certifying people dead.
33    LORD JUSTICE STUART-SMITH:        That would mean signing
34          some documentation.
35    DR.   BALL: Yes.Nevertheless,     I went through the same
36          procedure as I would for officially certifying people dead.

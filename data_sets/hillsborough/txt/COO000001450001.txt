    Sir Clive Whitmore spoke to Lord Justice Taylor this morning
to ascertain what he was likely to say to the press within the
next few days about whether his interim report was likely to
address the national membership scheme.  Sir Clive reminded
Sir Peter of the difficulties faced by the Government over the
Football Spectators Bill.

    Sir Peter told Sir Clive that he would not say publicly that
his interim report was unlikely to address the national
membership schemes and he would not volunteer any comment on this
issue to the press.  If asked he would say that membership cards
were clearly part of his remit and that he would proceed as
expeditiously as possible.  But it was too early to say precisely
when he would be able to give his views on the subject.

    Copies go to Andrew Turnbull (No 10), Stephen Catling (Lord
President's Office), Nick Gibbons (Lord Privy Seal's Office) and
to Trevor Woolley (Cabinet Office).

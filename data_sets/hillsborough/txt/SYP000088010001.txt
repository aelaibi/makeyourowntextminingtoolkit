           rather self employed



           I grew up in Sheffield and have been watching Sheffield Wednesday play

           and attending Hi 1lsborough Stadium for many y e a r s . I have in the

           past held a season ticket for this ground, a l t h o u g h A       do not have one

           at this time.       I am a supporter of Sheffield Wednes/Say.

           On Saturday 13th April 1989, I had been given a ticket for the north
               "o                                              —
           stand at Hillsborough for the FA Cup semi final, tie between Liverpool

           and Nottingham Forest.

           I met a group of business friends at the Hallam Towers Hotel               in

           S h e f f i e 1d , at about noon on the match day and we all had lunch at the

           hotel.

                                                                                                                WMhialMf


                  Our party,      set off from the hotel at about 1.45pm by coach, which

                  would take us directly to the football                  ground. We arrived at about 2pm

                  on Leppings L a ne, near the junction with Ve^e Road and then walked,

                  towards the stadium.          It was a bright h o t / sunny day.

                  I had attended the 1988 semi final of^ t/ie FA but between the same two

                  sides at Hillsborough and on that occassion had also been seated in
     f
                  the north stand.        I was aware of where I had to go in order to get to

                  my seat everyone in my party had adjoining seats                      in the north stand.



                  Shortly before 2.30pm I and another member of the party were still

                   ogether outside the Ground, we had visited a shop for cigarettes and
   -M

              i   * could see no recognisable queue outside the tur n/ ti le s, there we/e
         <2                                                   ”    V                   /
 *0^              some 200 - 300 people crowding around what appeared to be 4 double

                  turnstiles.      I could see ;two uniform Police of f i cers outside tj

                  turnstiles at either side of the outer turnstiles.                         I could j / o t    see any

                   €tivity   on    the   part   of   the    two    policemen   and   there    wouldVnot        have

                  been anything they could have done in such a large crowd.



                                     and I joined the crowd outside t p e               Leppings Lane terrace

                   rea. By 2.45pm I found myself                  in a serious (/rush which would have

         J        been difficult to get out of.               I would estimate that there was as many

                  as 600 to 900 people behind me in the crowd and all of them trying to

                  get to the turnstiles.



                  In order to protect myself from the crush I had bent my arms, at the
                                                                                   PAGE
                                                                                   S3227

          elbow,    pointing upwards in a position in front and across my chest.            I

          was shouting to people behind me to stop pushing.



         At about 2.50pm the crowd pressure forced me into a turnstile but the

          turnstile was already occupied and I was shouting for people to push

          back as the stile was apparently nou/jammed.        I tried to show my ticket

          but the turnstile operator would r\j6t let us both inside together.           I

        ^ p k i d manage to push back and let /he man in the turnstile go ahead of

         me and I followed him.



         Once    inside   I saw about 20 to 40 uniform Police officers engaged         in

^   ^ObtA^conversation and oblivious to the crush outside.          I approached the

a        ‘ Officers and explained what was happening outside and one of the
                                                             /
    I   / officers replied, "But what you're forgetting is t/nat this is a

          football match, and its not a matter of common /ense."



          I had seen few police officers outside.       In the previous year the

         Police had formed a cordon in Leppings Lane to check tickets,             this had

         not happened this year.     I did not see any use being itiade of Police

          dogs outside, as in previous years. The loudhailar had been used to

         some effect by the Police      in 1988,   but again ij/s   abscence was

          noticeable this year.



          I did see about upwards of a dozen people outside           1 imbing over the

         wall,     between the times of 2.30 pm to 2.54 pm.



          I received no police direction outside the ground,          or on the walk from

          the coach to the ground.



          In the past on match days,     those with tickets would enter via the
                                                                                    PAGE    4
                                                                                    S3227

        concertina gates a nd get their tickets,      srr season tickets,    checked by

        stewards and the police.       Persons witi)out tickets would queue and pay

        ,at the turnstiles.


    f   There appeared to me to be less communication betwe^Ti the police an|

        the fans than in the 1988 semi-final and less every; than at a norma]

        Sheffield Wednesday game.



        I got to my seat,      just prior to kick- 4“f , the teams were on the field,

        My seat was No Q                           North S t a n d , at a cost of

        fourteen pounds.



        Just after play started pEARSSLEY hit the Nottingham Forest c r o s p a r ,

        at the Kop end,    I saw fans spill onto the pitch behind the Li vjnrpool

        goal and I at first thought      it was a pitch invasion.      I saw /ans from

        the Leppings Lane terrace being pulled into the West St a n d/above the

        terrace.



        The first fans who got/onto the pitch were being forced back into the

        terrace by the Pol i i



        I saw fans collapsing on the pitch at the Leppi/fgs Lane end,

        apparently out of breath.       The game was s t o p pjed and the players left

        the field.



        I saw bodies beleived dead,      deposited on the pitch in front of my
i
        pos it ion.   Police   lined up in front of t hff Hop, and then across the

        width of the Leppings Lane terrace area.



        I heard the Tannoy announce "Please will you clear the pitch"               this
                                                                          PAGE     5
                                                                          S3227

        suprised me as people were dead on the pitch.



               and I left the ground at about 3.35pm.   I have supplied, with my

        statement, a copy of my letter .of 26th May 1989,   to Lord Justice

        Taylor.                     /v lA

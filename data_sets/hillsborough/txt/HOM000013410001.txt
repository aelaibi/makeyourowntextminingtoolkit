           Dear Mr Addison
           HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
           I enclose a copy of a letter that Sir John Layden has written in response to
           Lord Ferrers’ letter of 27 June following the meeting at the Home Office on
           20 June.
           In order to enable the Authority to take in to account the latest situation when
           it meets on 11 August will you please let me know
           (a)           to what extent West Midlands Police are undertaking work other than for
                          Lord Justice Taylor’s enquiry and for what purposes; and
           (b)           whether any expenditure on such activities which is legitimately
                          chargeable to South Yorkshire Police Authority would be covered by the
                          terms of Lord Ferrers letter of 27 June.
           Yours sincerely

Dear Lord Ferrers
HILLSBOROUGH : COST OF INVESTIGATION BY WEST MIDLANDS POLICE
Thank you for your letter of 27 June in which you confirm your stance on the
cost of the West Midlands Police inquiry as previously explained to us at our
meeting on 20 June.
I have discussed your proposal further with members of the Authority and have to
say that we also are still of the view which we explained at that meeting.
I now understand that the West Midlands Police inquiry is perhaps being further
extended in a way that the Police Authority has not previously considered. I
have asked the Clerk to the Authority to clarify this with Mr Addison and will
write to you further when we have received this information.
Yours sincerely




Sir John Layden JP

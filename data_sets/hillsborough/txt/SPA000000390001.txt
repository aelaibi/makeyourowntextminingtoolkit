                                 BY MR B W DEVONSIDE


    Mr Devonside wrote to South Yorkshire Police Authority on 3 March 1990 detailing his
    complaints against the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Mr P e te r Wright.

    The allegations made by Mr Devonside re la te to press interviews given by Mr Wright
    about the Hillsborough disaster. Mr Devonside alleges th a t, by insinuating th a t additional
    evidence, not revealed to Lord Ju stice Taylor's enquiry, will show th a t alcohol played a
    major part in the tragedy, Mr Wright was apparently attem pting to p ro te c t both his
    officers and his own reputation. Mr Devonside further alleges th a t making sweeping
    statem e n ts both in and out of the press, Mr Wright was apparently attem p tin g to
    influence either public opinion or the minds of potential jurors.

    On 22 M arch 1990 th e South Y o rk s h ire P o lic e A u th o rity d e c id e d to r e c o rd th e
    complaints and they were referred to the Police Complaints Authority under Section
    87(1 )(b) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The Police Complaints Authority
    decided to supervise the investigation under Section 89(2)(a) of the Act. The Authority
    approved the appointment of Chief Constable, Mr Leslie Sharp of Cumbria Constabulary
    as Investigating Officer.

    The Investigating O fficer's report was received by the Authority on 25 April 1990. The
    report was accompanied by 7 statem e n ts and 16 other documents including the record of
    interview with Mr Wright

    The m a tte r has been thoroughly investigated to the satisfaction of the Police Complaints
    Authority.

      by his own admission failed to do his job and th a t these comments could a ffe c t the

                   THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OF SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE

  On 7 February 1990 Mr Hicks wrote to South Yorkshire Police Authority detailing a
  number of complaints against the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police, Mr Peter
  Wright.

  The allegations made by Mr Hicks, relate to press interviews given by Mr Wright about
  the Hillsborough disaster. Mr Hicks alleges th a t Mr Wright abused the privilege of his
  position, by suggesting th a t information would come to light during the inquests that
  would present a different picture from th a t portrayed by Lord Justice Taylor's report of
  the incident. Mr Hicks alleges th a t these comments are outside Mr Wright's jurisdiction
  and could prejudice the verdict of the coroner and inquest jurors. Mr Hicks further
  alleges th a t by inferring th a t there is additional information available which was not
  presented to Lord Justice Taylor during the public enquiry, Mr Wright seeks either to
  deliberately mislead, or failed in his duty to provide Lord Justice Taylor with such
  information.

  On 22 M arch 1990 th e S o u th Y o rk s h ire P o lic e A u th o rity d e c id e d to r e c o r d th e

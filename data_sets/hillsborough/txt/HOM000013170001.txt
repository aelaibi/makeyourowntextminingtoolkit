     Hillsborough:           Cost of Investigations by West Midlands Police

     Thank you for your letter of the 13th June, in which you indicate your view
     that "liability for the costs of the police investigations" rests "with the
     body who instigated those investigations".

     As you know, I take the view on the evidence provided to me that the Home
     Office instigated the police investigations and understand that South
     Yorkshire will confirm this again to you at the meeting on the 20th June.
     It seems, therefore, that it only remains for Lord Ferrers to accept this
     point for the dispute to be settled very quickly, and I look forward to
     receiving confirmation from you immediately after your meeting so that
     arrangements can be made with you for payment of all of the costs and
     bills.

     I have copied this correspondence to the Clerk to the West Midlands Police
     Authority, to the Clerk and Financial Adviser to the South Yorkshire Police
     Authority, and to Mr Dear.

             In January this year          (000190)       I was visited by officers from           the West

             Midlands Police.          I completed        a Questionnaire       in connection with the

             Hillsborough disaster.

             Further      to my Questionnaire        I    woi^itf      like to say:-

             At about 2.45 pm <1445)             on J3^t,urday 13 April       1989 <150489)   I    was in

             the      crush outside Xhe^iir nst i 1 e s .
                                                I had been in the crush for about
                                                                       y
             10 minutes.  I had been with a few friends but we had/all got
                                                               7 q/j7-, ?
             seperated and I was with one friend a lad called             He is really

             a mate of my b r o t h e r ’s and I did not know m.s JTast name.

             We were about 3 or 4 feet away from the turnstile,                      it was turnstile

             ’G ’.      We were not moving forward and                       was squashed against a

             barrier that was on our             right.    His ribs were hurting and he was

             having trouble breathing.
                                                                               PAGE
                                                                               S3865

Just     in front of us was an old man about 60 years of age and he was

 being crushed.      He was   in some difficulty.      He was shouting out that

 he was having trouble breathing.

On the other side of the barrier about 6 feet away from the turnstile

 was a policeman.       <1 have since seen this Police man on the

 television.     He was on the First Tuesday Programme on I.T.V. about

 Hillsborough.       He was the Sergeant with the beard who did most of the

 talking).     ^ q £(C^[\J    & S K

 I said to him, words to the effect that,           these two, meaning             and

 the old man,    can you get them out of the crush.           I asked him a couple

 of times and he then helped them under the barrier.               I went with them.

 The   policeman got about a dozen people outof the crowd.He then

 said to us all,       if you go to that gate you      will get in.      He pointed to

 the   concertina gate, Gate     ’C*.

 We all went to the gate,       there was a steward,      two police officers on

 foot and a mounted Policeman by the gate.            Someone said to the mounted

- po l ic em an that we had been sent to the gate by the bearded police

 officer and we should be let in.           The mounted officer said we were not

 going to get in that way and to go back.

 We all went back to the bearded police officer and 1' told him that the

 mounted officer      had chased us away.

 He then said to       the twelve of us      ’Come with me*   and he took    us back to

 the gate.     He spoke to someone,       but I can not remember who        it was and

 then the gate was opened.        The steward who was outside          pushed the gate

 open.     I think   it was open a few inches before he pushed it.             1 think

 the time was about      1450 hours     <1450).   We walked in and I walked with

          to the entrance to the tunnel and we stood on each side to see

 if any of our mates      came in.      As I got to the tunnel and turned around

 I could see people just streaming          in through gate    *C '.   They were

 just walking    in and most went straight down the tunnel.              I found one

          At about     1      — et458)        and            went down the tunnel       to the pens

          and I stayed for another minute or so to see if I could see my

           brother.     People were s t i 1l^coming         in through the gate.       I then

           decided to go to the terraces^^arrrtf w e n t        down the tunnel.       I got about

           half way down and it^Jy^came ver>\ congested.              I decided I did not want

           to carry on towards the pens and \               came out of the tunnel.       There were

           people still       coming down the tunnel         but I managed to get out.          Even at

           this stage       people were still      coming    in through gate   ’C'.

           I went to go to the terraces to the right of the goal.                     As I got to

           the back of it there were a lot of people stood there and I thought

           that the terrace was full.           I then went around the back to get to the

           left hand side.          I got lost and ended up in the North S t a n d .        From

           there    I could see the terraces to the right of the goal were quite

           empty.     All    the   people were stood at the back making         it look full as

           you approached from behind.

           On Saturday 15 Apical 19S9 (1504-89)       I was working at

                                Stocks bridge at about j^Ciartej            t five    (1715)    I saw

           two men both white aged twentytwo             fwentythree years wearing jean

           I was standing by exit door with/shopping baskets               in my hands.        One of

           the two men grabbed hold of j^ry bow tie and began to pull                it away     I

           dropped my head and theP'trtfw tie strap snapped off and the started

           laughing and walked out the shop.

           I could smell beer on their bre at hs , it was very strong,               their eyes

           were gleamed and appeared to weave side to side.
                                                                          <0*9^
           I saw them walk towards a car in the road with_                     jFol lowing thats

           all.

           The men that pulled the bow tie off me had a Liverpool accent and I

           way say that they had come from the Liverpool - Notts forest match at

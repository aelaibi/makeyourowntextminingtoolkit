H’SLSBOROUGH INQUIRY - PHOTOCOPYING ARRANGEMENTS


I am writing to confirm th a t th e Treasury Solicitor team will be responsible during the
oral hearing stage of the Inquiry for ensuring th a t copies of witness statem en ts are
served on the solicitors acting for those groups or bodies which have been adm itted by
Lord Justice Taylor as parties to the Inquiry. These statem en ts will be served only in
relation to those witnesses who are actually called to give oral evidence a t the Inquiry.

I understand th a t your own team have already arranged for a large photocopying
machine and a smaller back-up machine to be installed in the general S e cretariat office
at the Town Hall.

Whilst we assume responsibility for          service of all copy documents and statem en ts on
parties (via their solicitors) I should      be grateful if we could rely on the S e cretariat and
its own clerical officers e tc for the        carrying out of the actual photocopying. This has
been found to be th e most e ffe c tiv e     arrangem ent in previous inquiries.

    Thank you for your letter of 17 April to the Prime Minister
about the disaster at Hillsborough.                    I have been asked to reply.


    As you know, an Inquiry under the Chairmanship of Lord
Justice Taylor has been formed to investigate the events of
Hillsborough and to make recommendations.                          I have therefore
forwarded your letter to Mr R Whalley, Secretary to the Inquiry,
who can be contacted at this address.

From the Private Secretary                     24 April 1989




     I attach a letter the Prime M iril-ster
has received from

     I should be grateful if you could arrange
for a Minister or Private Secretary in your
Department to reply on the Prime Minister's
behalf.

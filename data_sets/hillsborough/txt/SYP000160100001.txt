Dear Sir


                              v THE CHIEF CONSTABLE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
HILLSBOROUGH


I refer to my telephone conversation on Tuesday 13th June 1995 regarding the letter received from
E. Rex Makin & Co. Solicitors and accompanying correspondence, which is forwarded for your
attention please, as per Superintendent Chambers comments on Inspector Hoyland's memorandum
dated 12th June 1995. Inspector Hoyland's reason for release of convictions was based on the
'entitilement' issue identified by Weightman Rutherfords in their letter of 2nd March 1995.

          SUBJECT:                      COMPLAINT FROM E.REX MAKIN & CO.




          I refer to the letter of complaint received from the above named.

          Under normal circumstances, I would not                                             to a solicitor acting in
          civil proceedings.

          However, in this particular case the solicitors, Weightnor Rutherfords stated they were acting for
          The Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police and

          I find it negligent on their behalf to first state they were entitled to view the record if they weren't so
          entitled and secondly then to release a co py of the convictions along with a copy of my covering
          letter to the solicitor's representing

^          Dear Sir,
                                                     y   TOT rWTF.F CONSTABLE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE -
            TTTTLSBOROUGH

            The papers in this matter have been passed to our Professional Administration Partner, Brian
            Woodhams, to deal with one aspect of the case only which is causing us grave concern.

            We wish to make it absolutely clear to you that we are writing to you, not as the defendants in the
            proceedings to which we have referred above, but quite separately as the Police force which released
            to Messrs Weightman Rutherfords on the 15th March (we enclose a copy of your letter of that date)
            a record of our client’s criminal convictions which was obtained by you from the micro-fiche record
            which is subject to provisions of the Data Protection Act 1984 and transcribed onto paper by you as
            you admit in that letter.

            These are civil proceedings and the defendant’s Solicitors are not entitled to a copy of the
0          defendant’s record. In supplying it you appear to have breached, not only the long-standing code of
            confidentiality and circumstances under which a record might be disclosed, but you have also
            breached the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1984.

            This is an extremely grave matter and is not in any way ameliorated by the fact that the Police
            Authority supplying the record is in close relationship with the defendant in the proceedings.

            We must therefore ask you to respond immediately to this letter with whatever explanation you may
            be able to offer, because we have in mind firstly a complaint to the Police Complaints Authority and
            secondly a complaint to the Registrar under the Data Protection Act against you and such other
            parties as may have conspired with you, or in any way aided and abetted you, in the release of
            information which in our professional view you should not have provided in the circumstances in
            which you did.

             Ynnrs truly.__

Dear Sir

Re:                              7 The Chief Constable
             South Yorkshire Police - Hillsborough

I refer to your letter dated. 2nd March 1995.

        toes not have any convictions recorded locally in South Yorkshire. As a
consequence his national micro-fiche record had to be requested.           That
information has now been transcribed onto paper and is included with this
letter.

In addition to the convictions supplied             nay have minor convictions
recorded in his heme Force area which are not nationally notifiable.

Yours faithfully

PATRICK KEENAN POLICE SERGEANT 2171 ROTHERHAM POLICE STATION

F.A. CUP SEMI-FINAL LIVERPOOL V NOTTS. FOREST 9TH APRIL 1988




On the above date I was in charge of a Serial at this venue
and our brief was to vet Liverpool supporters going through
the Turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end of Hillsborough
stadium.

We were in position about 1.00 p.m. and initially there was
a trickle of supporters and each one was spoken to, was able
to produce their ticket and we ensured that no 'article' was
being taken into the ground.

At 2.00 p.m. the trickle of supporters increased but
nevertheless at that stage we were able to form them into
orderly queues and frisk them for 'articles'.  At approximately
half past two the crowd increased to the extent that we were
only able to check one in four persons coming up to the

turnstiles.  At ten to three or thereabouts the situation
arose where we were checking at random one in proberably
every 20, because the crowd had increased to the extent
that there was no longer any possibility of orderly queues but
just a mass of support heading towards the turnstiles.

Shortly after this the pressure of the crowd was such that
I found myself and at least one other officer hemmed up
against the wall between the turnstile gates, and I because
of my height and weight was at least able to give myself some
breathing space by pushing against the supporters close to me.
I was able to call for the assistance of a mounted officer
and when he arrived he formed a 'break' in the supporters
to the extent that myself and other colleagues were at least
able to get to the perifery of the crowd.

fans     who       were    looking          forward          to    the       game.




During        this     period'a            family       consisting                of    two       elderly        parents,            their

obtaining           refreshments.                 I informed             them          that       only Liverpool                fans

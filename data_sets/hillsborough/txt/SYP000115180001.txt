            At   1000 am on Saturday7"T5TTr Apr i 1 1989,     ( 150489)   I was with other

            officers      in serial No. 33 commaned b}^J^E^^228^At_k i n In the North

  |T '      Stand of Sheff ield Wednesday Football        Grund at Hillsborough where we

            received a briefing       regarding the match Nottingham Forest v„

            Liverpool        in the Semi-Final . of the F.A. Cup.

            Following        the briefing with the other officers         in     my serial we then

            made our way to Penistone Road North which            runs between Hillsborough

            Football Club and Wadsley Bridge Station where we were to perform

            duty at static       points on the footpath along the length of this road,

            regarding any public: order difficulties which may have arisen during

            the d a y .

            We were       in position at this point from 1100 onwards and it was

            noticeable then that there were a large number of Liverpool                 supporters

            already walking about this area,        some of whom indeed were asking

            where the nearest       public houses were.

            All Liverpool       coaches arriving,at Hi llsborough were being directed up

            Penistone Road North,       under Wadsley Station Bridge,          onto Halifax        road

            where they were being parked at         the top of the road,w i t h t h e   fans

            debussing        and then making their way down the road towards the
                                                                                     PAGE       2
                                                                                     R445

football   ground on foot,.

As the day progressed the number of buses being parked obviously

increased over the period of time,            resulting     in the buses being

          closer and closer^to where we were holding our position.                          i

Whilst? tfcfis was going on ,thousands /of football           fans were making their

W a y down this     road a large number of whom, were carrying cans of

alcohol,   bottles of cider,       cans of beer,      lager etc.       The majority of

these people who were thronging tine footpaths on both sides of the

road, were of the younger age element and several of them were quite

boisterous,    singing football         songs etc,   though no trouble was

actually witnessed,at this         point,    during this period.

As the day progressed it became obvious that there were a number of

large groups of these youths walking up and down Penistone Road North

apaprently aimlessly,         but all    carrying drinks of some description.

At approximately       1400 a football      special arrived at Wadsley Bridge,

Station where the fans were gathered at the bottom of the bridge and

escorted by both foot and mounted towards Hillsborough Football

Ground.     Whilst most of the fans were walking down towards the bottom

of the hill,       there was a large number of fans walking up the hill-

enquiring' as they went as to whether any of the fans had spare

tickets and I did see at least one youth running beside coaches as

they went up hill         doing the same thing.

At approximate 1y s t i l l         at this location,        there were still

hundreds of fan<r,                                   he hill. ^ g a ^ n t T ^ i i v n ^ ^

 urry and virtually all of whom were            carrying drinks of some

descript i o n .      .

Shortly after this,         the serial    came together at the bottom of

Penistone Road North,         outside a pub called       ’The G a t e ’ where we

witnessed what we were informed by other officers a£ some fans                        "making

up* after having been involved in a fight              inside the premises which
                                                                              PAGE     3
                                                                              R4 4 5

were all quiet by this time officers already having resolved the

problem.     The people making up after this trouble were extremely drunk.

Having performed our duty on Penistone Road North we shoulld then as

^ serial have made our way to C l a y w h e e 1s Lane Road Traf fi c. wing to

receive a m e a l R and then to remain on standby,        but at this time the

Sergeant    rec'eiyed an urgent message by radio to the effect that our

serial was required i m m e d i a t ^ y at the Leppings Lane end of the

ground.     Due to severe problems being experience at that location.

W s :<iifimeiliately made our, way there,   being only a couple .of .minutes

walking distance away, and,       on our ar rival we saw a large group of

youths- being held back by a number of officers           placed across the

gates    including mounted officers,        at this   point, we were told to line

up as a serial and then form a cordon across the entrance,             which we

did.

Almost    immediately after doing this,        I noticed a tall Liverpool       fan

who was very obviously drunk, start to remonstrate with officers to

my left,    demanding that he be allowed entrance to the ground.              He was

informed there were      problems inside the ground        (we were unaware

exactly what at this time) and as soon as they were resolved,             he would

be allowed access.      He was either too drunk to understand this or just

would not believe what he was being told and continued to demand

entrance.     He finally tired of speaking to officers on the          cordon and

then staggered across to the middle of the entrance to Leppings Lane

where he there started berating a mounted officer who told him to

move away from that position and re-iterated what had already been

said and started to turn his- horse away from this man and the next

thing    I knew,   the drunk had fallen under the horse which shied away

from him,    standing on the lower     part of one of his legs as it did so

having been helped to his feet by someone and moved across the line

againt to my* left where he sank onto the pattrnent- to examine his
                                                     - ■                   ;     PAGE
                                             : '■          ■           .       ' R445

leg.    Having done, this,   he started to get up, at which point he quite,

deliberately punched the parapet of the bridge, at the side of him/

ripping   the tpp of his fingers/knuckles on that hand to shreds.

He wai tti^n joined by another man whd Strenuously eneoured this

persoh tp complain about the ihcident and said he would back him to

the hilt.,

A short time af^«r this it became apparent that something was g&ing

Wrong   inside the Stadium at which point we were taken in through the                  ■

gates Of the Leppings Lane end, where we were formed into a second

cordon and not    long after this the first bodies started to be carried

from ths direction of the.stand.         There were also at this time people

walking out from the same direction in injured conditions.

As this was happening,       a number of Liverpool     supporters some of whom

appeared deeply shocked and crying came from the direction of the

Leppings Lane end and when they saw us standing there            in cordon they

started shouting    ’You fucking murderers'?        "You’re a set of ba st ar ds’ ?

"You bastard murderers*       etc etc.

Having giving this matter some consideration after the days events I

have come to the    conclusion that these same people knowing with

hindsight what    I do now, must have been at the rear of the crowd in

the Leppings Lane end when the disaster was unfolding as they could

not have come from any other direction than the communal             tunnel that

leads to and from the Leppings Lane end.

It was at this time whilst still         in the cordon and trying to placate

these   people before they got outside onto Leppings Lane           itself and in

sight of those who were still outside that one of these             ’f a n s ’ took a

siwng at me with his fist, which fortunately missed and he was then

hustled away by another two, friends or fellow fans.

At this point,   a young main, who appeared to have severe rib injuries

and hwo was trying in a deeply distressed way, approached me from the
      v                                                         PAGE   '
                                                                                   .R 4-4-5

          direction of the.Leppings Lane stand.        I took him to one side, as the

          first ambulance   had jsut arrived,    sat him down, and tried to console

          him as best I could,, but he was too distressed to think           rationally,

          stating that   people all around him had died and he had somehow

      ■ man age d .,td; escape Snd he could riot handle the fact th-at he was a l i v e 1

          and these other   people were dead,-

 yt                           ■... '
y         f-^n, who was injured and in deep distress,     and I then put them bdth in

          a place of safety to await the chance to get them into one of the

    iC^fleet of ambulances which were now starting to arrive eh masse,               but
r
          due to the fact that they were as what would be classed that day as

          ’walking wounded'    they were   left whilst others more seriously injured

          people who appeared dead,     or were unconscious etc, were seen first,

          with the ambulance staff,     firemen who were starting to arrive with

          oxygen and police officers attempting to resuscitate whoever they

          thought they could- help.

          As this was happening the f l o w of bodies,    conscious,   unconscious and

          apparent dead was    increasing all the time.

          Myself and all    the, officers around me were lending assistance where

          we could and at one point I assisted some other officers            to- carry a

          man on, some advertising hoarding to what was becoming known as the

          "casualty clearing a r e a ’ at the back of Leppings Lane where he was

          placed at the side of the fence at the       rear of the stand along with

          other people to await treatment from the medical       staff available.           He

          appeared to foe dead.

          A short time later,     I was instructed by an unknown police        Inspector

          to go with two female     police officers   to the opposite end of Leppings

          Lane and keep the access     road which runs along the length of and to

          the rear of the Lappings Lane end clear for ambulances,           doctors etc

          to have a clear    passage through.    With these officers       I then went to

                    casualties feeing brought out,                 including two young boys who appeared

                    i n ,a bad way . ■

                    We. did what we could as regards getting ambulances for these                       injured

                    etc,: and thejn secured the r o ad .allowing access and egress for ,

                    amfaajrances .and                                                             c who, had "

                     CeCa^rted                    to the tragedy by local       radio stations.    -v               ,   ■;


                    We continued to do this for some considerable time at which point we

                    Were then instructed to 'stand down as' there were no more ambulances

                    coming from the                  clearing station and we went to the North Stand again

                    for the debrief.

                    I was        later      informed that the man we had taken on the hoarding had

                    been resuscitated but                  I do not know if he survived the day.

                    Duty commenced at 0800 at Bentley Police Station and terminated there

                    at SOOO.

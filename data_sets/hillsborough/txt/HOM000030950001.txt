We spoke this morning. I have spoken to Lord Justice Stuart-Smith and confirm that it will
be acceptable if we can have your response to his letter of 12 December by Monday 19
January.

We also spoke about engineering evidence as to the state of the Hillsborough football ground
which was prepared for the contribution proceedings. You said that your firm retained
copies of the reports prepared by Elrond Engineering, for the police, Halcrows, for Sheffield
Wednesday FC, and Eastwood Engineering and kindly offered to send us copies. I confirm
that we would be grateful if you could do that.

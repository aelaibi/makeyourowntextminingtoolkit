           On Saturday 15th April               1989 (150489)        I we/it to the football match at

           Hillsborough between Liverpool & Nottirygham Forest.                       11 was an FA Cup

           Semi-final.           I am a Liverpool supporter and a season ticket holder.                    I

               obtained my ticket from Anefield and it was a £14.00 North Stand

           I trave j/ed to the/ match by/ coac h, with Helms of East ham together with



           We travelled straight to Sheffield,                      there were no delays, we arrived

           at Sheffield at about               12 n oo n. <1200)

           We then went to a pub for a drink*                   I cannot remember the name of       the

           pub but it was a good twenty minutes                      walk from the ground.

           I left the pub with a group of others at about                      2.15 pm (1415) and

           waIked to the ground.                On arriving there at around 2.45 pm (1445)
                                                                                     PAGfc.
                                                                                     S3421

           there was just a mass of people,      there were no queues,       I cannot recall

            seeing any Police officers or stewards at the turnstiles although I

           did not pay too much attention,      I was more concerned in reaching a

           turnstile and gaining entry to the ground.          When I eventually managed

           to do with difficulty due to the large mass of people,           I entered via a

           turnstile and surrendered my ticket to the operator.             I never saw any

           unauthorised entry into the ground neither did I see any gates being

           0 pe ne d.

           Once   inside the ground,    I then had to ask a steward which way to go,

           this was due to the lack of direction signs within the stadium

           indicating the various viewing locations.

           1 never saw any disorder,      fighting or drunkenness at t h y f time either

           I eventually took up my match viewing position and 14»0 hours I was

           not subjected to any crush.       I was seated in the* f/'ont of the North

           Stand near to the centre line and was with                       and several

           other members of our parties,      however,                and

           had still not taken up their viewing       positions.    The last time I saw

           them was in the pub.      The two of them are usually always the last to

           leave.There was a good atmosphere all         round, and I did not see

           anything untoward happening although I did not notice the central              pens

           at the Leppi ngs Ln end of the ground appeared to be incredibly full.

< ^ 0^ ~   Just after the teams kicked off Jynoticed that a few fans at the

           Leppings Ln were climbing over/the perimeter fencing and

^t£jlH£r^^con9regating behind thepNgoa^r area.      I also saw fans being pulled up

           out of the terracing ana into the West Stand seating area.             1 did not

           realise that people were being injured I thought         it was the fans being

           stupid.      My attention returned to the game,     for a few minutes but

           shortly after this the people behind the goal were         increasing in

           numbers and the game was eventually stopped and the players            left the

           field.       At about this time we were joined in the stand by
                                                                                      PAGE       3
                                                                                      S3421

          had gone to the Leppings Ln end of the ground, who had been delayed

          for some reason or other.        I could see from the amount of fans behind

          the goal that the situation was more than just a pitch invasion.

          At this point Police officers ^erfitered the Stadium from our left and

          lined up directly in front       if the North stand facing us
                                                                     us.        I could now
          O/VT                    no-       >HGr
          see fans being carried o/fst      the stand    on makeshift stretchers and

          that the i r facear\^ere/covered over.        These bodies were being carried

          by other s u p p o r a n d    due to this the people in the stand started

          to shout abuse at the Police intimating they should make an effort

          to assist    in some way.     This carried on for what appeared to be a few

          minutes and        suddenly jumped from in front of the stand on to the

          pitch,   pul 1ed off an advertising hoarding and ran off to see if he

          could assist.     On seeing this I quickly followed and we ran over

          towards the penalty area of t y p i n g s Ln where I saw a man of about 5*7
bci
          tall, white    in colour,    hjr would be 25 - 27 years of age, with a pals
TO        complexion and very t^xn,       his hair was fair/gingerish worn to neck

          length and very way^.        He was wearing    loose fitting blue jeans and had

OtlOW/zVi^' on a beige T shi'rt with a collar.        He was unconscious,               1 with

                                                                            1        + i r<=.

          aid post under the North stand.        I remained with him and           who h

          now was attempting to rescus itate him by jgiving mouth to mouth.

          cannot give any further       information       I felt totally overcome at what

          I was witnessing and I left to ret/urn to my seat in the stand where I
                                Pa
          remained until    I heard the\ Pol>€e announcement      informing us the game

          was officially abandoned.

          I did not suffer any injury at the game nor did I attend hospital                 in

          Sheffield.    I did not witness the barrier break in        pen 3, the   pens were

          too crowded to notice this occurring.

          I did not witness anything which I would consider           constitued a

          criminal offence.
                                                                               PAGE     4
                                                                               S3 421

         My views and observations on the way the incident was handled after

         the game was stopped are that I feel the Police were       initially badly

         deployed in front of the North stand when they would have been of more

         use helping with the dead,   injured,   elsewhere   in the ground.   Once

         they realised the severity of the tragedy they worked to the best of

         their ability.

         I   also feel there was a lack of organisation b y the Emergency

         Services,   a lack of medical equipment   in the ground and a total    lack

         of stewarding within the entire   complex.

                                                                              SIGNED

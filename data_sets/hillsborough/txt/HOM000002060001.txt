             replaced          by    stewards                     and    Police           Officers.

             Also      I think        that             pens          within          the     terracinq         should             also

             think       the    tragedy                at         Hillsborough               would      have       been       avsrti

             crowds       had       been      allowed                   to    spread         out    towards         the       sides,

             Finally       I went            to       Whiston                Hospital,           Whiston       at       9    am    (0900)          on    Sunday

             16th      April        1VS9      (160489)                   where        1    received          treatment             for       my    chest

             injury      ana        ankle         injury.                    The    Doctor         X-rayed         my       chest      and        they    said      it

             was    OK   with        just         a      bit        of       bruising         and    my      ankle          was    OK.

             I    have    been       off      work                since       May     1 st     because        of    the       trauma          of

             Hillsborough.

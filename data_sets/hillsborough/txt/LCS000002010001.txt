      Ve understand that you have been in touch with the Manager
o f the Hillsborough Disaster Trust Fund regarding the effects of
the tragedy on 'yourself or someone known to you*    The Manager of
the Fund has kindly agreed to send this letter to you on our behalf
as any information given to him is not available to us and is dealt
with on a separate and strictly confidential basis.

      We- represent the seven local authorities iri. the region where
the m a in affects of the tragedy have occurred and we have set up
a series of services to assist those people who have suffered both
physically and mentally.      You may have heard o f our confidential
HELPLINE (051—225—3413/3414) which is operated on a 24 hour per day
basis to receive call9 from people like yourself who may wish to
seek help with coping with the tragedy.      The helpers who answer the
phones will not try to identify who the caller is.       They are there
to listen and advise and if the caller requests it they can arrange
follow-up services which are strictly confidential.

      We are aware that many people who may be suffering after-effects
would never normally seek help from an outside body such as ourselves
because they feel they should be able to cope but it is important
to realise that this is not a normal situation.       The feelings of
fear, helplessness, grief, guilt, shame, anger, memories and worries
about the future are especially powerful when people have died in
circumstances like those at Hillsborough.      Letting these feelings
come out is part of the healing process and suffering them may make
people feel worse.

      We have sought advice frota those who were involved with the
tragedies at Zeebrugge, Bradford, Piper Alpha, etc, and we have used
that advice to increase our understanding and make ourselves more
able to help if you will allow U3.

      A tear off strip is attached to this letter for you to complete
and return to us if you would like to consider accepting our assistance.
                                    PM/LP                        2nd Kay, 1989




                                     2   -




You can either complete and return it to us or you can contact us
on the HELPLINE (051— 225—3413/3414)*   Anything you say to us will
be treated in the strictest confidence.

      Finally, remember, you are the saoe person you were           before
this tragedy occurred. Help is ayailable to you, to realise this.

This statement (consisting of 1 orig. page each signed by me) is
true to the best of my knowledge and belief and I make it knowing
that, if it is tendered in evidence, I shall be liable to
prosecution if I have wilfully stated in it anything which I know
to be false or do not believe to be true.

Dated the 18 day of March 1993.

Signature D Richardson



I am a Registered Medical           Practitioner employed by the Airedale

NHS Trust at Airedale General Hospital, Steeton.                      I have been so

employed since the           1st February    1993,     in the post of Registrar

to Dr MILES.



On      2nd   March   1993   I commenced    a     34   hour   shift    looking            after

patients on wards 1, 2, and 3, and any other medical                       admissions.



As part of my duties at 9.15 p.m.                 the evening of Wednesday 3rd

March 1993 I was called to see a long term patient on Ward 3, who

I knew to be ANTHONY DAVID BLAND.                 Following examination of the

patient I certified life extinct.                 I then informed Dr HOWE of the

death so that he may refer the matter for the attention of the

Coroner.

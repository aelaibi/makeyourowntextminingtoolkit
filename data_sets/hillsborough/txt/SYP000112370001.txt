                    'by Police Sergeant 840 Wright.                    At 10.00 a.m.      that day T arrived at

                    Midland Railway Station,             Sheffield,          along with other officers         in

                    serial     13.       Our duties were to supervise the Liverpool football fans

                    from the trains and onto specially laid on South Yorkshire Transport

                    buses.      At the      station I found           theLiverpool fans very        friendly and

                    co-opera ti ve.         From what     I saw there was            no trouble at all at the

                    station although          a small quantity of                intoxicants were   taken from the

                    fans before they          boarded the buses.

                    As each bus became full 6f supporters                        it travelled to Hillsborough

                    supervised by          two officers on each bus.
                                                                 Police Constable

        p. > 0 3    PjjMnw^y:k and I boarded one of these buses and made the journey to

                    Hillsborough with the fans.                During this journey there was no ill

                    feeling from the          fans in fact I found them to be very                  friendly

                    although some of          them did seem to bethe worse for drink.                   After

                    depositing the bus load of supporters                        in Hillsborough near to the

                    stadium Police Constable 405 Fenwick and myself returned to the

                    Midland Station on the now empty b u s .

members of o u r s e r i a l   we made our way back to Hillsborough along with

other officers on a SYT bus.           Whilst: travelling from the centre of                        ;

Sheff ield to the Hi 11 sborough Stadium I saw that a_ large n u m b e r of . V , ;

the pubs were often and large crowds of supporters had gathered                                     4 ."

outside and in the surrounding area. From what I could see a large;                                 '

number of these supporters were drinking intoxicantsi ’

At 3Ki40 p.m. Police Constable Fenwick and I arrived at the stadium,

    entered the ground and waited for our serial to reform.                             At around

3.03 p.m. while Police Constable Fenwick and I were waiting the

remainder of our serial, we were approached by a Sergeant who

d ^ e c t e d us to join his     serial as some trouble       had       been seen         in the

Cjrounjt.   We walked as       a serial around the ground           in front           of the

Nnrtfa-ci.anH to the Leppings Lane side of the ground.                      As we walked

   ound the track      I noticed that the centre pen appeared absolutely

packed with supporters and some of these supporters appeared to be

fighting at the front of the terrace near to the wire mesh fencing.

I saw one or two people begin to climb over the top of the wire

barrier fence and fall onto the track at the rear of the goal area*

I then saw one football          fan, a man aged late 2 0* s , we 11 b u i 11 to fat,

5 ’ 1 0 " tall, wearing jeans and a white shirt which was not tucked into

his trousers,      this man ran onto the pitch and took hold of the

Liverpool    goalkeeper and he appeared to be remonstrating with him.

Police Constable Fenwick and I ran onto the pitch and took hold of the

man who was crying and shouting,           "WHY WON'T THEY STOP?"                He appeared

very upset,     unsteady on his feet and was shouting constantly.                           It was

our intention to eject this man under the ground regulations and as

we walked around the track,          I saw he was unsteady on his feet.                         After

we had walked a little way, he began to complain of chest injuries and

he Calmed down sufficiently to enable Police Constable Fenwick and I

to und«rstand what he was saying.            He informed us that a number of

                                                                                           R 166

               people had been crushed at the front of the Leppirtgs Lane terrace and

               were   lying injured. . I saw he appeared injured and .immediately handed

               him- to a St. J o h n ’s Ambulance a t t e n d a n t ,,a woman, to be treated for

               his injur i e s .      /'                      .                           ./".

               Together with Police Constable 405 Fenwick I ran back towards the

               Leppijtfgs Lane side of the ground and I saw a line of Police Officers

               ajainst the perimeter fencing.        Having    reached the wire fencing I saw

          „   / o n the terracing at the front under the fencing were a large number

     'r        of persons    lying piled up one on anottier and they appeared to me at

^              that stage to be dead. Other fans were standing up to their waists in

               dead bodies and I saw a bald Sergeant and other officers attempting
OK             to pull fans out of the Hop onto the track through a small gate in

               the fencing.        Other fans were attempting to climb over the top of the

               fencing and I. then became      parted from Police Constable Fenwick.              I

               was unable to assist at the       gate in the fencing so I took off my

               helmet and climbed onto the       wall in      front of the high fencing. X

               leaned over the top trying to reach a fan,           I was assisted by Police

               Constable S089 Steven Maddocks.         I dangled Over the fencing with

               Police Constable Maddocks and attempted to reach a man who appeared

               to be aged about 20/22 years who was wearing a green jacket. He was

               shouting,"HELP ME, HELP ME."        We managed to take hold of his hands

               and pull him upwards but had difficulty in getting him over the top

               part of the fencing which is covered with spikes and at an angle to

               the rest of the fans to stop fans from climbing over.             He kicked off

               his shoes and was able to insert his shoes into the holes             in the

               fencing and with Police Constable Mack^cks          I was able to pull him

               over the top of the fence.        When we   got him to the track other

               officers took this man from       us. Together With Police Constable

               Maddocks   I again leahed over 'thi fence an<i with his assistance,            I

               managed to reach two more men,       both in their early 20*? and pull them

both over the     fence-   Both these men were hysterical by this time and

I saw that as     fast as the Police were releasing the crowit\from the

front it was filling up from the baCk.           I then saw that; police          .       v

dffieers had' broken down a section of the fencing and were able 'to/

gain entry into the crowd.        Many more were pulled out here.            I also

took hold of the wire fence and rolled it back partially to assist

where upon I was handed the body of a man in his late teens or early

2 0 * s and I carried him onto the grass at the side of the goal posts.               :

He appeared unconscious and a fan who appeared to be a Liverpool

supporter, male, with jeans and. a white sweatshirt,            assisted me to

attempt* to carry out artificial       respiration.      This man felt at his

chest and attempted to carry out cardiac massage and I held his neck

and head in the approved manner to carry out mouth to mouth

resuscitation.      This fan smelled strongly of 'intoxicants and as I

carried out mouth to mouth



                              and continued artificial        respiration and

cardiac massage.

We were then joined by a fireman in uniform who had a plastic airway,

and this was inserted into his m o u t h . ■ At this time we were joined by

a man who stated he was a doctor and he started to carry out cardiac,

massage on the victim.       This appeared to have no effect so I said to

the fan who had been helping me,        "I think he *s dead."          The fan

screamed at, itie to continue so we did. The doctor then took from the

fireman an oxygen mask and placed.this over the airway,                 he then

turned on the oxygen from a s m a 11 bottle in a kit bag which- the

firecrian held.   After a time the doctor took off the mask and said,

"I think he *s de a d . " ' He tried his pulse in his neck and wrist but g o t ,

no joy.   We were then joined by a couple of farts who had a makeshift

stretcher,   they p l a c e d .him on this and carried h i m a w a y    towards the

         Police Room.    , I never saw that injured man again.

         I remember my radio was switched on but the messages appeared non­

         stop and garbled and I could not tell a word of what was said-            I

         then assisted other persons to maie temporary stretchers from

         advertising boards.        I then saw that a large number of Liverpool        fans

         who were on the pitch around the goal began to storm up the pitch

         towards the Nottingham supporters on the far Hop.           I saw a number of

         officers   run towards the half way line and I joined them and together

         we forced the Liverpool       supporters back towards the Leppings Lane

         side of the ground.        As I walked back towards the Leppings Lane I saw

         most of the officers       in my serial   including Police Sergeant Wright,      I

         then joined them,.    Everyone at that side of the ground was       clearly

         upset and was    crying,    including myself and other Police Officers.

         After staying on the track for some time we were directed by

         Inspector Dews to leave the ground and walk towards the parked SYT

         buses to convey Liverpool       supporters    back to Midland Station.   As we

         walked to these buses       I can clearly remember fans calling me a

         "Murdering bastard" and a "ki11e r ", they also said,        "I bet you're

         glad of the overtime."        These comments made me very upset.

         After   remaining at Wadsley Bridge with the buses for some time and no

         more fans appeared,    Inspector Dews     instructed us to make up a van and

         to travel into Sheffield       City centre on public order patrol.

         I went off duty at S.00 p.m.        that same day.

         location?

4.        What did you see that   is in any way relevant to the incident?

5.        What did you do?

Please begin the account with your full name in block letters, your rank and
number and your sub-division/department. Please conclude the account with
your signature.

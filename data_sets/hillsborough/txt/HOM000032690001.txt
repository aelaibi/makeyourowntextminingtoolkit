      HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

      Thank you for your letter to Mr Philip Harding which I am replying to in his absence.

     Your letter accurately reflects the BBC’s position regarding untransmitted material of
     Hillsborough, with the following small caveats:

      • We cannot say with certainty that the material has been made available to all
        official inquiries, but it was certainly made available to Mr Justice Taylor’s Inquiry
        and to the current Scrutiny.

      • The BBC would be prepared to allow the representatives of victims’ families to
        view the material in connection with legal proceceedings.

     If you have any further queries, please do not hesitate to contact us.

     Chief Political Adviser

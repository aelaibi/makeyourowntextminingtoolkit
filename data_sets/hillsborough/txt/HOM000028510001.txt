a v a i l a b l e for e n h a n cement of CCTV equipment at major clubs in the
Footb a l l league, based normally on the use of tripod mounted

Station, which is situated on a freight line close to the
H i l l s b o r o u g h ground.  Because the proposal would have assis t e d the
running of Football Special Trains for H il l s b o r o u g h Matches and
a v oi d e d the need for large numbers of fans to congregate in the City
Centre, the Trust agreed, in October 1986, to make a grant of                  10,000
or 50         of the cost, whi c h e v e r was the lower.     After some lengthy
neg o t i a t i o n s involving other parties, the work was put in hand and
completed in J an u a r y 1989 and the grant of             9,360 was paid to Brit i s h
Rail on 24 February.
4.        F O O T B A LL AND THE C OM MU N I T Y
In August 1984, the Trust received a r ec om m e n d a t i o n from the Sports

e x t e n s U n to the weight room and store for the sports hall at
H i l l sborough.         We were a dv i s e d that the Sports Council had made grants
e xceeding            105,000 for C o m mu ni ty facilities between 1979 and
1984.         The Football Trust grant was paid in two instalments and in

              formed following               the    Ibrox Park      disaster.

              The       fund operates          under    the following          policies and            are    in strict

m o d i f i ca ti on or    re-enactment         thereof     for the time            being    in force.

Approved      proposals are           grant a ided to 75              of the a p p r o v e d     cost.

Clubs are      required        to obtain        competitive          tenders      for    their    proposals

and these      tenders are           scruti n i s e d   by the n o m inated surveyors                  to the

trust George C o u r de ry and Company,                  who    recommend to the trustees                      the

amount     of aid that should be offered to the                          club.          A grant     is paid to

the    club after         c o mpletion of the work against                   an auditors

certificate,         certifying         that    the     club has      d i scharged       its debt       in full.

Si gni f i cent ly the Football               Grounds     Improvement Trust              does    not    lay-

down safety standards                but grants aids           clubs     in meeting         standards          laid

down by Lo c a 1 Aut ho r i t i es .

Se c o nd ly the second         item     is for the        improvement         of spectators

facilities and ame n i t i e s           of    club grounds and           premises        under     this

sect ion the trustees               have a p o 1 i cy of       ini t iat i ves under         this      heading

w hi c h   includes       support     for the      provision for family enclosures,                          the

provision f o r the           f ac i 1 i t i es for the     di s a b 1ed and the          prov i si on of

modern toilet          facilities        for both male and female                   spectators.             Clubs

are   grants a ided on a p p r o v e d          schemes at 70            of the      cost.       The

procedures       for      receiving      these     grants are         identical         to our    first

catorgary.        The      trustees are         currently       in disc u s s i o n with         the St

Johns A m bulance Brigade with a view at assisting                                 in the    provision of

adequate      first aid facilit ies at grounds.                         The       initial    d i s c u s s i o n on

this matter was            prior     to the H il l s b o r o u g h    occurance.

   informed to release              those        documents    n e c essary to assist           the enquiry.

   In relation to what              h a p pen ed at S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y on 15 April,             1989

   I w ould     like to make          the following          comments.        On that day throughout

   the    country there were 92 football                     league    clubs and 38 S c o t t i s h

   League      clubs w hich held safety                  certificates      issued by the          local

   Authorities.           Each     of these        certificates       specified the m a x i m u m number

   of spectators          the    club were         permitted     to have on the ground.

   T urnstiles       fraud or       illegal        entry by whatever means               is a safety

   haszard      in a d d i ti on to being           fraudulent.         1 consider that           individual

   direct      controlled access             to each area of the            terracing        is desirable.
                                                                                                           'PAGE:.
                                                                                                           S 123 S

W hen    possible        controls         outside      the grounds          prior to the turnstile

p o i n t s h o u 1 ci be    i rif orced,      p o s s i b 1y by t h a ground     c 1 u b s o w ri s e c.u r i t y

employees.

Apart     from the safety               requirements             demanded    by clubs    they should            be

reminded of their                 r es po n s i b i l i t y of    regular    good house     keeping and

mainte n a n c e    of      its    property.          Some       individual    spectators       have     failed

to accept        their       respons i b i l i t y     for the       correct    standard of behaviour

upon which the organising                      of any event          is dependant.

I will     now speak about                fencing.        Fences were         the direct      result       of

irresponsible            behaviour         and there         removal    can only follow a period                     of

correct      behaviour.              Removal      of fences         could    result    in d i f f i culties          on

the field of          play fay invading spectators.

I also     produce          for the       information            of Lord Justice Taylors           enqu i r y a

copy of the         1979 Football              Grounds       Improvement       Trust    deed w hich was

the     beginning of the trust.                     The    trust     previously operated           under an

earlier      trust       deed granted            in 1973.

I' have    read over my statement and                        I would wish to re-iterate                one

point.       I do not wish to be                  pretentious         but my observations            are     based

on personal         and      practical         experience as a F.I.F.A.                official at the

                                      and

           We    left                                   s house mid m o r n i n g a l t h o u g h         I can't       remember

           the      exact       time.           I had a ticket         for     the m a t c h w h i c h     I had bought          from
W O - k
          / Anfield,           via                                     it     cost £.6, and         it was       for    the
      i
           Leppings            Lane,       s t a n d i n g are a Liverpool          area.

           Whilst         travelling             to S h e f f i e l d we just       s t o p p&4 for       something       to eat

           a bout 5 miles              from       the    ground.       I have       nt/i d s a what        time       that was.       We

           were      there          for about          13 mins and         the n/ea r r i e d on to S t o c k s b r i d g e      where

           we went         to the F r i e n d s h i p         pub.    \*Jeyriad a couple            of pints.           I think

           that      this was at about                   midday.

           We were         not       subjected          to any     travel      delays.        Hav i n g    been       to the

            corresponding match                     last year we had             left     early J m       a void      the traffic..

           The      pub had quite a few L i verpool                         s u p p o r t e rs j^n t h e r e , up to about

            •100,    a l t h o u g h most         people were         drinking,          t hjer e was     no drun k e n e s s    or

            rowdiness,              just    high       spirits..

            I have        no    idea what           time we       finally      parked up for             the m a t c h and we

            parked a bout             1 m i 1e f r a m the g r o u n d .

           We w a l k e d       to the          ground,     but    received        no Po l i c e    d i r e c t i o n or escort,

           the      only officers                I saw on the way             to the      ground were           direct ing

           t ra f f i c ,.

           Whilst        walk i n g        to    the    qround     I saw no disorder, ffiqhtinq or drunkeness
                                                                                            a s j
           We a r r i v e d at the               ground     entrance at about              2 . 3 0 pm.     At    that    time    there

           were      no queues             for    the    turnstiles,          it was      just a mass           of    people

           m i l l i n g around,            trying       to get      to their       turnstiles,           there was       quite a

           lot      of    jostling,.             The moo d     of the       crowd was        quite       good spirited,          there

           were      no a ngry out b u r s t s            that     1 heard..        There were           no Police       directors

           being         given       in that area,           that     I could see.            Having       been at     the match
                               k CU, ,                                                                                   — — .

The      officer        was a PC.      I was       so      incensed      by this        that      I mentally            noted

get     hysterical          as    I realised            the man was               dead,         I started         saying         ’H e ’s

fucking          d e a d ' , the PC        giving m o u t h to m o u t h said                      'You've       got     to keep

trying.’            I a sked      if an y o n e     had felt his                  pulse and he said                 no and

asked        the younger         PC     to take         his    pulse,        he      just       lightly held the mans

wrist and           said    'He's       dead'      an d just w a l k e d             off.

The     other PC then told me                      to stay by the                 body and          he then        left.

After        that      point my m e m o r y        has     gone         blank.        I c a n ’t remember where                      I

went        or what       I did?      at    one     time      I was        given a plastic                   cup of water.

The     next      thing     I remember             is a line of Police                     inside         the    pen by the

fencing.            By    now there were             no bodies             still      in the         pen.        1 saw a group

Pen and j o ined m e ,

Just        before       this    I had      seen a Police                 officer         and      supporter        carrying an

injured          fan towards          the    tunnel,          they were           having           trouble       getting

through          because        people were         standing              round      in a d a z e .           1 wal k e d     in

front        of them and tried               to    clear       the way,              When we         reached        the tunnel

              becoming more                      intense and       I then        felt myself                 being moved                ay the crowd.

T here      was    nothing        I could do about                it,     it was      just a case              of going

wit h      the    crowd,,       I was        carried       forwards        and to the            right,        gradually.

It was       not    one surge,            just     gradual        movements          towards         the front           of       the

pen .

I was       carried       by the        crowd towards             tne     front      of the          pen and      I

eventually          ended up           in a n o t h e r    position,,        w h i c h was about             seven feet

f rom      the    dividing        fence       betw e e n    pen three and              pen two,            and a little

past half w a y          down the         pen,,      The    gate at the front                   of    pen three was                to

my    left.        I have m a r k e d         this    second        p o s ition on the               separate         scale

plan of the          central           pens    using       the    figure      two,,        As    best       I remember,                it

p o s ition two.            The    game was          still       being     played when               I got     to the

p ressure         became more           and more          intense arm          I was       unable          to move at a i .

 At     this      time,     I was       not awar"' of any               crush barriers               a r o u n d me and            1

did not          know where        the       crush barriers were                   located       in that         pen,,        As       I

l ooked      towards        the    pitch there was a sea of heaas                               in front         of me?           all

t x g h 1 1y packed,         and       the    p e o p 1e in front          of me were all                  in an upright

position.           At    this     point,          I remember         that                was    behind me,            over my

cap,       run onto       the     pitch from the d i r e c t i o n of                 the       hoardings         in f/ront

side.        The    pile     of bodies           was about      four    deep.           My first     instinct was

to move       forwards         to    try arid7 pull          paople    out.        As    1 did so,     1 was

left and        forwards         to get      to the       people,,      1 believe          that     the game          had

just     been stopp e d / a t         tnis       point.       I got    to    the bodies and m a n a g e d              to

pull     three      clea/.          In order       to    puli a fourth         clear,.       I needed some             sort

of a n c h o r a g e    point,       so    I put my       left hand         behind me        looking       for

support       ana      grasped what          felt       like metal,         w h i c h was abrasive.              I

remember        thinking what              had    I grasped and         I looked          behind m e , upon

doing     so,      I saw that         I was       holding what was            o b viously a broken section

of a     crush barrier.               1 now realise that what I had grasped was the

h o rizontal        oar    of the middle            section      of the       crush barrier.               The       bar

had    brokers away          from the        joint with the            right       hand section of the

crush     barrier as you              look at the            pitch from tne             stand,,     Trie end of the

bar was       still       intact at         the    joint with         the    left       hand section,        as you

look at the            oitch.        The    broken      bar was       twis t e d out at an angle,

towards       the      pitch,,       I do    not    recall      seeing       any of the           extreme    left

hand     section of the              crush barrier,            I presume       that had broken a w a y as

well,,       I now      realise       that whe n        I had to move          to my left           to a void         the

right     hand section              of the       barrier,      w hich was      intact,        1 must       have

walked       straight       through         the    broken middle            section       to get     to the          pile

0 f b o d ie s .

1 did not see the barrier break,                             however,       from the       suddenness        of the
                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                             S978A

             pile     of    bodies a p p e a r i n g      and    'Lhe state         of the       crush      barrier     as

             d e s c r i b e d above,      in my opinion,              the    left     hand section of the                barrier

             and the mi d d l e         section,        must    have      broken at            the   same    time.      When     I

             first     became aware             of the     broken       barrier,             I w ould   estimate      the    time         to

             nave     been six or seven minu t e s                    past    three.           I ccmld not         say what      the

             time     was when the          barrier        actually          broke,      however r I believe              that

             the barrier           broke at a b o ut the same                 time a y the P o l i c e m a n         first     ran

             onto     the    p i t c h a n d a p p r o a c h e d the      r e f e r s-;ey,    This was       the P o l i c e m a n

             wearing        the    flat    cap,,        To my mind           it was      due     to the     barrier      breaking

             that     caused all          the    bodies     to be       piled up on the terraces.                       There

             was     no other a p p a r e n t       reason for          these       people       to fall      over.       1 can

             remember        that at       the     relevant       time       that     I saw these           bodies     piled     up

             the gate at           the front         of    pen three was             open and        some    people were

             climbing        out    onto    the         pitch. Tnis may have released                        the    pressure         in

             front     of    the    barrier        that    broke and          perhaps          c ontributed        towards     it

             As    regards        the   time     that     the    barrier,         I do not           remember      hearing

             anythi ng that may             have     been       the    bar r ie r b r e a .«i ng .

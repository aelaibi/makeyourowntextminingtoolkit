                                                              Date:              March 1998

 You telephoned me the other day about the material which the Home Office had sent you
 concerning your son’s death at Hillsborough.

 As I explained, what the Home Office sent you was an extract from Appendix 9 of Lord
 Justice Stuart-Smith’s report to the Home Secretary. In Appendix 9 of his report Lord
 Justice Stuart-Smith dealt, in as far was possible, with the questions which had been put to
 him by you and by the other families with whom he had private meetings in Liverpool about
 the exact circumstances in which their relatives came to die and about difficulties with the
 police documentation.

 I hope that you have now had a copy of the full, published, report from the Home Office.
 This explains on page 215 that the Home Secretary decided not to publish Appendix 9, since
 it deals with individual cases. Instead, he decided to send each part of Appendix 9 to the
 family concerned. The Home Office therefore sent you the part of Appendix 9 which deals


When we spoke last week you asked me why it was that the police said that your son only
had one scar and no other visible injuries. I have looked again at the transcript of your
meeting with Lord Justice Stuart-Smith on 8 October, and agree that you asked about this
very early on in that meeting. As you mentioned, PC Kearney said in his statement that 'an
examination o f (Andrew’s) body revealed grazing to the lower abdominal region No other
marks were fo u n d But it is clear from the Polaroid photograph of your son that he had facial
marks as well, and the pathologist, Dr Shortland, mentions other external injuries which
Andrew had.

I have looked at this as you asked me to. I have to say that I do not know why it is that PC
Kearney said what he did. I have found nothing in the extensive scrutiny documentation
which sheds any light on it. After almost nine years I doubt whether there is any new
information to come forward, and I would not have thought it was helpful to speculate about

I am very sorry that I cannot be of any more help. You also mentioned in your interview

A:\SEFTON.261
  with us on 8 October your concerns about inconsistent police statements about Andrew and
  the fact that you found him still to be warm at 3 a.m. the next morning. I hope you will agree
  that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith did address these points in the part of Appendix 9 which the
  Home Office has sent to you, even if you do not agree with his conclusions.

  I should add that, now that Lord Justice Stuart-Smith has reported to the Home Secretary and
  the Home Secretary has published his report, the Hillsborough Scrutiny office is closing
  down. I have of course written to the Family support Group to notify them, but you may
  wish to know that if you have any further inquires about the scrutiny you should contact the
  Home Office at room 528 in this building (telephone 0171 273 2433).

                      Thank you for your fax of the 11th February. As you say the document you sent is a
                      transcript.

                      I have discussed it with Mrs Williams and I can confirm that there are no further

                      Office. Thank you again for your help.

                      Yours faithfully

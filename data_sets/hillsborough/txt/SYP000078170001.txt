I knew      that       ambulances                 were       arriving              on    the       s e e n e , b ut       before          they

reached        our      position;,            they       were           used       by    other        officers            further          along

through.          I saw        one          constable             who     appeared             young         in    service?           electing

                         ervic.es            to    one ambul anc e                   c r e w who w e r e           tending           to    a youth

long     period         during          the       afternoon,              and        I consider              h a d ne      not       have       cons,

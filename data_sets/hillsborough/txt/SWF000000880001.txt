Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

Further to previous correspondence, we are now ready to prepare the
consolidated copies of Lord Justice Taylor’s reports and if your
own underlined copy can be with us without further delay, we should
be able to serve the consolidated copies within the original time
limit contemplated by the Order, i.e. before 6th July.

We, therefore, look forward to hearing from you by return of post,
if possible.

Now that a Judge has been appointed to deal with the hearing of the
main action, we think that he should have the opportunity of
inspecting the football ground and the Leppings Lane terraces before
any alterations are made.  We suggest Counsel's Clerks should liaise
with the Listing Officer,  Do you agree?


Yours faithfully,

         Dear Sirs

         Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

         We thank you for your letter of 2nd July.

         We are still considering with Counsel the underlining of Lord
         Justice Taylor's reports, but hope to be in a position to
         exchange shortly.

         The implication in your letter is that we are to let you have
         our underlined copy report for consolidation by you and that we
         are not to receive your underlined copy reports by way of
         exchange.   This is certainly not our under s t a n d i n g of the Order
         of 24th May, nor is it the understanding of Davies Arnold
         Cooper.   Our understanding is that all parties shall exchange
         these underlined reports, following which you will then prepare
         the consolidated copies.

         We agree that Mr Justice Jowitt should have the oppo rtunity of
         inspecting the football ground and, in particular, the Leppings
         Lane Terraces before any alterations are made.    We have spoken
         to Davies Arnold Cooper and understand that they are also in
         agreement.   We presume from your reference to Counsel's clerks
         liaising with "che Listing Office, that you propose that Counsel
         should attend the inspection with the Judge.      We assume that
         solicitors should also be present.      Please confirm whom you
         consider should be present at this inspection.

         We are inforr.ed by our Counsel's clerk that the Pre-Trial
         Review has been fixed for 24th July before Mr Justice Jowitt at
         the Teeside Crown Court in Middlesborough where he is presently
         sitting.   We understand that this date is convenient to all
         Counsel.  A tire will be fixed nearer the date, but we have

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

Thank you for your fax of 3rd July.

With respect, the Order is perfectly clear.  All parties should
have completed their underlining by 22nd June, which was extended
by agreement to 27th June.  Yourselves and Davies Arnold Cooper
were then to serve copies on us and we were to consolidate and
serve consolidated copies not later than 6th July.  We emphasise,
once again, that this date can still be achieved.

We are not sure what your concern is here.  It is difficult to see
that we are going to gain any advantage by receiving your
underlined reports a day or two in advance of the date for service
of consolidated underlined copies.  The main priority must be to
keep to the timetable and, in this respect, it is rather
disappointing to note that you are still considering the underlining
with Counsel, when the extended date for completion of underlining
was 27th June.

Turning to the question of a ground inspection, we think that
Counsel and Solicitors should be present, if possible, but that the
parties should not insist on both their Counsel being present if
this causes problems in fixing a date.  Indeed, if there were real
problems over fixing a date, we would rather that the Judge
inspected by himself.  At all events, shall we now ask our Counsel's
Clerk to try and liaise with the Judge's Clerk to organise a date?



                                                                                                                              /...           contd

 We have also received notice of the pre-trial review and have no
 objection to the hearing commencing at 2.00 p.m., if this is
 convenient to the Judge.  No doubt you will let us knew in good
 time if you are seeking any particular directions.

For our part, we are issuing a Summons seeking leave to amend the
First Third Party Notice, as we have not heard from the Club with
their consent.  So far as the amendment of the Second Third Party
Notice is concerned, we are of course agreeable to the usual terms
on costs as a condition for your consent to the amendment.

We are turning our attention to documentation for the trial.  Are
you able to let us have a list of documents which you would wish to
see included in the Core Bundle and a list of photographs and videos
which you would wish to have readily available?


Yours fai

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

We assume that you have received from the Heal th & Safety Executive
a composite bundle of further reports prepared by various persons
on various engineering and wider aspects of the disaster.

Our preliminary view is that these documents are not covered by
paragraph 3.2 of the Order of 24th May, 1990 and, if that were tc
be correct, then the status of the documents has to be considered.

Are you able to say,                       in respect of each document,                                     whether you are
agreeable:


           1.       To that document being put in evidence without the
                    maker being called.

           2.       To the content of the document being agreed
                    evidence.

We refer to the telephone discussion between Mr. Metcalf and
Mr. Wyles and enclose herewith our underlined copies of the Interim

We hope to issue a consolidated version within the time limited by

Yours faithfully,

          Dear Sirs,

          Hillsborough

          Thank you for your telefax of 4th July.

          We refer to our telephone conversation of 4th July and enclose
          by way of exchange a copy of Lord Justice Taylor's interim
          report which we have underlined.       We have not underlined
          anything in Lord Justice Taylor's     final  report.    We look
          forward to receiving copies of your underlined report(s).

         We confirm that we have asked our Counsel's clerk to liaise
         with your Counsel's clerk concerning a mutually convenient date
         for the Judge to inspect the ground and confirm that you may
         now ask your Counsel' s clerk to liaise with the Judge's clerk.

         As regards documentation for the trial, we confirm that we are
         not yet able to let you have a list of those documents which we
         wish to see included in the core bundle.    As we explained, we
         have only today received from you a bundle of further documents
         which we requested in our letter of 21st May.

         Dear Sirs

        Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

        We thank you for your letter of 2nd July enclosing two further
        bundles of Statements and the West Midlands Compilation Video.

        We see that you are unable to locate the Statement of Dr C
        Nicholson (No 251).      We wonder whether this is the " H. S. E. "
        Report s u bmitted to the Taylor Inquiry, but please confirm.

        We note from your letter that you are to forward to us further
        available doc um e n t a t i o n as soon as possible. We list the
        documents (by reference to their numbers) which we still do not
        have.   Please will you indicate which documents you are unable
        to supply us with, particularly as several of them are in fact
        photographs.   Please will you also indicate when we are likely
        to receive the further documentation to wh ich you refer.

        The documents we do not have are as follows: -

                      1, 4, 5, 29, 68, 69, 73, 81, 96, 126, 128A, 128B,     129,
                      135, 143, 146, 155, 170, 174 - 177 (inclusive), 179, 185-
                      187 (inclusive),  193, 194, 206, 208, 212, 215, 217, 236,
                      241, 252, 254, 255, 260, 272, 275, 276, 278, 279 and 306.

        The entries for document 74, 75, and 76 refer to briefing notes
        being attached to the Statements,    You have supplied us with
        copies of the Statements, but not the attached notes.    Please
        will you let us know if you can supply us with these.

        Document 86 is the Statement of Inspector Robert Purdy.   The
        copy document which you have supplied to us numbered 86 is a
        one-page Statement which refers to a previous paper which we
        presume is a reference to the original Statement.  Please may
        we have a copy of this.

           Dear Sirs,

           Hillsborough - Eastwood & Partners

          We thank you for your second telefax of 4th July.

          We are considering the further report re c eived from the Health
          and Safety Executive wit h Counsel and our clients.       In the
          meantime, we agree that this further report is not covered by
          paragraph 3. 2 of the Order of 24th May 1990.

          Our personal and preliminary view is that it is most unlikely
          that we shall be able to accept that all the further reports
          may be put in evidence without the makers being called.            It
          follows, of course, that we are equally u n l ik e l y to accept that
          the reports may be put in as agreed evidence.

          We shall of course write to you with our final views on this as
          soon as possible.

Further to previous correspondence, we now enclose herewith, by way

Dear Sirs

Re;   Hillsborough

Further to our various telephone conversations on the 6th July, we
enclose as requested a copy of Davies Arnold Cooper's facsimile latter
of that date.

As we explained to you, in line with your own suggestion contained in
your letter of 4th July, our Counsel's Clerk contacted :~r, Justice
Jowitt's  Clerk  with  a view   to  arranging a date   for  a  ground
inspection.

Rather than deal with    the natter   informally,   Mr, Justice Jowitt
directed an application should be made at Teaside Crovn Court on
ilonday the 9th July, which application has of course not gone ahead
due to us receiving the facsimile letter frosi Davies Arnold Cooper,

We trust this clarifies the position.

Yours faithfully
HAMMOND SUDDARDS

        List of Issues at the Pre-Trial Review on 24th July.               We have
        seen the correspondence passing between you and Davies Arnol d
        Cooper concerning the List of Issues.   Our r e co l l e c t i o n is that
        it was agreed between the parties that your clients w o u l d be
        able to she* how the various issues l i sted arose from the
        Pleadings   ky the   addition of two    further        columns      cross-
        refer ring the issues to the pleadings and i n di cating against
        w hom the issue was made.     We do not c o n s i d e r that the two
        further colu-ns have served the purpose w h i c h we were led to
        believe they would.

        We look forv=rd to hearing from you.

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

We were most c oncerned to receive your fax of 12nh July, dated
11th July.

Whilst we try to take a reasonable attitude to extensions of time
in litigation, we do not think we can accominodaue your request.

We have to remind you that it was your clients and the Club who
insisted on an early hearing date for this acticn, with the obvious
and necessary consequence of a strict timetable.

We were overruled in our view that more time was required and the
preparation of the case to the present stage has necessitated a
very considerable amount of out of hours and weekend working by a
dedicated team.

It is our view and that of Counsel that your clients should be
prepared to ensure that the same efforts are mace in order to
ensure that the timetable is strictly upheld.

We are conscious in making this point that we requested and
obtained an exte n s i on of a few days in relation no completing the
underlining of the Taylor report, but we must pcint out, as we did
in subsequent correspondence, that that time would have been more
than made up if your clients and the Club's underlined copies had
been served w i thin the time as extended.

Clearly, you are not going to serve the List of Issues on a Sunday
and we would be content to grant a further two day extension to
Wednesday, 18th July.

Any later service will inevitably jeopardise the usefulness of the
pre-trial review, as well as representing a default in respect of
the Order agreed by all Counsel at the last hearing before Mr.
Justice Rose.


Yours faithfully,

      We thank you for your telefax of 13th July,

      We t e e tbit you are only prepared                                                 to   grant          us        a   two-day
      extension to Wednesday 18th July.

      We shall use our beet endeavours to comply                                               with this extension,
      but if we are unable to do so, we hereby                                                 give you notice that
      we Bhall apply for a further extension at                                                the Pre-Trial Review

Dear Sirs,

Hillsborough

Thank you for your fax of 13th July.

We must empha s i s e that, in granting the extension we have, we are
doing our best to accommodate you within the limits of a very tight
timetable.

You will recall that lists of witnesses and further statements are
required to be exchanged by 31st July.   Service of response to the
List of Issues by 15th July left an already narrow windo w in which
to obtain further statements in response    to any points which may be
raised by yourselves and the Club.  That window    is further f o r e ­
shortened by the admittedly brief extension we have granted.

Obviously, you are entitled to apply for a further extension and, if
the Judge is persuaded tc grant this, so      be it. Our point is that
that must n e cessarily have consequences    for other aspects of the
timetable, whe r ea s the da~e for the commencement of the trial must
needs remain fixed.

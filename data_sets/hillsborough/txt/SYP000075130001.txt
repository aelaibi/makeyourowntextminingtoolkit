We e nt ered through the gate and made                       our way towards           the tunnel      in a

flow of supporters.               We wa lk ed normally,           no one was          rushing the

a t m o s p h e r e was   in good humour.



I did not see any signs                 in the ground d irecting               us to the      terrace    but

I did not have any d i f fi cu lt y              in finding where             to go as    I went      last

year.



We were      half way down the tunnel                 when    I saw that the terracing was

packe             d ecided to turn around and go                             but a surge      of fans    came

into________ nrtel a nd it was              impossible       to   „          ack.    This surge       of fans

carried me with my feet                off the ground along              the t u n n e l and on the

back    of the      ter r a c e s .   I had great        diffi culty breathing            the    pressure

was    unbearable.          I was     being     crushed up agai nst my               chest and my legs

had been stood on and we re p a i n f u l .



There were        no Police       or stewards at the entrance                   to the tunnel.          I did

not see any fans            drinking alcohol            in the ground.



On the terracing we were p u s h e d to the                    right     of the tunnel          into Pen

       We were still          t o g e t h e r , the   pressure    in the       crowd was      still    tight.

where     ever    the     crowd went       I had to go with            it.     The    game nad a l r ea dy

k i ck e d off.       I could not see any of the ac ti on because                        I was    now on

the ground.

                 approximately          two yards       from the front        fencing      fans were     crushed

                 ag ai ns t    the    perimeter    f e n c e , some had uirned blue.              In front     of me

                 there was a pile of dead and                   injured fans       rying    on the t e r r a c i n g.        I

                 went    down a gain a s e cond time when a lad next to me                        collapsed against

                 me,    we both fell        to the ground holding             on to each other.           He started

                 to s cream hysterically,               "I d o n ’t want    to die,     I d o n ’t want     to die,

                 After     I had lifted a young            boy aged 8 - 9 y e a rs who had also                fallen

                 an d was screaming,            I handed the          boy to I          |who then       pulled ms        up

                 At this Npkflint we were          near the gate          I saw two Po ryce Officers            p u l l i ng

                 still     unbearable.          I was    still    having d i ff ic ul ty     breathing.

                 After     going down twice            I thought,       if I go down a second time             this

                 is it I w o u l d n ’t survive,          I could not feel my           legs,     it was as      if they

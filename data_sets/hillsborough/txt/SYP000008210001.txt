We    travelled               to H i l l s b o r o u g h         stopping               once       at    B a k e w e l 1.      1 believe                at

a    pub     for     a    d r in k .          We    go t      there          at       1305    hr s      and    left    at      1330         hrs.

We    then      travelled                straight             to H i l l s b o r o u g h           not       meeting        any       traffic

delays        at     a l l.         We    parked           approx            2    1/ 2 -- 3 m i l e s          from     the

ground        on     the R o r e s t           side        of    the         ground.              We    a r r i v e d at     the

parking         position             at       approx          1415       hrs          and    made       our w a y      straight

walked        past        the F o r e s t           turnstiles                   at    the    Spi on K o p         e nd a n d         although

there        were        lots       of    supporters                there             I noticed          there were

no    queues         to       speak       of       at    th e    turnstiles.                      I d i d n ’t k n o w

the    best         way       to    get       to L e p p i n g s         Ln       ter r a c e s        for    whi ch    I had a

ticket        so     one       of m y         friends           spoke            to ^       policeman who              directed              us    round

the    ground.

We made         our       way       back       round                    ground          and a r r i v e d at           the     big         gates        at

L e p p i ngs       Ln    at       approx          14^0       hrs       and       immediately                was   confronted               by a

great        mass        of    peopleyftiich                  stretched                from       the    turnstiles            and         out     of

the    big      gates          in         the       street.              I made             my way       w i t h my     tw o      friends              up

to    t he    g a t e s ^ / There              they        left         me       because          they       had   s ea t    tickets              for

the    West         stand.           As       I got        to    the         gates          I saw       three      Police         horses

acrosss         the       gate       area          trying        to      stop          supporters             from     entering              the       area

up    to     the     turnstiles.                    They        did      t hi s        for    what       appeared a            couple             of

minutes.             I then          heard          a man        called               out    "Is       the    game     going          to     be

delayed?"            and       one       of    the       policemen                on    horse          back    replied         "Yes."              I

think        on e    of       the    horses             moved       a    little             and    supporters           including

myself        began           to    go    into          the     ones         towards          the       turnstiles.               It w a s         only

a    slow     dribble.               At       this       point          it w as         packed          but    not     uncomfortable.

        course        and     I found           myself        being          taken        to    the      tunnel       under       the       sta n d .

        I saw was           for      toilets           but    having          said        that      I s t il l       had    to    go    in        the

        walking.            There         was     no    running.              T he    tunnel            was    about       7 f oo t     height

             same     pain and             struggling               for      breath.                 My     left         arm       for       some         reason       was

             twisted           b ac k     behind          me    and     my     right          I managed                  to       get       to m y        face.           I

             c an    remember             feeling          bodies          being         passed             over         my       head       on e      or    two     of

             them     striking             me.        I d o n ’t k n o w           if        they          were         passed          over        me      or w a l k i n g

            or      crawling            over     me.           I just        remember                bodies            going           ov e r     the       t op    of me.

             I was        so    ho t      and     in t o t a l        panic        because                 1 was         finding             it v e r y         hard      to

             breath        again.              I c o u l d n ’t m o v e           forwards                 or    backwards                  or    to      the      sides

             blacked           out      again      because            the      next          thing          I remember                  is a        lad      standing

I could       hear       h im      but     I c o u l d n ’t a n s w e r            anything             for       a time.               It    now

felt     that      thing        were       becoming            easier         because            I could              breath        a    lot

better      and     there          was     not      so m u c h         pressure             from       the       back.

I then      managed           to     speak         to    the      lad a n d        told        him      I wa s          alright.              He

then     left      me.        I could          hear          people      shouting              “M o v e      back"           and    thing          were

becoming        easier          all      the       time       until      such          time      1 had           enough        room          to    lean

I can      remember           s om e     lads       then       shouting            "Clear          the       way"        and       saw       some       of

them     carrying         bodies           from         the     front        up    the        terrace            to     the    t u n ne l .

These      bodies        were        face      down.           Others         were          being       taken           by    other          youths

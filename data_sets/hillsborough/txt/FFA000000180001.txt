    Dear                              /

    SEASON TICKET HOLDERS - WEST STAND
                                                                         if



    During recent years we have expressed concern over the fact that a number
    of Sheffield Wednesday season ticket holders continue to be accommodated in
    the West Stand. As you are no doubt aware, it is our policy that we should
    make every effort to maintain segregation and this area is specifically
    designated for ’away’ supporters.

    I appreciate that on occasions we utilise part of the West Stand for home --
    supporters.on match days which do not anticipate large numbers of visitors.
    However, it is on the occasions when big matches take place that we find
    some difficulty in trying to accommodate those few ardent Wednesday fans
    who seek to maintain their position in the West Stand.

    I would ask that serious consideration be given to refusing season tickets ■
    to Wednesday supporters in the West Stand in the interests of safety, and
    seek your assistance in this matter, please.

    Yours sincerely
                                          V

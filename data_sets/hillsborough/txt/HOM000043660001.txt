Thank you for your letter o f 3 June in support o f recent calls for a new public inquiry   ^
into the Hillsborough disaster.


I am currently considering what action to take in response to the representations which
have been made for a fresh inquiry. I have been following the families’ campaign for a
new inquiry closely, and since the broadcast o f the television drama about the disaster
in December I have had the opportunity to meet some o f the members o f the
Hillsborough Families Support Group.


I am very conscious o f the strength o f feeling on this issue and will make an
announcement as soon as I can.

                  Dear M r Straw

                  I write in support o f recent calls for a new public inquiry into the Hillsborough
                  disaster.

                  I was Chairman o f Social Services at the time o f the tragedy and attended a tto ftile
                  funerals which took place in the Knowsley area. As you can imagine it was a very sad
                  time for everyone on Merseyside and it certainly left a marked impression on me.

                 Since my election as Mayor o f the Borough o f Knowsley I have been approached by
                 bereaved families in the area to add my support to the M ayor o f Liverpool’s request
                 for a fresh enquiry.

                 I ask that you give urgent attention to this matter and I am hopeful that you will reach
                 a favourable decision in the very near future.


                 Yours sincerely




                 Cllr George Howard
                 M ayor of Knowsley

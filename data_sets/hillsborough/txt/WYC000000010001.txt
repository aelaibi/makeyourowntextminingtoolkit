             parents, Allan                            31and at
             He was a general labourer having worked for the firm of
             from leaving school at age 16 years, until his injury on th 15 April 1989.


             Mr Bland had no history of any form of serious natural illness. When aged four years
             he sustained a fractured pelvis in a road traffic accident. He susbsequently made a
             full recovery.

             Mr Bland      had a stand ticket he gave this to Mr Grew, choosing instead to use
             Mr Grews ticket and stand at the Leppings Lane End. Mr Bland and Mr Gill were
             standing near the front of the crash barriers when the now famous disaster occured.

            I live at the above address & a m e m p Io y e d a s a M e d i c:a 1 S e c re t a ry in

            the Obstetrics & Gynaecology Dept of the Northern G e n e r a 1 H o s p i t a 1 in

            Sheffield,

            0 n Saturday 15th April           1989 (150489) , as a result af s eei ng reports of

            the disaster at the Hillsborough Football                            Stadium in Sheffield,                  I went

            to the Northern Gene ral H o s p .

            1 arrived at the hospital at about 3.40 pm— ( 1 ‘V + n )— ajxd— upnt to the

            Casualty desk.             I eventually met up with                                            the new

           Medical    records officer,           who told me to go & get the next                           clip board.

            I did this & it turned out- to be No 7, which contained forms which had

            to be completed with            physical        descriptions,            and the property found in

            possess ion of decease d p ersons.
                                                                                              P AGE
                                                                                              S3S7S

              T he plaster     room was being used as a temporary mortuary and so I went

              there,    and liaised with the       police officers on duty.

              As each body was searched & property taken,             the police filled in their
                                                                               /
              own forms,      the details from those forms was then read over Vo me by a

              policewoman 1 only knew as

              I am quite sure that in all          I filled in 11 forms       in connection with

              deceased persons     Vt     the hospital,   as I recall    on a nuVnber of occasions

              the figure was mentioned in connection with press statements.

              On 15th April        1989    (150489), my sole function was to fill      in   the forms

              I have    previously described,        they showed the time,      the Majax No, a

              description of the deceased & any property found in the possession of

              the deceased.            I had no part in the filling   in of any other forms and

              I had no part        in the issuing of any of the Majax /(umbers.
                                                                         /
              Ihave since been shown by DC GADSBY of/the Wesa Midlands Police,                     10

A n           of    the 11 forms       I completed that day./   I can/confirm that they are all

              but" I am not able    abl^ to say, the t Majax No of the one that is missing.

              In relation to the one bearing the No 001,              I cannot give any

              explanation why this No was used.            I know that    it was related to me by
      #
              the polieewoman      I have     prev ious 1y named as

              On the form bearing the No 20,           I have written the details of one of

              the H I C K S ’ girls.     At the time of recording this name        it had been

              assumed,    due to the apparent age,        that it was Sarah HICKS) at the
                                v.
              hospital. x It was only after the deceased had been identified by Hr

              HICKS at the hospital,          that it was discovered     it was his younger

              daughter Victoria.          The name was then altered on the form.

              My best    recollection concerning the mix up of the H I C K S ’ g i r l ’s name

              is that Mr HICKS was of the opinion that his daughter Victoria still

              had a chance of being alive,          and so the deceased girl must have been

         After my attendance at the hospital   on 15th April   1989   (150489),   I had

         no contact with any of the   papers or documents   relating to the

         deceased persons dealt with that day.

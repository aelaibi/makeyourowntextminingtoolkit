              went        to      the       junction          of C l a y w h e e l s           Lane    and Halifax                Road     supervising

               time       it w a s          very       busy and          lots     of       the       supporters             were    carrying

              ^bottles            and       c a ns     of    beer     and      lager           and    ci d er .        We    prevented          them

There         is a p u b l i c         house       situated             at    the       junction           of C l a y w h e e l s       Lane

s om e    Liverpool              supporters             who    had        been admi t t e d               via a         rear     door.        The

incident             had    subsided          prior       to       us     gaining             access       but       it w a s     obvious

there         had     been       s om e     kind    of    fight           inside.              The       premises          were       cleared

and      those        inside          were    warned          re    conduct.

At    3.05       pm       (1505)       we    started          to w a l k          up C l a y w h e e l s        Lane       for

refreshment                but    halfway          up    instructions                   were        received            that     all

available             serials          were    to a t t e n d           at    Leppings              L a ne ,    entrance          of    the

ground.              An    Inspector          took       charge           on L e p p i n g s         Lane       a n d we        made    our

way      to     that       end a n d        paraded       in s e r i a l s .             The        Inspector             reported          our

position             then    instructed             us    to       go     into         th e    ground and assist                      in a n y

w a y we        could.           The      outer     gates          to     the      ground were                 open       and    there       w as

a    la r g e    group       of       supporters          milling             around.               On    going         inside        the

ground          we    saw    that         there     were       about          twelve          bodies           l ai d     on    the    ground

near      to     the       entrance          tunnel       of       the       Leppings            Lane      en d      stand.           Officers

were      giving           artificial          respiration                   to     s o me     of     them      others          had                 '

covering             their       faces.        Other          officers             and        people       were         carrying        bodies

out      of     the       tunnel       I checked          two       p eo p l e ,        found         pulses         and       laid    them       ir>

the      recovery           position.

There         were        other       supporters          around             the       tunnel        stood          yelling       and

shouting             abuse       at    us    and most          appeared                worse        for    drink          but    obviously

shocked          as w e l l .          We    were       instructed                by P S L i n d o p           to    get       into    the

ground          and       assist       where       we    could.

Inside          the       ground       I could          see    a    pile          of    bodies           near       the    first       fence        I

could         smell        urine,         vopit,        excretia             and       intoxicants.                  Together          with

other         officers           I carried          a man          ou t      through           the       tunnel.           I assisted

with      artificial              respiration,                but       we    couldn't              revive          him.        I left       him

with      the        two    officers          and       went       back       into        th e      ground.             1 carried

another          body       of a m a l e       out       of    the        stand         and      through            the    tunnel       but

left     him w i t h          other           officers.                  1 returned             again      into        the       stand        and

helped        past*; b o d i e s          out, of         the         stand       through         the      gate        on       the    perimeter

f en c e .     All       the     time          other           f an s     in the         stand were             shouting              abuse          an d

spitting         at      us a n d         throwing              punches.              I was       hit      twice          in the        back           and

t h e n -c o t 'S w e r e       thrown          at    us as              we    continued          to m o v e         bodies           out     through

the     gate.           We w e r e        then as s i s t e d                 by f a n s    to    rip off            the        facia       boards               on

the     top    stand          and        passed       them           onto       the      pi tc h .        On    clearing              the     stand

we     were     instructed                to    form a              cordon across                the      s ta n d .        Again       the          fans

began        spitting           at       us a n d     throwing                 eaw s .      We were            told       to     retire             oi h o

t he    pitch.           On     the       pitch        I assisted                 where         1 could         then        a    photographer

appeared         from         nowhere           into           the       stand       and    started            to    t a ke

photographs.                  This        angered              the       remaining          fans       and      they want              for          him

we w e r e     instructed                 to    go     into          the       stand and          get      him       out.         While

getting        the       photographer                 out           of    the     stand         I was      again          punched           in the

back     of m y         neck.            We    then      got         back       onto       the    pitch and               began

comforting              some     of       the    fa ns.              Those        in the         stand were               in a n

aggressive              mooed        and       some      even            started         fighting          amongst              themselves.

When     all     the         dead and           injured               had      been      removed          from       the        pitch with

great        assistance              from       some           of     the      suppoorters             we w e r e         s t i ll

receiving           a    lot     of       verbal          abuse.

and     the     pitch          was        cleared              of    remaining             fa ns.         Iagain          rejoined            PS

LindOp        and       PC     1130 B i n n s           and          we       were    i n s t r u c t e d to        get     back       o n to

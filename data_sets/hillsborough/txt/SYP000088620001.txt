            On this date I was not on duty with the Road Traffic contingent but

            was working directly with          *F* Division from the football ground.



            I came on duty at 07.30 reporting to the gymnasium and was shown on

            the Operational Order as Transportation Officer responsible to the

            Chief Superintendent,          *F* Division,     in liaison with Inspector Sewell

            *F* Division,        who was   co-ordinating various admin op e ra ti on s.



            My duties included receiving personnel              carriers/vans at the ground as

            they arrived from the various division,              organising    parking of all of

            those vehicles        including   coaches,   re -al 1ocatinq vehicles to the

            various serials following briefing,              organising stand-by serials and

            meal    reliefs etc etc.        It was intended that I operate between the
                                                                                PAGE         2
                                                                                S3288

football   ground and the Road Traffic Garage at ClaywheeIs Lane.



I had carried out this duty the previous               year and had been asked if       I

was available to do it this year.



A little before 3.QQ pm I was actually supervising the area around the

mobile   catering vehicle at the side of the gymnasium when                "Ground

Control*   asked for either 2 or 3 serials to be deployed from the

gymnasium area onto the ’t r a c k ’ to assist officers there and

immediately a number of officers           left the gymnasium in response -

although I had a pocket         radio and was monitoring transmissions,          this

message had not been directed to me and I had no part in directing

those officers,      although I had heard the request acknowledged.



Shortly after that        ’Ground C o n t r o l ’ asked for    all available serials    to

attend on the      ’t r a c k ’ from the gymnasium      and that was acknowledged and

indeed every available serial was despatched.                   I remained in control

of the area outside the gymnasium and the entrance from Penistone Rqad

North to that a r e a .



During these proceedings         I heard various transmissions on my pocket

radio which was obviously busy but I had not noticed any problems with

the radio.      One sequence of tranmissions which I cannot with certainty

place into the order of proceedings other than to say that I believe

they were close to the time that all available serials were despatched

to the   ’t r a c k ’ area.   One message told control          that 2 to 3 thousand

fans had appeared outside the Leppings Larie turnstiles.                  A further

message then said that they were           (the crowd)        trying to break down the

large gate and that people were being crushed at the front.                   Someone

asked for permission to open the gate to relieve the pressure and I
                                                                       PAGE      3
                                                                       OuCOO

believe that this was refused by control.      Within a short space of

time there was a further frantic message to the effect that people

were being killed at the front of the crush outside the said turnstiles

and again permission was asked to open the large g a t e .    There was a

pause of some seconds before a message came back from ground control,
                    rJbtoZ 2-
and I believe Sergeant Goddard was the voice on the radio, 'Authority

has been given to open the gate,    open the gate."    (or words similar).



I am not clear on the sequence of events following this,       the radio was

extremely busy,    it was apparent that there was some sort of serious

disruption,   someone asking for an ambulance, and the St J o h n ’s

Ambulance travelling from the gymnasium area onto the ’t r ac k. ’      At no

time did I see the playing area or the terraces but stayed within my

area of responsibility - the gymnasium yard/parking area.



Shortly,    injured and dead people w ere being carried from the playing

area into the gymnasium y a rd area and I then realised just how serious

the situation was.     I started to direct persons carrying dead to one

side to separate them from the injured but living but within       ’sec on ds ’

the area was littered with bodies and injured people.

Someone then decided to use the gymnasium for placing the bodies and I

assisted in directing bearers to the appropriate place .



Ambulances and other emergency vehicles started to arrive and so I

organised control of the entrance to the area so that ambulances         could

leave as and when they were loaded and were not blocked in.        I also

organised police motor    cycle escorts to the various hospitals as

required,   arranged police personnel   carriers to convey persons with

less serious injuries eg. broken arms etc, ,_to hos pi t a l , again under

escort.
                                                                                  PAGE       4
                                                                                  S32SS



         In this frantic period I assisted in moving bodies about in the

         gymnasium yard but I could not identify which ones.            I also assisted

         in loading critically injured people into a m b u l an ce s.    Whilst   carrying

         out these tasks I sustained an accidental      back injury/strain

                                                 although it has not caused me to

         refrain from duty.



         Prior to the incident the stewards     in my area had been most co­

         operative and I had not experienced any difficulty whatsoever with

         them.



         I had seen football    fans coming out of an off licence at the junction

         of Penistone Road North and Vere Road w ith great amounts of dririk and

         sitting around on Penistone Road North drinking s a m e .       I do not know

         which fans they were but imagine that they would be Notts fans.



         The remainder of my duty was taken up with receiving relatives,

         organising tra nsport for them to and from Hammerton Road Police

         Station etc etc.

             Further to my account of 28th April              1989:



             At a time around 3.0Q pm emergency vehicles started to arrive at the

             Penistone Road North Side of the football ground and the first of

             these were to the best of my recollection Police vehicles.                      In order

             to afford access to the urgently needed ambulances                   I instructed that

             police vehicles be moved from Inside the entrance to the gymnasium

             yard.      I remember that Sergeant       1636 Lightfoot         ’C ’ Road traffic,

             arrived in a Range Rover and parked that on the central                   reservation on

             Penistone Road North and he came to me.                  There was a large police

             van that had been used for carrying equipment and no parking cones

             before the match - this vehi cle was parked in the yard and I suggested

             to Sgt Lightfoot that perhaps we could put                   ’the dead * into that out of
                                                                     PAGE   2
                                                                     S3288A

sight and away from the injured survivors and indeed we opened the

back of the vehicle to make sure that it was empty,       but by the time we

had done that there appeared to be dozens of dead and injured

lying about the area close to the gymnasium and so I had to abandon

that idea.



Ambulances started to arrive and were directed by us into the yard

area through the gymnasium entrance gate.        I walked out onto Penistone

Road North to check that the road was clear for other ambulances to

arrive and I saw an ambulance attempting to enter Gate       'O' and I

realised that with all the activity inside that gate the ambulance

would have difficulty - there were people carrying injured etc from

the pitch up into the area just inside Gate       "O' and there were dead

and injured lying around that area - that       is why I had originally

organised the area inside the gymnasium entrance gate.        I walked down

to Gate    'O' and told the crew that they would better using the other

entrance.      I then entered Gate   'O' and went to an Ambulance Service

Range Rover which was parked against the kop wall.        I told the officer

with that vehicle what I had arranged with regards to the other gate

for access of his vehicles.      I then returned to the other

gate.     I cannot recall what other vehicles    if any, were parked inside

Gate    "O’.



As ambulances started to arrive      in numbers I had to organise them into

some sort of order — whilst some crews were tending to the injured

other ambulances were arriving and blocking the first ambulances          in,

indeed on at least two occasions crews had gone off with the ambulance

ignition keys and we were unable to get loaded ambulances out.

Another ambulance was left on Penistone Road North obstructing the

entrance.      Eventually I had an orderly queue operating with ambulances
                                                                             PAGE   3
                                                                             S3288A

         queuing on Penistone Road North and in one side of the gate leaving

         room for loaded ambulances and police vans to exit on the other side

         of the gate.



         Sgt Lightfoot had suggested that some    'walking wounded* might be

         carried in police personnel    carriers and we organised that together

         with police motorcycle escorts to hospital.



         I also instructed that Penistone Road North should be closed at its

         juntion with Leppings Lane/Herries Road to assist emergency vehicles -

         a motorcyclist did this for me.



         I also had the central    reservation cleared of police vehicles so that

         ambulances    could also cross over onto opposite carriagewards.



         Everything    possible was done to assist ambulances arriving and

         departing from the early moments to well    into the night,   but this had

         to be via the gymnasium entrance gate ~ there was no way that they

         could have operated via Gate    ’O ’, the area inside was too restricted

         and congested.

                 In relation to the FA Semi Final of Sunday 12 April                   1987 between Le e d s

                 United and Coventry City?                I attended a briefing at 8.15 am and then

                 took up supervisory duties on Sector 13 — the                   ’tr iang^te" formed by

                 Penistone Road North, Leppings Lane and Vere Road.



                 The operation on this day was the same as on other first team games in

                  relation to that area in that the top and bottom of each road leading

                 between Leppings Lane and Penistone Road North was closed off using a

                  number of barriers a nd these were then manned by constables and

                 supervisory sergeants.                 The reason for the barriers was to prevent

                  football fans from using those particular side streets for parkiry^

                  cars or passing from one end of the football ground to the othei/ thus

                  reducing nuisance for the residents.                  The barriers were manned/from a
                                                                               PAGE
 *   * *                                                                       S32888

           time immediately after the 8.15 am. briefing continually through the

           football match and until officers were stood down after dispersal of

           the fans at the conclusion of the game.



           The officers manning these barriers were not there to vet or check

           fans moving towards the football ground but merely to prevent fans

           causing nuisance to the residents of the side streets.       The only

           checking carried out was if a resident or bone fide person wishing

           access to premises   in a side street approached a barrier either with a

           vehicle or on foot and the barriers would then be moved to/ al 1ow them


 %         in"                                                      /


           I do not remember there being at any time a police c/rdon with

           barriers across Leppings Lane a nd to the best ofyny recollections

           traffic was flowing up and down Leppings Lane throughout my period of

           duty in that area.    My responsibilities did not extend to the area

           immediately outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles and so I cannot

           comment on procedures   in that area but only as far as the junction

           with Vere Road — some 30 — 40 yards from the turnstiles area.

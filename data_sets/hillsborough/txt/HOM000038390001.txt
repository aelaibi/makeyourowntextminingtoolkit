                           QUESTION                  TEN

Why did only 14 of those who died go to hospital?

Mr Higgins SYMAS took a leading role with the injured and fatalities at the
gymnasium. A triage was implemented and the casualties were assessed, those who
were injured and capable of surviving being placed in ambulances which conveyed
them to hospital and those apparently dead placed in the temporay mortuary.
This was a difficult task for Mr Higgins due to the speed casualties were arriving at the
gymnasium. A number of casualties had already been assessed by Mr Higgins and
conveyed to hospital before a doctor arrived and assumed control of the triage, when
many more casualties were conveyed to hospital.

Mr Higgins also arranged the ambulance operation which in spite of problems with
parked vehicles still ran smoothly.

In Mr Higgins experience within the ambulance service he didn't think they could have
saved many lives. Those that died had been in the pens for a longer period than you
would normally expect to be able to successfully resuscitate anyone, they were
cyanosed, the worst cases he had ever seen in his service.

Why only 14 of those who died got to hospital is that the triage implemented by
Mr Higgins SYMAS and continued by the doctor was successful in so much that
valuable spaces in the ambulances were taken up by those capable of
recovering/surviving and not those who were in fact dead.



OBSERVATIONS
This question was raised at the Lord Justice Taylor inquiry. A number of witnesses
gave evidence concerning this matter and their observations would have been
considered by Lord Justice Taylor in his eventual conclusions.

Lord Justice Taylor - Interim Report

296. I say at the outset of this chapter that no valid criticism can be made of the
response by the St John Ambulance Brigade, by SYMAS or by the fire brigade on
15 April. Indeed, no represented party ventured any criticism of them. The only
attack on SYMAS came from two Liverpool doctors. One claimed that ambulances
did not arrive swiftly or with sufficient equipment and that there was a lack of triage.
He was proved to be wrong in all three respects. Unfortunately he had seen fit to go
on television on 15 April when he said more lives could have been saved if staff and
equipment had arrived earlier. Apart from being proved wrong in fact as to the times
of arrival of ambulances, he conceded in evidence that it was not possible to say
whether lives could have been saved. His comments on television were irresponsible.
The other doctor complained of the absence of defibrillators. I am satisfied on
overwhelming evidence that to attempt to use a defibrillator on the pitch with people
milling about would have been highly dangerous owing to the risk of injury from the
electric charge.

301. There was insufficiently close co-operation between the police and the
emergency services. It is clear that SYMAS and the fire brigade should have been
called earlier than they were. However, in view of the nature and extent of the
crushing, the time when police rescue began and the pathetically short period for
which those unable to breathe could survive, it is improbable that quicker recourse to
the emergency services would have saved more lives.

      is correct, sir.   We tried to maintain 10 outside the ground.        '

Q. In practice they reversed in, collected their patients and
   then came out forwards? - A. That is correct.

Q. Did that in practice cause any appreciable delay? - A. I don't
   think so.  It went rather smoothly once the operation got
   underway.

Q. I think the arrangement as per the plan was that initial
   casualties would be taken to the Northern General? - A. That
   is correct.

Q. With the Hallaroshire as the reserve? - A. Yes.

Q. Again, on the day did that part of the plan appear to work
   smoothly? - A. As far as I could see it did, yes, sir.

Q. And also the plan to use the Herries Road bus station as the
   holding point for ambulances, again many were there within a
   short period? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. In fact, possibly surplus to requirements? - A. We had too
   many in the later stages, yes, sir.

Q. Once Mr. Hopkins had taken over from you at the ambulance did
   you divert your attention to the gymnasium? - A. It was
   between the gymnasium area and the ambulance loading area.  I
   was trying to assess patients, priority to move them, sir.

q j   is it right again at the time you declared at major incident
      you had visited the gymnasium at that stage? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. It was then being used as a dining room, but you made the
   request that that be cleared away, and that was done
   immediately? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. Mr. Higgins, you then spent the rest of the day taking a
   leading role in ensuring that the casualties and fatalities
   were then attended to and moved from where they were to where
   they had to be taken? - A. Yes, sir.

                  Cross-Examined by MR. GIBSON-WATT:

Q. Mr. Higgins, when you were asking to be able to attend the
   Semi-Finals you told us that the reason or excuse given to you
   was that the ticket allocation was a matter for the Football
   Association and not the club? - A. That is correct, sir.

Q. You have confirmed, I think, you did not suggest to the club
   that they should take up the problem with the Football
   Association? - A. I didn't press it, sir.

Q. You did not press it, and~so far as you are aware no-one in         --
      SYMAS took up the problem direct with the Football
      Association? - A. Not that I am aware, sir.

                                                  P. HIGGINS

     Q.   You were in charge, until Mr. Hopkins arrived, of the
          gymnasium area, dealing with casualties. May I put to
          you some criticisms that have been made by doctors and
          the press and ask you to comment on them please? A. Yes,
          sir.

     Q.   The first one is that people were being put into ambulances
B         in any order.   What do you say to that? A. No, that's
          not correct, sir.   I was assessing patients as they came
          through.  It was rather difficult, as they were coming
          rather quickly.

     Q.   The second suggestion is that it required a doctor who was
          a spectator in the crowd to assume control and make sure
          that those still alive and most seriously injured got off
          to hospital first.  What do you say about that?   A. Well,
          we had transported a number of casualties before that
          doctor arrived on the scene, sir, and many more after.

     Q.   There is also an allegation that at least 30 people would
          still be alive if there had been a rapid response with
          basic medical facilities.  What do you say about that?
j)        A.  It's difficult to say.  In my experience within the
          Ambulance Service, I don't think we could have saved many
          lives down there, sir.

          Why is that, Mr. Higgins?   A. The people that were
          coming out of the ground, when the bodies started to
          come out ---

£    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  You mean out from the pens?
          A.  Out from the pens, yes, sir. They had been there
          for a longer period than you would normally expect to be
          able to successfully resuscitate anyone.  By the colour
          of them, they were so cyanosed, they were the worst cases
          I've ever seen in my service, sir.

               Mr. KALLIPETIS: Lastly, Mr. Higgins, can you help
          us with some of the equipment that has been variously
          described here, and I think inaccurately described in
          terms of its function?   Could you just look at and snow
          his Lordship what a Brooks airway looks like, please?
          You cannot tell us what a Brooks airway looks like,
          because we have not got one! But we have got some mouth­
          pieces here, I think.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Perhaps in the course of the
          day we might see one.

                 Mr. KALLIPETIS:   We can arrange for one to be brought,
          sir.

               LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  And perhaps also it would be
          helpful to me, Mr. Kaltipetis, if oh one sheet of paper
H         you could put the hierarchy of your officers.

                 Mr. KALLIPETIS:   Certainly we will do that, sir.
                                                                       159

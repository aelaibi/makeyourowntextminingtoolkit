Detective Constable 2088   *F* Division
Hammerton Road Police Station.

At 12.00 noon on Saturday 15 April 1989, I commenced duty at Hammerton Road
Police Station. My duties included sub-divisional C.I.D cover whilst the
FA cup semi-final tie was being played at Hillsborough stadium.

Between 12.00 noon and 3.^0.pm I was engaged with sub-divisional crime
enquiries.
At 3.40.pm I was instucted by Det Sgt 17^5 Sturgess to attend at the Royal
Hallamshire hospital Sheffield as it was understood that bodies were being
conveyed to the hospital after events that had taken place at the football ground.

On arrival at the hospital I was accompanied by Det Sgt STUEGESS, Pol Cons
NOTTINGHAM and Det Cons LEWIN and we saw a large number of persons who had
sustained various injuries.
There was one body at the hospital.

At 6.20.pm we were informed that no bodies were to be taken to the hospital and
we attended at the gymnasium at Sheffield Wednesday Football Club which was
being used as a temporary mortuary.

On arrival there I saw a large number of bodies that had already been laid out
and numbered and I assisted with placing the bodies into bags.

The bodies had already been photographed to assist relatives in making an initial
identification and after a photographic identification had been made I assisted
with making the bodies presentable by washing faces and generally cleaning
visible debris from the bodies. The bodies were then placed on trolleys and
taken to the 'viewing' area for identification. When an identification had been
made the bodies were handed to the ambulance service who arranged transport to
convey them to the Medico-Legal-Centre together with the officer in cahrge
of the identification and the relevant paperwork.

My duty finished at 5»00«am on Sunday 16 April 1989*

Crewed with Ambulanceman


Our first case of the afternoon was an admission from Skyedge to Nether
Edge Hospital. Whilst on the ward at Nether Edge I caught a brief glimpse
of what I took to be crowds of people on a football pitch.

On returning to the ambulance the volume of radio traffic made us aware
that something had occurred at Hillsborough Football Ground.

On contacting Control we were directed to the Penistone Road entrance of
the ground, I was driving. As we joined Infirmary Road a Police car
escorted us to the ground.

On arrival at Parkside Road, I attempted to turn into Parkside Road
intending to approach the Football ground at the Penistone Road entrance,
but could not due to a large number of Policeman who directed us to
Leppings Lane. This we did.

We turned into Leppings Lane and then into the Perimeter Road. There was a
huge crowd, Police and civilians pointing to what we shortly saw to be a
group of casualties. We drove forward between two lines of casualties.
There were no other emergency vehicles in view, neither ambulance, fire or
police, but police were in attendance.

Upon leaving the vehicle, my attendant and I stayed together and began to
examine the casualties. The exact number I was unable to estimate, we
quickly became aware that the casualties were unconscious. We removed the
nearside stretcher and placed it next to a casualty. We were so near to
the casualties that we hardly had to move any distance with the cot.

We loaded the stretcher and patient and immediately took the other
stretcher out of the vehicle. We asked one of the crowd to stay with the
patient whilst we loaded a second casualty. He looked in a critical state.
All this took only seconds.

As we attempted to load the second casualty, a group of people rushed
forward and loaded a further unconscious casualty onto the ambulance. I
told the crowd to lay him down and folded a blanket to make a pillow.
Whilst this was in progress my attendant and some police officers were
holding the stretcher.  Immediately this patient was laid down, we loaded
the patient still on the stretcher onto the ambulance.

    We then began to operate the resuscitator on the first patient we had
    loaded. My colleague administered oxygen to the other two casualties. On
    closing the ambulance doors my attention was drawn to a further male
    casualty who was lying at the edge of the road. He was breathing and I
    instructed the person who had called my attention to him to stay with him.
    I turned him into the coma position. He was breathing. At the same time
    my attention was drawn to a further casualty who appeared to have an arm
    injury. I confirmed this by speaking to him and since he was able to walk
    I instructed him to get into the cab of the ambulance. I fastened the seat
    belt around him and asked him if he was all right. He said he was and then
    drove the ambulance forward along the Perimeter Road towards Penistone
    Road. I believe I saw an ambulance as I drove past the Director's
    entrance, but cannot be sure. This was some way from the location where we
    had loaded the casualties.

    There were crowds of people everywhere. As we joined Penistone Road I saw
    at least two other ambulances, being escorted by a police motor cycle. I
    followed on and carried on   to the Northern General Hospital Accident and
    Emergency Hospital as part of the column of vehicles.

    I tried to radio Control on the ERC Channel but was unable to get through.

    At the Northern General we quickly unloaded, as there was a large number of
    staff awaiting our arrival.

    We began to return to the ground and on the way a radio broadcast advised
    us to report to gate '0* on Penistone Road which we did.

    At the ground we joined a small queue of ambulances being filtered in turn
    into the ground, near what I found out later was the gymnasium. We were
    directed into the casualty   loading point by Station Officer P Eason. I
    also saw Superintendent T   Dale and in the distance, Station Officer P
    Higgins.

    We loaded a patient, and immediately began adminstering oxygen. I was
    assisted by Ambulanceman Tony Edwards, who had initially come to our
    vehicle requesting supplies of bandages.

    At this point my attendant took our second stretcher and assisted by
    Ambulanceman              went to collect a second vehicle.

    At this point Ambulanceman Edwards returned to his own vehicle and I stayed
    with the patient, still administering oxygen. Shortly afterwards my
    attendant returned with a patient on the stretcher on a drip. He was
    accompanied by             , He had obviously been treated and I was told
    he had a fractured femur.

    We loaded this patient, reversed out of the ground on to Penistone Road and
    set off back to the Northern General Hospital. We once again quickly
    unloaded at the Northen General and returned to Gate *0'. We parked in a
    queue of ambulances and shortly afterwards we were directed by P Eason to
    standby at Herries Road Bus Garage. Which we did. We stoodby at Herries
    Road for half an hour or more, before being directed back to Gate 'O' at
    the ground.

    Assistant Chief Ambulance Officer D Jones was present, who after a short
    interval stood down all crews present who were on normal duties. We
    contacted Control and were returned to base. We carried on normal duties
    and finished duty at 2205.

    Whilst waiting at Gate '0* before proceeding to Herries Road many
    spectators approached the crews to offer thanks for their help.

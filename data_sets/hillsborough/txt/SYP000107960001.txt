'El' Sub-Division




From   where     I was       standing       prior       to   the match I had          a clear view of              fans

approaching the West Stand turnstiles from Leppings Lane.

From about 12 onwards there was a steady influx of supporters, most in happy

spirits.       A surprising number arrived without tickets and told they wouldn't

be    allowed    in,    others       claimed          they had   to collect        tickets      at    the    players

entrance.            These    had     to    be    directed       around      the   ground       to    the    players

entrance.

A lot of Forest supporters tried to get through the sterile area but had to

be sent round the ground.

A    number     of    infirm    and    elderly          were   escorted      through      the     area      to    other

officers.

As the crowds seemed to grow more Forest supporters tried to get through the

sterile       area.     A number       that were         sent back said,           "You can't send us back

through that lot they're fighting back there", referring to Liverpool fans.

A man brought his young                lad       to the      barrier   and    said,      "We'll      have    to stay

here    you     can't        take    kids        in    there",    (referring        to    the     crush      at     the

turnstiles).

The    crowds    continued          to grow and about            ten to three        the whole of Leppings

Lane was       alive.        Fans were      pushing and shoving as kick off neared.                              People

near    the    front    were        getting more         distressed.         The   fans were         shouting       and

chanting.       It was obvious a number were worse the wear for drink.
Fans were climbing onto the turnstiles and walls.

The numbers were immense, impossible to control,                            they were being forced from

Leppings Lane around the corner further towards the sterile area.

The atmosphere wasn't normal,                   people near the front seemed genuinely afraid

and a number         of parents       dragged       their children out of the queue and stood

near    the barrier.           Women were        screaming,      one had mascara all down her face

and she was still being pushed forward unable to move either way.

Suddenly       the    door     opened      a     little   (the    concertina        door       subject   to    the

dispute),      not known why.             At that, what seemed thousands of fans surged for

the    opening       forcing      their    way    through.       We    had    to stand back or else we

would    have    been      crushed.        The    fans were      shouting obscenities             at us like,

"Fucking pigs", "couldn't control a piss up in a brewery" and "You Bastards"

were just a few of the comments I recall.

A    mounted    officer       forced his way         through      the crowd        and    the door was        then

shut again.          I don't know how many had gone through on this first surge, but

no doubt a number didn't have any tickets.

As it neared kick off the tension got worse,                           the shouting and screaming was

sickening,       and Leppings Lane was              still    full of rowdy youths,               still pushing

forward.

At    kick off       the    atmosphere      was    frightening,        the pushing didn't stop,               just

seemed more       intense.         People were        screaming and being hurt in the crush at

the turnstiles.

A    radio   message        was   heard    that     assistance        was    required     on    the   pitch,    or

words to that effect.              Most officers interpreted it as a pitch invasion.

Most of our serial ran towards the South Stand.                              I remained with about three

others outside the concertina door.

There    was    no    way    we    could       control    anybody,     it    was   like    one    body   of men

against so few Police Officers.
A    radio   message    was   then   received     to   open   the   gates.     There was      a short

delay and then         the gates     opened,    at which a second stronger surge went for

the light.

We   had to stand back and let them run past us.                    I was genuinely afraid and

realised at this point that the event was totally out of hand.

I heard a couple of tannoy messages advising supporters                            to stop pushing.   I

don't recall any other messages.

After the rush a number of people started walking back out of the gates                             and

away from the ground in a daze.

One man      said to me,      "You'd better go in there love,               there's a man laid on

the flo or, looks like h e 's dea d".

At first I thought this was a turn of phrase,                   but went       into the area behind

the turnstiles and in front of the tunnel.

There    were   a number      of people      laying on the     floor.        I was glancing        round

deciding     who needed       my   attention first when I set my            eyes      upon   the first

dead person - a young man lay obviously dead.                       It was then that I realised

the seriousness of the incident.

The people      there,    I didn't     know if they'd fallen in              therush or been moved

there from the stands, I only knew they needed help.                         We were trying to       get

on the radio to get ambulances but the airways seemed to be full.

A large number of fans were walking round this area in a daze, some crying.

Others were      shouting at Police            Officers,   "Fucking dosomething,          that's    what

you're paid      for you bastards".            Others were shouting, "Murderers".

I was knelt      tending to one lad who was breathing but unconscious.                        The word

"Murderers"      kept    ringing     in my     ears    and I was    numb.     How could anyone be

talking to us like this, we were helping.                  Officers were resuscitating large

numbers of people.
I carried        a number of people away from this area back outside                                 the gate in

fear that if the ground should be emptied they would be crushed again.

I strained myself literally helping to carry bodies that were too heavy.

Dead bodies were being lined up at the                          fence at the      entrance to the rear of

the South Stand.              I feared 15-20 may be             dead.

A doctor grabbed me shouting,                        "Who's in charge of priority cases?"                 I asked

him to assist.

He then began showing me who he thought needed the more urgent attention.                                           I

then began directing the ambulances to the cases in turn.

By this time fans were stood staring at                         the dead, a number still blaming the

Police.          Even    then      I       didn't    know   the extent        of the    disaster inside       the

ground.         I thought that the dead that we carried out were the only ones.

I gave cardiac massage on a youth for what seemed an eternity.                                        The lad was

eventually placed in an ambulance.                           I prayed he lived!             The smell of stale

ale and vomit remained with me.

I   was    confronted         on       a    couple    of    occasions    by   fans     hurling    abuse, but        I

didn't reply, I was sick inside.

I then took some doctors to the gym at the request of someone who                                      said there

were more casualties inside.

I couldn't believe              the scene when I walked inside.                  I dealt with all of the

bodies in there, my job being the logging of property                                 and later returning       it

to the families as they arrived to identify the dead.

I   will       never    forget         the    Hicks    sisters.    I    stood   near     to    them      as their

parents        identified them and then I had to return their property.                                 Mr Hicks

said      to   me,     "All    you         bastards    in a blue uniform        are    to    blame      for this,

you've murdered my daughters".                        I didn't reply, I was near to tears.
                                      - 5 -


    I feel that this should be mentioned following the recent TV coverage given

    to Mr Hicks over the abuse he has received from officers.   I realise he was

    in shock.

         Purpose of Meeting



SES2.5               meeting on 10th F e b r u a r y 1981, and ° ^ i n a U y ref erred t=

visit'on 7uh April had been a special cne in-view-of-the- Stadium being tn*
venue on 11th April for a F.A. Cup Semi-Final match.

2.      Inspection of     Stadium

The r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s made a joint inspection of the Stadium.

(a)     South Stand

The progress of the monitoring of the apparent deflection in the steel
t r u s s e s ° r e f erred to at the meeting on 10th February was queried but, ia
the absence of Dr. W, Eastwood, no specific answer could be given.

It was noted that the monitoring device to-be sited adjacent to the new
metal case for the batteries supplying the emergency power supply for tr.«
public address system (referred to at the meeting on 7th April) had )e. uo
be provided.

 (b)    West Stand

Th® cracked brickwork at the rear of the_stand, as well as the apparent
distress on the concrete pillars supporting the steps at the rear of tne                _
stand and the cracks in the concrete at the top of both sets o. stairs,
had been made good.

As previously agreed, as soon as a grinder was next present at the Stadium
the Club would round off the steel supports to tne new emergency e.-.it
 (nearest to the South Stand).

 Following experiences at the F.A. Cup Semi-Final match the Club vere
 mnsiderina revised arrangements on the terracing m front of the Stand.
 An assurance was given that the Officer Working Party would be consulted
 when these had substance.
 (c)     North-West Terrace

 The two small areas where water seepage had continued to take place after
 treatment had now been satisfactorily treated.

 It was also n o t e d ' that the tie bars through the upper level concrete
 area to the rear had been -protectively wrapped.

 (d)     North Stand

 The expansion cracks in the wall of the North Stand (nearest to the Spion
 Kop) had been made good.

 (e)     Spion Kop

 The   infillin’ of the step adjacent to the handrail on the left of the
 original   exit at the top of the Kop had not been done to date but would           ;
 be attended to shortly.

 The temporary barrier of scaffolding tubes erected between the end of the
 neJ K o p exit'outer barriers and the concrete pillar of the lowest or the
 K o p original exit steps (adjacent to the new brick built chip shop) prior
 to the F A. Cup Semi-Final match remained. However, the Club intended to
   “ n(1 the existing barriers to fill the gap on a permanent basis and to
 level off the area between the bottom of the new Kop exit staircase and the
 original Kop exit steps prior to the commencement of the forthcoming season.

 It was noted :-
 /• \        the steel girders with mesh on top adjoining the wall at the _
 rear of the Butcher’s Shop on Penistone Road required attention because or
 corrosion, and (ii) that thetop of_the brick built w a U oecweea cne Spio-
 Kop and the South Stand required pointing.

                                   Radial Fences at Leppings Lane End

           We have                b e e n       instructed by the Club to organise the
  installation of two radial fences on the terrace at the
 Leppings lane end of the ground.

           It is intended that these fences are so positioned
  that they divide this section of the terrace into
 ^ p r o x i m a t e l y three equal areas, each served by its own
..'■'"entrance.
           By dividing the terrace more control over supporters
  should result.                          A visiting team with only a few followers
  will be allocated one section, with.the other two sections
  retained by the home supporters.

            Larger contingents of visiting spectators could be
  accommodated in two or all three areas as their numbers

  dictate.
            A 1.15 metre wide gate is proposed at the rear of
  each fence to give access for maintenance and also policing
  during a game.                            The gate could be left open, but fastened
   back, to connect the areas during a game if adjacent ones


                                                                  Registered in E n g la n d — No. 1134531

     are accupied by supporters of the same team.                           When establishing
      the height we have considered that the views to the corner
      flags should not be restricted any further than they are at
      present by the perimeter fence.                   We therefore propose that the
      top of the fence should be approximately ISSOmia above the
      terrace.
             This may not prevent the odd spectator climbing the fence
      but should eliminate a mass invasion from one area to the other.
 -    Fences this height appear to work successfully at St. James’s
      Park, the home of Newcastle United.

 4^           We would be pleased if this specific point can be discussed
      within the Working Party and your comments forwarded to us.

      various locations- around the north-stand. - Now the gymnasium is
      open to the general public security to ether parts of the ground
      must be maintained.             It is proposed that gates are provided at
      the top of the ramps at both ends of the stand with additional
      gates at ground floor level at the Penistone Road end of the
      stand.       A separate gate will be placed behind the west ramp to.
      prevent people going round the rear of the gymnasium towards

Nov"that the' gyma'sium- was7"open” to .the general public, the Club wished to
erect security gates' at^. the top of ;the ramps at both ends_ of the North
Stand, with additional gates at'ground floor level at the'Penistone.Road
end of the Stand.— A- separate gate would also be placed behind the West....
Ramp to prevent people going round the rear of the gynnasium towards .
Lepping? Lane.

These gates would .be fastened when the gymnasium only was in use so as to                  .
•provide 'security for'the rest of the ground. . However, on match days they
would be secured in the fully open position to allow unrestricted access.-^

IT WAS AGREED that Mr. Vaughan should notify Messrs. Eastwood^ and Partners’
that the Officer Working Party sees no objection to the erection ox security
gates around the North‘Stand, subject to* the gates and/or^their supports,*
hinges, etc not impinging’on the existing critical ramp widths, and to the
gates being’secured in the fully open position on match days. .

It was recalled that the.existing unsatisfactory police and first aid _
facilities under the North Stand had Been accepted on an^interim basis.
The Club had undertaken to provide purpose built facilities in a similar
position to the existing timbered facilities ^during the 1980 close
season. Whilst some progress ‘had been made in discussing details of t..s
facilities, no firm indication   had yetBeangiven asto when they would
actually be provided.    _                          .

IT WAS AGREED that Mr..D, Vaughan should press the       Cluband/or its ^
Consultants   for a firm indication as to wnen tne       new police and firsw
aid facilities are to-.-Be provided.

5.       Lottery Ticket Boxes

Attention was drawn to the blocked egresswhichcouldresult    if the
timber lottery ticket Boxes presently sited close to the ramps were to
be tipped over or ignited, either■accidentally or deliberately.

IT WAS AGREED that Mr, Vaughan should draw the Club’s attention to the
desirability of re-siting the lottery ticket boxes.

      -id facilities under the.North Stand had been accepted on an interim
      Ssif     the'understanding 'thaf the Club would provide purpose b u n t
            o n "


      replacement facilities in the 1980 close season.

      Tt is appreciated that discussions on the detailed requirements >re ^
      still continuing, but it is filt that the Club
      a firm indication when the new police and first aid faci-i
      be provided.

Dear Sir

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB
SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Further to your communication dated 31st      December/   1981/   the   following
observations are made for your attention.

1.      The proposed erection of pairs of gates at the bottom of the 2
        staircases at the rear of the west stand is acceptable with the
        provision that they are maintained in the open position on match days.

2.      It is confirmed that the radial fences are found to be satisfactory.

Yours faithfully

As the Annual winter inspection of the'Hillsborough Stadium is^due
to take place anytime around now, I would suggest the opportunity be
taken to discuss these matters at the inspection.

Perhaps you would contact Hr. D. Vaughan of my staff (extension 422)
so that the necessary arrangements may be made.

 For the attention of' M r . D « V aughan


 Dear Mr. Vaughan,                                         •
                                           Safety of Sports Ground Act
                      Thank you for your letter of 20 January.
                      I b e l i e v e -the small, number of points needing
 clarification have already been*discussed between
 John Strange and Mr. Sheriff.                                                 One of these refer to the
^ f c d for a goal post type frame over the gates but this is
 in fact already provided by the sheeting frame.                                                                       There is
 also a small amount of rust staining arising from misplacement
 o f reinforcement in the 100mm thick retaining wall.                                                                         There
 is no immediate danger arising from this and an appropriate
 maintenance repair will be carried out.                                                                           _
                      Turning now to the- radial barriers on the West
 terrace it is of course accepted that where there is a
  crush barrier passing through or close to the radial barrier
  it will make it easier for anyone who so wishes to climb
 over.                Nevertheless we believe it is not unreasonable to
  leave the crush barriers as they are.                                                        If all barriers
 were removed back to a distance say 1.2m from the fence it
  would.mean a 2.4m wide gap which is not protected by barriers.

    There would be a consequent loss of calculated spectator                              _
    capacity which is undesirable from the C l u b ’s point of
    view.         However from the point of view of safety a strip
    of that width without a single crush barrier would be a

    major hazard.
            It should be kept in mind that the introduction
     of these radial barriers has effected a very, great
  I m p r o v e m e n t from the point of view of segregation of
  'Spectators but to achieve perfection from the point of
     view of segregation brings with it other disadvantages.

   ••between the- 'various interests.
             In the second paragraph on this subject you
     refer to dangerous pieces of rails protruding from the
     crush barriers.              I have not had an opportunity to check
     this since receiving your letter but I am informed that
     the word ’d an g er ou s 1 is a little exaggerated and they
     do not of course protrude into- a gangway as there is no
     cangwav at this position.
   ^       ’ with regard to the security gates around the North
■T 'r stand the point at issue is whether the encroachment into

     the gate width is at all critical-,-                   The remaining clear
     width is 3.300mm which is equivalent to a six unit exit.
     Thus the theoretical number of people who can get out in
     eight minutes using the green book figure of 60 people
     per minute per exit width is 5,760 shared between the two
     routes.          The stand capacity is of course 10,000 and in
     practice more than half the number tend to use the lower
     exits since most spectators are reluctant to walk uphill
     to the upper set of exit stairways.                      The picture is that
      fewer than 5,000 people will be trying to get out of
      exits which can accommodate 5,760 in eight mj.nut.es.
"ASTWOOD & PARTNERS




           There were very good structural reasons for placing
   the gates in this way.   The theoretical exit capacity has
   not been changed since it was always a six unit gateway.
   There is no funnelling effect, and there is a good
   'reservoir' area upstream of the gates.
           I telephoned your office yesterday but gather
   you were on leave and have again telephoned this morning
   with a view to agreeing a tentative date for the winter
  meeting of the working party.    I will try again in the
   next day or so.

 1   .      Purpose of Meeting—                           - *

 The purpose of the meeting was to discuss-the apparent difference of opinion
 on certain aspects of the radial barriers installed on the West Terrace
 and the security gates at the top of the North stand rasps, as well as to
 carry out the usual winter inspection or the Stadium.

            Ground Inspection

 A.         West Terrace

  Whilst the whole Terrace had yet to be used, the matches played since the
e r e c t i o n of the radial barriers indicated that generally they worked well and
Satisfactorily effected the segregation of opposing groups of fans.

 However the police pointed out that in peaces the existing crush barriers
 had be°n extended up to and, in some cas'es, completely through the new
 radial barriers, which had the effect of making it relatively easy for anyone
 who wished to do so to climb from one pen to another. Also, m the pen
 nearest to the South Stand, a small length of existing crush barrier had been
  left unsupported.

  IT WAS AGREED -

  (i)   That on balance, it was preferable from a safety point of view to
  prevent crowd surge by the existing barriers being extended up to and/or
  through the new radial barriers than to completely prevent persons being
  able to climb from one pen to another, subject to review at the end of the
  current season.

     (ii)   That the unsupported small length of existing crush barrier would
  be cut off.

                                             -1-
B.       West Stand '

One of the security gates which the Club wished to instal at the bottom of
the two staircases had now been erected.

IT WAS AGREED         that this could be regarded as satisfactory.

    C.   North Stand

The Fira Service felt that the manner in which the security gates had been
installed at the top of the ramps unduly restricted the exit width available.

    The Club’s Consultants and the Fire Service disagreed on the interpretation
    of paragraph 16 of the "Green Guide", and consequently on tne n g u r e to be
    anolied°in the calculation for assessing whether the exit width lost at the top
    of" the ramps by the method of security gate installation was critical or not.

    IT W\S AGREED   that, as the point might well have been covered in the
    initial consideration of the Club’s application for a General Safety
    Certificate, the point would not be pursued at the moment.

^         NOTE - A' search of the file subsequentlyrevealed that, as
                 suspected, the point had been considered at a
                 meeting of the Officer Working Party on 12.-2.79,
                  the relevant part of the Note of the meeting jreading:-

                      iithe'construction and width of the ramps being
                       such that they could quite,properly be
                       regarded as elevate'! roadways .

    D.    Spion Kop

•It was noted that the infilling of the step adjacent to the handrail on
 the i ^ t of the original exit at the top of the Kop had taken place: that
 the boundary fence at the to? of the Kop had been reinforced, and that tne
 existin'7 barriers had been permanently extended and tne area a ^ t h e foot
 of the new Kop exit (adjacent to the brick built refreshment point)
    levelled off as agreed.

^E.       South Stand

    The agreement to visually inspect the ro'oT trusses for apparent deflection
    after exceptional gale or snow loading conditions  vasrecalled.

    F.    Items of General Maintenance

    IT WAS AGREED     that the following items of general maintenance required
    attention:-

    (i)   The rourdin* off of the corners on the steelwork of the underside of
    the exit "at the southerly end of the West Stand (to be done that day), as
    well as the rounding off of the brackets to the North Stand security gates.

     (ii) Thn repair or replacement of the corroding stanchions supporting the
     fencing and”sheeting above the boundary wall on the right hand side of
     Gate "0".

fvi) The concrete supporting strut to the vail between the Spion Kop and
the South Stand (nearest to the Spion Kop) to be protected (cracks an-
'exposed bar).

G.               Temporary Structures

            p r e s s e d as Co the possibility of inadequate structural stability
of teiporary structures, such as scaffolding used in connection vith
television transmissions.

        • 9 n of rhe Club’s General Safety Certificate required T.V. cameras
In” 5o“L b l e equipment to be placed only in such positions as may be agreeo
and po_ccDJ.e h v                        x b x         generally required to

 C.              Widening of Walkway and Erection of New Fence

     Because of drainage problems, the existing concrete panel fence to the
     rear of the Spion Kop (nearest to the Owls Club) had had to be removed.
     When settlement vas complete, it was intended to viden the exl.tj.ng
     walkway and erect a new fence on the revised line.

  1.     Purpose of Meeting

      purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
' Stadium in accordance with the>Policy of twice yearly visits to Football
  League Grounds in South Yorkshire-

  -P;;   jrpprid• -In-SpKC<             t*                          " "   .2         — .1   -V“


  A.     South Stand          ’

  The alterations and extensions to the understand area of the Stand (which
  had been completed since the "summer" inspection) were shown to the Officer
  Working Party. .

   IT WAS AGREED -

   (i)   That any further areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at
   the rear of the Stand would continue to be monitored and receive attention
   by the Club as a matter of maintenance.

3®ii)   That the unsecured wire to the illuminated "Exit" sign in the Match
  Day Sponsors Lounge would receive attention by the Club.

   (iii) That the remaining bridge between the Stand and the Club at the rear
   of the Stand (now used solely as a means of escape from the Kitchen area)
   should be infilled with mesh_from a safety point of view to accord strictly
   with the appropriate Regulations.

   (iv) That the two emergency lights in the Club not operative at the time
   of the inspection would receive urgent attention by the Club.

   B.    West Stand and Terrace

   The Club recalled the practice followed in consultation with the South
   Yorkshire Police of separating home and visiting supporters at the rear
   of the Stand at certain matches (such as with Liverpool) by erecting
   temporary barriers. This worked well but on all other normal occasions it
   was the policy of the Police to aim for exclusive use by visiting supporters
   of the West Stand and Terrace. On those occasions when the number of
   visiting supcorters was small and the weather was inclement, it was
   obviously desirable to allow home supporters access to a sheltered area.
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)   That the Club would consider at some future date a scheme for
nermanent barriers at the rear of the Stand, subject to any proposals
being submitted for prior approval by the Officer Working Party m the
usual way.

(ii) That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical cci-vmn
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii) That the apparent rusting of the steel columns at the rear of the
Stand should receive appropriate treatment by the Club.

C.     North West Terrace

No comments.

D.     North Stand

IT WAS AGREED that so long as larger, not easily combustible, materials
continued to be stored in the timber screened store area under the Stand,

had been removed from the top of the wall between the Spion Kop and the
South Stand, and that the damaged corrugated metal sheeting between the
Spion Kop and the South Stand had been replaced.       .

IT WAS AGREED -

 (i)   That the condition of the roof of.the tunnel exit from the Kop should
continue to be monitored.

(ii) That the Club would carry out the pointing work to the outer perimeter
wall on Penistone Road once the frosts had ceased.

F.     Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons (first mentioned at the
inspection on 29th February, 1984) had yet to be carried out by the Club.

 IT WAS AGREED that the visual inspection of the lighting pylons would be
 carried out by the Club in the near future (weather conditions permitting).

 3.    Public Address System

 and the P o l i c e -confirmed that reports received indicated that it was noticeably
 better than the previous system.

          ■Segregation of Visiting Spectators at Leppings Lane E n d

              The club is anxious to segregate the visiting team's supporters
      as they enter the ground, and also to enable the police to control

      their exit at the end of a game.                               •
          we have prepared the scheme shown on the attached print of our
      drawing 6705/2. This involves the construction of two new banks o
      turnstiles              (Nos 17 - 21 and 22 - 29), and various runs of fencing


  *    nd I t^wou l ^ b e appreciated if the Working Party could consider this
      proposal at an early date. Mr Chester has already given a copy of
      the drawing to the police so that they have had some advance notice.




                                                                       Yours sincerely,

        1.     Purpose of Meeting

        The purpose of the meeting was to consider the letter dated 9th AP ^
    A     a n l a n from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners relating to the proposals of
^       the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club to construct two new banks of
        turnstiles and various runs of fencing and new_gates m order to achieve
        segregation of visiting supporters at the Leppmgs Lane end of the
        Hillsborough Stadium.

        2.* 'Consideration of •Proposals        ..          . . . -   •«- •        •   -

        ThP Police representatives pointed out that the proposals had been
            m n t p d in the main by comments they had made to the Club. At one
        Z*°     both the West Stand and Terrace had been regarded as exclusively
        f'r^he use of visiting supporters, but recent patterns of attendances
        at t h e Stadium made it necessary Co allow for some element ol use y
        home supporters as well.

        The proposals now outlined by the Club were generally acceptable to the
        Police representatives, subject to.~

               additional gates being provided between the turnstile numbered 16
         (a)
               and the wall of the inner access road;

V              the central area of the Terrace (indicated a s 'the neutral area or
         (b)
               visiting supporters1 terrace) being divided m half by a new
               central radial fence running from the tunnel entrance to the
               pitchside security fence with gates erected so as to permit entry
               to be diverted to either half as appropriate^(the proposed ne*
               secondary radial fence adjacent to the existing f e n c e _ indicated
                on the plan to be abandoned),

         (c) the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters’
              terrace) also to be divided in half by a n e w c e n t r a l radial fence
              running from back to front with two gates (the existing radial
              fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - :   neutral area and
              home supporters - to have a second gate installed,

          m     the existing pitch perimeter fence to have additional exit gates
                installed - one in the neutral area and one m the home supporters
                area

                                                     1.

        Dear Sir

        SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975
        S^^FIELD WEDNESDAY FC

        Further to the joint meeting on 18 April 1985, to discuss the proposals for
        new crovrd control arrangements, the means of escape implications have now
        been considered. The scheme would appear to be satisfactory providing that
        certain gates have the minimum widths (in metres) as indicated on the enclosed
        plan. It is understood that these gates will be supervised by either the police
        or club officials.

        Should you require any further information, please do not hesitate to Contact
        this Department.

        Yours faithfully

        Dear Sirs,

        Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1985
        Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

        In reply to your letter dated 9th April, whilst a meeting of the
        Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) was held on 18th April

        aspects.

        following points and to the submission of detailed plans and
        calculations under both the Safety of Sports Grounds Act and
        Building Regulations, the proposals outlined are regarded as
        generally acceptable

        (a)   additional gates being provided between the turnstile
              numbered 16 and the wall of the inner access road;

              entrance to the pitchside security fence with gates erected
              so as to permit entry to be diverted to either half as
              appropriate (the proposed new secondary radial fence
              adjacent to the existing fence indicated on the plan to be
              abandoned) ;

         (c) the right hand area of the Terrace (indicated as home supporters'
            • terrace) also to be divided in half by a new central radial

              radial fence dividing the present two Terrace areas - neutral
              area and home supporters — to have a second gate installed)?

   For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan

   Dear. Mr. Vaughan,
                            Safety of Sports Ground Act 1975
                          Sheffield Wednesday 'Football Club 'PLC
                     Thank you for your letter of 2 May giving the comments
   of the Officer Working Party on the proposals which we sent
   to you on 9 April.
                     In the interim period several of the points which you
   ^raised had already been incorporated in our latest scheme
   which has yet to be considered by the Club Board.                                                        However I
   would .ask that further consideration should be given to the
   request in paragraph                              (c) of your letter for a second gate to
   be installed in the radial barrier and for the new radial
   barrier which you have asked for to have two gates.'                                                      If these
   gates are meant for use in emergency it would mean having                                                              a
    steward in attendance on each occasion, the expense of which
   would hardly be justified.                                        It is our view that in the event of
    emergency,spectators can be evacuated quickly enough by the
    gates on to the pitch and by the normal exit gates at the rear.
   We will of course be prepared to discuss the matter with the
    Fire Officer's staff should you so wish.

                                                                                     Yours sincerely,

 Dear Sirs,

 Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975
 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club pic

 As requested by your letter dated 16 th July, I have written a confirmatory
 letter to the Club regarding the steel sheeting and non-slip surface of
 the timber deck to the South Stand upper seated area (copy attached for
 your information).

  I understand that applications for building regulation/planning approval^
 -iiavS^«eiv--Sade*                         :3i> 'rs^rctnis^tiCn ^of^cnccs- * *
v and turnstiles and 'allrsrations to toilet facilities-at the rear or ■tne---- ■-
  West Stand, Leppings Lane, and (ii) erection of roof and enclosure to the
  Soion Kop Terrace.

 The Officer Working Party considered and gave approval in principle to the
 rear of the West Stand re-organisation proposals in May but, other than
 brief mentions by the Club or yourselves at routine meetings of the^
 possibility of the Spion Kop being enclosed, no outline plans or details
 of such proposals have been considered to date.

 As on orevious occasions, I am assuming that you will subnit the necessary
 detailed plans, specifications and calculations for Safety of Sports Grounds
 Act approval (bearing in mind the General Safety Certificate requirement
 to crvo the County Council at least 21 days notice of any proposed
 alterations or extensions at the Ground) should the Club decide to implement
 the proposals after building regulation/planning permission consideration.

                                                                   Yours faithfully,

The purpose of the meeting was tc consider the detailed plans submitted by the
letter dated 25th July from Messrs. Eastvood and Partners of arrangements
for the segregation of visiting spectators at the Leppings Lane End of the
Hillsborough Stadium of the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club. It was
recalled that consideration cf outline proposals had taken place by the
Officer Working Party on 18th April, 1985- Whilst formal application had been
made for Building Regulation approval and some of the work had actually
 commenced, Messrs. Eastwood and Partners had apologised by 'phone that
 submission of the detailed proposals for Safety of Sports Grounds Act
 approval had apparently been overlooked due to pressure of work and staff
holidays. The plans also included details of repairs to certain crush

.2. •   Consideration of Proposals

 The 14 detailed plans,submitted were each considered and discussed individually

'IT WAS AGREED-- that, subject to t h e ’following points -and to the submission of
 the necessary detailed calculations to the Building'Authority, the proposals
 for segregating visiting supporters at the leppings Lane End of the
 Hillsborough Stadium were generally acceptable:—

 (a)    Plan No. 6705/6 - for both security access and emergency egress purposes
 a pitch perimeter fence gate to be provided;

 (b)    Plan No. 6705/8A - the new handrail by Turnstile 23 to be either
 shortened or re-aligned’so as to maintain the exit width between the outer
 (river) wall and Turnstile 23, and the exit width between Turnstile 16 and
 the new handrail not to be less than the width of the roller shutter gate
 between Turnstiles 16 and 17;

 (c)    Plan No. 6705/9A - the single block thickness of the interal walls
 (e.<*. the cubicles) is not considered to be substantial enough, and a
 substantial stud partition (timber or steel - suitably faced) is felt to
 be required;

  (d)   Plan No. 6705/10A - same comments as for plan 9A;

 (e)   Plan No. 6705/11A - no objection in principle, but details of exact
 location required;

  (f)   Plan No. 6705/12 - no objection in principle, but no barrier                                height
  Indicated;

     )     Plan No. 6705/14A - so long as increased thickness is achieved by steep
      ■oes as indicated on the plan and not by "stepped” arrangements to give
foothold, the proposals are satisfactory but the possible need^to take
measures on top of the wall to discourage persons from attempting to climb
over'will have to be borne in mind;

(h)    Plan No. 6705/16A - in view of experiences- iasc year, the fronc
corner of the Spion Kop (by the crush barriers numbered_5, 8 and 22) to
either have a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate or radial barrier(s) to overcome
possible lateral crushing hazard when large crowds are present;

(i)    Plan No. 6705/17 - for both security access and emergency egress
purposes, a Pitch Perimeter Fence Gate to be provided;

(j)    Stewarding of New Gates - as mentioned'in-my letter of 2nd May,: 1985,
it is essential that all the new gates are fully supervised by Stewards,
who must be fit, able and properly trained.

     For the attention of Mr. D. Vaughan


     Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                                            Safety of Sportsground Act, 1975
                                    Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC
                      Thank you very much for your letter of 30 July giving the
    O u t c o m e of the Working Party meeting on 29 July.                                                         We note
>     the general comment that the calculations have to be approved
      by the Building Surveyors Department.                                       We believe that all the
      calculations which are likely to be required have been sent for
      checking and comment.
             With regard to your detailed observations our response

       is as follows
       (a)    We are not sure of the location on the West terrace of
       the proposed extra security gate.                                       There is already a gate xn
       the 2m wide gap formed by the new radial fence for use by the
       police.           This same gate will still be available for the spectators
       in emergency as there are gates into the 2m gap from the terrace
       which will be under the control of the police.                                                             This point may
       perhaps be clarified during the Working Party's visit on 7 August.

         (b)          The foundations'for this fence are in fact already aligned in

  the way you suggest.

  (c) and       (d)
              We are a little surprised by the suggestion that a
  single block thickness is not sufficient for the cubicle
  walls.       The inside of a toilet cubicle is not a very
  vulnerable area and the walls are braced by the door frame.
  Studding is not at all suitable in terms of strength or
  durability, and would probably invite vandalism.

  (e)         The refreshment area is under the most westerly

   taken care of by Mr. Chester.


               It will be much easier for your Working Party to
   appreciate what is intended when they see the works under
   construction.          There will also be an opportunity to see
   the metal decking of the South stand.

1.    Purpose of Meeting.              J       _    _

The purpose of ihe tn^m'ng was""to-: carry out-the J'sunaker’^aspecti'AJ of the
Stadium with particular reference to the Leppings Lane end improvements and
the metal sheeting of the upper seated area of the South Stand.

 2.   Ground Inspection.

A.    Leppings Lane End            ^               . .

 The progress‘of the works to segregate visiting supporters behind and on the
 West Terrace and Stand were inspected with particular reference to the
 points raised at the Officer Working Party's meeting held on 29th July,
 (forwarded to Messrs. Eastwood and Partners by the Chief Executive s letter
 of 30th July) and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners reply of 1st August.

 Messrs. Eastwood & Partners had confirmed that all the calculations which
 were likely to be required had now been sent to the Building Authority for
 checking and comment.

  On the inspection, the Building Authority pointed out what they considered
  to be the poor standard of workmanship in the construction of the new
  dividing wall which was being built behind the Stand. The position of the
• Police Personnel access gate and the stepping of the face of the wall by
  45° chamfers so as not to form footholds were acceptable.

 The foundations of the new handrail by Turnstile 23 had actually been
 aligned so as to maintain the exit width between the outer (river) wall
 and the Turnstile (unlike the indication on the plan submitted).

  As regards the single block thickness of the internal walls of the cubicles
  in the new male and female toilet facilities at the rear of the stand,
  Messrs. Eastwood and Partners considered that the inside of a toilet cubicle
• was not a very vulnerable area, and pointed out that the walls were braced
  by both the outer walls and the door frames. • The Building Authority noted
  the assurances given by Dr. Eastwood, but expressed concern that the
IT WAS AGREED that the metal sheeting of the wooden upper portion of the
Stand should largely overcome the flammabxlxty problems uuiarent xn such
timber structures, and the Club stated that they would ensure^that the
wooden intermediate steps were securely replaced upon completxon of the
la.yi.ng of the metal sheet mg*

C.      Spion Kop

Messrs. Eastwood & Partners recalled that outline details of the Club s
proposal to cover the Spion Kop had been senc for the xnforaatxon oftne
Officer Working Party by letter dated-22nd July. As part of that scheme,
the bridge portion of the Kop would beremoved. Its present condxtxon
remained acceptable with continuing maintenance.

In view of experiences last season, the Club were requested to provide an
additional gate in the pitch perimeter fence in the front corner nearest
to the South Stand to overcome the lateral crushing hazard whxch could
occur when large crowds were present.

 IT WAS AGREED that the Club would provide a new gate xn the pxtch perimeter
 fence in the front corner nearest to the South Stand with a stepped
 arrangement to assxst access and egress.

D.      North Stand


• (iVfront of"the L'aclies1 Changing Facxlxtxes xn the sports Hall) were
 inspected.

 IT WAS AGREED that so long as light combustibles (such as paint) were not
 stored in this area, its use continued to be acceptable on a temporary
 basis.

. E.    Closed   Circuit   .-Television Facilities

 The advantages for general crowd control and security (both in and outside
 the Stadium) which would be given by the recently installed Closed Cxrcuxt
 Television System were explained to the Officer Workxng Party.

 IT WAS AGREED

 (a)   that a    kg. C02 Fire Extinguisher should be installed in both the
 Police Control Box and the Disc Jockey Box;

  (b)     that loose external wires on the outside of the Boxes should be made
  secure.

 Mr Vauehan pointed out that-the Local. Government Act, 1985, would abolish

 City Council that appropriate representatives.xn addition to the

           IT WAS AGREED that, in the first instance, Dr.^Eastwood would prepare sketch
           plans of the suggested roofed disabled facilities m front of the North Stand
           for consideration by the Officer Working Party.

           C.    Ground Inspection
                 (i)   West Terrace and Stand

           The Police representatives confirmed that.the revised segregation arrangements
           to the rear of the Stand worked well on by far the majority of occasions.

           Dr. Eastwood pointed out that the segregation rail in the upper seated area'*
                                                                                                     J*’
           of the stand could be moved within .certain limits if the Police considered                s*
           that this would achieve a useful purpose.

           IT WAS AGREED

           (a)   that the additional advertisement hoardings, at the front of the upper
           seated stand area (nearest to the North-West Terrace) should also be securely
           fixed to concrete wall;                               :                           .

           (b)   that f u r t h e r areas-of spalled concrete at.the front of the upper
•jf;
           seated stand area should received Attention as matters of maintenance.

!'              ' (ii)   North-West Terrace


           West Terrace’should be securely fixed.

                  (iii) North Stand

           The area for the suggested coveted disabled facilities was inspected.

           As p r e v i o u s l y - mentioned by-Dr. Eastwood',--the possibility of providing an
           increased width access to the pitch area (between the Norrt Stand and the
           Spion Kop) for possible use by emergency vehicles, as well as for maintenance
           by the Club was discussed. -The facility could be incorporated into the
           enlarged Spion Kop proposals relatively easily.



       •
            It WAS AGREED that, whilst the County Fire Service felt that such a facility
           was not essential for their purposes, it could be useful for use by emergency
           vehicles in certain situations and generally should be supported.

                  (iv)   Spion Kop

           It was noted that the m e t a l .sheeting of the. wooden floor of .the upper ■
           portion of the Stand (with sprayed non-slip surface) had .proved to be of an
           acceptable appearance in use, and generally appeared to .provide a compromise
           solution to the flammability problems inherent in such wooden structures.

           IT WAS AGREED that its condition would continue to be monitored.

 SAFETY AT SPOETS GROUNDS : REVISED EDITION OF THE GUIDE TO SAFETY AT
                            SPORTS GROUNDS

  Introduction

 1.   This circular introduces the revised edition of the Guide to Safety a~ Sports^
 Ground’
       s (the "Green Guide") a copy of which is enclosed for all recipients.

  2.   As stated in paragraph 9 of Home Office circular 5/\9?S the revised edition ^
  o^ the Green Guide has been drawn up primarily in the light of both the In~enm anc.
  Final Reports of the Popplevell Inquiry, although where practicable additions have
  been made to take account of comments from elsewhere. The Guide remains a voluntary
  code and is intended to be applied flexibly to take account of the individual
  circumstances and needs of particular grounds.

  Content and Main Changes of the Guide

  5.   Although the format and structure of the new Guide have been changed in an
  attempt to facilitate reading, this revised edition continues^to rely heavi.y on o ,e
  technical material of the previous Guide, the substantive advice of whicn -/as
  acknowledged by the Po^plewell Inquiry to have stooa up well to de . a i l e d _s.ruoiny.
  The new Guide is therefore still orientated towards 'football-type staai- bat,
  Slike'ilpredecessor, it is mads clear that it also applies to sports grounds usee
  for other sports.
  4.    The main changes in the new Guide are that greater emphasis is placed th_ough°u.
  the latest edition on management responsibility to which a new chapter i       «.
  (Ch*i>te- 2) ard there is a further additional chapter on s rewarding (Chapter 3, •
  The~advice orTfire safety has been expsmded and amendments made to chapter 14 on
  crowd control. General advice on temporary stands is offered m Chapter 0.

   Distribution

   5.   The Guide has bee, issued to the                                                                           “ t

 Dear Sir.                             .                „     ...

  S a f e t y 'of
            Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield United Football Club’and
  Sheffield Wednesday Football Club_______________ ____________________ _

  I am writing to ask for your comments in writing as to the conditi.-n of the
  above two stadia under the 1975 Act from the Fire Service point of view.

  What I would like from you is written confirmation that as far as the Fire
  Authority is concerned both stadia meet your requirements tinder the 1975
  legislation.

  If it should be that there are outstanding matters which require attention
  please detail these in your response; I think it would be helpful to all parties
  if any defects outstanding were fully detailed so that action could be taken to
  remedy them.

  Please be advised that I am aware of the south stand roof problem at Sheffield
  Wednesday and as you know I am taking steps to ascertain the Club’s position on
  that problem.

   I hope you will be able to let me have your reply to this letter in the near
   future.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
received them as yet.

The Police have indicated that they are quite satisfied with the stadium and
have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they receive is very
satisfactory.

The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. I think the letter
is largely self-explanatory but I would particularly like to refer to the
comments which are made in respect of final exit gates. As you can see from the
-               t*.? — «   c          -* — -             - - ~t* a A                            f-Ko   cl      A i -nty crq t*       V>S*V<® **   t C.P. T5ld
        w ile   Ji         o c .* . v j .'- .o   ----------------- ----------—   —   ------ —    *     —    --- -----------»     .

that as and when they reach the end of their useful life they must be replaced
with outward opening doors. The Fire Service have also produced a drawing (a
copy of which I enclose) to show a better arrangement for securing the sliding
gates against forced entry from the outside during the course of the game. The
Fire Service feel that this hook type arrangement will be more easily used in
the event of an emergency than the current locks, about which they are very
concerned.

Would you please let me have your comments on the Fire Service letter as soon as
possible.

Yours faithfully,




Head of Department

  Dear Sir

  Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 - Sheffield Wednesday Football Club

  In November 1986 I asked both the Police and Fire Service to comment on the
  condition of your stadium having regard to the provisions of the 1975 Act. I
  have also asked the Building Surveyor to make similar comments but I have not
  received them as yet.

  The Police have indicated that as at 6 th January, 1987 they are quite satisfied
  with the stadium and have indicated that the degree of co-operation which they
 :receive is very satisfactory.

I The Fire Service have, however, made a number of comments and I attach for your
V information a copy of their letter to me of 18th February. Some points in the
  letter have now been further clarified as follows:-

   (a) The timber buildings referred to should (if still required) be re-sited away
   from the walkways.

   (b) As far as the locked doors in the south stand are concerned they will be
   dealt with by the Fire Service under the Fire Certificate.

   (c) Gates must be unlocked and stewarded at all times, during matches: if this
   cannot be arranged, panic fastenings would probably be insisted upon.

   I think the rest of the letter is largely self-explanatory but I would_
   particularly like to refer to the comments which are made in respect of final
   exit gates. As you can see from the letter the Fire Service are concerned about
   the sliding gates and have indicated that as and when they reach the end of
   their useful life they must be replaced with outward opening doors. The Fire
   Service have also produced a drawing (a copy of which I enclose) to show a
   better arrangement for securing the sliding gates against forced entry from the
   outside during the course of the game. The Fire Service feel that this hook
   type arrangement will be more easily used in the event of an emergency than the
   current locks, about which they are very concerned.

Dear Sire,
In reply to voar latter daSed l;.
                                lth May, I9 S7 regarding the "Future Administration
of the Council's Certificating Function” under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act
1975. please find belcw the observations of this Department.

1.     With respect tc the schedule detailins a proposed division of responsibilities
       between authorities it is felt that this should remain along the lines of
       the document issued by the previous certificating authority i.e. Sou oh Yorkshj.^.e
       County Council, a copy of which is attached. As this document has steed the
       test of tine with feu problems, it is recommended that a meeting of all author­
       ities concerned cc called ac soon as possible in order tc discuss the division
       of responsibilities it lays down.

        W h a te v e r   th e-     o u tc o m e     one        a re a     w h ere    th e re      m ay      be        a    need      fo r     e m p h a s is   is    a

        itie s       re s p o n s ib ilitie s           a id      th a t    when      c o n s id e r in g         any        p ro p o s a ls      a ll    a s p e c ts
        of      th e " g re e n    g u id e       s h o u ld    be. ta k e n        in to     account            in       o rd e r   th a t      fu ll    c o n s u l­
        ta tio n     can    ta k e       p la c e   w ith      o th e r    in te r e s te d     a u th o r itie s .


2.      Tho proowsai for one annual inspection by the working group in conjunction
        with individual inspections by authorities as and when considered necessary
        is agreed with although it is envisaged that because of manpower resource
        limitations the degree of central cc-ordination referred to may cause problems.

        The Fire Authority would, wish to carry out such inspections subject to the
        limitations referred to above and under varying conditions at the ground.
        Obviously" any "adverse comments on crowd safety would be forwarded to your
        Department.    As tc the annual inspection, a good time would be at the end
        or towards the end of a season in order that any necessary work can be followed
        up before the conmoncomont of a new season.

 3.     Whilst the situation regarding the status of working group is fully appreciated,
        this authority feels that the recognition of the group as a decision making
        bodv by the City Council is imperative if it is to remain effective. As under
        the*County Council however, the terms of reference of the group w o u l d be within
        the conditions of certification laid down by the City Council, anything oeyond
        these terms being referred back via your Department for a Conja.ti.ee decision.

                                                                                                                                                     Cont• ••••

 Metropolitan District



 4     The oroe-du-e outlined for calling additional meetings of the working group
     * is a^eed with although it is considered essential that full minutes of all
       meetings are oroduced and. circulated and in particular should make-direct
       reference to outstanding matters from previous meetings in order that these
        are not ’lest’ in the minutes.

 In addition to the above'matters it would be appreciated if both Sheffield United
 and Sheffield Wednesday Football Clubs were contacted in order to discuss tne
 outst-,T’/,i"1'* features dealt with in correspondence between 'CT Division Headquarters
 and y o i Department dated 9th December, 1986 in respect of Sheffield United and
 18th February, 1987 in respect of Sheffield Wednesday.

 If thsro are any queries on the above matters, please do not hesitate to contact
 the Officer concerned.

 Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir,

•Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
        AHm-fnifltratlon of the Council's Certificating Functioj.

Following a meeting on Tuesday 10th March I have given some further thought to
the above subject.

M any points were raised at the meeting but I think that the general feeling was
tfiat t h e roles of each Authority involved in the system should be defined
perhaps along the lines adopted by the South Yorkshire County Council.

T  have no obiection in principal to roles being defined in this way but I should
          i          if it is agreed that particular Authorities adopt particular
r 0S s t h ^ t ^ S U be u i d e f r f u t y to consult with other interested parties
where there i f an overlap of interest. As I see it the Authority which Carnes
               iar role will have the responsibility of advising the Council as
Certificating Authority on all matters falling within that Lead Authority role.

 I have drawn up a draft Schedule which attempts to define Lead Authority roles.
 1 nave arawn                draft is intended to be open for discussion and I
 1 Id        ther°efo e " 1 o ^ y o u r cf»«e«s on it. Would /ou please also let me know
If the« are          l n y oiherm^tters which should be included in the Schedule.

 M      rmi-n the Question of inspections of stadia, this point was also discussed
 at the meeting on 10th March. My view is that the existing system of bi annua
 limited inspections is no longer appropriate; I feel that one major inspection
           cVinnld be carried out on each stadium which should include all t e
 a r e a s  installations within the scope of the legislation. To back up this
             a n d


 inspection there should be a number of "during performance" inspections by
 Officers. I think that there is general agreement m relation to d^ m g
 performance" inspections as they would highlight the performance of the safety
 system at each stadium whilst it is in operation.


                                                                                                     734690 - Mr. Bownes
                                                                                            .................................(STD
                                For telephone enquiries on this matter please ring..........................
                                                                                                                                    Code 0742)
                                                          Telex 54243 (Administration & Legal)
Perhaps ''during performance" inspections could be arranged so that each
Authority carries out such inspections independently with a degree of central
co-ordination to prevent two inspections taking place simultaneously. As the
first step towards the development of a .programme of inspections it might be
appropriate for me to arrange a joint inspection involving representatives fr
all the authorities in order to provide an insight into problems which may be
encountered

Moving on to the "working party" structure I think it is clear from the meeting
of 10th March that some clarification of its status is required. It is
reasonably clear from the County Council’s records that the working party as
such was actually a decision making body presumably acting under delegated
powers. However, the normal City Council practice is that the principal powers
remain with a Committee or Sub-Committee (in this case the General Purposes
Panel) with routine matters being delegated to a Chief Officer (in this case
myself). I would therefore propose to ask the Panel to accept the working party
as a forum for discussion.

I take a view that the Lead Authority will be able to use the Working Party as
a useful forum for discussion prior to drawing up that Authorities formal view
to be submitted to the Certificating Authority. I propose that when an
Authority feels that a meeting would be appropriate contact should be made with
my Chief Licensing Officer, Mr. Bownes, who will then make arrangements for the
meeting to take place. An agenda will be prepared and circulated prior to the
meeting and at the conclusion of the meeting Mr. Bownes will prepare a list
showing the subjects discussed and the action to be taken by each Lead
Authority. This list will be circulated as well.

Would you please consider the points I have raised and let me have your comments
on them in due course; it will be necessary for me to formulate a report to the
General Purposes Panel on the administration of the Certification system.

Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
Draft revised Safety Certificate Conditions

I enclose for your attention a copy of the new draft Certificate conditions
which I have prepared. Please bear in mind that these conditions are a first
draft only and are in a basic form (i.e. they have not as yet been tailored to
the needs of individual stadia). I also enclose a first draft of the
interpretation section of the Certificate which will help when reading the new
 conditions.
 I would welcome your comments on the conditions, preferably in writing. If you
 feel that it would be helpful to discuss the conditions at a meeting then please
 contact Mr. Bownes on the telephone number given below who will make the
 appropriate arrangements.

 Yours faithfully




 Head of Department

Dear Sirs,

SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975 -
DRAFT REVISED SAFETY CERTIFICATE CONDITIONS

In reply to your letter dated 7th July re the above, please find below
the observations of this Department

Section 9(a)   An additional item agreed with Barnsley and Doncaster Councils
               in respect of their standard conditions is that the age
               range of stewards should be 18 - 6 p.

Section 10(a) Whilst specified in the green guide, it is difficult to
              imagine how this task can be controlled by stewards. This
              matter should be considered further.

Section 10(i) Reference should be made to the opening and securing open
              of exits on the intiation of any emergency procedure or
              at the end of a game and to assisting and directing spectators
              out of the exits.

Section 18     Add . . . "The emergency power supply should operate independ­
               ently of the main power supply and come into automatic
               operation   on the failure of the latter and be capable of
               maintaining the necessary power output for a minimum period
               of three hours.

Section   23   Reference    to "compressed gas or liquid" should be amended
                to . . . "flammable liquid or compressed gas (except fire
                extinguishing apparatus)".

Section 2b     Add after "whatsoever"    "whether combustible or not".

Section 28     The old SYCC certificate required that the Police had knowledge
               of the whereabouts of the doctor.

Section   29   Again the old SYCC certificate      required that members      of
                the press, T.V. and radio were identifiable.
Section 35(d) This requires that the electrical installation be examined
              and a report submitted to the Council every 12 months.
              The same requirement should al30 apply to emergency lighting,
              and fire warning (including P.A.) systems.

Section 35(f) Sub paragraph (iii) requires emergency lighting to be tested
              at least 24 hours prior -to an activity. It would be preferable
              that the original requirement of testing 3 hours before
              an activity be maintained.

Two additional items for consideration are:-

 (i)   That     a competent electrician employed or retained by   the   Holder
       3 hall   be present during a specified activity.

(ii)   The Holder shall provide and maintain within the stadium to the
       satisfaction of the Council the access routes for emergency vehicles
       shown on the plans.

SCHEDULE - Interpretation

Whereas the old SYCC Certificate required certain matters (e.g. fire alaras,
extinguishers etc.) and the maintenance of these to be to the satisfaction
of the Chief Fire Officer, the proposed Certificate now requires these
to be to satisfaction of the City Councxx.

This Department does not foresee this causing any problems subject to
copies of the required annual certificates of test being forwarded to
us for examination.

If there are any queries on the above matters, please contact Divisional
Officer Grinshaw.

Also enclosed for your information is a list of sports grounds and indccr
SDcrts premises within Sheffield and known to this Department.

Yours faithfully,

          Dear Sir,

          Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds - 1986 Edition

             I refer to the revised Guide which was recently published by K.M. Government
             following the Poppelwell Report. I would like to draw your attention to the new
             Guide and particularly to Chapter 2 entitled "Management Responsibility .

             This Chapter sets out in detail the sort of matters which ground management _
             should be responsible for and I regard it as essential that the management or
             designated stadia should be entirely familiar with it and follow its guidance.

             Would you please, therefore, confirm in writing.-

             (a) that you have obtained and intend to retain on the premises a copy of the
                  Guide;

             (b) that your Company and its Officers are familiar with the Guide and i^end
                 to perform the management duties outlined in Chapter 2 of the Guide, the
                 Company should also take immediate steps to appoint a Safety Ofricer as
                 defined in Chapter 2 and confirmation of that appointment should be sen, to
                 the Council as soon as possible.

             Yours faithfully,

1.1      The timber ticket hut adjacent to the refreshment bar on the main

 Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 -
.Sheffield Wednesday, Foot~b? 11 CliVb rlc.


 I enclose for your attention two copies of a letter which
 I have received from Messrs Eastwood & Partners dated the
 3rd Fe’oruaiy, 1 9 8 8 . I think the majority of the latter is
 straight forward tut I am concerned atout the last para­
 graph on sheet seven of the letter. In view of the appa­
 rent critisism of the Fire Service contained in that para­
 graph, you may think it appropriate to respond directly to
 Messrs Eastwood & Partners. Perhaps you would let me have
 a copy of your letter in due course.

 I look forward to hearing from you on the remainder of
  istwood's letter in the fairly near future.
^ I
 Yours faithfully,




 Head of Department

                             With the exception of a small hut and the steel
                    clad groundsman's accommodation, which are both
                    located under the ramp and not the stand, the timber
                    clad buildings have been .removed.
                              We believe that the reference in the minutes
                    dated 7 August, 1985 was to storage facilities and
                    not to buildings.

     f)    Exit gates are unlocked before spectavo'rs enter
     the ground.    The keys then remain in the possession
     of the steward(s), given the responsibility of
     unlocking the gates, until after the end of the
     match and all spectators have left the ground.

     West Stand
      a)   Do we understand correctly that the
      reference to 'timber framed and clad units' is to
      the bar fittings at first floor level?     If so, then
      those fittings were part of the original construction
      for which Building Regulations Approval has been
      granted.    There has not been any previous comment


      or other stands.    We do not consider that they
      present a h a z a r d .
      b)   This item has already been dealt with in our
      letter dated 15 January.

      South Stand
      a)    (i)   We note the comment about the doors and
      this point has been dealt with under the regular
      procedures of obtaining a Fire Certificate under
      the Fire Precautions Act or 1971 for the oiiicss .
      Fir® Officer Rocer Woodhouse has be£n dealing *ii_n
      the natter.
           (ii)        We see the principle behind the creation
      cf fire compartments.    That is sensible.   Sealing
      off the windows is not difficult but the provision
      of ducting to the south wall is, and furthermore
       very expensive.   A major exercise such as providing
       ducting would by necessity have to wait until the
       redevelopment of the South stand in 1991.

      but this does not reduce the effect of i;ae
      intumescent paint underneath.
            (iv)     We cannot understand this comment because
      the paint store was constructed i.n its present
      position on the advice of the Fire Officer.             A
      special ’non-sparking’ light fitting was even
      installed on his recommendation.           It is not contem­
      plated to move the store again after spending money
      to build the store in its present position.
               (v)   We do not consider that the two laminate
      covered toilet kiosks present a hazard.             As for the
      wooden cupboards, they have been on the rirst rloor
      for many vears and no previous adverse comments
                                         .^.^ryice.. about cnexr
      presence.
           (vi) We' agree that the holes round the cables
      should be plugged with an appropriate fire resisting
      material.
          (vii) As far as we are aware all doors leading
      onto the first floor and ground floor circulation
      ^>-035    were crovided witn   2   oinm rebates and the cO'.t?
      made up tc a nominal one hour standard.             That work
      was done in 1979-80.
         (viii) We agree that the spaces above toilet
      accommodates should not be used for storage but
      believe that the Club have now removed the stored
      materials.
       c)      We believe that clinbing over the existing low
      wall does not present any difficulty in the event
       of an emergency.       Spectators will go over the wall
       whether there are gates or not.           We do not consider
       that the installation of gates is necessary.

                  The comments about the gates are noted.


          The Club have expressed to us their increasing con­
c e r n   that with the introduction of each new member of tne
Fire Service to the Officer Working Party new or
different recommendations are put forward by that officer,
which in some cases openly contradict the recommendations
offered by his predecessors.          Whereas we agree that   many
p f the observations and recommendations are of a
 subjective nature the Club cannot be expected to continue
 spending money on matters which are purely a matter of
personal opinion.          Some consistency in the comments

   Your comments regarding the various items as listed are receiving our attention.
   However, your comments on sheet 7 stating that each new member of the Fire Service
   to the to the Officer Working Party puts forward different recommendations have
   been throughly investigated and our observations are as follows.
   Station Officer Woodhouse has attended meetings of the Officer Working Party since
   November 1985 and for two year prior to Lhis Station Officer .Mlcock v»as the -■
   responsible Officer.
   The only time when another Officer may have been involved was when Station Officer
   Woodhouse was absent for 13 weeks at the Fire Service College during late 1986.
^ ^ t a t i o n Officer Woodhouse has also been involved in Liquor Licensing Act work as well
^R.s Fire Precaution Act work at the ground.
   It would appear therefore that the clubs remarks are a little exagerated, and every
   endevour is made by this Authority for continuity of fire precaution standards.


   Yours Faithfully

In respect of Liverpool supporters, vehicular traffic will, in the main,
leave the Ml motorway at Tankersley (j’ji-ction 36) and travel on the
A61 to Sheffield Wednesday Football Stadium.    The geographical location
of Liverpool, coupled with the country wide support enjoyed by the club,
suggests that traffic may also approach via the A616 (Flouch).

 Coaches will park in Claywheels Lane and Halifax Road.  Transit vans
 and similar vehicles will park in Wardsend Road North and private, vehicles
      be encouraged to park on the Parson Cross and Fox Hill estates
‘and if necessary, the Wisewood and Marlcliffe estates.

i ^ i c u l a r traffic carrying Nottingham Forest supporters will, in the
main, leave the Ml motorway at Tinsley (junction 34), and travel along
Sheffield Road, Weedon Street to Brightside Lane.

At this point coaches and transit vans (or similar) will travel along
Upwell Street, Owler Lane, Firvale and Herries Road.  Coaches will park
in the Herries Road Bus Depot, Herries Road South and Herries Road.
Transit vans will park on the Rawson Springs Industrial Estate.   Private
vehicles will be directed from Brightside Lane along. Sutherland Street,
Gower Street, Brunswick Road, Nursery Street and will be encouraged
to park in the Neepsend area.

For the attention of Mr. D. Bownes




Dear Sirs,

SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB -
SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUND ACT

Following the inspection at the above sports ground on 19th May 1988, the following
items are forwarded for your attention.

Splon Kop

Rubbish i3 accumulating under the new structure and requires removing.

^jouth Stand

 a)   The extractor fan from the laundry has an accumulation of fluff and requires
      cleaning.

 b)   The new Sponsors Lounge on the first floor has been fitted with an extractor
      fan that breeches the fire resisting wall. At the time of the inspection it
      could not be determined whether it is fitted with an automatic heater detector
      operated shutter or not. If not, seme such device will be required.

 We3t Stand

 There were only two small EXIT signs situated above the exits from the covered
 walkway which could not be seen from the extremities of the walkway. As this
 stand is used by visiting fans it is recommended that larger signs be fixed,
 in a more prominent position.
Mr. O. Bownes                                                        25.5.88

It is recommended where gas cookers are used in the snack bars that a fire blanket
be provided.

Should you require any further information concerning these matters, please do not
hesitate to contact mo.

         Dear Sir,
.   (
         Safety of Sports Grounds - Draft Revised Safety Certificate Conditions                                                                                          •

         X refer to your letter of 13th August 1987 (your reference FP19/2/4:RG/EB) in
         connection with Safety Certificate Conditions.

         I now enclose for your attention a copy of the final revised Safety Certificate
         Conditions which as far as possible incorporate the comments made in your
         letter   You will appreciate that the wording of certain of your comments has
         had to be amended slightly but I hope that the objective has none the less been
         achieved.

         There are four points which require some further consideration:-

                     (a)       You say in your letter that an age range should be specified in
                               connection with stewards. I think however that the wording of
                               Condition 11 should be satisfactory without stipulating an age range.
                               No final decision has yet been taken on this issue and you may like to
    ^                          consider it further;

                     (b)       police knowledge of the whereabouts of a doctor - I believe this is
                               adequately covered in Condition 7;

                     (c)       identifiability of press T.V. and radio personnel - I am not sure of
                               the justification for such a Condition and wonder if you have any
                               further comments on it;

                     (d)       the attendance of competent electrician - again I wonder what the
                               justification for this Condition would be.

          Would you please let me have your comments on the new Conditions m                                                                          due course.

                      CUTDANCE FOR SAFETY CERTIFICATE HOLDERS



 INTRODUCTION

 This note has been prepared by the Sheffield City Council inporder to inform
 Certificate Holders as to the general background of the Safety Certificate
 Conditions- The Council in dealing with Safety Certificates".takes advice from
 the Chief Fire Officer, the Chief Constable, the Director of.Health and Consumer
 Services and the Council’s Building Surveyor. These Of ficersv-and the Council
 itself is concerned to see as far as possible that the spectators at any
 specified activities are reasonably safe.
   . . . .                               .
■'GUIDANCE

 Where advice is given to the holder by any of the four Officers mentioned it
 should be acted upon in accordance with the time constraints given in the *
 advice. The holder is reminded that failure to take steps to ensure the
 reasonable safety of spectators could give rise to a prosecution.

 The Chief Constable and his Officers have a particularly important role in
 relation to "public order" situations the correct handling of which should
 reduce any risk to spectator safety.

 The Chief Constable must therefore be provided with appropriate facilities at
 the stadium for control, crowd surveillance, detention and administrative^
 purposes- These facilities are essential if public order is to be maintained
 and the risk to spectators minimised.

  The Chief Constable must also be informed at the earliest possible moment of the
  proposed date and content of all specified activities so -that appropriate
  planning can take place.

  In addition there must -be consultation and agreement between the holder and the
  Chief Constable well in advance of specified activities about the proposed
  methods of admission and the segregation of spectators. Consultation must also
  take nlace if advance information is such that public order difficulties may
  arise. As a result of this consultation it is possible that the Chief Constable
  may require for reasons of preserving public order, that the specified activity
  is "all ticket" or the specified activity should not be played at all at the
  Stadium or the day and the time of the specified activity should be changed.

  The Chief Constable should also be able to use whatever means are appropriate to
  exercise control over spectators for reasons of safety and as part of this
  control he and his Officers should be allowed full access to all areas of the
  Stadium.

1.     These signs to have suitable sized white lettering on a green background,
       the size of lettering to be agreed on site.

       The position of the exit signs are indicated on the plans by a green
       rectangle containing the letter 'E'.

2.     If the proposed rewiring of the emergency lighting system is adopted
        as discussed by Mr. Clough and Divisional Officer Jones then, with the
        reduced lighting output, it may be necessary to provide a number of
        illuminated exit boxes.
E m erg en c y P r o c e d u re

Emergency procedure notices should be placed at strategic points throughout
the ground.

Access for Emergency Vehicles

1.        Adequate roads should be provided to ensure that speedy and direct
          access can be obtained by emergency vehicles to all exterior parts of
          the stadium.

2.        Ensure that parked vehicles will not obstruct emergency vehicles on
          these access roads.

Public Address System

The existing public address system to be upgraded, with the Police having an
over-ride facility from their Police Room.

Police Facilities

A suitable permanent Police Room (with facilities as shown on the sketch plan
marked A A ) to be provided in the 1980 close season.

First Aid Facilities

 (i)      Structure

           The existing facilities are considered to be below an acceptable standard
           and it is suggested the Club consider providing a more permanent
           structure which is not likely to require up-grading for a very long time.
           The internal finish, particularly of the Treatment area, should be of an
           impervious nature so that it can be easily cleaned and rendered fairly
           sterile and require no decoration. This can be achieved by the use of
           tiles or formica type finish etc....

 (ii)     Waiting Area

            The Waiting Area could be arranged within corridor space to minimise
            the cost, where sitting cases could wait for attention on chairs.

  (iii) Treatment Area

            The Treatment Area should be sufficient to accommodate two or three
            patients at any one time, and consideration should be given to the needs
            for privacy within the treatment area, bearing in mind that the three
            patients may well be lying on couches.
(iv)      L ig h tin g '

          Good lighting is essential and strip lighting would be satisfactory. The
          provision of a power point would also be a basic requirement.

(v)       Water

          A supply" of hot and cold water is essential; the cold water suitable
          for drinking. A hand basin and a large Belfast type sink should also
          be provided. The Club might consider whether it would be cheaper in
          the long run to provide stainless steel basins which are not subject to
          chipping.

(vi)      Toilet Requirements

          The Club should provide at least one male and one female toilet, for
          the use of the pubLic, and should consider whether they should provide
          an additional toilet for the use of the staff.

(vii)     Storage

          Storage facilities are required for six stretchers, and for two sets of
          wheels for stretchers, blankets and other bed linen. This storage should
          be lockable.

(viii)    Equipment

          The following is a minimum list to provide a basic service:-

          Treatment couches with lift up ends, two or three in number depending
          on space available and/or number of cubicles, if the accommodation is
          cubicled.

          Six Stretchers.
          Two sets of stretcher wheels.
          20 Blankets.
          Six Pillows.
          One Minute-Man Resuscitator.

(ix)     . Telephone Facilities

          A telephone facility would appear to be basic in 1979. This could be
          achieved by an extension from the main switch, or by sharing with
          police.




                                    6.
(X)    C a r P a rk in g

       The Club might also consider what facilities could be extended to the
       St. John's personnel for the parking of staff cars.

Crowd Capacity

The following numbers will be considered to be satisfactory, provided that the
recommended work as detailed above is carried out:-

       Spion Kop                   16,850
       South Stand Upper            5,567

        Emergency Lighting

        It was obvious that there was a difference of opinion as to what could be
        regarded as acceptable as regards the emergency lighting in the Souta _     .
        gtand. It was agreed that a trial should be conducted during the hours ci
                  attended by representatives c£ the Club and the “ire Service so
        Ts to identify the danger areas.  Consideration would then, b a g l v a a to. ‘
        possibly installing an extra battery and additional wiring to those partusuLu
        areas not covered by the emergency lighting covering other parts of the
        ground.

        Fire Warning System

        The problems with the public address systems eemed to be mainly ones of
        diction an.d correct volume level. It was agreed that the police would xnonitu
        position at the next heme match and, pending the new police control post euv
        erected, would arrange for an officer to sit alongside the Disc Jockey m the
        meantime.

         It was also agreed that the monitoring point for the fire dsteeKoa equipment
         should be in °the tower between the South and West Stands, and would procee,
         once the electrical work was completed.

    1.
              would (in consultation with 'the Fire Service and ths Police) mark out a lane,
              from the main gate to the South Stand in which parking would not be allowed.
              It was also agreed that the hydrant outside the South Stand would have to be
              kept clear.

               Public Address System

               Already discussed under "Fire Warning System"

               Police‘Facilitss and R. First Aid Facilities

             .As agreed, a suitable permanent Police Ro o m would be provided in the 1S3G
               closed season.

               The Club explained that it would be preferable from a building point of view
               for boththe police and first aid facilities to be in the same overall building
               although physically separated. The police representatives reserved their
               position on this point, pending the outcome of detailed discussions with the
               Club.

               The question of parking for both police and St. John's personnel purposes
               would also need to be looked at in detail.

               Ground Capacity

               Provided the outstanding.points were satisfactorily resolved, it was agreed
                that the crowd capacity would be as shown, i.e. a total of 5G, 174.


                                                       4.
The Club were anxious tot lie Certificate should be in force by
 -h Sheffield United on Boxing Day morning, and they were assured that providing
; f o " n g ^ints were satisfactorily resolved, it was still the intention to
issue the Certificate at the beginning of December.

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act/ 1975

Following approval by the County Council and clarification of certain
structural aspects of the South Stand construction, I am now able
issue the attached General Safety Certificate in respect of
Stadium.

As previously mentioned to you, the fee payable has yet to be determined by
the County Council and I will, of course, contact you further on this point
as soon as possible.

I would particularly draw your attention to the following paragraphs of
Schedule 2 of the Certificate:-

8(1)   - the* existing First Aid facilities are accepted on an interim bctsi:-:
          only pending the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980
          close season;

12(1) - the arrangements for ESnergency Lighting in the South Stand (as set
         out in the letter from Messrs. Eastwood & Partners to the South
         Yorkshire County Fire Service dated 12th December, 1979) are
         regarded as acceptable only for the duration of the existing
         battery life;

14     - the existing Police facilities are accepted on an interim, basis only
          panning the erection of purpose-built facilities in the 1980 close
          season;

30     - use of the Stadium in excessively high wind conditions
                                and
       - use of the Stadium in excessively high snowfall conditions.

Perhaps you would also .treat this letter as the formal notice of issue reguir .d.
by Paragraph 7 of the Safety of Sports Grounds Regulations 1976.




Mr. K. Inland,                                                                /Should             ---

Should you have any queries on the Certificate, Mr. D. Vaughan o
will be happy to discuss them with you.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity of recording the '
appreciation of the co-operation and goodwill which the Club -nd
has extended to the Officer Working Party over the inonths of the;
involved detailed investigations.

          would be willing to assist    in the training of safety
          stewards aa to their actions in an emergency as
          required by Schedule 2, Section 9, of tha safety
          certificate issued by the County Council,, no progress
          has been made in this matter*

     •sions shall be provided and maintained to the
      satisfaction of the Chief Fira Officer.

           Tha recent inspection,has discovered that without
           further discussion, some eigne having inadequate
           lettering size have been provided and the siting haa
           not complied with the detail of tha certificate plan.

           The signs at tha rear of the South Stand are not
           illuminated by bbth the normal and emergency lighting.

           Those itcrca do not appear to satisfy the requirements
           of the safety certificate.

 %          The emergency lighting provisions in the South Stand

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

             SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS' ACT 1975-         V

             Further to your letter of the 31st March, my Chairman
             is away for another three or four weeks; so you will
             appreciate that I cannot give you Board decisions or
             opinions. My personal reaction is surprise, as under
             the above act work has been going on continuously since
             it was started last summer and at no time do I feel
             that the Club have lagged behind in its actions to do
             everything that has been promised to be done.

             To take Item 4 of your letter - this is very ncuch in
             the progress, and we axe in the hands of the contractors.

             As regards the training of safety stewards, this was being
             left until the warning system was installed. However, on
             receipt of your letter I did contact Mr. Vaughan and
             suggested that if he would like to contact the County •
             Fire Service, all our stewards would be at the ground
             for our match on Easter Monday, and that might be an
             opportunity to deal with this particular item. The
             officers of the Fire Service had intimated to me    .
             previously that any time would be suitable to them.

             All your other items under Paragraphs 2 & 3 will be
             dealt with, and in fact a copy of your letter I have
             sent to Dr. Eastwood for his professional advice.

             Yours sincerely,




             Secretary.

     points raised as Mr. Clough is on holiday until Tuesday,                                                                      8

     April, and Mr. Strange is away until Monday, 14 April.
      Because we are carrying out re-wiring in the South Stand
      and Mr. Clough is better equipped to deal with the comments on
      the Exit signs I will delay replying until he returns.
                 With regard to the comments from the Building Control
       department I may need to reply in greater detail when John
       Strange returns from holiday.-                                                  .However,     m y   first comments

       are as follows.
        (i) The cracks between the ‘door frames and supporting wall
                  will be re-inspected.                                             I can only a s s u m e ‘that this is
                    something which was not noticed in the inspection which
                    we made and the inspections which were -made by the
                    Building Control department at the end of the work.                                                                It
                    may be that due to shrinkage of the timber a slight
               • gap has opened since that time.'                                                We will, of course, have

         the cracks mortared or covered if this is needed, but
        might I suggest that minor matters of this kind do not
        need a letter or need to be dealt with between the
         periodic inspections which you and we will be carrying
         out.   . After all the next inspection is less than three
         months away.


   :(ii) I have not been able to discuss the paint used on the


         closed down until 14 April.    However, one of ray assistants
         believes that M r .. Sherriff-has recently told Mr. Strange
         that Mr. Mills saw a painter with a tin of Dulroc instead
         of the Nullifire which we specified.    It would have been
         appreciated if a telephone call had been made at the time
         so that we could have-checked with certainty and if
         necessary taken corrective action.     I will write to you
         again on this point.


    (iii) Mr. Strange mentioned that Mr. Sherriff had queries in a
         recent telephone conversation whether wired glass has been
         used where appropriate.    Mr. Strange said that so far
         as we know wired glass had been used everywhere that the
         fire officer had requested it, and that the fire officer          <•
         had .of course, made his own inspection.     The conversation
         had ended with Mr. Sherriff saying that he would check with
         the fire officer.


    (iv) We presume that the reference to 'clearance* refers to
         the vertical headroom.    It will be recalled that some
         ingenuity was needed to devise this particular exit, as
         we were constrained by the levels in the existing stand
         and the level of the top of the terracing and the exit
         route.    Our drawings and calculations were submitted to         (

                      the Building Control department for comment.                     They
                      inspected during construction and after the work was
                      completed.            I am not amused by the fact that the
                      headroom is now being queried.                 In any case this is
                      a matter for the fire officer, not the Building Control
                      department.               With regard to the sharp edges I suggest
                      we leave the matter until the inspection in June/July
                      as the season is now almost over, and there is no
                      time to agree further work and have it carried out before
                      'tlie' season--enosr"'


                (v)   The perimeter fencing at the north-east c o m e r of the
                      Spion Kop has been appraised for condition and strength.
                      Bearing in mind the likely pressures at that location,
                      the tests which we carried out where possible, and that
                      we are dealing with_ an existing ground, the fence is
                      satisfactory in my opinion.


                (vi) We will look at the step obstruction, but again unless
                      this is something which is obviously dangerous                   (in
                      which case I would have expected the matter to be raised
                       last December)            suggest that discussion be left until the
                      J u n   e / J u l y .inspection.


                (vii) The mesh fencing under the North stand was discussed
                      with Mr. Jones of the fire service and he, like me, was
                       satisfied that there is no hazard which justifies the
                      making of c h an ge s .


                       I will write to you again after Mr. Clough returns front
                holiday.

   Dear Mr. Vaughan,
                   • Sheffield Wednesday Fo'otbal'l' Club Ltd.
                                      • Safety 'of Sports Grounds' Act - 1975
                  I have now been able to talk with Mr. Clough regarding
   the exit signs and have pleasure in replying to your points
   ii, iii and iv.


   Wra            ii
                  I find the exit signs were erected under the supervision
    of John Strange who is still                                                on holiday.         I have quickly
    looked through the certificate of ground safety and have not
   been able to find any reference to lettering size.                                                                Because
    you do not say which exit signs have not been sited in
    accordance with the plans it is a little difficult for me to
    comment and I suggest this matter be left in abeyance until
    John Strange returns.                                        With regard to the illumination of the
    exit signs, it may be that you are unaware that we are rewiring
    the South Stand and it may -be that the signs you have in mind
    will be appropriately illuminated by both systems when this
    work is complete.

    Para iii
         We have not been able to understand what it is
    which you say does not comply with the requirements
    of paragraph 12 of the certificate.          The agreement
    with the Fire Service     (Mr. K. Jones) was set out in our
    letter of 12 December.      So far as we can see the only
    possible variation from that agreement is that because                       V-..V
                                                                                    t.
    Qf the rewiring which is now taking place we did not
    implement the agreed measures in the 'case of the two exits


    December.


    Para iv
         The fire warning sys te m is complete except for the
    supply of the trickle charger and battery equipment.         These
    - items were ordered some months ago axio. if "che original
    delivery dates had been adhered to would have been installed
    by now.      Unfortunately the suppliers have failed to
    deliver on time.       We have been applying appropriate pressure
    and the latest information is as set out in the attached
    copy letter from our electrical contractors which was dated
    24 March.      As you will see from this, two of the four
    outstanding items have very likely been delivered by now
    but the signal indicator panel was not expected for four
    weeks from 24 March and the industrial batteries complete
    with steel stand and ancillary equipment was due t o 'be
    delivered by Friday, 25 April.


            I understand that there is to be a meeting at the ground
     on Thursday, 10 April, when these can no doubt be discussed.


                                       Yours sincerely,

                 Inspection of Ground_

  The Working Party inspected the ground in company with the Club's representatives.

                 Stewards until the fire w ^                               ^               sonie stewards yesterday. •

                 representatives.

      (ii)        Exit Signs
                  The Club's representatives felt that the exit signs generally had been sited where
                  required and were of adequate size and/or illuminated.

                                   ^             there were a number which could be more advantageously sited

                                                                               1.
         and/or direction arrows. The County Fire Service undertookto liaise with
         Messrs. Eastwood and Partners.

         Emergency Lighting in the South Stand

         As was evident, complete re-wiring of the South Stand with -eparate circuits had
         already commenced, and the County Fire Service undertook to let Messrs. Eastwood
         and Partners know their detailed requirements.

v)       Fire Warning System

         The Fire Warning System had been installed, except for the trickle charger and
         battery equipment. These items had been subject to delivery problems, but the
         system should be complete by the end of the month.

         It was agreed that as regards the F.A. Cup &mi-Final, the P o lic e Communications
         base which would be at the ground would also be used for Fire Service purposes if
         necessary.

v)        Sealing of Fire ResistingFrames,

          Th- sealing of the fire resisting door framesa gainst the supporting walls had generally
         ‘beeacairied out, but there were a'small number which were now showing signs of _
          small gaps.

vi)       Firs Betardent Paint

          The Club pointed out that "Nullifire" fire retardent paint had been specified on the
          u a r t it io n s within the South Stand but, as the Contractors were on holiday until
          14th April, it was not possible to say with certainty at this time whether it hac actoa.ly
          been used.

'v-ii)    Wired Glass

          The Club pointed out that to the best of their knowledge wired glass had been used
          wherever required by the County Fire Service.

          The County Fire Service and the Police were generally satisfied that the small panes
          of glass in the upper half of the wooden partitions within the South Stand would not in
          normal circumstances be regarded as a fire and/or safety hazard. The Club agreed in
          the longer term to consider the fitting of wired glass and, in the short term, to
          consider fitting wooden battons as an interim measure.

(yiii)    Sharp Edges to Steelwork on South-West Stand

          Whilst there were a number of sharp corners on the supports, these were at a height
          of at least s e v e n feet. However, the Club undertook to round them off.

£x)        Perimeter Fencing on the Spion Ko^

           The Club pointed o u t ’ that this had been tested where feasible and the results forwarded
           to the Chief Executive in January. A copy had been passed to the Building Authority on
           30th January.                                 •             *
(     Pn.aihle Step Obstruction on Pnoer Exit Area on SpionKop.

      Whilst it was agreed that the erection of the barriers at the Upper Exit Area had left
      1 ^ 1 1 adjacent area of approximately one foot wide by four foot long at a lower level
      th-- the remainder of-the exit, it was felt that its position coupled witn the“ 0^
      flow at that point meant that it did not unduly create an hazard. However, .he Club
      undertook to give attention to it in the longer term.

i)   . Mesh Fencing under North Stand

      Tn view of the normal crowd flow rates on the public side of the mesh fencing and the
      fact that there was no public access to its rear, it was felt that the timber framoa
      mesh fencing under the North Stand providing security to storage areas was acceptable

   the attitude of the Clubs who, whilst accepting the principle, sees
b ,7
          ^ 0 spend tccney on ground icprovemants which will be i.acuij.sc.
whsn"dasiguat2d but do not constitute an actual conger at tha prasent



On a =cr2 specific point, I understand that extensions to tha barriers
at the foot of the Spion Kop at the Hillsborough^Stadiim designated
ground have bean added at the request cz t:*.a police, tha sura —esn at
the Cap expending beyond the edge of the fra=:a.

 I have no record of the Sheffield Area Officer Working Party being
 consulted v z i o r tc the Club being requested to undertake tne work-
 I nencicn this as it could be a source or eEbarrasssant and ^lead to
 accusations of inconsistancy as the Sheffield Area Officer forking

 Tr-ctruslon in the”Sheffield Ur.itad Pitch Security Fence. At^that t^eetic
 ycu vers represented by Superintendents J. V. Gavins ana T. Jcf.nscn.

 To avoid aav tisunderstar.ding, I veuld stress chat the foregoing is in
 no way intended to be a c.riticisz: of the traditional role or =athoc_or

  continuing to contribute to .the Officer Working Parties and so achieve
  consistency or. all aspects throughout the County.

                             EMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


The following notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all
official stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the
Hillsborough Stadium on the action to be taken and'procedures to be followed
in the event of the possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the
playing of a game when spectators are present. The notes are not intended to .
be a c o m p r e h e n s i v e list of all the action necessary, but are for personal
issue to” each steward and for retention by the steward for immediate ref­
erence all the time hs/she is on duty at the stadium.

 It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many
 and varied, but the most obvious are fires or information that explosive/
.incendiary devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground. ^
   at information may be received or discovered either by members of -the s^aff

•   the stadium, or by telephone to the stadium., police, local or national
 newspapers.

^FOR THE DECISION.TQ. EVACUATE ALIi OR PART’OF THE- GROUND' :RESTS- WITH...THE SENIOR
 m a n a g e m e n t : OF THE CLUB.       (The senior police officer on duty will be in a
 position to advise as to whether the ’bomb call’ is likely to be genuine or
 not).
 Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to ths
 police officer on duty in the "P. A. Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on
 instructions from the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether
 the match is in progress or not, will cause the record ’THREE BLIND MICE_ to
    played over the loudspeaker system.

    The playing of that record will indicate to everyone present at the ground, > •
    other than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exists.

#     B.   As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and
           both teams, this information should be passed to them so that the
           game officials are also aware of the possibility of an interruption m
           play and the significance of the playing of the record.

    On hearing that record all club stewards will mete their way to their des­
    ignated duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Ihose on exit ga.es will
    open the gates and renain at that point. -During this period senior
    officials will consider tha nature of the emergency alleged and will dccid-
    to evacuate all/oart of the stadium; Once that decision has been taken, but
    not until, the senior police officer on duty will cause a spoken message to
    be relayed over the !,P. A- System" which will have the effect of:-

           Stopping the game and removing players from the field of play;
    (1)
           Informing the spectators/officials of the precise nature of the^
    (2)
           emergency and its location if known, and requesting all or specified
           sections of the public to leave their seats and make their way out of
           the ground by the nearest normal exit route unless specifically directed
            to do otherwise by means of the     A. System".         y

    IT IS STRESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WILL TAKE PLACE EXCEPT IN EXTREME
    EMERGENCY AND ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING RECORD 'THREE BLIND MICE'
    MAY BE PLAYED, THERE IS EATERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL
    ESTABLISH THE PERPETRATION OF A EORX, ETC. , AND XIT THAT CASE,. INSTEAD OF
    A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE, TEE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS PASSED
    WILL BE INDICATED BY THE PLAYING OF THE RECORD - 'TEDDY BEARS PICNIC'.
    ON~HEARING THIS 'ALL CLEAR’ STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GVHGWAYS WILL
    REMAIN ON STAND-BY AT THAT POINT FOR FIVE MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES
    AND RESUMING THEIR NORMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

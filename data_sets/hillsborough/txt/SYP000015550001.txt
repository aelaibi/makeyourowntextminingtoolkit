I am writing on behalf of my wife and myself as we both attended Hillsborough on
that fateful Saturday, the 15th April.  We are only just b e g i n n i n g t o come to terms
with what happened on that day, and it certainly has not been made any-easier by
comments that have been passed in certain quarters.  These people can only be_
described as both arrogant and ignorant, they need to be pitied.          The hierarchy
running the game of football have shown-nothing but total disrespect towards the            ,
bereaved, they should hang their heads in shame.

Inside the ground now, first job is to use the toilets then something to eat and
drink. The toilets were in a very good condition, perhaps the best we have seen
in any football ground.   I remember visiting West Bromich Albions Ground, the
toilets were in the open air and the urine was floating all over the floor and
the stench was awful.   It would have been more hygenic to have urinated were I
stood!   We now visit the food bar for some refreshments due to the great difficulty
we have in trying to get to the toilets at football grounds drinking of liquids
is limited.? Meat pies are 90p and the tea is 40p, we are served by a young girl
who is obviously nervous as we can see her visibly trembling as she attempts to
total up the sum for four purchases.   A man walks into the food bar and is over­
heard to mutter something about being short-staffed to the other ladies serving
behind the counter.   The pie is luke-warm and the tea is made from some brown
coloured powder which floats around on the surface of the hot water.   Not at all
pleased with the catering facilities we decide to make our way to our allocated
seats.

Stewards are standing around but no one asks to see our tickets or direct us to our
position in the stand. We find our seats and on being seated we notice the clock
reads 12.50 p.m. We survey the scene, not many people in the ground as yet, a few
are in the Leppings Lane Terracing who are sitting on the concrete steps reading
their programmes, one or two people are leaning right back taking in the warm sun.
We wonder what the pre-match entertainment will be -that was promised, there was to
be no pre-match entertainment.  We read our programmes, it is now 2 p.m., the
Leppings Lane central pens are getting quite full especially in comparison to the
other areas of the Leppings Lane terracing. We decide to go to the toilet, this
time a steward asks to see our tickets.

It is 2.40 p.m. the central terracing in Leppings Lane looks cram packed, people
are attempting to get out.  Some are trying to get over the front perimeter fencing
only to find they are being pushed back in the crush by the police possibly to their
deaths.  The braver and fitter ones are attempting to climb into the West Stand, to
the rear of the terracing by jumping off crush barriers or fencing and praying that
the people in the West Stand catch them and drag them to safety.  The policeman in
the West End is watching but made no attempt to prevent this happening, he obviously
knows what is happening down below.  The elevated section to the right is filling up
steadily, the section to the left appears half full, the section to the right has
hardly anyone in it. We have only noticed two young girls entering this section of
terracing to the right via the tunnel, everyone else appears to have got in there
by climbing out of the middle pens.

The two teams take to the field, the ground erupts with a cauldron of noise as
both sets of supporters sing for their respective teams, any cries for help are
totally muted. We cannot help but look over to the Lepping Lane end there is a
strange humming sort of noise coming from there.    No one up this end of the ground
is watching the game that is in progress, something is seriously wrong in the
central pens. We hear screams, we hear shouts the people in the West stand are all
standing up waving their fists towards the police.    People are being hauled up into
the West Stand, the front perimeter fencing and the fencing on the sides of the pens
have swarms of people trying to escape.   The police just stand there watching, one
man escapes he is staggering around the pitch, he drops to his knees, two policemen
grab him and appear to arrest him.   Another two lads escape, they run onto the
pitch they shout and point out to Bruce Grobbelaar that people are being crushed
to death.  A senior policeman walks onto the pitch and orders the referee to get
the players off the pitch.   Some players stop and look to see what is happening,
eventually they walk o f f .

There is now a noise of pandemonium, people are screaming for help but the police
appear to be more concerned with preventing people getting onto the pitch.  It is
the fans themselves who are assisting the injured.  It appears■that escape gates
have been opened, the gate to the terracing on the right side which is half full is
definitely open, I wonder why no one enters this section of the ground, of course I
do not realise the devastation that has taken place, those people witnessing that at
first hand certainly do not want to go back onto the terracing.
                                      -   3   -




 There are now many people on the pitch, some staggering around then collapsing on
 the turf. -The police nearest the central pens are beginning to realise just what
 is happening and are starting to provide some assistance.       The people in the West
 Stand are going berserk they are screaming and wavihg their fists in the direction
 of the police, they have seen the carnage below them.      Someone on the loud speaker
 is telling people to clear the pitch, the Forest fans are chanting, the Liverpool
 fans scream at them to shut up.     A large number of police come marching into the
 stadium from the corner between the North stand and the Kop.       We say thank God desperately
 needed assistance has arrived and of course we are quite terrified by now with events that
 are unfolding in front of our eyes.     But no, the police march to the half way line
 and form a cordon just standing there staring      at the mayhem,   a totally useless act.
 Fans run up to them, screaming for their assistance but they do not budge.

 Liverpool fans are now ripping up hoardings and using them as make shift stretchers.
 They are ferrying casualties from one end of the ground to the other.  The police
 reinforcements standing on the half way line offer no assistance and in fact
 hamper operations by standing where they do.  There are bynow many people all over the
 pitch, the people in the North stand are looking in a state of shock and are
 wondering the extent of the trauma.

 Fans and police are tearing at the perimeter fencing, I tell my wife and the man
 sitting alongside us that someone is dead inside there.  People are being carried
.out and put on the turf, lifeless bodies are being hurled all over the place.
 Unconscious people are being given heart massages and the kiss of life.  We now know
 there are fatalities as coats and jumpers are placed over the deceased faces.  People
are still staggering around, some half naked, articles of clothing come hurtling
over the perimeter fencing onto the pitch.   People around us are sobbing, some
people are leaving.   The Fire Brigade arrive, the perimeter fencing is ripped open,
 there is an ambulance behind the goal.  People are continually running backwards and
forwards with people flat out on the hoardings, some injured, some shocked some dead.
The Nottingham Forest Fans now appreciate the severity of the problem and warmly
appauld the Liverpool fans heroics.

Police and Firemen are inside the pens it is difficult to make out just what is going
on. A young man lies slumped across a crush barrier obviously dead, people are
still inside the middle section of the terracing but now to the rear, they are
shouting and pointing a the police inside the pen.  We see no signs of looting or
urinating, just total chaos.  People have told me since who were in the Leppings
Lane, of the disgusting remarks made by the police at the time, but as I did not
witness these insults first hand I will not repeat them.  As we watched these        . ' ■         !
harrowing scenes before our very eyes we felt totally useless unable to do anything.
We felt anger and grief we needed to get as far away as possible.  We made our., way
out of the stand.

It was 3.40pm as we made our exit one young lad come over who was obviously shocked
and was shaking his head and saying it was- the pigs fault. We made our way.down
the gangway, a man was standing there facing us, he was ashen his eyes staring
straight at us he was muttering that his lad was in there (obviously referring to the
Leppings Lane), We did not know what to say, I just said that they had got everyone
out now and that his son would be ok. What elso could I say? Further along
there was another man with the same expression on his face, but this face was familiar
as he sat near us at Anfield.  I asked if he was alright he replied "yes". We
moved o n .

 We are leaving the ground quite possibly via them dreaded gates.   We dare not look
 back on the side of us frightened of what we may see. We make our way past fire
 engines, ambulances and police with sirens blaring.   People are just standing around
 staring, crying attempting to make sense of the tragedy. We of course realise that
 people have died, we ask how many? Someone holding a portable radio to their ear
.replies "five". We know this is wrong as we saw at least fifteen fatalities.  We
 walk along the dual carriageway towards where our car is parked, local people are standing
 at their frontdoors staring towards Hillsborough, no one saying a word.
                                  -   4   -




Coach drivers are sat behind their steering wheels listening to their radios
wondering what is going on and how many people less they may be taking home.
Some people are sat on the coaches, obviously feeling safer now.   Outside public
phone boxes queues twenty to thirty deep are waiting to    phone home and inform the
loved ones that they are safe.   There is an eerie silence all around, the only
sound that can be heard are that of wailing sirens.   Apolice car goes past telling
people to get off the road, to clear the way for the emergency services, people
respond by hurling a verbal volley of abuse towards the car.   It is if people are
in unison saying the attempts at organisation are now totally futile.

It seems to take an age to reach the car.  We switch on the radio it is 4 p.m. we
hear "forty dead". We drive some miles, ambulances are passing us in the opposite
direction, we realise we need petrol and the use of the toilets.   As we pull into
the service station we again see queues of people waiting to use the phone, it
now enters our head that we should also be phoning home.   We decide to drive home
non-stop to get away as far as possible from Hillsborough.   We reach home at 7 p.m.
the death toll is in the 'seventies'.  What we witnessed on that fateful day will
haunt us for the rest of our lives.

This closes our account of what we witnessed on that dreadfull day. We would
like to take this opportunity to add further comments as regards football in
general.

Our experience of attending football matches is that the ’Away' sections of the
ground always appear to have far inferior facilities.  It is possible that this
breeds resentment amongst away fans due to their treatment.  Usually the catering
facilities leaves a great deal to be desired.  I remember attending a game at
Stoke City Football Club and the car and coach park was just an expanse of waste
land and it was pouring down with rain that day, everyone’s footwear was covered
in mud.

Also a visit to Aston Villa brings back memories of being treated less than human.
A friend and myself purchased tickets to stand on the terracing at the visitors
end of the stadium. We were herded into pens not dissimilar to those at Hillsborough,
it became very packed inside these pens.   The terracing to the right of us was
completely empty, we pleaded with stewards and police to open the gate to allow
some of us into this section of terracing to relieve the crushing.  We asked a
policeman who stood by the gate to unlock it for us but he replied he did not know
where the key was. Fortunately people did manage to climb over the segregating
railings onto the empty terracing and I believe also that one of the gates at the
front was eventually opened.  People could well have suffered injury on this
occasion.

We hope this letter proves to be of some use, just writing it has made us feel
that we have made some contribution in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy.
People must feel and be safe when attending football matches,, and treated to
comfort and with dignity, no other spectator or participant of any other leisure
activity would tolerate such treatment.

Finally, the signs above the Kop turnstiles at Anfield perhaps some up the attitudes
of the hierarchy within Football towards the supporters, "Enter ground at own risk,
no money refuned".

Yours most sincerely,

I am writing on behalf of my wife and myself as we both attended Hillsborough on
that fateful Saturday, the 15th April.  We are only just beginning to come to terms
with what happened on that day, and it certainly has not been made any easier by
comments that have been passed in certain quarters.  These people can only be

view we got of the Leppings Lane Terracing was rather similar to that which
Mr. I                  Witnessed when taking photographs which appeared m the Daily Post
on Saturday 22nd April.          We would now like to describe to you how events unfolded
for us on that d ay .

We set off from Llandudno just after 9am on the Saturday morning, I was allowing
a good three hours for the journey, as two weeks previously I had travelled to
York on practically the same route and had encountered a series of road works on zhe
motorways.  We left the Ml around noon and as we travelled towards Sheffield we
noticed a long stretch of roadworks along the A61 we commented then, that there would
be delays in getting from the ground. We could see no signposts directing us to
any designated parking areas and there was no police assistance with parking
arrangements.  We were assured in the Anfield Review for the 8th April that these
facilities would be available.  We did notice a sign that said "parking and i o o c
5 minutes from ground", but this certainly did not appear to be an official sign.

We parked the car about a mile from the ground around about 12.15 pm.    We Parked in
a side road, off the dual carriageway which runs past the ground. We walked down
along the dual carriageway towards the ground, the dual carriageway was the
designated parking area for the coaches, at this time there was one coach and one
minibus parked there and we had passed no more than five coaches on our journey down.
As we walked towards the ground, four lads passed us asking if we had any spares, a
few lads sitting on walls or steps in the sun drinking from beer cans but everything
is peaceful enough.

We arrive at Leppings Lane Turnstiles at about 12.40pm there is a quite a large
contingent milling around the turnstiles, there does not appear to be any oraerly
queue to join. We just push our way through people to our turnstile, there is
just one lad ahead -of us. A policeman at the turnstile asks to see his ticket, checks
it then gives him a     search then the fan is allowed through the turnstile.   Tne
policeman asks if we    are together, I inform him that we are, he checks our tickets
then through the turnstiles we go. No search for me it is obvious that if you are a
couple you are treated with some dignity.     My wife would nor have been searched as there
was no policewoman to be seen.    The ironic thing is that the man in front wore jus-
a tee-shirt and jeans and would have had great difficulty in        concealing anything.My
wife and I both wore    heavy overcoats which could easily have concealed various items,
not that we wanted to face the humiliation of being searched.

 Inside the ground now, first job is to use the toilets then something to eat and
 drink.  The toilets were in a very good condition, perhaps the best we have seen
 in any football ground.   I remember visiting West Bromich Albions Ground, the
 toilets were in the open air and the urine was floating all over the floor and
 the stench was awful.   It would have been more hygenic to have urinated were I
 stood! We now visit the food bar for some refreshments due to the great difficulty
 we have in trying to get to the toilets at football grounds drinking of liquids
 is limited. Meat pies are 90p and the tea is 40p, we are served by a young girl
.who is obviously nervous as we can see her visibly trembling as she attempts to
 total up the sum for four purchases.   A man walks into, the food bar and is over­
 heard to mutter something about being short-staffed to the other ladies serving
 behind the counter.   The pie is luke-warm and the tea is made from some brown
 coloured powder which floats around on the surface of the hot water. Not at all
 pleased with the catering facilities we decide to make our way to our allocated
 seats.

Stewards are standing around but no one asks to see our tickets or direct us to our
position in the stand. We find our seats and on being seated we notice the clock
reads 12.50 p.m. We survey the scene, not many people in the ground as yet, a few
are in the Leppings Lane Terracing who are sitting on the concrete steps reading
their programmes, one or two people are leaning right back taking in the warm sun.
We wonder what the pre-match entertainment will be that was promised, there was to
be no pre-match entertainment. We read our programmes, it is now 2 p.m., the
Leppings Lane central pens are getting quite full especially in comparison to the
other areas of the Leppings Lane terracing. We decide to go to the toilet, this
time a steward asks to see our tickets.

It is 2.40 p.m. the central terracing in Leppings Lane looks cram packed, people
are attempting to get out.  Some are trying to get over the front perimeter fencing
only to find they are being pushed back in the crush by the police possibly to their
deaths.  The braver and fitter ones are attempting to climb into the West Stand, to
the rear of the terracing by jumping off crush barriers or fencing and praying that
the people in the West Stand catch them and drag them to safety. The policeman in
the West End is watching but made no attempt to prevent this happening, he obviously
knows what is happening down below.  The elevated section to the right is filling up
steadily, the section to the left appears half full, the section to the right has
hardly anyone in it. We have only noticed two young girls entering this section of
terracing to the right via the tunnel, everyone else appears to have got in there
by climbing out of the middle pens.

The two teams take to the field, the ground erupts with a cauldron of noise as
both sets of supporters sing for their respective teams, any cries for help are
totally muted. We cannot help but look over to the Lepping Lane end there is a
strange humming sort of noise coming from there. No one up this end of the ground
is watching the game that is in progress, something is seriously wrong in the
central pens. We hear screams, we hear shouts the people in the West stand are all
standing up waving their fists towards the police.  People are being hauled up into
the West Stand, the front perimeter fencing and the fencing on the sides of the pens
have swarms of people trying to escape. The police just stand there watching, one
man escapes he is staggering around the pitch, he drops to his knees, two policemen
grab him and appear to arrest him. Another two lads escape, they run onto the
pitch they shout and point out to Bruce Grobbelaar that people are being crushed
to death. A senior policeman walks onto the pitch and orders the referee to get
the players off the pitch.  Some players stop and look to see what is happening,
eventually they walk off.

 There is now a noise of pandemonium, people are screaming for help but the police
 appear to be more concerned with preventing people getting onto the pitch.  It is
 the fans themselves who are assisting the injured.  It appears that escape gates
 have been opened, the gate to the terracing on the right side which is half full is
 definitely open, I wonder why no one enters this section of the ground, of course I
 do not realise the devastation that has taken place, those people witnessing that at
                                    -   3   -




There are now many people on the pitch, some staggering around then collapsing or.
the turf.    The police nearest the central pens are beginning to realise just what
is happening and are starting to provide some assistance.      The people in the West
Stand are going berserk they are screaming and waving their fists in the direction
of the police, they have seen the carnage below them.      Someone on the loud speaker
is telling people to clear the pitch, the Forest fans are chanting, the Liverpool
fans scream at them to shut up.     A large number of police come marching into the
stadium from the corner between the North stand and the Kop. We say thank God desperately
needed assistance has arrived and of course we are quite terrified by now with events that
are unfolding in front of our eyes.     But no, the police march to the half way line
and form a cordon just standing .there staring at the mayhem,      a totally useless act.
Fans run up to them, screaming for their assistance but they do not budge.

Liverpool fans are now ripping up hoardings and using them as make shift stretchers.
They are ferrying casualties from one end of the ground to the other.  The police
reinforcements standing on the half way line offer no assistance and in fact
hamper operations by standing where they do. There are bynow many people all over the
pitch, the people in the North stand are looking in a state of shock and are
wondering the extent of the trauma.

Fans and police are tearing at the perimeter fencing, I tell my wife and the man
sitting alongside us that .someone is dead inside there.  People are being carried
out and put on the turf, lifeless bodies are being hurled all over the place.
Unconscious people are being given heart massages and the kiss of life. We now know
there are fatalities as coats and jumpers are placed over the deceased faces. People
are still staggering around, some half naked, articles of clothing come hurtling
over the perimeter fencing onto the pitch.   People around us are sobbing, some
people are leaving.  The Fire Brigade arrive, the perimeter fencing is ripped open,
there is an ambulance behind the goal.   People are continually running backwards and
forwards with people flat out on the hoardings, some injured, some shocked Some dead.
The Nottingham Forest Fans now appreciate the severity of the problem and warmly
appauld the Liverpool fans heroics.

Police and Firemen are inside the pens it is difficult to make out just what is going
on. A young man lies slumped across a crush barrier obviously dead, people are
still inside the middle section of the terracing but now to the rear, they are
shouting and pointing a the police inside the pen. We see no signs of looting or
urinating, just total chaos.  People have told me since who were in the Leppings
Lane, of the disgusting remarks made by the police at the time, but as I did not
witness these insults first hand I will not repeat them.  As we watched these
harrowing scenes before our very eyes we felt totally useless unable to do anything.
We felt anger and grief we needed to get as far away as possible. We made our way
out of the stand.

It was 3.40pm as we made our exit one young lad come over who was obviously shocked
and was shaking his head and saying it was the pigs fault. We made our way down
the gangway, a man was standing there facing us, he was ashen his eyes staring
straight at us he was muttering that his lad was in there (obviously referring to the
Leppings Lane), We did not know what to say, I just said that they had got everyone
out now and that his son would be ok. What elso could I say? Further along
there was another man with the same expression on his face, but this face was familiar
as he sat near us at Anfield.  I asked if he was alright he replied "yes". We
moved on.

We are leaving the ground quite possibly via them dreaded gates.    We dare not lock
 back on the side of us frightened of what we may see. We make our way past fire
 engines, ambulances and police with sirens blaring.   People are just standing around
 staring, crying attempting to make sense of the tragedy. We of course realise that
 people have died, we ask how many? Someone holding a portable radio to their ear
.replies "five". We know this is wrong as we saw at least fifteen fatalities. We
 walk along the dual carriageway towards where our car is parked, local people are standing
 at their front doors staring towards Hillsborough, no one saying a word.
Coach drivers are sat behind their steering wheels listening to their radios
wondering what is going on and how many people less they may be taking home.
Some people are sat on the coaches, obviously feeling safer now. Outside public
phone boxes queues twenty to thirty deep are waiting to phone home and inform the
loved ones that they are safe. There is an eerie silence all around, the only
sound that can be heard are that of wailing sirens.  Apolice car goes past telling
people to get off the road, to clear the way for the emergency services, people
respond by hurling a verbal volley of abuse towards the car.  It is if people are
in unison saying the attempts at organisation are now totally futile.

It seems to take an age to reach the car. We switch on the radio it is 4 p.m. we
hear "forty dead". We drive some miles, ambulances are passing us in the opposite
direction, we realise we need petrol and the use of the toilets.  As we pull into
the service station we again see queues of people waiting to use the phone, it
now enters our head that we should also be phoning home. We decide to drive home
non-stop to get away as far as possible from Hillsborough. We reach home at 7 p.m.
the death toll is in the ’seventies'. What we witnessed on that fateful day will
haunt us for the rest of our lives.

This closes our account of what we witnessed on that dreadfull day. We would
like to take this opportunity to add further comments as regards football in
general.

Our experience of attending football matches is that the ’Away* sections of the
ground always appear to have far inferior facilities.  It is possible that this
breeds resentment amongst away fans due to their treatment.  Usually the catering
facilities leaves a great deal to be desired.  I remember attending a game at
Stoke City Football Club and the car and coach park was just an expanse of waste
land and it was pouring down with rain that day, everyone's footwear was covered
in mud.

Also a visit to Aston Villa brings back memories of being treated less than human.
A friend and myself purchased tickets to stand on the terracing at the visitors
end of the stadium.  We were herded into pens not dissimilar to those at Hillsborough,
it became very packed inside these pens.   The terracing to the right of us was
completely empty, we pleaded with stewards and police to open the gate to allow
some of us into this section of terracing to relieve the crushing. We asked a
policeman who stood by the gate to unlock it for us but he replied he did not know
where the key was. Fortunately people did manage to climb over the segregating
railings onto the empty terracing and I believe also that one of the gates at the
front was eventually opened. People could well have suffered injury on this
occasion.

We hope this letter proves to be of some use, just writing it has made us feel
that we have made some contribution in the wake of the Hillsborough tragedy.
People must feel and be safe when attending football matches, and treated to
comfort and with^dignity, no, other spectator or participant of any other lei-sure
activity would tolerate such treatment.

Finally, the signs above the Kop turnstiles at Anfield perhaps some up the attitudes
of the hierarchy .within Football towards the supporters, "Enter ground at own risk,
no money refuned".

Yours most sincerely,

     FA/HILLSBOROUGH

      X spoke to Glen Kirton. He was expecting 3 figures on
     Freshfields charges in connection with the bill.
     was setting that up in the Accounts. I ran through
     Counsel's fees with him and our own fees. On top of that
     there was copying. He said that was not completely
     surprising to him. It just showed they had not made a
     profit out of the FA Cup this year. It was about the same
     amount as they paid to the families. He agreed that a lot
     of the work that was undertaken would stand them in good
9W   stead for the future and he was very pleased with the way
     everything had turned out. It would not come as a surprise
     to Graham Kelly.

     Engaged 15 minutes including dictation

Dear Chief Constable

Hillsborough Enquiry

 I enclose a letter addressed to Lord Justice Taylor
 from one of my constituents.

My constituent is anxious for his views on the above
to be available to the Enquiry.

Would it be possible please for your appropriate
Officer to ensure that this letter is forwarded to
Lord Justice Taylor?

Yours truly

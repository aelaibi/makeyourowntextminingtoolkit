                               29 JANUARY 1990


         W ith     permission,           Mr Sp e a k e r , I     should

          LIKE      TO     MAKE      A   STATEMENT        ABOUT     THE

          FINAL REPORT OF LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR'S

          In q u i r y     into      the      tragedy       at      the

          Hi l l s b o r o u g h   stadium    on    15   April    1989,
          WHICH IS PUBLISHED TODAY.                      SOME MONTHS

          HAVE PASSED SINCE THAT TERRIBLE EVENT

          BUT     NOT      LONG      ENOUGH     I    KNOW   TO     DULL

          THE PAIN SUFFERED BY THE BEREAVED, AND

          I WISH TO PLACE ON RECORD MY SYMPATHY

          FOR THEM AND              FOR THOSE WHO SUSTAINED

          INJURY.

                                             2   .

        I    AM      MOST       GRATEFUL             TO      LORD    JUSTICE

        Ta y l o r     for    the        Re p o r t ,     which     sets    out

£       CLEARLY WHY WE HAVE HAD SO MANY MAJOR

        TRAGEDIES AT FOOTBALL GROUNDS OVER THE

        YEARS         AND      WHY       WE      HAVE        HAD    DISORDER

        AND          HOOLIGANISM.                       As     THE     HOUSE

        FAMILIARISES                ITSELF           WITH     THE    REPORT,

        IT       WILL        BECOME           CLEAR          THAT     IT     IS

        ADDRESSED             AS         MUCH        TO      THE     FOOTBALL

        INDUSTRY AS                 IT    IS TO THE GOVERNMENT.

        Lo r d       Ju s t i c e    Ta y l o r       explains        how     in

        HIS INTERIM REPORT HE CONCENTRATED ON

        OVERCROWDING                 BECAUSE              THAT      WAS      THE

        CAUSE          OF     THE        HILLSBOROUGH               DISASTER,

        BUT NOW HE GOES ON TO TALK OF A GAME,



                                                           /THE IMAGE OF
                                        3   .

    THE IMAGE OF WHICH HAS BEEN MUCH

    TARNISHED,         AND         OF       A   BLIGHT    OVER         THE

0   GAME      DUE           TO       OLD         GROUNDS,             POOR

    FACILITIES,              HOOLIGANISM,                 EXCESSIVE

    DRINKING AND POOR LEADERSHIP.



    Lo r d   Ju s t i c e        Ta y l o r     does     not         spare

    THOSE WHO RUN THE INDUSTRY.                                 He    SAYS

    INDEED      THAT        THE         PROVISION        THEY         MAKE

    FOR      THEIR          CUSTOMERS            IS      OFTEN         NOT

    MERELY      BASIC            BUT        SQUALID,            AND     HE

    SAYS THAT SQUALID CONDITIONS CAN HAVE

    AN    IMPACT      ON         SAFETY AND THAT                 IN HIS

    VIEW THEY ALSO LEAD TO LOWER STANDARDS

    OF BEHAVIOUR.

     Lo r d       Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r         says        that      the

     Fo o t b a l l       As s o c i a t i o n          and        Fo o t b a l l

     Le a g u e     have         not    seen          it    as    any     part

     OF    THEIR         DUTY          TO       OFFER        GUIDANCE        TO

     CLUBS          ON      SAFETY                  MATTERS,       AND        HE

     QUESTIONS            WHETHER               THE        DIRECTORS         OF

     MANY CLUBS ARE GENUINELY INTERESTED IN

     THE WELFARE OF THEIR OWN SUPPORTERS OR

     THEIR GOOD BEHAVIOUR.                             PLAYERS TOO ARE

     CRITICISED,             WITH           LORD       JUSTICE        TAYLOR

     POINTING OUT THAT INCITEMENT FROM THE

     PITCH         OR     BAD          BEHAVIOUR             BY    PLAYERS,

     WHICH        IS NOT          CONFINED TO SOCCER,                       HAS

     A    MAJOR         INFLUENCE               ON     THE       CROWD.         I

     ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SOME CLUBS HAVE MADE



                                                           /AN EFFORT TO
                               5   .

AN    EFFORT      TO      IMPROVE         STANDARDS,        BUT

Lo r d J u s t i c e T a y l o r 's     clear      conclusion

WAS     THAT     THE      MAJORITY           HAD     NOT    AND

THAT     THE    GAME      ONLY         HAS    A    FUTURE    IF

THE     DIRECTORS         AND          THE    PLAYERS       CAN

CHANGE      THEIR OWN          PRIORITIES           AND    GIVE

A LEADERSHIP WHICH IS PLAINLY LACKING

AT PRESENT.



He    agrees       with      the        Government         that

THERE      MUST      BE    A       MOVE      TOWARDS       ALL-

SEATER       STADIA        AND         POINTS       OUT    THAT

SECTION 11 OF THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS

Act        specifically                  provides           the

MACHINERY        FOR THIS.              THE       CHANGE WILL

IMPROVE      SAFETY            AND         WILL          IMPROVE

BEHAVIOUR,      AND WE            INTEND TO BRING                IT

about.       Lo r d        Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r        makes

CLEAR THAT THE BULK OF

THE    FINANCES       FOR      GROUND           IMPROVEMENTS

WILL   HAVE TO        BE      RAISED BY THE                   CLUBS

THEMSELVES.           He     SAYS         THERE     ARE        WAYS

OF    RAISING   TJ«r^MONEY                 IF    THE      CLUBS'

MANAGEMENT            IS          ENTERPRISING                  AND

RESOURCEFUL       AND          HE         POINTS         TO     THE

OPPORTUNITIES                         PRESENTED                  BY

SPONSORSHIP.           He      ALSO        POINTS        TO     THE

REVENUE    THAT        FLOWS          TO    THE        FOOTBALL

AUTHORITIES       FOR TELEVISION RIGHTS AND

SAYS THAT THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES



                                           /SHOULD ENSURE
                                 7   .

SHOULD         ENSURE         THAT            THIS         VALUABLE

SOURCE OF REVENUE XS DIRECTED TOWARDS

IMPROVING            STADIA.             He     CANVASSES         THE

POSSIBILITY OF A LEVY ON TRANSFER FEES

WHICH       HE       SAYS   HAVE          REACHED          A     LEVEL

WHICH MANY REGARD AS GROTESQUE.



Th e r e   are       a   whole       series          of    detailed

RECOMMENDATIONS SET OUT IN CHAPTERS 3,

4 AND 5 ON MATTERS RELATING TO

SPECTATOR            SAFETY      SUCH           AS    GATES        AND

GANGWAYS.                   INDEED,             OF         THE      76

RECOMMENDATIONS,                     43         IN        SUBSTANCE

APPEARED         IN THE        INTERIM REPORT.                     THE

Go v e r n m e n t    accepts        these       proposals,

                                     /s o m e    of       which
SOME         OF       WHICH          CAN          BE      IMPLEMENTED

IMMEDIATELY.                   SOME       WILL           NEED     FURTHER

work.         Fo r       convenience                 I    have        placed

in     the    Vo t e O f f i c e          a     schedule          setting

out    the        Go v e r n m e n t 's        response          to     each.




Ho n    Me m b e r s       will       recall             that     section

13     of         the        Fo o t b a l l        Sp e c t a t o r s    Act

provision.                 Lo r d J u s t i c e          Ta y l o r

    LEGISLATION             AND      WE       WILL         HAVE         TO

    CONSIDER WHETHER IT IS JUSTIFIED.


                 / €
    Pa r t   III /t h e R e p o r t         contains           a    number

    of   proposals          relating         to     crowd          control

    AND HOOLIGANISM.                  IT     ACKNOWLEDGES THE

    CRUCIAL        ROLE      OF    THE       POLICE            IN CROWD

    control.           Lo r d J u s t i c e       Ta y l o r       rightly

    REMINDS        US THAT,         WITHOUT THE WORK OF

    THE POLICE, MANY SPORTING EVENTS WOULD

    BE CHAOTIC AND COULD NOT BE PERMITTED

    TO     TAKE    PLACE.      SOMETHING         LIKE   5000

    POLICE        OFFICERS          ARE     ENGAGED       ON

    FOOTBALL       DUTIES     EACH      SATURDAY    DURING

    THE SEASON,          LARGELY AT THE EXPENSE OF

    THE TAXPAYER AND RATEPAYER.                    He    PAYS

    TRIBUTE                            THEIR SERVICE.       I

    WANT TO ADD MY THANKS TO THE POLICE

    FOR     THE      WAY     THEY       CARRY     OUT     THE

    DIFFICULT,             THANKLESS        AND         OFTEN

    UNTHANKED TASKS WHICH ARE THRUST UPON

    THEM.



    Th e    Re p o r t   recognises        the     advances

    MADE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IN

                                   11   .

THE      EFFECTIVENESS OF THE                        POLICING OF

FOOTBALL,           PARTICULARLY INSIDE GROUNDS,

AND       TO     THE      MAJOR            IMPACT        OF     CLOSED

CIRCUIT          TELEVISION                 ON     THE        HOOLIGAN

PROBLEM.                 IT      ALSO        MENTIONS              OTHER

MEASURES TAKEN BY THE GOVERNMENT SUCH

AS       THE     RESTRICTION                ON     THE        SALE     OF

ALCOHOL AND THE POWER GIVEN TO THE

COURTS           TO       MAKE             ORDERS         EXCLUDING

CONVICTED HOOLIGANS FROM GROUNDS.



Lo r d    Ju s t i c e        Ta y l o r     also        recognises

THE       GREAT          POTENTIAL               VALUE        OF      THE

police         Na t i o n a l     Fo o t b a l l    In t e l l i g e n c e

CRIME AND WITH HOOLIGANS TRAVELLING TO

MATCHES ABROAD.



As I     have      said,     Lo r d    Ju s t i c e     Ta y l o r

TAKES THE VIEW THAT BETTER FACILITIES

AND    BETTER       TREATMENT          OF        FANS      WILL

BRING BETTER BEHAVIOUR.                     BEYOND THAT,

the   Re p o r t   recommends         the       creation       of

THREE NEW SPECIFIC Ttmecziicw SPECIFIC

OFFENCES TO APPLY AT DESIGNATED SPORTS

GROUNDS:              THROWING              A      MISSILE;

CHANTING       OBSCENE       OR      RACIALIST          ABUSE;

AND    GOING        ONTO     THE       PITCH          WITHOUT

REASONABLE         EXCUSE:           AND IT ALSO ASKS

FOR CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN TO



                           /EXTENDING THE             courts'
EXTENDING THE COURTS' POWERS TO IMPOSE

ATTENDANCE          CENTRE ORDERS               AND       FOR THE

USE OF ELECTRONIC TAGGING IN THE CASE

OF    OFFENDERS              CONVICTED         OF      FOOTBALL-

RELATED        OFFENCES.               THE     SPECIFIC           NEW

OFFENCES SUGGESTED DO TO SOME                               EXTENT

SEEM TO DUPLICATE OFFENCES WHICH                                  ARE

ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE PUBLIC ORDER

Ac t .       Bu t   I    shall       look     carefully           and


QUICKLY AT ALL THESE SUGGESTIONS.



I NOW        COME       TO    THE      PROPOSED         FOOTBALL

Membership              Sc h e m e .          Lo r d      Ju s t i c e

Ta y l o r     examined             the      In v i t a t i o n    to

Te n d e r    for   a     scheme          which     was     issued




                             /b y   the      consultants
BY     THE    CONSULTANTS         EMPLOYED            BY   THE

FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES.               He CAME TO THE

CONCLUSION THAT         HE COULD NOT                  SUPPORT

A SCHEME OF THAT KIND BECAUSE HE DID

NOT BELIEVE THE TECHNOLOGY WOULD WORK

WELL    ENOUGH    TO    AVOID          THE       DANGER     OF

CONGESTION AND DISORDER.                     He WAS ALSO

CONCERNED       ABOUT    THE       CALL          ON    POLICE

resources.        In s t e a d    he      proposes         the

MEASURES TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED.



In     the    light     of       this      advice,         the

Government have decided not to proceed

Then he goes on to consider the question of the Secretary of State’s            B
powers under, so far as we are concerned, section 17 of the Criminal                                                                                     L. N. W.
Appeal Act 1968. He said, at p. 580:
    “If section 8 [of the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Act 1968] envisages
    more than one appeal arising out of the same conviction, the
    purpose of the Secretary of State’s powers . . . becomes obscure,
    because it would follow that the applicant could always approach            C
    the court directly without the intervention of the Secretary of
    State.”

    As to that, Mr. Mansfield puts forward this proposition. He submits
that it is not the applicant’s fault that the evidence which is sought to be
adduced has come to light late in the day. He did not know that it
existed. He suggests that to cast the applicant upon the mercy of the           D
                                                                                                                [q u een ’s bench division ]
Secretary of State would be an injustice. It is imposing between the
applicant and the court a further discretion, that of the Secretary of
                                                                                                    REGINA v. WEST LONDON CORONER,

would be unfair.
   But the final and most important part of the judgment so far as the                              REGINA v. WEST LONDON CORONER,

almost the last paragraph of the judgment. Widgery L.J. said, at p. 580:
                                                                                     1986 Dec. 15, 16; 19                                      Watkins L.J. and Roch J.
    “Mr. Eastham , however, takes one further point. He refers us to

    presupposes the existence of a competent appeal or application, and                  Jurisdiction o f High Court to quash verdict on ground of

acted for or in the name of the company but against those who were to be
identified as the embodiment of the company itself. The coroner formed the view
that there was no such case fit to be left to the jury against this company. I see no
reason to disagree. I would add that I see no sustainable case in manslaughter
against the directors who are named either.
   I do not think the aggregation argument assists the applicants. Whether the
defendant is a corporation or a personal defendant, the ingredients of manslaughter
must be established by proving the necessary mens rea and actus reus of
manslaughter against it or him by evidence properly to be relied on against it or
him. A case against a personal defendant cannot be fortified by evidence against
another defendant. The case against a corporation can only be made by evidence

“did the misdirection have any bearing on the verdict which the jury
came to in this case?” and I say, with regard to that, that I am
absolutely satisfied that it had no possible bearing on the outcome.
   The position is this. The jury brought in a verdict of death by
misadventure. That means that the jury were satisfied, on the balance of        F
probabilities at any rate, that there was here a death caused by an
accident. That was the critical matter which they had to determine. In

other words, was it a case where the police officer’s arm was deliberately
round the deceased’s neck or was it a case where his arm slipped? I then
take into account the fact that, although the coroner’s direction was                        ‘DUBAI BANK LTD. v. GALADARI                       and   O t h e r s (N o. 2)

the jury, he was dealing with something which was unnecessary to deal           F
with. In other respects the summing up was satisfactory.                            1989     Dec. 8, 11; 21       Slade and Mann L.JJ. and Sir David Croom-Johnson

    I do not think the aggregation argument assists the applicants. Whether the
defendant is a corporation or a personal defendant, the ingredients of manslaughter
must be established by proving the necessary mens rea and actus reus of
manslaughter against it or him by evidence properly to be relied on against it or

another defendant. The case against a corporation can only be made by evidence

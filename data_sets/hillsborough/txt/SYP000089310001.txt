             at Sheffjr^ld on April               15th (150489)        between Liverpool and Notts Forest

             was the on v Li veroo/^ came I saw this season.

             My brother                                 lives in Nottingham and on the Friday before

             the match I travelled to Nottingham and stayed the night with him.

             We left Nottingham at 11.15 am (1115) on the day of the match and I

             travelled in a car driven by a man named                           , also in the car was a

             man called                      and an older man who I did not kno                  These people
                                                                                                      _ 1 2l

             but he has been seen by the Police.

                         got me a ticket for the match it was for the Forest end of the

             ground a terrace ticket and cost £6,
                                                                        PAGE       2
                                                                        S3357

On reaching Sheffield we drove into a two mile queue of traffic and

arrived at the street near to the ground at about        1.15 pm (1315).      My

brother            went to the game in another    car with two or three

friends and I did not see              or his friends from the time I left

his house in the morning until we got back at night at about 7 pm

(1900).

On arriving at Shefield I stayed with the lad called               as we

supporting Liverpool and the others were Forest supjxfrters .        I do not

k now         ad d r e s s ,           is his telephone number,   his surname

is            and I think he lives in                        We sat on a wall

in Leadings Ln after getting some chips.         Although we both had

tickets for the Forest End we really wanted to go into the Liverpool

end.    We tried to get into the Leppings Ln end but after the Police

checked our tickets we were turned away, and to go to the Forest End.

We started to walk away and came to a Police manned barrier an officer

there said he did not know how to get to the Forest end and because

we were Liverpool       supporters they advised us to try again to get

into the Liverpool End.        All this took place at about 2 pm (1400) to

2.13 pm <1413) and it was very busy and there was a lot of people

milling around.

We again made our way back to the turnstiles        in Leppings Ln and asked

a steward if we could get in he directed us to an end turnstile

on the right as you look at the ground from Leppings Ln, as this

turnstile man had been letting Liverpool       supporters   in even if they

did not have the correct tickets.        We went to this turnstile and we

showed the man our tickets and explained that we were Liverpool

supporters            showed his Liverpool membership card and we wejf’
                                                                      e let

into the/ground.

At the/time we entered the ground it was about ten to quarter           past two

( 14 10 /1415) and it did not appear to busy.      We walked through the
                                                                                       PAGE         3
                                                                                       S3337

          tunnel and into t>n& LeppingsJ^t terrace.           I knew where to go as I had

          been to theyif^ame g               ^             We were not pushed along the

          tunnel      it was not that busy.      As we left the tunnel and walked      into

          the terrace I saw a blue fence dividing ahead which run down the

          terrace to Jme      perimeter fence, and            and myself went to the left

          of theyF'ence.      At this   point this area was    reasonable    clear and you

          cou^im stand where you wanted to.          At first we just sat around and

          chatted near to the perimeter fence,          but when it started to get busy

          we moved back and settled about          18 feet from the perimeter fence and

          about half way accross the pen,          it was now about twenty five to three

          ( 1433) .

          We remained in this position and at about a quarter to three              (1443)     it

          started to get very packed but not to bad.            I remember the players

          coming out to warm up it was about ten to three           01430)   by now.   After

          this I remember the teams being announced am^iThe           crush became really

          bad,   I could not see the pitch but I renumber the game kicking off

          because of the cheer.         Even before Jimis time people around me were

          falling down near to me,         but Iyfcannot describe these people at all.

          To me these people appeared^Xo be dead even before the match kicked

          off.     I saw them fall ovet,      their arm would flai about for a while and

          then they would go limp and not move again.            Before all this

          happened I had lost contact with                &nd did not see him again until

          we got back to our car.

          At this point I was getting worried and panicked I shouted to try and

          get attention for the people who were dying near to me.              I saw three

          or four Policemen standing the other side of the perimeter fence and

          they did not appear to realise what was going on.            I sawythem

TO        laughing to each other.          I saw people at the front trying to clifnb

          over the perimeter fence a n d these were being punned back by Police

the crush.      I remember being pushed up in the air almost on to the

back of the person in front of me.           I could see that a lot of people

were    in serious trouble around me with their faces pushed into peoples

backs.     The crush seemed to go on and on and it was obvious           people

were dead around me also people around me were screaming and

shouting.    I stopped shouting because I was having difficulty

breathing.     After about twenty minutes of the really bad crush the

pressure started to ease.          I knew the game had been stopped and I

could see people on the pitch.

When the terrace        clears a little I went down to the p e r i m e ^ r   fence

and climbed over onto the pitch no one helped me arid/ir clifflbed ‘over

/ight behind the goal,        I think the perimeter gaj>e was on my left.

Once    I got onto the pitch I collapsed because of the crush and lay in

the pitch.      1 was    lying face down on theypitch and I can remember

someone    coming around with a bucket of water and putting some on my

face,     1 also remember someone giving me something to drink          out of a

small     bottle. I think     it was whisky or brandy.

I was    lying on the pitch on the left as you look from the Leppings Ln

end about    15 yards shot of the centre spot.          I remember talking to a

steward who said he had only been called up about             12.30 (1230)    that

day.

I lay on the pitch for about five minutes and started walking around

looking for             , but I could not find him.      I made my way towards

the goal area and saw a lot of people being attended to and a lot of

people dead with their faces covered.

I went with two other        lads and kicked down an advertising board,         I do

not know the other        lads but 1 would describe as 18 to 20 years bright

ginger hair wearing a green Tee shirt with Waterboys on, he was

definately a Liverpudlian.          He was hit by a steward after he accused a

                    stood on the board, just as we jptfre about to pick it up.   We told him

            j       the g round the re was adfough stretchers to go around.         Another

                    Liver pool walked yfis and shoved the policeman off it.         We went back      to

                    the goal line>*fnd about eight or ten of us was carrying the board.

                    I saw a St J o h n ’s man working on a man but as we got to him he said

                    the man was dead.       We pushed the man onto the hoarding and he was so

                    heavy,   the hoarding    cracked in the middle but did not      break.    I would

 T ^ e              describe the man on      the hoarding as being abcunrfT 27-30   yrs, 6*1, 2,

                    We ran with this majj/the length of the pitch because I was not sure he

                    response.    The man by now was dripping with sweat particularly his

fiOlW           ^ af,ms which were cold and limp.         The man had short^^fFk hair and a

N       l2oW        square set face.

                    On reaching the Forest end we had to y d i t about a minute before being

(|£                 b 1 e to carry the hoarding through a narrow exit off the pitch because

                    of the amount of people carrying people on hoardings and stretchers.

                    An ambulance went up the slope       in front of us and this appeared to be

                    full of people.

                    After going up the slope exit we took the man around the rear of the

                    stand.  Two Policemen told us take the man offyfcfte J-'ioardings which we

                    did and about six of us carried the man it^ 6 a sports hall, I remember

                    badminiton courts were marked out.        Twcj/of the lads had taken

                    the hoarding back down into the pitch again.          Once in the sports hall

         we were told where to lay the man on the floor.          In there I saw

         several    people about 23 or 30 laid out covered by white      paper.

         Someone    I do not remember who,    looked at the man we had brought and

         told us he was dead.       After this I went back into the pitch and ran up

         to the Leppings Ln goal area but there was no one else to move.             I

         walked around the pitch for about another ten minutes         looking for

                but I did not see him.       I then went   into the main stand and sat

         for a couple of minutes, after this I left the ground it was about 4

         pm (1600) and made my way back to the car.         After about half an hour

         everyone    returned to the car and we made our way back to Nottingham.

It was         evident          that m a n y       fans were au fait with the area and                             very much

a ware     that        the ground was                  no more       than a ten minute              walk    from where

they had been dropped                        off       by the       coaches.



By 2 . 3 0      pm     (1430)         coaches          were    still      arriving        and there were many

hundreds            of fans          still     mak i n g      their way down to the ground.



At appr        ok   irnate ly 2 . 5 0        pm    (1450)          my Serial       and    I proceeded           to make      our

way bach: t o t h e g r o u n d , even a t t h is t im e fans we r e s t i 11 m a k x n g t h e a r

way     to the         ground,         man y      of    them       running.



Whilst         making          our    way    to    the     ground,        I could        hear     a sudden       roar      coming

from     the        c r o wd    inside       the       ground and         I presumed         that    one    of    the      two

teams      ha d      scored          a goal.           Almost      simultaneously            we    were    informed         that

our    presence           was        required          inside      the    ground;,       although      it w a s n ’t c lear

We a r r i v e d at the               stad i u m at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 3 . 1 0        pm    (1510)       and were

i m m e d i a t e l y deployed              to w a t c h tfoqf N o t t i n g h a m Forest           fans at       the bpion

K o p end of the                playing        surface         perimeter.             Once   inside       the    ground,         I

could see            that numerous                s u pporters        had s p i l l e d onto        the    pitch at         the

Leppings            In end and           I presumed that                 the Liv e r p o o l      supporters       were

fighting.              The N o t t i n g h a m         supporters         at    this     time were        getting       very

a g i t a t e d and        restless as             like as          they were         unaware      of the

c i r c u m s t a n c e s of the t r a g e d y and b e l ieved                     the    fans were        fighting.             At

this     time        I could see Police                    Officers           and fans at the L e p p i n g s Ln end

tearing         down the w o o d e n              hoarding ar o u n d           the    pitch      perimeter       and using

it as m a k e shift                  stretchers.              At   this       stags    we were      u n c e r t a i n as    to

what     had occurred.

As t ime we nt on I could see                   fans and P o 1 i oe Officers                g i v i ng mo ut h t o

mouth     resus c i t a t i o n and heart massage                  toy people       lying ail        over     the

playing        pitch.      It was      only after a JteBfgthy period that                        the

r e a l i sation of the         tragedy which was                 unfolding,        struck      both myself          and

the Notts        fans,     and even then             only because           dead bodies were            being       left

at the Notts          end of the          pi t c h .



We still        did not     know exac t l y what              had occurred,          but    i n f o r m a t i o n about

Officers        carrying      the     injured and dead from the Le ppi ngs Ln end,,



M any w i t h i n    the Notts        crowd     came        forward to offer          their a s s i s t a n c e      in

dealing wit h the           injured.



Once     the   game had been           cancelled,            the*lMotts fans made             their way        out of

the ground          in a very orderly manner                    and our Serial         was     deployed        back

to our     original        positions        on Hal i fa;-; Rd.



Many Liverpool           supp o r t e r s a p p r o a c h e d     us trying        to find out about

relatives and we gave what                    help we         could.        The    fans were       quiet and

subdued as          they made       their way          back     to the      coaches.        However,         some

were     hostile      towards       us,    swearing at            us and     blaming       us for      the    events

w hich    occurred.         As we      listened         to the      report        coming    over     the     fans'

transistor          radios,     the    full     scale        of the    events       started      to unfold.



Finally,       at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6 .0 0     pm    (1800)    we    resumed       to C l a y w h e e i s L.n

for a meal          and after       that we went            off    duty at 7,1 5       pm     (191     )»

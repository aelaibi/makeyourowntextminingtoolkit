              On S at u r d a y      13th April     1989       I had a ticket            to go to the         semi    final

              football         m atch at S h e f f i e l d     between L iv e r p o o l       and N o t t i n g h a m Forest.

              It was a six            pound terrace          ticket      for the L e p p i n g s Lane         end w h i c h    I

              had to get          from Anf i~&4<^ a bout 2 weeks                 before.        I went to t h e m a t c h by



                                                                                                           ,a nd

              We were held up near to fHe Rochdale turn off the M 6 2 , c ongestion of

              traffic and also s to p p e d at one of the service stations for about ten

             minutes.          As we were      enter ing S h e f fi el d the traffic was                     very bad an d         it

              took     us a long        time to get          from the m o t o r w a y        into S h e f f i e l d and we

              parked our          car next to a row of shops                     on a mai n       road facing a school

about £0 m in ut es walk                  from the ground a r r i v i n g at about 2 -05                       pm.     We

had s o m ething            to eat from the Chip Sho p a n d star t e d                       to make our way

straight        towards           the      ground. Whilst w a l k i n g             down     I saw a few

s u p po rt er s      drinking          from    cans    but there was              no disorder         fighting or

drinking.             T here were         plenty       of Police about              lining the main            road

standing         by the          side    ro            We got        to the       entrance to the ground               at
                     SoS t-L-
about        14.2 5hrs and there was                   ja^nfa^s              of    people    in this area,

T here were           no queues at all              and the          crowd was       right out         onto    the    road

past     the    outer        iron gates.            We went and stood at the                    back and we

se e m e d to get           thro u g h    the outer           iron gates          fairly quickly,         but     it was

getting        very     packed          in this area.

We were        in the a r ea to the                right as you          look at the           turnstiles         near      to

the    river.          I saw two m o u n t e d Police                 just    inside       of the turnstiles.

Not    long after            we had got           thro u g h these       outer       iron gates.          The Police

closed them behind us w h i c n S ^ t h o u g h t                       was a good idea but they only
                                                                                 Po^-              -

st a y e d    closed for about                 a m in u t e        T h e m o unte d Police just had no

control        over     the         crowd-.at all „ I d o n H y r ^ m e m b e r            seeing a n y P o l i c e

O f fi ce rs     on foot            in this a r ^ .           I was wait i n g      to     get through these

t ur n s t i l e s    for about          23 minutes           nd   this a rea and          it g r a d u a l l y got more

and more         packed and e ve nt u a l l y the two Po l i c e                     on horses         gave    up,

they were            shouting at          the     crowd and they brought                   the horses         thro u g h

the    crowd and            everyone          tried to g H ^ o u t       olf the way.

At about         14.55hrs          I e ve nt ua ll y got t hr o H g h 11")e turnsti 1 es and gave my

ticket        in.      As    I got       t hr o u g h the      other    side       1 saw    one or two Stewa r d s

their    glasses and were                   sweating       in the face.              They told me to get                 over

by the     fence         towards          the wings as          they were        sure      people       had died        in

the    tunnel      w h i ch they had just                   come from.          We    pushed our way over               to

the    fence w h i c h         runs a lo n g       pen 3 near      to the       front and          I      was looking

a r o u n d for my brother.                  I could see          people        climbing      over the front

perimeter        fence and the Police                      were s h o u t i n g      for   everyone           to rush

back.     The m at c h had been stb                         ‘     ‘      ' re were         bodies       being     lifted

over    the     crowd.          I couldn't          beleiVe what was              happening.             At    no time

had    I. noti c e d a crowd surge as                                     ha d just        built       u p o v er a

               On Saturday,    15 April         1989 (150489)    I commenced duty at 0800am at

               Mexborough Police Station and reported to Doncaster Headquarters for

               0845am from where we were transported to Hillsborough F o o tb al l

               Ground a rriving at 0945am.            We were there briefed by senior off i cers

               on the forthcoming days proceedings, and I was assigned to Serial
                                                diizs
               33, my Sergeant being PS AITKEN and overall               in charge was Inspector
   .     #>£                                                              ^1\‘
                                                                             80
               MILLETT.     I was positioned in company with PC HIGHTON at the bottom of
           n• Penistone    Rd outside the Travellers Public House.              My duties were to

               supervise Liverpool Supporters safely down towards the ground and make

               sure they behaved in an orderly manner.                Whilst at my post outside the

               Travellers Public House,            the Liverpool Supporters were behaving in an

               orderly manner and seemed to be in good h u m o u r , although as they past,

               a larger number of them were drinking from cans of beer and lager and
                                                                      PAGE        2
                                                                      S2227
the occasional    one still had 2 or 3 unopened cans in their hands.        The

occasional supporters walked past me smelling strongly of intoxicants

and were staggering as they walked.

At about 2.45pm <1445)      I was called to the Gate Public House, which is

situated next to the travellers      public house, as there was some kind

of a disturbance there.      On this occasion I did not enter the public

house as the disturbance had already been sorted out.

At about 2.55prri (1455)    I heard some shouting and banging from down the

side of the Gate Public House and I subsequently went to investigate

this.     As I looked down this alleyway I could see a group of about 8

youths shouting and thumping at the exit door of the pub.         Some of the

people approached me,      claiming that some of their friends were getting

beat up inside the pub.      Other officers also attended at the scene and

eventually we gained access      into these premises, where on entering the

lounge area inside I could see broken glass scattered over the floor

and a couple of pool cues snapped in half.        There was no disturb an ce

at this time and from making enquiries with customers within the

public house they stated that it was only a minor scuffle in the far

corner of the pub.    There were no complaints made to the police and

we subsequently left the premises, although it was apparent that

Liverpool supporters were      involved.

Immediately after leaving these premises PS AITKEN informed me that

our serial was required at the Leppinqs Ln end of the ground and

together with my serial      I attended outside the gates at the L epp ing s

Ln end.

As we arrived at this area there were a large number of supporters

standing around in the streets waving tickets and saying they had

tickets and wanted to get into the ground.        We were informed by the

Supervisory officer at the scene not to allow anyone else into the

ground at the present time and to form a cordon across the gates,
                                                                          PAGE    3
                                                                          S2227
which we subsequently did.

About 5 to 10 minutes   later supporters were walking out of       the ground,

saying that people were dying in the ground.       PS AITKEN was then

ordered to go into the ground with his serial and we entered the

ground to the area at the rear of the Lappings Ln Stand.          As we

entered into this area I could see supporters      running around in a

confused state and there were about a dozen or so people laid on the

ground,   some of which were   obviously dead.   I then entered    the tunnel^

in the centre of the stand     where people and other officers    were

rushing up and down carrying people out of the stand.        I remained in

this tunnel area assisting     in clearing this area for other emergency

services a nd ass isting in removing people f rom the stands      into the

area behind the stands where they could be treated for any injuries

they may have.    By this time this area had become frantic with people

rushing around not knowing what to do or what was really happening.

There were a lot of people severely shocked from this incident and I

found it necessary to comfort same of these people and reassure them.

After about half an hour most of the injured bodies were removed

through this tunnel area and we subsequently formed a cordon at th e

end of the tunnel to stop supporters from entering back into the stand

and therefore leaving more room for emergency work within the stand.

When all the bodies had been removed from the terraces we again formed

a cordon in the rear of the stand and assisted in safe evacuation of

supporters from the ground.     When the ground had been cleared we

returned to Claywheels Ln where we were stood down and obtained

transport back to Doncaster Headquarters where      I booked off duty at

8pm (2000).

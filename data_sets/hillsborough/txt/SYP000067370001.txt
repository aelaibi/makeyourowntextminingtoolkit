                at    2 , £ 0 pm      (1420)       I had         cause       to a r r e s t         a youth         from       the      bus       for     being

                with       hi m a n d      once       at     this      location,            I saw          that    he       had     fallen          o f f the

                shouted          threats         of     violence          to me.               These        included,             ’L e a v e      him alone

                away       and     spit     on me.               I ha d      no     choice          but     to    leave        th e     youth          and

                attempt          to     seek    medical           assistance.                    As    I made          my way          down       to     the

                disturbance              was     occurring             in that          area.              I attempted              to m a k e         my way

                there       through         th e      congestion           of       the     N or th Stand,              but       was       pushed

                forward          by a y o u t h         shouting,            ’T h a t ' s      a bit        fucking           strong.’




                I turned          around and               took, h o l d      of     the       accused           and    he     began         to     struggle

                with       me.          I managed            to w r e s t l e       him     to      the     edge       of     the      pitch        but       such

                was    his       determination                that      two       other        Officers           had       to a s s i s t        me     to

                restrain          him.           The       man    would       not       calm        down     and       ha d    to      be    forcibly

                taken       to    the     Police           Room     along         the     track.             As     this       took         pl a c e ,     it w a s

and    I could         see      a    large          number            of     fans     and Police              on     the      pitch.             The

accused       wa s    taken          to    th e         Police          Room       and    booked          in„           He    wa s    detained.




I was      then      informed             to       clear          the      gymnasium           for       apparent            casualties,

which      I di d w i t h           other          Officers.                  I then went                outside           the     gym,     where

opinion.             The       body was             taken            into     the     gym,         where      I saw          several        other

bodies       were     being          brought                in on       stretchers             and       billboards               from     the

ground.            I then           took       a    stretcher                onto     the      pitch with               another           Officer,

where      I saw      hundreds             of       fans          and      other      persons            running           about.           They

were      carrying         other          bodies             out      of     the    ground          on s i g n s ,         and     it w a s

apparent       that        there          were          a    large         amount        of    dead       and      dying          persons        on

I ran      through         the       persons                with      the     other       Officer           and      stretcher,             to       the

Leppings       Ln     e n d , where                I saw          that       the    restraining              barrier              fence

had    been    pulled           up    in a          place.                 Persons        were        running           about        in    pa nic

and    injured        persons             were          being         tended        to    by P o l i c e ,         ambulance              and

other      fans      on a n d        around             the       pitch.            I saw          several         fans       running           up    to

persons       who     were          giving          first            aid     and    pulling           them        off      them.           I saw a

fan    run    up     to a n a m b u l a n c e m a n ,                 or     steward,          a nd      k 1 ck    him       in the        back

and    run    back        towards          th e         st a n d .           I began          to    look     for        persons           who    di d

We all        left at about                1035 hours and              drove       to E l l e s m e r e Port where we

experienced                si nun. ar delays.              The whole         jour n e y took a p p r o x i m a t e l y

three        hours. ? On           the way          to the ground,             I didn't        see any other

suppo r t e r s       d r i nking wh i l s t           trave l l i n g      by car.

We a r r i v e d      in S h e f f i e l d a r o u n d       1400 hours an d were                 not      sure of where

we were           or where         we    could       park,       so we      parked where we             could and we

knew we were                near     the    ground,         as we      could see         s upporters moving                  in one

As    it turned out we were                         only    ten minu t e s        from     the ground.           We         parked

the    car and w a l k e d              to the       ground.          We    didn't      see any Police           escorts

by f o l l o w i n g    e v e ryone       else      on the way to             the    ground.

1 d i d n ’t see any f i g h t i n g               or disorder          but    did see a few of the              fans

dr i nking         cans of beer.              We    d i d n ’t stop on the way to the                   ground and
      /'
aj/fived there about                    1415 hours.

As we w a l k e d       into L e p p i n g s Lane              from the River             Don side     I could see «

mass       of   people       s tood      in f r o nt-of         the gates          to the     t urnstiles      of the

t e r races        entrance.            This went         right       up to the       turnstiles        itself and

the gates           in front        of those         t urnstiles          were      open.

I c o u l d n ’t see         the e n t r a n c e s       to the       seating area.

In the Leppi n g s            Ln    itself         I remember          there/being           quite a few Poli c e

vehic l e s        parked ther e and a c o u p 3.e of ^o 1 i ce O f f icers                         stood there,

further ar o u n d           near       the   terrace          t u r n s t i l e s were     several   more Police

I received no Pol i c e d i r e c t i o n at this                         stage and          could see    no

stewards.           There were           t w a m o u n t e d P gT i c e 0 f f i c e r s in that a rea as well.

All        three    of us went           down the s|^e               of what       I now know to be the

terrace         turnstiles,             parallel         with the River             Don,,     We were    trying     to

find        our way     in and a v o i d           the    crowd.        As we went           down the    side    of the

ground we           came     to a metal            type    fence,       the    type       erected     by the Police

and        by this were            about      eight       or    nine Police          Officers.

They       e n q uired what we were                 doing and gave             us directions           to the    correct

turnstiles.             We turned a r o u n d and                   joined    the    crowd at this        stage.

            went     off     to    join the queue at the West S t a n d seating                           turnstile

and                    who    d i d n ’t have a ticket and had hoped                           to buy one outside

the    ground,         deci d e d       not   to bother and wait                   until     later.

I joined the mass                  of    people      just       inside       the    gates     in front    of the

terrace         turns t i l e s     alone      and was          pushed forward.              The    crowd seemed

quite        jovial     and as          the   crowd grew             pressure       star t e d to     increase    and

            and    form queues          but    that went       unheard,        mainly.         The m o u n t e d O f f icers

            were    more       of a hindrance,            causing      people      to surge and then                push

            themselves          out    of the way.

            I made my way towards                 the     t u r n s t i l e s an d saw several            s u pporters      trying

            they a l r e a d y    opened.

            I was almost          pushed t h r o u g h       the     turnstile      and had to almost                throw my

            ticket       to the man at          the turnstile.

            crowd.        There were          several       Policeman       in that a rea and              I believe? I saw

            a couple          of stewards.           I w a s n ’t s e a rched      upon entering             the    ground.

            To the       left was an opening                in the wall        a n d further         down     a small       fenced

            enc l o s u r e   made     by portable          fences     where     programmes were              being sold.           i

            went    over ancl bought a               prograrnme and stood              in that area           for a few

            quite       clear    though and          I had a/t'ree passage along                    it.

                   the    fence       dividing        pens three and four.

                   It was       very       close     to kick      off     time as         the    players were well            into     their

                   I wouldn't          describe         it as a surge,            rather an           increase       in pressure           over

                   a short        amount      of time.           I was     forced down and to the                    right and was

                   almost       s t u mbling       until     I was       just   in front          of the      last    barrier

                   Section.           My    position kept           changing         as    there      seemed to be surges              of

                   I believe a barrier                 was      br o k e n near      to me      but at the time             I. was

                   unaware        of this.           As the      pressure       inc r e a s e d    people        star t e d s c r eaming

                   and    shouts       came     from      in front        of jp e f that        people were        dead.

                   I was     having         pr oblems      breaj^HiTng, being              crushed.         My    lef t hand was           u'p

                   and holding             onto a bj*/rier          leg,    the      other was         pinned to my side.

                   To my     right         sL^fabout         four metres away,                  I saw a boy age d about               13— 14

                   years.         He only       looked a small             lad but         he seemed         quite    high off        the

       /C C /      ground as          if he was         trai:         s^tTween two          people.         He had brown
              0/
                   c o l oured hair,          cut     in a b n ormal       short      style.          I can      remember     he had a

                   shoVt     sleeved         swearts h i r t on with a logo on the                      front.        1 h e s h 1 r t was a
4<o
         /A
          V        b rown m u s t a r d / c o l o u r .      I saw his face was a deep                       purple       colour     ______
      "\V
 %                 I saw him g e t           pushe d f o r w a r d and s u c k e d          down i . n t o t h e     crowd.

                   Above     me    people,         mainly       children,       were       being      thrown down and          passed

                   over.        All    of these         either      looked u n c o n s c i o u s       or dead.

                   At    this     time      I. was    by the      barrier and             to my    left     I could see a younq

                   lad    in his       teens w i t h rnousey coloured hai r .                         His   head was        pushed     up

                   against        the barrier almost                as    ;i.f he had tried            to get      under     the barrier
but     had been trapped.

People         were    pushed up agai n s t            him and      I could only see                  his    face and

neck.          His    face was    cove r e d wit h blood and                 I could see he was                 trying

to     push back        but his      head    kept       being      forced against             the barrier.

O ther       people were        trying      to    resist      being      pushed up against                   the barrier

but as the            crush    inc r e a s e d they were           pushed        up agai n s t        it.     I was

being        crushed and        felt     dizzy and sick and almost                        being       forced

d o w nw a r d s wit h    people       on my back.

Pe o p l e     a r o u n d me were     b e ginning        to sink      under        but    there was          nothing

yo u    could do to help.

I remember            seeing    people      climbing         the    front        perimeter        fence and at             one

time     I was        pushed sidew a y s         and    could see        people         being     pulled up into

the     se a t e d are a above.

The     pressure        then se e m e d     to slowly stop and there was more                                room.

I made my way out               in a daze and             into the       tunnel         where     I helped three

other        s u pporters      carry their mate              out    into the a rea of the                    turnstiles.

He a p p e a r e d     unconscious        and     once     in the      t u rnstile         area       received       First

I went         back    to a pre-ajfrf^Tnqed meeti ng                place        in L e p p i n g s    Ln but

couldn't         find my friends.                X then spent          the       next     hour wan d e r i n g a r o u n d

the are a        loooking       for my friends and e ach time                        I revisited the stand a

Police         cordon was       being     formed        so e v e n t u a l l y    I was      unable         to get    back

into     the     ground.

All     the time        bodies wer e        being       brought      out.

At     -1700 hours       I eventually            met    up w i t h my friends             at the p r e - a r r a n g e d

                rest of the Serial at Midland Sy4tion ,y§heff ie1d where our duties

                were to escort arriving Notts Forest/fans onto transport supplied by

                South Yorkshire Transport,           and from there escort them to the ground on

                the buses.       All the fans paid £1 for a return ticket.         After escorting

                a bus full of fans to the ground we were to return with the buses to

                the station, and then escort the next bus load to the ground.

^^,*.2// j      radios,   the Sperial and Inspj/^tor DEWS attended the Leppijcrtfs Lane gate.

                The Leppings Lane gate was designated for the arriv^J^and admission of

                Liverpool    fans.       On my a/rival at the gate there were perhaps fifty

                officers already in a^Cendance, but there only appeared to be two
  c_       .    --------------- — 7 ^ ------------                            —
  " ur^         turnstiles       in use. / 1 could see that on the other side of the

                turnstiles there were many people crushed up against the turnstiles

                 unable to get through, many of whom were in obvious signs of
               «7^
                ..distress. I then turned to the actual gate itself.  This is of a


       &        concertina type construction/and at this time it was             literally bulging

                and shaking with the bodi l^y pressure of the people outside pushing

                against   it .        I could hear screams and shouting on the other side of

i               the gate and as supporters came through the turnstiles they were upset

                saying,   "Its murder out there, they're getting killed".



           f As supporters             legally entered the ground via the turnstiles,    I could
                                                                                      PAGE    3
                                                                                      S3615

^ l / j ^ s e e many others climbing over the w«ycl into the ground.          I saw some
    ^N
‘        Police Officers move to stop thesjr illegally entering but due to the

         commotion and the obvious difficulties outside,            these were allowed

         1n .



         A steward moved to the gate and continued to hold the gate closed by
                                                            /
         what   looked like two calliper bars s i t u ^ e d at the top of the gates,

         A few seconds later a Police Inspectyl^told us all to             be prepared for

         the gates to be opened.         This he tykd to shout as the, noise was

         incredible.     I 1 inked arms witty other officers zVase to me and we

         formed a cordon perpendicular to the gate to p r e v e n t      supporters

         rushing   into the open western end of the Leppings Lane terrace, which

         was full and to channel        them down behinjy the Leppings L a ne t e rrace, to

         alleviate the p r e p a r e   outside the ga/e,



         The gates we/e opened and up to 1,000 supporters rushed in, many were

         in obvious/state of shock and distress,           some even being carried by

         others.    Many were abusive and smelt of intoxicants,         and   I heard one

         supporter say,    "Why weren't the gates opened sooner?"



         As they came in some supporters tried to show their tickets.              About

         2 minutes after the gate was opened I heard over my personal             radio for

         our Serial to go to the front of the Leppings Lane terrace.             Led by

         Sergeant KNIQWTS we, went onto the pitch via the stand close to the

         Leppings Lane gate.



         As I ran onto the pitch I could see people crushed up against the

         perimeter fence     in the terrace behind the goal mouth.         I could see

         several   police officers stood up against the fence motioning with

         their arms for the fans to move backwards.             There was also a 1ine of
                                                                                  PAGE    4
                                                                                  S361S

photographers     close to jL\fe f^nce t a k i n g pho tographs.       I could see a

line of hoardi ngs behi/nil he doal              ywould hi nder possible res cue

a t t e m p t s , so I began to[ remg^e the ^ c u r i t y    pins and take down the

ho ar di ng s.



After perhaps a minute I looked up and saw that the crush at the

fence was worse and some people looked to be in serious difficulties,

some unconscious.        I could see that the gate in Jme middle pen was

open but due ta the rush and pressure of people trying to get o u t , it

was impossible for PC'S to get in and h^lp X h e                injured.



As a result of this I ran to the gate to the first pen (western end of

the Leppings Lane Terrace) where there were less people so I could

gain entry and from there to the second pen and the injured.



At gate 2 Police Se/geant                GREEN had opened the gate in the f e n c e .

There was also a >wPC who               not know.     All three of us ,he 1 ped

people out of t/at pen to try and relieve pressure on those                  in section

3.    I did not know that there was a 6 foot high spiked railing

fence between the two pens which prevented a lateral movement of the

fa n s .



After perhaps a minute         I pushed my way into pen 2 and from there

fought my way to the right towards pen 3.                   Many people did not realise

that other supporters were in difficulties so they were reluctant to

move out of the way for me.           As I got closer to the third pen I

encountered hostility and abuse from the surrounding fans.                   I then

encountered the 6 foot spiked railings.                 I could not get across the

railings    immediately so I called on several men inside pen 3 to assist

the injured over the railings and although some did help most seemed
                                                                             PAGE     5
                                                                             S3615

      indifferent even saying "I'm alright here".



      I saw that police/officers were trying to pull down the fence with

      their bare hand's without success so at this point I climbed over the


v     spiked r/fri 1 j/ngs and saw a 'pile*

      one another with others
                                              of people all laid down   on top of

                                   crushed up against tly/'fence which was bulging

      outwards under the pressure.       There were aerhaps 50-60 people in this

      pile with some at different      levels of tne pile moaning and struggling

      to release themselves.       There were others who were cyanosed and

      unmovi n g .



     After climbing over the railings         I had to fight my way to the front of

      pen 3 towards the injured.       As I made my way to the front I was

    I' verbally abused by many of the fans around me and I was struck by

      several    coins which had been thrown      from the stand directly above the

      terrace.       Many of those who had extricated themselves from the pile

     were staggering about so I told other farfts who were stood nearby to

     assist them to the railings between tine pens or to the front fence

     where police officers were leaning / v e r      to assist them up and on to

      the pitch.



      With a burly supporter nearby we began to pull the people out of the

      pile.     Many of these were entangled with one another and so it was

      very difficult to separate them.



      As I dragged people out of the pile,        those who were cyanosed I tried

      to give mouth to mouth or nose and heart massage to those whose pulse

      I couldn't feel.       I didn't have much success.



      I decided that those      I pulled out and not shoeing signs of life would

              receive 6 quick breaths, 6 pumps at heart massage and then be passed

              on to officers and fans at the railings who would then pass the

              casualties to the pitch for proper attention.            At this point I saw

              that several PC'S were attempting to pull down the fencing with their

              bare hands without success.



     &        As I was attempting heart massage one man with a ginger beard and

              the impact,



              As the pile decreased,      Police Off i/f& r s were able to enter section 3

              via its own gate and take the ip^ured and dying out onto the pitch.                  I

              saw a body with a jumper on iJCs face,        I removed it and told the

              supporters to pass      it on to tl



              I assisted a severely shocked man who I now know to be|Dayid GOLDING,

              brought, out from the pitch and placed nej/X to us on the ground.             He

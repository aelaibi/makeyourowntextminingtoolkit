Dear
                                          Sheffield Wednesday Inquiry
                Prior to our interesting talk last Friday afternoon,
Inspector Sawyer had passed to nie a list of questions
which you wished to discuss.                                                 I think, that either directly
or indirectly we dealt with all of them, but included was
a request that we supply you with a copy of the test results
carried out on barriers on the morning of Sunday, 16 April 1989,
and on gate No. 3 on 15 May, 1989.
                I have pleasure in enclosing these results.


                                                                           Yours sincerely,

          Load Test on Gate No. 3 in the Perimeter Fence/
               at Leppings Lane End/ on 15 May 1989




Width of gate * 850mm.   Test load * 6 kN/m.


Applied load * 0.51 Tonnes.


The load was applied at two points on the horizontal mid-rail.


There was no sign of distress or excessive deflection of any of the
gate members/ supporting frames or hinges during the gradual load
application.


When full load was reached it was found that the quick-release
device on the pitch side of the fence could be operated easily
using an outstretched hand.


The load was applied a second time but increased to 0.56 Tonnes.
The quick-release device again operated easily using one hand.

          Load Tests on Three Barriers at the Leppings Lane End/
                                   on 16 April 1989




    Test Nos. 1 & 2


         Barrier No. 136 in pen No. 1 (an original six span barrier).
         Spans tested 4 and 5 and then 5 and 6.
         Three spans, each 2.4m between supports.
         Test load *     6 kN/m      Applied load * 1.44 Tonnes
         Result.     100% recovery after each of the second and third
         applications of load, see record sheet.


    Test No. 3


         Barrier No. 137 in pen No. 3 (an original two span barrier).


         Initial deformation of horizontal tube was measured as being
         39mm.     Two spans, each 2.3m between supports.
         Test load = 6kN/m         Applied load « 1.38 Tonnes
         First two load applications both up to 1.38 Tonnes resulted in
         100% recovery after release of load.
         A third load application was then made up to 1.75 Tonnes
         (equivalent to 7.6 kN/m).        There was bending of the horizontal
         tube and some rotation of the end supporting frame.           The load
         was released and a permanent horizontal movement of 11mm was
         measured at the centre of the tube in span No. 1.         Load was
         then applied again and at 1.6 Tonnes the back leg of the
         centre supporting frame sheared across the bolts.         A
         horizontal movement of 25mm was measured in the tube after the
         release of the load.
Test No. 4


     Barrier No. 128 in pen No. 3 (an original three span barrier).
     Spans 1 and 2 tested.     Initial deformation of horizontal tube
    was measured as being 55mm.      Two spans, each 2.32m between
     supports.
    Test load * 6 kN/m       Applied Load * 1.40 Tonnes
     First load application, up to 1.4 Tonnes resulted in a 75%
     recovery after release of load.
     Second load application, again up to 1.4 Tonnes resulted in a
     100% recovery after release of the load.
     A third load application, up to 1.75 Tonnes    (equivalent to
     7.6 kN/m) was made.     At that load a horizontal movement of
     27mm was measured in the tube.     The load was gradually
     increased up to 2.1 Tonnes (equivalent to 9.2 kN/m) when the
     travel on the hydraulic jacks reached its maximum and no
     further load could be applied.     At that stage, the horizontal
    movement of the rail was measured as being 40mm. There was a
     permanent horizontal movement of 13mm measured in the rail
     after the release of all load.

Dear
                                                         Hillsborough Terraces
     Further to our meeting of April 28th please find enclosed information regarding
barriers and crowd safety
       1. Crush barrier strengths and spacings, Home Office, March 1973.
       2. Protective Crowd Barriers, L.R. Creasy, Ministry of Works, 1948.
     These are both referred to in the draft document 'Appraisal of Sportsgrounds'
currently being considered by the Institution of Structural Engineers.
     The above papers describe relatively comprehensively the development of barrier
philosophy as contained in the Guide to Safety at Sportsgrounds 1986, and
BS6180:1982, Protective barriers in and about buildings.
     Further to our discussion you provided me with information concerning the
terrace below the West Stand. This information was extracted from two drawings
          1.    Ground capacity and barrier spacing as drawn for W. Eastwood.
          2.    Dimension details obtained after the disaster.
     The latter drawing recognised certain deficiencies and lack of compliance with
the Guide to Safety at Sportsgrounds and BS6180.
A.        Drawing 1 gives the crowd capacity in the central pen as 2200 persons whereas
          Drawing 2 indicates 2060 persons.
          Based on a simple area calculation my own figure is 2037 persons. However
          the barrier spacing does not conform and the calculation must be performed as
          in paragraph 226 of the Safety Guide. This reduces the capacity to 1939
          persons.   I have allowed for the barrier that you verbally informed me was
          missing from Drawing 2.   If as correctly implied on Drawing 2 appropriate
          reduction is made for gangway requirements (paragraph 223) then this figure
          must certainly be further reduced. The figure given on Drawing 1 is
          certainly 20% too high.
 B.          The perimeter gate widths depart significantly from the recommendations of
             the Guide to Safety. This is noted on Drawing 2.
                                                                                                                    cont....

C.        The barrier patterns and spacing do not conform to the Guide to Safety
          creating undesirably high pressures.
          We discussed modelling the crowd pressures and subsequently discussed the
          matter again. You had in our earlier discussion quoted measured barrier
          heights lower than the Guide to Safety requirement which gives a preferred
          height of 1.1m.   If the barrier height is insufficient, and the figure you
          quoted was correct, then the crowd pressures simply leapfrog the barrier with
          very serious consequences.
          You agreed to confirm the barrier height; this is an overiding factor in
          modelling the crowd pressures.
          My own research on barriers has examined sustainable pushes that individuals
          can generate over a considerable period of time (as opposed to impulsive
          pressures). These are considerably higher than given in Document 1 and
          would pertain to the situation at Hillsborough.
         I still find it difficult to understand these departures from the Guide to
    Safety and the British Standard. My experience with local authorities in this area
    has been quite contrary to what has been permitted here. The problem of diffusing
    the crowd pressure has quite simply not been understood or even possibly
    addressed.   Had the Guide to Safety at Sportsgrounds and BS6180 been complied with
    the deaths on the terracing would have been substantially reduced.   I will be in
    touch with you later this week.
                                     Yours sincerely,




                                     Dr. J.F. Dickie
ENQUIRY INTO THE DISASTER AT SHEFFIELD WEDNESDAY FOOTBALL CLUB, HILLSBOROUGH

1   Following our   meeting with Professor Eastwood on 24 April, I felt it would be
    beneficial to   set down what I know about the situation at Hillsborough.  In
    addition, and   more importantly, describing what questions remain outstanding
    and how these   might be resolved.

General

2   It appears for a long time it has been common knowledge there were unsatis­
    factory crowd flow patterns at the Leppings Lane end, with uncomfortable crush­
    ing amongst the crowds.  Brian Hibbs has told me that he stopped using this
    end of the ground years ago partly because of this. Professor Eastwood's
    remarks about remodelling of the turnstiles, proposals that date back to the
    1980s, although attributed to improved use of the area and hence based on
    improving stand utilage, might also point to the same common knowledge. The
    reluctance of the ground's steward to open the main gate at police request
    might also have been because the steward knew that the area was unsafe for
    such a large influx of people.

              Information required

              Any correspondence between Professor Eastwood, the club, and the
              working party on crowd control flow patterns at Leppings Lane end?
              A statement from the steward on his views on any crushing problems.

3   It appears that the layout of the ground around the turnstile area directed
    the major part of the crowd flow towards the tunnel. While this would be
    beneficial in encouraging the rapid and smooth departure of persons from the
    ground, it was not the case when a rapid and concentrated flow of persons
    made their way on to the terraces.

4   It is curious that better signing and the construction of some small crowd
    deflection barriers or walls had not been attempted to control the ingress of
    crowds or that the recent remodelling between the turnstiles and the stands
    had not been done to an overall plan to facilitate improved crowd flow.

              Again is there anything in the correspondence?
              What happens at other grounds? are they similarly equipped to deal
              with crowd flow patterns?

5   I imagine the sort of plan layouts which ought to be developed in these areas
    should bear some similarity to those which deal with the ebbing and flowing
    of water.  In other words basic hydraulic knowledge might have been able to
    suggest "correct" plan layouts.  During the period since 1972 there would have
    been ample opportunity to gradually adopt suitable plan shapes if the club was
    aware and suitably motivated to undertake this work.

              Is this in fact true? We would need to talk to an hydraulic
              engineer. What did Professor Eastwood consider to be his main
              duties and priorities?

6   With the remodelling plans for the ground mentioned by Professor Eastwood,
    would crowd flow be improved? Which scheme would make the biggest difference?
    and what was the relative cost of the two schemes? Presumably quotes must
    have been obtained, or if guess estimates were used, were these realistic?

                   7   The Professor's comments about crowd densities at the Kop end, immediate post
                       war were very interesting. The present recommended limit of 5.4 persons/m2
                       represents an uncomfortable density.      Try getting 5 persons to stand in a space
                       1 m x 0.903 m. Of course in a larger area such crowding is not quite so
                       noticeable, i.e. movement can still take place, but in addition there would be
                       variations in crowd density fee—dte-a-l-with.       w -
                                                                             w U,        tec.

                   8   Professor Eastwood was however suggesting that 8.5 persons approx/m2 had used
                       the Kop end while still leaving the more unpopular areas empty. This seems to
                       indicate a major alteration in crowd behaviour and tolerance. As this alter­
                       ation would not occur instantly, but be a gradual evolutionary change, then
                       presumably this is still continuing. Therefore the figure of 5.4 fixed in the
                       early 70s may no longer be appropriate.               _            ,
                                                                            s.—o <-'■£*-'   -
                   9   In addition the "working parties" view of the ground may have become too com­
                       placent, reflecting what was acceptable in the late 60s/early 70s rather than
                       now.

                                 I do n 11 know how to check this out but might have a better idea after
                                 speaking to Mr Stickley.

               10      The gates from the pitch into the    central pens seem very narrow. The Green
                        Guide describes exits as being in   .55 m units.  Therefore from the left hand
 ""(W-i v-%            central pen there would be 3 exit    units into the tunnel and one exit unit on
       ^               to the pitch. At the recommended     flow rate of 60 per sons/minute, the shortest
                        evacuation time for 1,012 persons   (my figures, see below) is just under
cJr&c,         .        5.7 minutes .

               11      The pen to the right hand side had an extra two exit units. Therefore for
                       1,048 persons (again my figures) the evacuationtime would be around 1\ minutes.

                                 What was the fire service's thoughts about this?
                                 Did it allow sufficiently rapid evacuation of the area?

               12      The pen sizes appear to be approximately 14.3 m and 14.43 m by 13.13 m giving
                       plan areas of 187 m2 and 194 m2 respectively.  Allowing 54 persons per 10 m 2
 iIetZ -<c/°           as in the Green Guide and as discussed with Professor Eastwood, this would give
   -                   the maximum numbers as 1,012 and 1,048 persons. The drawings which I have seen
                       so far show 2,200 persons for both pens.

               13      From the Green Guide (para 96) it states spectators should be within 12 m of
                       either the exits or exit gangways, with the pens 14.3 m wide or more this was
                       impossible.  This suggests gangways should have been provided down the terraces
                       from the tunnel entrance, further reducing the standing area and the maximum
                       permitted numbers who should use them.

               14      The recommended Green Guide figure of 54 persons/10 m 2 is only to be used where
                       the terracing is in the best condition.  The existence of non-standard crush
                       barriers (see later) indicates that a figure of less than 54 would have been
                       appropriate.

                                 How were these densities calculated? what was the working parties
                                 views on gangways?   (The survey might show a reason). Mr Stickley
                                 might be able to comment on how the quality of the ground affects
                                 the 54 person density, what happens at other grounds?

                                                               2
15   If gangways had been adopted then these are easier to keep clear if they are
     sunk below the level of the surrounding terraces. It could be claimed that
     to do this would cost the club unaffordable expense.  However work was done
     on the terraces when the security fences were installed and the additional
     cost of forming the sunken gangways might have been quite reasonable at that
     time.

              What would have been the extra cost of doing this work? If this work
              had been carried out it would have also required the cutting of a
              gateway on to the pitch from the bottom of the gangway.

16   The plan layout of the area where the tunnel emerges on to the terracing shows
     two short wing walls.  This coupled with some signs that barriers onee had
     existed in front of the tunnel, indicates the original flow pattern was for
     people to exit by gathering at the back of the terrace and perculating into
     the tunnel. Depending on the gap between the wing wall and the barriers,
     ingress would have been quite reasonable, encouraging the total width of the
     terraces to be used, rather than concentrating the flow, too quickly into one
     area. The alterations to this area (see later) have almost forced the crowd
     directly down the terracing, instead of encouraging it to gradually back up
     and flow along behind the crush barriers.

              When were these wing walls built? Were they to a deliberate plan
              to disperse the crowd as suggested?

17   The tunnel slopes down for the most part at about 10° towards the terracing.
     This would be a "good thing" when crowds are leaving the terraces, but very
     bad when they were entering en masse.  The effects of the sloping tunnel and
     the terrace layout in front of it must have been responsible for some of the
     high pressures within the crowd as experienced on the terracing, it would have
     been similar to a pump ramming up the pressures in an already solidly jammed
     constricted space.

18   It should be noted that this compressing effect could only occur when the
     crowd density in the tunnel was very high for all or nearly all of its length.
     Where persons were restricted by the turnstiles (the best flow figure for
     these is around 750 persons per hour, i.e. less than 90 persons/minute through
     the 7 turnstiles and the investigations of others is likely to show the best
     possible rate was less than this), the flow up the tunnel would be low enough
     to allow persons to turn round and come out again to find alternative standing
     areas.  It is probable it would be so low as to add little to the crowd
     pressures on the turnstiles.

              Just how much increase was there in crowd pressure due to the
              tunnel layout?

Crush barriers

19   The barriers were generally lower than the recommendations in the Guide and
     had a 60 mm diameter top rail. The Green Guide (para 111) is very ambiguous
     on this simply stating that 50 mm diameter rails are in use at many sports
     grounds, although research shows that 100 mm vertical flat would be an advan­
     tage.  It therefore appears to make no recommendations at all. It is much
     more positive about heights however (para 110) recommending 1.02 to 1.12 m
     above the back step,while many both at the Leppings Lane and Kop end are
     around 850 mm high.  Professor Eastwood told us these were installed before
     1978.
•
    20   Tests ace carried out to the Green Guide (perhaps the only thing that strictly
         follows the Green Guide, perhaps suggesting something about the attitude of
         those concerned) and perform adequately for a class A barrier. However the
         gaps between the various barriers are frequently too wide and allow columns
         of persons to develop at steeper angles than the recommended 60°.
         Professor Eastwood acknowledged this saying it would have been too costly to
         correct the fault, although in 1978 they had installed other barriers, which
         are of the recommended height and have a 100 mm diameter top rail, to cover
         the more glaring gaps in the layout.  (He estimated 40% of the rails were of
         his new design).

    21   I have   spoken to Doctor Dickie about the crush barriers and he was most con­
         cerned about the.. cEush’^bafeiere-. He pointed out that it was vital fe-ha-t the
         distance between barriers was not exceeded, therefore restricting the maximum
         pressure that could come on to both the barrier and the front line of people.
         He was   even more concerned about the barrier height. The nominal height of
         the old barriers is about hip height and this means that the body flexs
         naturally over the barrier.     In a very densely packed area this would allow
         the thrust from the crowd at the back of the terraces to be passed to the front
         almost as if the barriers were not there.

                  I query both the claim of an excessive cost of correcting the
                  excessive gaps in the existing barriers in a time scale of 10 years
                  and the percentage of old to new barriers.
                  The position of the 3 damaged barriers 124A, 137 and 128 in their
                  relationship to the tunnel entrance suggests that pressures were
                  along lines at much smaller angles than 60°.
                  Your test to load the barriers to permanent deflection might throw
                  more light on this.
                  Brian Stickley may know more about why the barrier height of 1.1 m
                  was chosen, i.e. if it was because of this flexing problem outlined
                  by Jim Dickie.  In any case we should try to find out at what
                  density this overriding of the barrier starts to occur.

    22   Thetesting required for the barriers and their annual visual checking seems
         very good, i.e. in accordance with the Green Guide, which is puzzling why
         other aspects had not been so enthusiastically attended to.

                  After further study of the test reports, etc., I may have further
                  comments on this.

    23   According to Professor Eastwood, in 1985 the police requested security fences
         to be installed. When this work was being done some barriers were removed.
         We have seen the marks where the frames were once positioned. In other cases
         the barriers were run through the security fence or welded to it. Therefore
         there seems to be no need to remove the top row of barriers to make room for
         the fences.

    24   The Green Guide recommends (para 113) that the barriers should preferably run
         the full length of the terraces except where there wear radial gangways (as
         described before). Of the three runs in eacj^gf^the central pens onl^,on^ ^ ^
         meets that recommendation.  The others hav<t£22, 25, 28, 4 0 'and 53%^faps in
         them. Had they all met the Green Guide's recommendations then, depending on
         Jim Dickie's body flow flexing theory, many of the injuries on the terraces
         may have been avoided, if not most.  However had'", the terraces been fully to
         the Green Guide it is very likely the number of injuries in the tunnel would
         have noticeably increased.

                      We know the pressures (from Professor Eastwood) which caused barriers
                      137 and 128 to deflect. We can probably calculate those which
                      caused 124A to fail. By testing we will be able to discover what
                      other barriers can stand and therefore know that the crowd pressure
                      did not reach t h e s ^ ^ T h i s may show that the maximum pressures were
                      at the front of the terraces and lend credance to Jim Dickie's theory.
                      This could well form a good check on a model of the situation caused
                      by the crowd pressures,(a hydraulic one perhaps being the best idea).
                      Such a model may then enable the layout of any crowd flow areas to
                      be properly designed.
                      Work has been done on modelling crowd flows using table tennis balls.
                      I still prefer the hydraulic modelling (perhaps on computer) as being
                      the more realistic method.         I am checking this out with Dr Dickie.
                      Professor Eastwood did suggest if I remember correctly that the
                      police had some barriers removed. We can check this against police
                      files presumably.

             NOTE: The modelling would not be the same, as far as I understand it, as the
                   pedestrian flow pattern the Institute of Structural Engineers wishes to
                   investigate.  This, I think, is to see how you can encourage people to
                   go in any one particular direction.

        Medical

        25   We need to have a plan showing where people died or were injured so that we
             can judge both what were the effects of the pressures noted above, and how
             the two types of barriers performed.  No doubt the police are addressing
             this problem. Watching the videos may give a clue to numbers of persons
             involved and the crowd build up (second by second?).  I don't think this is
             my job although I would welcome a view of the videos to get an idea of crowd
             density and area.

        26   We also need to know the type of pressures the body can stand or rather what
             pressures cause specific types of damage. This could be linked to the police
             investigation and tied back to our (hydraulic) work. You now have the name
             of Dr Frankland.  I imagine medical research on divers would also be
             appropriate.

        The Green Guide

        27   The philosophy of the Green Guide is to control crowds, encouraging the
                                                         -f& f / W v o v jr r *            .
             pressures they create to disperse rather than^build up (para 16). Siting of
             barriers, gangways, exits, etc., all are built around this concept.         In detail
             it does leave a lot to the imagination and focuses much attention to egress
             rather than ingress (20 paras as against       . ^Jus tjLf iab^y so, as egress is
             still the most likely cause of injury alspate at^illsborough.          Much of the dis­
             cussion is vague, deliberately so, I believe, and fails to provide sufficient
             detail on some points such as recommending a maximum length of any direct
             access ways. I am sure that had the gates not been in line with the tunnel
             and this had not led straight into the terraces, then most of the injuries
             would not have occurred. However there is no doubt in my mind that in normal
             circumstances a straight exit route is the safest. With its^egress and the
             philosophy of continual dispersal of crowd pressure, persQns following the
             guide fydould plan for funnel shaped exit routes. These wetktel-concentrate
             pressures from incoming crowds.    I think its a point which needs more attention
             and study.

            28   The Guide's recommendations for the strength of barriers are satisfactory.
                 They are so strong that persons will be seriously injured on them when
                 involved in a crush and there seems little point in insisting they should be
                 stronger.

            29   It might be worthwhile to research a design for a barrier which would gently
                 fail at lower pressures, preventing serious injury and helping to relieve
                 crowd pressure.

            30   It appears that the following concepts used in the Guide need verifying.
                                                                  ffirt '&•*--

For the attention of Mr. G. Mackrell

Dear Mr. Mackrell,
                     Safety at Sports Grounds Act 1975
                           Barrier Testing 1988
     Over the four days 14,15,18 and 19 July 1988, the fourth
part of our five yearly cycle of barrier testing was carried out.
The barriers tested were numbers 121 to 124, 124A, 125 to 128,
128A, 129 to 136, 136A, 137 to 153 and 187 all of which are on
the lower area of terrace at the Leppings Lane end of the ground.
The location of the barriers tested is shown on our drawing
1610/64E, a print of which is enclosed.
     The load testing was carried out in accordance with the
procedure set out in Appendix C of the 'Guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds'.
     In all but one case the barriers tested, successfully
withstood the applied load. A clip over the rail of barrier 124
broke before reaching the full test load.
     Visual inspection of all the barriers on the ground revealed
that some of the ends of the rails are corroded although those
tested on the Spion Kop last year and also those t rcted on the
Leppings Lane terrace this year all safely supported the test
load.
     The rail on barrier 133 is badly corroded and should be
replaced now. There was also a lot of movement of the rail on
barrier 144, when tested, and we also recommend that that rail
is also replaced.
     As agreed we have arranged for the clip on barrier 124 to
be replaced together with rails on barriers 133 and 144, before
the start of the coning season.

          DESCRIPTION:                           One hydraulic pump complete with two hydraulic cylinders.
                                                 The force on the cylinders, under an applied force is
                                                 measured by a pressure gauge mounted on the pump.


          IDENTIFICATION:                        Pump: D948005
                                                 Gauge: BGF 168 SR
                                                 Cylinder 1: 04773                  Model RC 53AF9N
                                                 Clyinder 2: 04772                  Model RC 530J8N


          METHOD

          The calibration was carried out in a Grade 0.5 lever arm testing machine                                                   in
          terms of the Technical unit of force the ton force (tonf). The uncertainty                                                 of
          the forces applied during the calibration is +0.5$.

          Three tests were made on each cylinder.

          Tests were made to determine the reading indicated on the gauge at fixed loads.

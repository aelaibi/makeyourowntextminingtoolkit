    NOTE OF A MEETING HELD ON 8


    POLICE FEDERATION


                Home Secretary           Mr Alan Eastwood
                Lord Ferrers             Ms V Neild
                Mr Addison               Mr Michael Shersby MP
                Mr Yeates
                Mr Haslam
                Mr Storr


          The meeting had been arranged to enable the Police Federation
    representatives to raise with the Home Secretary a number of issues of
    concern.

    2.    in   welcoming   the   opportunity    of   meeting    Police  Federation
    representatives, the Home Secretary said that he wished to continue his
    predecessor's policy of regular discussions with the Federation. He would take
    every suitable opportunity to emphasise the need for the public to support the
    police.

    RENT ALLOWANCE

    3.    Both Mr Eastwood and Ms Neild referred to the reaction within the police
    service to Mr Hurd's series of meetings with Professor Hunter, the Official
    Side and the Staff Side on rent allowance.     The Federation leadership was
    coming under great pressure to mount a campaign against the action which the
    Government seemed likely to take. The timing of the former Home Secretary's
    interruption of the negotiating process could not have been worse as
    negotiations were at an extremely sensitive stage. If the Government had felt
    so strongly that this action was necessary, why had it not been possible to
    say so at the time of the award or, better still, wait until the negotiating
    process was complete? Mr Eastwood wished to know whether this indicated an
    intention on the part of the Government to change the whole basis of the
    police negotiating machinery.

    4.    The Home Secretary said that he could go no further than to restate the
    Government's position as set out in '   Mr Hurd's letter to Professor Hunter.
    He would, however, consider carefully any recommendations which the Police
    Negotiating Board put to him before he reached a final decision. But he was
    happy to repeat his predecessor's view that serving officers should not
    receive less under any new arrangements than they would be receiving on 31
    March 1990 and reiterated the assurance that the Government had no plans to
    change the Edmund-Davies arrangements for police pay. He appreciated that the
    FederatiOT* b ^ h T l n ^ u ^ o f "                           d l f t i c u l t i « to the
    serious reservations until the end of lh«                 about the Government's
    that those involved in negotiations .< k».   i,           Process would have meant
    false assumption.    tte Z e t ^ ? \ /     "*U haVe       teen er°“ « “ ng under a

          The Police Federation representatives also raised the following points

             (i) Mr Eastwood welcomed the Home Secretary's reported
                 Views on capital punishment. He accept^ t h e ^ c l
                  wL        T   HT e Secretary's statement that nobody
                  the death    ^             °fficer since abolition of
                  the death penalty in 1965 had ever been released from
                  prison. But in his view this was not a deterrent;

           (U)      ^hf.H°me Secretary „as urged to look again at the
                  a°*eed T * Evidence Act 1984. Mr Eastwood
                  agreed to write in specifying which parts of it
                  needed amending in the Police Federation's view;

          (iii)    Mr Eastwood mentioned   that considerable police
                  resources could be saved if court business could be
                  arranged to cut down the number of unnecessary

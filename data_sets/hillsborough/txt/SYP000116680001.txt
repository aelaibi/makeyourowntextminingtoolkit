              1 am the Mounted               Inspector       in charge of the Force Mounted Section.             1

              am answerab 1e to the Supe r i n t e t d e n t , 0 pe ra.t- ions Di v is io n , but the day

              to day running of the branch is my direct                            responsibility.



              I regularly attend all -Poutball matches                          in this County and 1 have

              policed at         '’Hillsboro'’ on many o c c a s i o n s .          I was on duty for the

              previous two semi-finals at                      *Hi1 lsboro *.



             Mounted Section whilst, playing an important                            part of the overall

              operation are only one                  ’cog*        in the wheel.     The deployment of horse

              at the ground for this year's semi-final was more or less a carbon

             Our 'section of 18 horses                   is considered too small to cope with the

              size of the operation.                   As in previous years           'Mutual Aid* was sought

from     foreign            forces.                 X    chose       to       bring        in    extra       horses          from       both

Merseyside             and          N o t t i n g h a m s h i re         to    supplement              our       strength.              The

overall          number             of    horses             deployed          was       33.         That    is       six    at     the      Midland

Railway          Station              and      29       at    the    ground          itself.               1 was       not    party          to       the

decision          as       to       the       total          number       of       horses        to    be    deployed.                 I was

responsible,                once          the       total        number            was    decided           u p o n , for         their

deployment             around             the       ground.




Prior       to    the       day          of    the       match       I    received              my    own    copy       of    Operational

Order       F 1/89.             I     noted         the       recommended                deployments              around          the     ground,

but    1 modified                   this       according             to       my    own     experience                and    knowledge                of

likely        trouble               spots.              My    Sergeant             Sorstoy       was       consulted          for       his       views

and    together'            we        agreed            upon our         deployment..                 He    attended              the     p l a r m i ng

meeting          on    HE       March           1 9 8 9 at     Hammerton                 Road.        I was       unable          to    attend.




Broadly          speaking                my    deployment                was       based        upon       the    safe       escort          of       fans

both     to      and       from          the     ground         and       assisting              their       safe       entry/enit.                    We

also     keep         an    eye          on    any       public          order       situation              which       might,         develop

and    deal       with          it,       if     it      does.




X    used     our      Merseyside                   horses          at    the       Leppings           Lane       end. of         the     ground

Initially             10    horses             were          deployed          on    Penistone              Road      under        the       command

quite       good       humoured,               but       seemingly                 oblivious               to       the       over-crowding

that       was       occurring.                At       this       time       I was           working               with       Police

Constables             1696        and       1300        from       Merseyside.                       All       3    of       us    worked          fo r      a

long       time       to     stop        fans       pushing             and        jamming            up    against                the       person        in

front       of       them.         It       was     already             causing              problems               at    the       front          of    t he

turnstiles             and        we     knew       a    serious             situation                was       developing.                       I shouted

continuously                 at    fans        to       'stop       pushing"                as     did      the          other          officers.                 We

ignored          us    and        kept        increasing                in    volumes.                Things             eventually                became

so    overcrowded                 that       my     horse          ’H u s s a r '          who     is       seventeen               and       a    half

hands       high       and        weighs           well       over       half          a     ton      was       surrounded                   by    fans       who

were       wrapped           around          his        whole       body           like        sellophane                 or       cling          fil m.      The

horse       could          not     move        a    leg       or    a    muscle.                 He     began            to    lose          his    footing

as    he    was       lifted           by     the       crowd.




I was       somehow            pushed          to       the    left          and       my      left         leg      was       trapped             against

I knew          the        horse        was       far     from       happy.                 If     he   was         kicked?              reared          or

even       moved       a     leg       I was        extremely                worried              that       the         safety          of       the    crowd

I   could         see    that       Police         Constables                1696       and     1300      had      followed                my

example           and    we       were    joined         by    Police          Constable             £316        Scott.               We    then

shut       the     blue       wrought          iron      gates          at    the       Leppings          Lane         end      with        the

assistance              of    a    foot      officer.              These       gates          lead     into        the       turnstile

pens.        This        was       attempted          to      alleviate             crushing           on    the        turnstiles

which       by     now       was    getting         quite          nasty.           We       managed        to     hold         the        gates

for    a    couple           of    minutes         but     the       crowd         in    a    determined               mood       -    forced

them       open.




Realising           the       ho pi e s s n e s s     of      the       situation,              I formed           a    line          of    horses

across       the        Leppings          Lane      access          area       -- o u t s i d e      of     the        blue       wrought

quite       effective              barrier         sideways             onto       the       crowd     who       were        still

pouring           along       Leppings          Lane       towards            the       ground.

Constables              3186       and    156      were       near       to    me       and. w e     field       the       line.            i

could       see     the       tact i c working                to    some       reasonable              effect.               On       my    right

towards          the     turnstiles             the      crowd          began       to       thin    slightly              at     the

turnstiles.                  On    my    left      looking           into      Leppings             Lane,        I saw          that        we

had    contained              around         500    or     so ' l a t e c o m e r s .          They       were         obviously

distressed              and       frustrated          at      not       being       able       to    get     to        the      turnstiles,

but    we    had        them       contained,,

continuously,                     but    he    was    ignored             by       the       crowd.              They          pressed       heavily

on    our      line          of    horses       and       broke          through             and     ran         to       join       the    rear        of

the    pushing/shoving                        crowd       at    the       turnstiles.




At    this      time          a    supporter          reported                to       me    that       a woman                was    injured           at

the    turnstile                  near    the       gate       by    the          Sweet       Shop.          (Gate            D ).     I could           not

see    the      woman             and    there       was       no    way          of       getting          to    her          with    a    horse.

It    was      at    this          time       that    the       order             was       given       to       open          the    gates.            It

was    no      doubt          given       to    save       loss          of       life       at    the       turnstiles                and    was        in

my    opinion            -    quite        correct.




Fans     rushed              through          the    gate       on       my       left       (Gate          D>    in          large    numbers.

This     passageway                 leads       I think             to    the          North       Stand.                 The       opening        of    the

gates       had      eased          and       released          the       problem             almost             immediately,

On    the    day       in     question         my      d a y ’s    duty        began         at   0700,             I completed                duty

at    2000       that        evening.

responsibility                 of    the       two     Superintendents                    in      charge        - Super intendent

all    officers              deployed.              Their       exact        location,             collar           number          and       force




My    general          perceptions              of     the      day      were      that        large       numbers             of

Liverpool             fans      came      late       to     the     ground.             Many      were      intoxicated                   but

not    necessarily                 drunk.           Too     many      were        in    that       state        ~    prohibiting

act ion      by       individual           of f i ce r s .




The    crowd          at     the    turnstile             were      initially             good       humoured,,            but       quickly

became       aggressive              as    the       turnstiJ.es             were       unable        to    cope          with       the

influx.           The        crowd       would       not       listen        to    advice          given        and       had       no

concern          as    they        pushed       forwards.,            for      the      safety/comfort                    of    the

I    could       not       understand           at     the      time      of      the     crushing          at       the       turnstiles

why    people          were        not    passing           through.              The     crowd       hardly          seemed             to

                   outside    all   my   previous   experience,.        I have    never   seen   a   crowd,

                   assemble    so   late   and   in such   1a r g e   numb ers.

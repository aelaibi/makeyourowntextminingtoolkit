INSPECTION AND TESTING OF

CRUSH BARRIERS AND HAND RAILS




(1)      INSPECTION

1-0      An important part of the inspection is to determine the

          physical condition of all                barriers.           Correct spacing,

          height      and     layout       together     with adequate structural

          condition         are   all      essential      if     the     barrier       is to

          function so as to prevent injury.



2.0      In    order     that      comparison       can    be made with previous

          annual inspections,            a full     record of          the observations

          on   each     barrier         should     be   logged by the inspecting

          engineer on a Standard              Record      Sheet        (Ref    5     Ch 6.3)

          giving       location      and      date of inspection together with

          all comments on condition.



3.0      Any     visible          defect       (corrosion,            cracks,         holes,

          misalignment,           missing      bolts)     shall        be noted and its

          potential      reduction in         strength         gauged     in       order   to

          determine      whether        the      condition       of     the     barrier is

          satisfactory.           All signs       of potential          weakness should

          be looked for, such as potential for instability.



4.0      Members       and    connections         which the engineer considers

          may contain defects (hidden corrosion) will                              need to be

          exposed.       In particular,           inspection should             be made of
all areas where     water      traps   or     hidden    detail where

corrosion or damage could facilitate corrosion.



When the inspection establishes the presence of obvious

and significantly      deteriorated         material,    the barrier

shall be   deemed to     be defective and replaced.           Should

the inspection reveal any component whose               condition is

deleterious   giving     any     doubt as to performance,       then

that barrier should be proved to have adequate strength

by proof testing, or declared defective and replaced.
TESTING

(a)            The Proof Test

For     barriers        the    proof     test     is    to      consist of the

application        of     a    loading       which     is       as    nearly     as

practical equivalent             on all components of the barriers

to the evenly distributed                force required              to test that

category of        barrier       (see Table      ... Chapter ...).             As a

general principle,            the barriers        shall be           proof tested

for up     to a load of 1.25 x the Required Design Service

Loading (Ref 2 Ch 3.8.3).



The purpose of site tests is to assess                       the adequacy of

the barrier        for service,        and to observe and record the

behaviour and deflections of the barrier, handrails and

posts under test.



It is important therefore to both record the results of

the     test    and      to    look    for      any     signs        of weakness,

particularly at           the base       of the        barrier posts, or at

structural joints, during the test.



The test will be              carried out       by applying           a series of

part loads        to the        tops of the barrier rail               (posts and

intermediately along the span                   of the       rails)     so   as to

model     the     live        load    performance        expected from that

barrier.        The magnitude of load             applied will therefore

vary from        barrier to barrier, and within an individual
barrier, depending on location,                            span,   height          (and of

course, barrier type).



(b)            Test Arrangement

The     load     shall       be      applied          by     jacking        against the

terrace behind the barrier,                     ensuring the test equipment

is horizontal as far as possible generally as diagram.



The instrumentation                 shall be designed so as to be able

to measure up to approximately twice the design service

load     of     the       barrier        and     to        record accurately each

individual load increment required during the test.



Deflections in two directions at right                             angles shall be

measured         immediately              adjacent            to      the     point     of

application of the loads                   on the           handrails and          at the

top     of     all    posts,         using       a     graduated        steel       rule,

incorporating a Vernier gauge capable of                               recording the

nearest        0.5    mm.           The deflection measuring equipment

shall be properly fixed to a rigid part of the terrace.



The arrangement              (), the        load      (kN)     and the deflection

(nun)    shall        be    recorded            by the testing authority for

each barrier              location        and     load       increment        so     as to

assess        linearity        of        performance of the barrier under

load.        Each barrier           to     be     tested       shall        be numbered

according            to      the         barrier           schedule         and      shown
diagrammatically on the Test Record,                  so       as to indicate

the length     of the     barrier and         whether the barrier is

single or multiple.



(c)    The Bedding-in Cycle

As an initial cycle, and to allow for bedding-in of the

test     equipment,       the     release            of        any     frictional

restraints,    the barrier is       to be           loaded up           to 75% of

its design     service load;        the bedding-in load shall be

applied in     at least     three       (or    six)       equal increments,

with deformations        being monitored at each increment of

the load cycle.



The testing     and     barrier     can       be     considered           to have

satisfactory     completed        this        part        of     the     test    if

recovery to Â±10% of its original                   position is achieved.

If the barrier fails to achieve this level of recovery,

the engineer     shall     establish          the     reason           why before

restarting the        bedding-in cycle.             The barrier shall be

deemed defective        unless a     satisfactory explanation is

obtained for these results.



(d)          The Test Schedule

The schedule should reference the number of the barrier

in accordance with the           'Barrier Location                   Plan'.     From

year to year, the barriers to be tested will vary.                               The

engineer should        provide     to     the       testing           authority a
schedule of the 25% of all the barriers to be tested in

that year,    together with any additional              barriers which

the prior     inspection has          recorded may be of defective

condition.



The test loading is to          be     applied    on    five    (or ten)

approximately       equal     increments,    the loading increment

being maintained for five minutes prior                 to measurement

of    the    deflections.        A record should be        kept of all

deflections at each increment of load.                 The load should

then be     released in the same increments and the extent

of permanent deformation          (mm) measured after release of

all load.



(e)         Criteria for Compliance

Provided     that      the    structure     has     been     bedded-down

correctly     prior     to     testing,     it      should      show   no

significant signs        of permanent       deformation.        This may

be assumed to have           been demonstrated         if the following

conditions are met:



     (i)    The     recovery     of     the deflection is at least

             75% of the maximum deformation recorded under

             the full proof load.

 (ii)       Existing cracking,            or deformations are shown

             not to     extend significantly during the test

             and the     barrier as       a whole      showed no great
                non-linearity of deformation during test.

(iii)           The barrier shows no other signs                 of distress

                as a result of the test cycle.



Where    possible,           comparison      should   be   made         of   the

performance of other               similar   barriers      and        with that

under    any         previous      similar    tests    to establish that

there      is        no      significant       reduction         in     overall

performance of that barrier with time.



In the     event of          the inspection revealing a structural

condition that is likely to prove unsatisfactory or the

barrier failing             to comply     with the     conditions of the

proof testing, it shall be deemed                   defective and either

replaced        in        total,    or   repaired     so   as     to     enable

compliance with further proof testing.

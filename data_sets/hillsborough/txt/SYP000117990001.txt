                     On Saturday                        15 A p r i l      1989,    I was        on d u t y           for    the F.A.         Cup Semi-Final

                     between Liverpool                            and Nottingh am               Forest           h e l d at H i l l s b o r o u g h F o o t b a l l

                     Ground,                 Sheffield.




                     I commenced                        duty     at     8 . 0 0 a m at B a r n s l e y          Police         Station and          I was    to       be

                     At     10.00am                 I reported with my                    seriai^lfo             Inspector           Dews     at    the M i d l a n d

                     Railway Station.                             Together with                other           serials         we w e r e    to    ensure

                     Liverpool                     supporters            arriving         by    service              trains       should      be    directed

                     from        the              railway        station        o n to a w a i t i n g           P . S . V . ’s a n d       transported          to

                     n ot       to       be a l l o w e d         to e n t e r     th e    city           centre.




                     Nottin^foam F o r e s t                      supporters           would also                be a r r i v i n g     at    the M i d l a n d

                     Station                 cli s p e c i a l ,        and,    service         trains.               The      rival    factions          were    to

                     be     identified                     on    t he    station       by B r i t i s h          Transport           Police        and    directed
to    exits        at    opposite              ends       of    the       station where                  they would         be     received

by S o u t h Y or k s h i r e            personnel              and       directed            to    the P . S . V . ' s .




At    th e   outset           it w a s         apparent             t ha t     supporters            of    both       teams were

attempting              to    by-pass           the T r a n s p o r t           Police         in the          station and          the

Police        cordons          at       th e    outer          exits         by u s i n g      the m a i n       exit     in the

centre        of    the       station.               This       was       an    obvious            attempt       to a v o i d      using

the P . S . V . ' s          and    get        into       the       city       cent r e .




At    11.00am           I was       directed              by I n s p e c t o r       Dews      to m o n i t o r       the m a i n     exit

with my        serial          and       filter           out       any      football          supporters             from amongst

the    general           public          using        that          exit.           We w e r e      constantly           directing

football           supporters              from       t h is        e xi t     to    the P . S . V . ’s.          It w a s

approximately                 2 . 10pm w h e n            the       last       of    the      supporters          had     passed

t h r o u g h the        station.




Large        numbers          of N o t t i n g h a m           supporters               has    used       the M i d l a n d S t a t i o n .

I was        surprised             by    how        few s u p po rt e rs             from Liverpool               has     used      this

station,           especially              in v i e w          of    the       f a ct    that       only       appr ox ima tel y 350

were     expected             to    us e       the    special             train         into W a d s 1 ey B r i d g e        Station.




Approximately                 S.E5       p.m.        we    boarded a P.S.V.                        together       with      officers

from     other          serials          fo r       transport             to H i l l s b o r o u g h .          The    serial

instructions                 were,       to     remain              at       the    g r o u n d as a      reserve,          t a k e a meal

during       half-time,                 a n d at      the           end       of    th e m a t c h t r a v e l    with       the

Liverpool           supporters                 on    the P . S . V s           returning            to    the    Midlan d Station.




We a p p r o a c h e d H i l l s b o r o u g h             from Mi ddl e wo o d                Road       turning        right      into

Leppings           Lane.           At    2.50        p.m.       I saw          large       groups         of    supporters          walking

towards       the L e p p i n g s              Lane       turnstiles.                   Some       were more          t h a n a h a lf
                                                                                                                                  PAGE

mile    from      the     ground.          On       turning          into L e p p i n g s       Lane       t he    bus       h a d to

slow    to a       crawl      because          of    the       volume       of    people        making        their          way       to

th e   ground.



Between         2.50    p.m.     and 2.55            p.m.       we    pulled       up     in L e p p i n g s L a n e

immediately            opposite          the     turnstiles.                There       wa s    a    densely           packed

crowd      stretching          from       t he      road       right a cr os s          the     width        of    the

turnstiles.             Crowds       of    people          were       still       arriving           from     either

direction.             There     were      at       l ea s t    half       a dozen men              climbing           o ve r     the

walls      and     gates      surrounding              the      turnstiles.               There       was     no       question             of

any    queue      at    any    of    the       tunstiles.               It w a s       j u st    a mass       of       people.              I

can    rec a ll       seeing     individual               Police        Officers          within       that        crowd          but

they were          obviously         having          little          effect       on the         movement          of       the

crowd.          The    two    Police       horses          that       I rec a ll        also        seemed        to    be      having

little      effect        on the         crowd.



It w a s    obvious          that    we    would          not    be a b l e       to    enter        the     g r o u n d at        this

point      for     some      considerable              time.          The     driver,           therefore,             took       us

around      the       ground     to P e n i s t o n e          Road where          we     entered          the     s t a d i u m at

the    main Police            access       point.




I had      n ow    changed       channels            on m y      personal          radio and was                  monitoring

transmissions             made      at    the       ground.           I reported           to       Inspector           Sewell          in

th e   gymnasium.             It w a s     s till         prior       to 3 . 0 0       p.m.     and    I now           became

aware      of     requests       for      assistance             at     the      Leppings           Lane     end       of    the

ground.           I could      not       discern          from       the    r a d io    transmissions                  the      exact

nature      of    the     problem.             I presumed             from what           I had a l r e a d y           seen       that

the    problem wo uld            be w i t h         the    crowd        outside         the      ground.           I had          heard

garbled         transmissions             to the          effect,          "We m u s t     open       th e    gates".

Inspector            Sewell          asked        for a n y        serials        who     were        available             and      I was

directed            to    take my          serial         onto      the       track       in        f r o n t of      L e pp i ng s Lane

terrace.             We    walked          in s i n g l e        file a lo ng          the          t r a c k in      front       of the

North Stand               towards          the L e p p i n g s          Lane.         There         were       only    the     no r m a l

number         of    officers           you        would         have     expected             to     see on the           b ac k

serial.             The    match        had        not      s t a r t e d at      this         time.



A s we        approached             th e L e p p i n g s        Lane     Terrace          I        f o u n d it s t r a n g e        t ha t

there app eared                 to    be    l a r ge      spaces         within        the          righ t h a n d         pen.

Spectators               were    climbing              f r o m th e      terracing             along       all       the    sections,

i nto     the       seating          area.         I directed my                 officers            to    space        out     in f r o n t

of     th e    terracing             along        the     track.          I was        not a w a r e           of a n y     problem            in

th e    terracing           at       this       point.



I tried         to m o n i t o r        th e       radio         transmissions                  as     I wanted            to c l a r i f y my

instructions.                   I could            not      hear        the    t r a n s m i s s i o n s b e c a u s e of           the

crowd         noise™



My att ent ion was                   drawn        to     th e    centre        pe n    by m y        officers           stood        on the

track         behind       the       go a l .      I went          to    the     track         behind          the    goal     where           I

could         see    that       people          o n the         terracing          next        to    the       perimeter            f e nc e

were      being          pushed        into       th e    fencing         by t h e w e i g h t            of    the     crowd and

appeared            very    distressed.                   It w a s       obvious          that       the       people       only a

short         distance          into       th e    terracing             and     only a few               feet a w a y        from        the

fence,         were       unaware          of     the     people         in d i s t r e s s .




I believe            at    this       point        t h at       the m a t c h      ha d    started and                there       was an

horrendous               volume       of    noise         from      the       cro wd .         It wa s         not    possible            to

hear     any        radio       transmissions.
I stepped             b ac k      and     checked             th e      right        hand        pen to se e              if t h e r e        was

still       space        capacity,                 with a view                to     releasing              people           through          the

gates       from       the        centre           pen a l o n g         the        track and              i n to     t he    rig h t     hand

pen.        It w a s         not     possible                to    use       t he    r ad i o a n d         inform           control          of my

intentions.                  I w a v e d at             th e P o l i c e        control            box      to      indicate            that    we

were       going       to      open       th e       gat e s. I k n e w at                th i s      time            that     there       were

not      enough Police                   Officers             on the         track        to        c o n t r o l the        people        that

would       come       through            the       gates.              However,               it w a s      now obvious                that    the

people         at     th e     front          of     the      pen       n e xt      to     the     fencing were                extremely

distressed.



I shouted             f or     the       gates          to    the       centre         pen       to    be       opened.            I was       next

to    gate       4,    situated               immediately                behind           the      go a l       and    I fully           expected

a    flood       of    spectators                  to     surge         onto        the     tr a ck .           However,           no    person

c ame      through           th e    gate          of    their          own accord.                   Each       person        had       to    be

pulled         through,             the       c r o w d wa s         that        tightly           p a ck e d.




People         at     the      front          of    the       crowd were               now       shouting             and     screaming             for

help and            obviously             being           crushed.               I r e ca l l         at     this      point        thinking

t h at     people        in       the     crowd w oul d                 be    seriously               in j u r e d .         Yet    there       was

s t i ll   a     crescendo               of    noise          from       the        main       body        of    the      crowd who            were

engrossed             in the         match.



Together            with       half       a dozen             officers              from my           serial,          I became

embroiled             in f r a n t i c         efforts             to    pull        people           through          the     gate.           I lost

track       of      time       and was             totally           unaware           of      events           other        than       those

immediately              surrounding                    that       gate.            In s p i t e       of all          our     efforts          we

did      not     seem        to     be    having             any     impact          on     releasing               the      pressure          of    the

crowd,         no m a t t e r        h o w m a n y we              pulled           through           the       gate.

I am     sure       that       people          only a short           distance            back     into         t he    terracing

were     watching             the    game w nd were              unaware        of    the       c r u s h at       th e     fro nt .

Panic      and      desperation                then    seemed       to     pass      through          th e      crowd        r ap i d l y .

People      appeared               from about          t e n d eep,        rolled         over     the       t o p of       the      c ro w d

in f r o n t      of     them and          down       to t h e     g ate.       I was          now a w a r e       of m o r e

Police      Officers               arriving        on the        track      and assisting                  as    the        crowd      from

t he    pe n s p i l l e d         onto    the     pitch.




The     gate      was     a p p r o x i m a t e l y 2*-3*          wide.        Access          around          the     g a t e wa s

very      restricted               because       of    two    factors.            The      first         was     t ha t      th e    gate

only      opened         to    form a          righ t a n g l e     with     fen c e.           Therefore,              only        two

officers          of a        time       could     efficiently work                  at    pulling           people          free      by

approaching              from       the    front       and    left       hand     side.           In our         obvious            f ra n t i

efforts        to a s s i s t        we    were       inevitably           getting         in e a c h        others         way.          The

second       factor           was    that       advertising           hoardings,               set at        an angle,              from

the     floor       to    knee       height,          were    up a g a i n s t       the       fence       and     r i gh t      u p to

the     edges       of    the       gate.




The     situation was                now       desperate,          people       f i ve     or     si n     deep within               the

crowd were             screaming           for     help.         People      at      the       fencing          were        being

crushed mercilessly.                           Individuals          even     in t h e i r         pa nic        were        indicating

that      people         were       being       trampled         underneath           their        feet.           There        was

nothing        we      could        do    but    pull     people         through          the     g at e     one       at   a time.

Some     were       at    shoulder             height,       some     at    waist         height         and     s om e     were

dragged        out       along       the       floor.



I was      unaware            of    t i me,     but    after       b e i n g at      the       gate      for     some

considerable              time,          two    particular          men     became         s t u c k at         the     bottom         of

the     gate.          They        were    pleading          for    he lp,      but       we    could        not m o v e        them.

We     h a d to     pull       many       people       through        over      the       t o p of       them      inevitably

causing        them       to    be    trampled          on.       I was         afraid          for    the       l i v es    of   these

m e n at      this      point        but    there      was       nothing          to    be d o n e         for    them       until       the

crush was           relieved.              Still       people       further            ba c k    in th e         crowd,       who    di d

not    appear        to    be    in       real   danger,          were       jumping            and    rolling          o v er    the        t op

of    the     crowd       down       to    the   gate.



A middle          aged man           in a g r e y a n o r a k          had      been       pulled          through          the   gate

quite        early      on.      He       continually            t r i e d to      get      past       the P o l i c e        officers

to    th e    g ate.       He    was       obviously          trying         to    get      to a n         individual             trapped

in the        crowd       near       to    the    gate.          He was         in a b l i n d          panic         a n d all     he

was    doing        was    hampering             our    b e st    efforts.              After         repeatedly             pushing

and    pul 1 ing        him away           f r o m th e      gate      I had       to      strike          him     in t he        stomach

w it h my      f i st     in a n      effort       to k e e p       him away             from        the     gate.



I could        now      s ee    that       there were            spaces         on t he         terrace          only a short

distance          away     from       the     fencing.            We     s h o u t e d at        the       crowd around             the

gate     to    turn and          l o ok     back       but    they were            obiivious               and     continued         to

push     towards          the    g ate.          Not    until       Po l ice O f f i cers               had      pulled       people

away     b ac k     into       the    terracing            did    th e    pressure              at    th e      gate    subside.




The    two m e n w h o          had       been    t r a p p e d at       th e     f o ot    of       the     gate      for    several

minutes        must       have       been     seriously           injured.              The      first          was    a white

male,        late    thirties,             medium       buildm,          dark      hair and mo ustache,                       wearing           a

bright        red    jumper          with a motif             and      blue       jea n s.           He w a s      pul led        to my

side and was              certainly           al i v e .



The    second man was                 a white          male,      late       te e ns ,      piump          b u i 1d , w e a r in g       a

lightweight             jacket,           t-shirt       and      jeans.           I assisted               in    pulling          this

man    to m y       side       and    placed       h i m on       the     grass          in the         re cove ry          position.

He was        blue      in t h e      face       but    breathing            steadily.                I returned             to    him

                                                                                                                                 R 160

after         a few m i n u t e s .           He was       s t i ll    in the           same      position,            breathing

and     responsive              to m y        questions.            I did        not     see      either         of    these        two

m e n again.



The     majority           of    p e o p l e w h o we         pulled        through            t ha t    gate,        although

distressed,              were        uninjured.            However,          there would                 s t il l     be a    l a rg e

number         who    would          have      some     injuries.



After         the    crush       had     receded           I was      aware       that         the      m e s h at     either        side

of     th e    gate      had     been         forced       away and         bodies        were          being       removed         from

t he    terracing.               1 assisted            with     cardiac           massage             on two        persons,         but    I

was     stopped          after        only a few mi nu t es                 after        they were             pronounced            dead

by a d o c t o r .            I cannot          describe        these        p e op le .




I assisted            to      carry my man              from    the     terracing                to     the     left     of    gate

four.          He w a s       carried          onto     the    field        to    t he     left         of    the     goal.         He w a s

a whi te m a l e , a p p r o x i m a t e l y 6 * tall,                      medium         build,            fai r hair,        clean

shaven,          wearing         jeans         and a shirt            whi ch w a s         hanging            off     hi s    body.        He

was     blue        in the       face a n d          his    body      wad    discoloured.                     He a p p e a r e d     to    be

d ead.          I attempted             mouth        to m o u t h     resuscitation,                    assisted         by a

policewoman              doing        caridiac          massage.            This        was      futile        within         a few

moments          a doctor            c am e    and    certified         the       man      dead.             He was      carried away

by     people        using       a hoarding.                I did      not       s ee    t hi s       ma n again.




I went         back      to     the a r e a      behind        the     g o al,      there         now seemed             to    be a

mass      of     bodies         all     obviously           dead.       Another            body was            passed         out    from

the     terracing.               Police         Constable           Hooson and myself                        tried     to     carry

this      person away                but we w e r e         unable      to.        Another              hoarding        appeared

and     I assisted              to    carry      this       body      towards           th e    ko p     end     of    the     ground

where         it w a s     left.          I cannot          describe         this        pe rson.

                                                                                                                                 R 160



I walked          back    towards              Leppings           Lane.        The    pitch was             now a mass           of

Police Officers                 and       supporters.                The Notting ham               supporters            on t he H o p

began       to    jeer    and        t h is     obviously            provoked        the Live rp oo l              fans      on the

pi t ch .        I made        efforts          to    turn        the L i v e r p o o l        supporters          away.         A     line

of P o l i c e O f f i c e r s        was       formed across                 the w i d t h      of   the        pitch and a

confrontation was                    avoided.



In s p i t e      of    th e    distress             of     the    people        present         it w a s        quite       evident

that    a    large       number           of    the       supporters           who were          on t h at        pitch       ha d     been

drinking          alcohol           and    were       th e w o r s e      for     dri n k.




I was       totally        unaware             of    t he    time       and    over what           period         of    t i me    the

events       had taken              place.           I ha d       lost    contact          with       the    personnel            in my

serial.           I made        several             trips     up and          down    the       pitch       to    locate         and

gather       my    officers            together.




It w a s     approximately                 5.00       p.m.        I left       the    stadium with                six    officers

from my          serial        to    go    to C l a y w h e e l s        Lane.        I went          off    duty       at

6.30    p.m.       at    Barnsley              Police        Station.



I have       twelve       years           Police          Service,        th e    last         f iv e as a P o l i c e

Sergeant.              I have        policed          football           matches          at    all    the       football

grounds          in the        South       Yorkshire              Area.        I have          a wide       experience            of

public       order       techniques and                     training.            No a m o u n t       of    preparation              or

training          could        have       foreseen           the     consequences               of the       events          that

day.        Considering              the       enormity           and    scale       of    those       events,          the S o u t h

Yorkshire Police                    and    other          emergency           services          dealt       admirably            with

the aftermath.

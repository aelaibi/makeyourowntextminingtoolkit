SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE




I am   a Chief        Inspector         in    the    South    Yorkshire Police,                         at    present

stationed at Hammerton Road Police Station.

On 29 March 1989, together with Superintendent Murray and                                                Inspector

Sewell,      I attended a meeting at Divisional Headquarters with Chief

Superintendent            Duckenfield         in    his    office,        where         we     discussed             the

Operational         Order       and    how        arrangements      were          firming           up.            Minor

amendments      were made to the                  Order but     otherwise              it was           all    right.

The    Operational          Order       was       completed,       approved             and       subsequently

circulated on the evening of 5 April 1989.

At    9.00    am    on     Saturday          15    April     1989 ,       I    paraded           for         duty       at

Hammerton Road Police Station.                        The weather was                fine and sunny.                     I

travelled          with     Superintendent                Murray      to         Sheffield               Wednesday

Football Stadium where my duties were in the areas of the Spion Kop

and    the    South        Stand,       my    Sector       Commander            being         Superintendent

Greenwood.

Together       with       all    other       officers       involved           in     policing               the    Semi

Final,       I took a seat.'in the North Stand where Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield         briefed       all    concerned          using     a       public        address           system.

During        his     briefing,          he        identified         all           Sector              Commanders,

Superintendent Murray and Detective Superintendent McKay.

Superintendent              Murray           then      briefed            all         officers                as        to

communications             and        emergency       evacuation              procedures,                 informing

everyone that the two tests carried out previously had been
                                                                                                                                            17

successful,              in     fact       I    believe             the    word           'excellent'          was       used.         Mr

M u rray       was          followed             by        Detective                    Sergeant         Charlesworth                 who

a ppraised          everyone           as      to     the       current .i n t e ll ig en c e                concerning              both

Live r po ol and N o t t i n g h a m supporters.

Finally,         Inspector             Sewell          informed            all          officers        regarding             issue    of

radios,        meals           and    not       to    'stand          down'          without           authority         of        Police

Control.

The     main        b ri efing         ended         and        I    subs eq ue n tl y            joined       Superintendent

G ree nw oo d       on    the        Spion       Kop       where          we    spoke         with      Inspectors             Calvert

and     Booth         and       their          respective              Serials.                 D uring      this        briefing,

S u pe r intendent             Gree n wo od informed the officers                                  of the       fact that the

taped off area at the North Wing of the Spion Kop would be used                                                                       for

Liverpool             supporters               who     purchased                tickets           for     that        area.         This

s e g r e ga ti o n      area would,             of necessity,                  require           containment            by police

o fficers       and       Mr     Greenwood             recounted                his       e x p e ri en ce     of     last         years

Semi     Final        and      public          disorder             which       o cc ur re d       on    the     Spion         Kop     at

this location.

Toget he r      with           S uperintendent                  Greenwood,                I     then     went       to        an    area

behind        the     Spion          Kop    as       this       area           is       barren     and    there          are       loose

stones      which        could        be used as ammunition.                                  We found that there were

stones      in that area but neither of us were unduly concerned.

I   then      left       Super in t en de nt           Greenwood                and       w a l ke d    over     to      the       South

Stand      where          Inspector              Darling             was        in        the     process           of    briefing

stewards        for       that        area.           One       steward             was    w alking       away        whilst          the

briefing        was       in    progress             and    I therefore                   spoke    to him.            He told me

that     he    had        heard        it      all     before             but       I    re m in de d    him     that          it     was

important           he    paid       attention             as       'sods       law'       di c tated        that        if    he    did

not s om et h in g wo u ld go wr o ng in his particular area.

I then           proc ee d ed        to    patrol        the    perimeter          track,        South         Stand,        South

Stand        car        park,        sterile        area,          Penistone           Road     North         and      re turned

eve n tually             to    the        Spion     Kop.             During       my     tour       I    spoke         with     all

officers                on their          respective duties                to      ensure           that      all      officers

were        per f or mi ng         their         allocated           duties       ana     that       none      of      them     had

any problems.                  I repeated this procedure at r egular                                    intervals.

At     12        noon     as       spectators            began        to     enter       the     Stadium,           Liverpool

supporters              were        identified           on     the        Spion       Kop     and      the       segregation

plan        at       the North             Wing      'was implemented using                      officers              from     the

Spicn Kop Terrace                    Serial.

I    recall         seeing          Police        Constable            Green       a p p re h en d      a     youth      in     the

Spion        Kop     whilst           I    was     stood        near       to     the     se gr egated            area.         The

youth       was     w earing         a green         rugby         jersey       and was        struggling.                I went

to     his       as s istance             and     ascer ta in ed           that    the       yo u th        had     made       rude

gestures            (masturbating)                to     the       N o t t in gh a m     Forest         supporters.               I

helped        Police Constable                   Green        take     the      youth     to     the        Police Room at

the    rear of          the    North        Stand       where        I left        them.            I returned            to    the

Spion Kop           for a short while                    to m o n i t o r       the mo o d of the crowd and it

appeared good humoured.

I    continued            to       tour     the     Serials           under       my     s up er vi s io n        at    regular

intervals           but no problems were being experienced.

As     the        crowds           increased           on      the      Spion      Kop        and       the       numbers        of

Liverpool           supporters              in    the       segregated           area     on    the      Kop       increased,

then     I       found        it    necessary            to    increase           the    number         of     officers          in

that        area.              The        number         of     Liverpool              supporters             on       the      Kop

e ve ntually         reached          well        in excess           of    500    and       Inspector         Calvert          and

an entire           Serial were eventually utilized.

Throughout              my     tour       of     duties        I     ma in t ai ne d      personal            contact          with
                                                                                                                                      Â£ 111
S u pe r in te nd e nt           Greenwood                and     gave       that       officer          regular           updates

regarding the areas. un d er ray direct supervison.

At     one       particular             stage        I     believe          arrouna        2.15     pm     I       became      aware

that       my     ra di o      was      transmitting               intermittently.                    By    that      I mean           I

could        only      hear       approximately                 every        other      word.         I informed            Police

Control          and     stated          I     intended           to        change      my     radio       battery          at    the

Gymnasium at             the rear of the North Stand.

I     made       my     way       via    the         South        Stand       car       park       where       I    spoke        to    a

Mounted           Off ic er          who        informed           me        he      was       e xp e riencing             similar

difficulties                wTith       his     radio.             I     walked         uc     Psnistone            Road       North

where        I    was       struck       by         the    lack        of    traffic         and      comparative              small

number           of      Nottingham                 Forest         supporters                queuei n g            outside        the

turnstiles.                 In fact          I saw Chief            Superintendent                 Nesbit          in the Range

Rover      and        recall        passing          comment        on the          self       same      subject.           I then

went       to    the        g ym n a s i u m    and        exchanged          my     radio         battery          but    a     test

t ra ns mission             revealed           no    improvement.                 I therefore            walked           onto    the

perimeter             track       via    the        access        route       between         the     Spion        Kop and        the

North      Stand;           the     time       would        be    a p p r o x im at e ly       2.30      pm.          I noticed

that       the        Spion       Kop    was         approx im at el y            two      thirds        full       whilst        the

North      Stand        was       only       half        full.         The    West      Stand was          filling nicely

but    plenty          of     empty          seats        were     visible          and      whilst        the      two     centre

pens       were       filling           up     there        was    plenty          of      roo m    at     both      North        and

South ends             of the        terraces.              I remarked on this to Police Constable

Lamb who was             the first officer                       I met on the track.

I    was        then     joined          by     the         Communications                 officer         who       stated           he

understood             that       radio        problems           were       being      experienced.                I informed

him of the             trouble          I had e xperienced                   and elected to w alk him around

the    p e r im et e r        track      to     the        Police           Control       Room.          This       I did,        the

    time        being        ap p ro xi ma t el y             2.40        pm.          I      left       the        Communications

    Officer       at       the     foot       of the          stairs          leading to the Police Control Box

    and     I    again           walked        around the                external           perimeter          of    the     Stadium;

    all     was       in    order;           traffic          was     light          and     the     number         cf    pedestrians

    mansgeable .

    I returned             to     the       perimeter           track         via     the     access       route          between the

    Spion       Kop        and    the       North        Stand        and       this        t ime    noted       that       the    Spion

    Kop    had    filled           up as       had        the    South Stand.                  There       was      still     seating

    a vailable         in        the    North        Stand           {approximately                 three      quarters           full),

    the     West       Stand           had     filled up,                the     centre        pens       appeared          full        but

    there       was        still       room     visible             at     the       North     and       South       wings        of    the

    terracing.

    I turned          to face the              Spion          Kop,       looked at the segregated area which

    by     now       contained               well        in     excess           of     500         Liverpool            supporters.

    Recognising             the    potential              public         disorder pr ob l em which could                           arise

    and    already           m entioned             by    Su pe r intendent                 Gree nw o od       at        briefing,        I

    signalled          to    Inspector             Calvert           who was with a Serial                       at the side of

    the    s e g r e g at ed      area       that        I w i s he d         to speak with              him at          the rear of

    the    No rt h     Stand           in    five       minutes;               the    time      would       be      approx im at el y

    2.50 p m .

    I then       spoke           with       five    L iverpool             suoporters              who    were       on    the     Spion
m   Kop     behind          Gate        6.         As     I did          so     I     saw     Police        Constable             Holmes

    escorting          some        Liverpool             supporters              to    the     segregated             area       in    the

    Spicn       Kop.         I    advised           the       five       youths        I was        speaking          to,    to        join

    them    but       they        ignored          me.          (These         youths         were       later      taken        out     of

    the Spion K o p and removed from the Stadium for their own safety).

    I recall          at    this        time       h earing         radio        transmissions              but      I was        unable

    to    decipher          the        exact       content           due       to     the     noise       in   the        ground       and
                                                                                                                                          (Ilf
what     I    took           to    be       b a c k g r ou nd       interference .                     This        was       despite       the

fact     that       my .ra di o              was        fitted       with       an       earpiece.                 I did,          however,

hear     the    word 'gate'                   or 'gates'           mentioned             and       I              therefore went            to

the     rear        of        the       North             Stand          with        a    view to             list en i ng           to    the

t r an s mi ss io n          as        well        as     discussing              segregation                     problems           on    the

Spion Kop with                    Inspector Calvert.

On      reaching                  the        quieter             area          behind              the        North            Stand,        I

distinctively                 heard          the    voice          of    a male          officer.                 I would describe

the     rone        as excited                   and urgent          and was asking for                           authority to open

the     'gate'           or 'gates'.                     Termi no lo gy         was' used to the                    effect that             if

this    was     not          done,          then    deaths           would      result.                 The       request          was    made

more     than            once          but       I am     unable          to    say       on       how    many           occasions          or

w h e t he r by one or more officers.

At     this     time          I     was          joined        by       Inspector            Calvert.                   We     agreed       to

double        man        the       cordon on                  the       segregation area                   on       the        Spion       Kop

fifteen minutes                   after kick off.

I     then     returned                to     the        Spion          Kop     as       Iwas          aware             the    game       had

started,        my           attention              being           drawn         by      the          roar         of       the     crowd.

Simultaneously,                    I     saw        the       N o t t i ng ha m        Forest            supporters                pointing

towards        the           West           Stand         and        terracing             and          appeared               angry       and

abusive.                 I     did          not know          at        that      stage            what           had     caused          this

r ea ction      but          on    looking              towards         the     West       Stand          and       terracing             from

the     Spion        Kop          end        I     saw     what         appeared             to be            a    mass         of       press

officers        in       between              the       Leppings          Lane         end      goal       and           the terraces.

This    bank        of       people          o bs c ur ed       my      view      of      the      t er r a c i n g       but      I could

see    people        climbing               over        the     top      of    the       perim et e r             fencing       onto       the

track.          I        could          not       see         police           officers because                     of       the     people

behind        the        goal           o bs c u r i n g       my       view      and          I       recall            my immediate
impression was that                  a pitch          invasion was taking place.

Radio         transmissions              were        still     poor     and       this,           coupled         with     the

noise of the crowd,                  made any signals                 inaudible.

I     im mediately           in st ructed        all        officers        on     the       perim et e r          track    to

m on i to r     the       crowd     on    the        Spion      Kop    as    their           mood       was       angry    and

violent.            I also saw Police                 Sergeant        Battv on the South Wine of the

Spicn         Kcc     terraces           and     I     signalled        to        him        to    ao     over      to     the

segregated            area     to       assist        Inspector        Calvert           and       his     Serial,         the

puclic Gisorder poten ti al                      in that area now being great.

At    this     juncture        police          officers        came running             down       the    access         point

from     the        direction        of    the       g y mn as iu m   and     I d ir ected              them      down     the

p eri me te r       track     in    front        of    the     North    Stand,           towards          the      Leppings

Lane t e r r a c e s .

The    Spion         Kop    was     now        bubbling,        the     crowd       were           booing,         shouting

abuse     and making violent                    gestures        towards       the       Liverpool          supporters .

The     five        Liverpool           supporters           were     removed            via       Gate       6    at     this

point.       A minor skirmish occurred but this was qui ck l y brought                                                  under

control.

Add i tional         officers        came       via     the     South       wing        of    the       Spion      Kop     and

these were           allowed        onto the          perimeter track via                    Gate       1 and directed

m     front of the South Stand to the Leppings Lane end.

I    could     see     that       the     number        of     supporters          on     the      perimeter            track

was      swelling          behind         the        goal      mouth        and     then           was     aware          that

S up er in t en de nt       Green wo o d        had      run    onto        the    pitch           and    stopped          the

game .

I    recall     Liverpool           supporters              running     over        to       the    Spion         Kop     end,

s in gularly         at    first,         and    police         officers          moving           forward         to     deal

with them.
The     crowd       behind           the       goal       quickly           swelled          onto    the        pitch          and    into

the     penalty          area.           A St        J o h n âs Ambulance                came      down        the       access       road

from      the      d i re c ti on        of     the     gymna si um             and    a dvertising             hoardings             were

b r ok e n and removed tc allow free access onto the pitch.                                                              It was

then driven to the Leppings                                Lane e n d .

Police           officers           and        supporters              were       together          carrying             persons        on

stretchers,              on        ad v e r t i s i n g      hoardings                and     by     hand           tc    the        North

Stand /S p io n         Kcp corner               of the pitch and were                         adminis t er in g m o u t h to

m ou th     res us c it at io n            to      seme.          It    was       apparent          at        that       stage        that

there       had        been         deaths,            although             I    am     unable           tc     say       how        many.

Supporters             were         also         rip pi ng         down         advertising              hoardings              at     the

Spion      Kop      end       of     the       S t a di um    and       these in turn were                      being          taken    to

the Leppings Lane end.

On    re a l i s i n g       the      potential              enormity            of     the    problem              I    ran    to     the

gymn a si um       and        told       the     officers           there         to    clear       the       area        for use       as

a t e mp or ar y mortuary.

I     returned          to     the        pla yi ng          area       and       there       I     saw       Police           Sergeant

Robinson          en      route          to      the       Leppings             Lane     end,       called              him    over     tc

assist       with        First        Aid       as     I knew          he    was       a First       Aid       Instructor.               I

then      turned        to another               group       in time to see them covering a youth's

w a lked     away        and       I took         hold       of     the         temporary          stretcher.                  Together

we    carried          the     body to the                gymnasium;             however,          m a no eu v e r a b i l i t v was

Once       inside           the        g y m n as iu m - I         was    aware            that       a     number       of     people

(exact        number          not         known)       were        laid        on    the       floor,        apparently             dead.

A    number       cf     relatives               and     friends          as        well       as    police        officers          were

in     the    area,          many          were       distressed,              seme        were       angry        and    directing

insults        at      the       police.              Detective           Sergeant             Smith       a p pr oached        me    and




officer remained with each body to ensure continuity.

A number          cf    officers             were       persuading             none        police          personnel          tc leave

the g y m na s iu m and I returned to the pitch to rejoin officers there.

On    my     return          I       noticed          that    the        number          cf    police        officers           on    the

perimeter           track            had    been       increased           and       I spoke           with       some     of       them,

reminding              them          cf     the        need        for         v igilance             in     respect           of     the

with       him.        He     told         me     to    monitor           the       No t t i n g h a m      supporters in â¢the

A cordon          of police                officers          had been          formed across                 the halfway line

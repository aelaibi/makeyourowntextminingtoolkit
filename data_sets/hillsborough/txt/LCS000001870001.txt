O ur first wish is to ex pr es s our h e a r t f e l t s y m p a t h y to all       those
w ho were injured or b e r e a v e d . i n the te rr i b l e d i s a s t e r at
H i l l s b o r o u g h on S a t u r d a y last.

As trustees of the appe al we con si de r our o v e r r i d i n g p r i o r i t y is
to give spee dy and pr a c t i c a l e f f e c t to the w i d e s p r e a d feelings of
   apathy and support w h i c h are m a n i f e s t in the m a n y do na ti on s
*  Lch have been re ach in g the fund ev e n before the formal
   ception.      By last nig ht £ 6 6 0 , 0 0 0 had been r e c e i v ed in the Bank
acc ounts set up in the three cities, and this was apart from the
pro mi se d co nt ri bu ti on of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 from the G o v e r n m e n t and £2 5,0 00
from each of the three cities.                 The tru ste es are aware that man y
more do na tio ns have a l r e a d y bee n p l e d g e d and that ma n y fund
raising ac tiv iti es are underway.

Immediate payments to relieve h a r d s h i p have been made du ri n g this
week throug h the Social Se rvi ce D e p a r t m e n t s of the Local
Autho rit ies , and the t ru st ee s have a g r e e d that they should take
re sp on si bi li ty for these, and will co nt inu e to mee t these
immediate payments.         In p a r ti cu la r, we have a g r e e d to pay, if
requested, all funeral expenses. ' A g a i n the p r oc es s of de al in g
w i t h this has a lr ea d y be e n i n i t i a t e d by the Local A u t h o r i t i e s and
we shall take these on board.

As to d i s t r i b u t i o n of the bulk of the Fund, we have been
fortunate in having had the be n e f i t of advice from those who ran
       Bradfo rd Fire Di sa s t e r Fund so succes sf ul ly.         This has
t a b l e d us at our first m e e t i n g this a f t e r n o o n to take a number
^     deci si on s on the p r i n c i p l e s w h i c h will guide our actions.
T h e y are

1.   that we should pay out              to the v i c t i m s or their   families
     as q u i c k l y as po ss i b l e

2.   that as har ds hi ps have not be e n su ffered equally,                this
     should be re flected in the d i s t r i b u t i o n p o l i c y

3.   that we should not at any time pu b l i c i s e to w h o m we had
     made d i s t r i b u t i o n s nor h o w much- any in dividual or
     ca te g o r y of p e rs on s ha d received

Continued/.
4.    that we     should pay out lump sums            rather    than
      requl ar    income pa ym en ts

5.    that we as trustees will not be able to me e t all of the
      b e n e f i c i a r i e s and th erefore we sh o u l d not me e t a n y of
      them

6.    that the costs of a d m i n i s t r a t i o n   sho ul d be kept to the
      minimum.


A p a r t fr o m the immediate pa ym en ts a l re a d y referr ed to, it is our
h o p e and i n t e n t i o n that we can ma k e an initial p a y m e n t to those
b e r e a v e d and to the i nj ur ed w i t h i n four weeks.    C l e a r l y we are
n o t aware of all those w h o have b e e n injur ed and we w o u l d ask
a n y o n e w h o c o n si de rs that they ma y have a cl ai m on the Fund to
w r i t e to the Trust Fund Manager, H i l l s b o r o u g h D i s a s t e r Appeal,
P 0 Box 220, Liverpool, L69 2PN.

Finally, we sho ul d like to e x pr es s our sincere thanks to all
t ho se w h o ha v e a l r e a d y sent d o n a t i o n s - ma n y of w h i c h are
ar lymous.

i n d i v i d u a l a c k n o w l e d g e m e n t s will no t be sent by the trustees

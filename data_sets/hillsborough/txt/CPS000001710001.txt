Sue Ross of the Treasury Solicitors Dept expects to send me a draft letter today as the reply to the defence
solicitors' requests for our detailed reasons for not intervening in the private prosecution.

She informed me in our telephone conversation late yesterday that her advice will be to run it past Philip Havers
QC before sending it out.
On receipt of this draft I shall fax it to addressees of this e mail for your consideration.

I understand that her position will be that we should give more detailed reasons than we would normally do so.

The latest information from the HFSG is that their representations to the Souith Yorkshire Police Authority re the
legality of the funding for the two defendants are to heard at a meeting with the Chief Constable present. In the
meantime I'm informed that the Authority has stopped funding for any judicial review application pending a final
decision. A newspaper report of 20.1 shows that the Authority members are concerned about the seemingly
open ended funding. The district auditor has also been asked to look at the legality of the Authority's decision.

Thank you for your letter of 30 September 1991* a copy of which I have
forwarded to Mr Sleightholm®.

I am mindful of the need to seek to make arrangements as to the date and
venue of the tribunal, but as I recounted to yoTPin”m!S^telep!wne~
com'ersation laslT weeY there pre problems including those identified by
counsel regarding the statements and the needs of the accused officers
in ‘preparing their “cases"; These problems have yet to be resolved.

It is clear to me that there are further issues that demand discussion
and I therefore propose, once Mr Sleightholme has had the opportunity to
digest what you say, to cause to be prepared a paper setting out all the
problems.

I would hope after you have considered them you will see the value in
further discussion in order that matters can be expedited.

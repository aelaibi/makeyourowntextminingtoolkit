the    lads     replied         ’W e ’re Liverpool              fans,    we    can get      in a n y w h e r e ! ’',

1 saw another             van     pull      up    in the       layby and a lad got              out and sold a

ticket      to a      lad    in a car which had                  pulled       up behind      it.

We    noticed       that     from about            1— 1 . 3 0 pm the 'traffic was            so    congested

a long    the      road     that      the    cars were at a standstill.                      However        by about

2 pm t h e road was             vir t u a 11 y e rnp t y .

At about 2 . 3 0 p m we              s t o p p e d two    coaches       w h i c h were    travelling           together

and the fans were                 c omplaining           that    the    drivers were         going       to make

them     late for         the     game.

At appro:;.         2 . 4 5 pm we       left Tankers 1 ey I n t e r s e c t i o n en            route     to

C layw h e e l s    Lane     for      our meal.

As we     pass ed by H i l l s b o r o u g h            I saw    tnat    there were a lot of                Li ve r p o o 1

fans     still      m i l l i n g about          at about       2pm and       I commented         that    if    the

fans     d i d n ’t hurry t h e y w o u l d miss                the    start    of the     game.

At about        3.05 a call             came      to us    that we were           required at L e p p i n g s

Lane.      We a s s u m e d       fighting, had broke                 out.

On arrival          at H i l l s b o r o u g h our        Inspector an d S e r geant              tuld us to make

sure     that we stayed               together as a serial.                    Once we     got     to    the    cate at

the L e p pings Lane .-I saw several                       hund r e d Liv e r p o o l     fans     stand i n g

opposite        the    gates w h i c h           lead    into    the    ground.

At first we were                told to form a cordon and                      I thought        this must        be

because       the     fans were          going      to s torm the            turnstiles.          At    this    1 1 me

rumours       began to          circulate          that    the    game       had been stop p e d a n d some

L i v erpool       fans     had      spilled onto          the    pitch.

A Liverpool           fan    came      up to me and a s k e d why               he was     not     being       allowed

in and showed me                his    ticket       and    I explained          the   situation          to him.

As we were          s peak i ng an a m b u l a n c e ar r i ved a n d t he               1ad a s k e d why       t he

ambulance          had arrived.              I said that          some       one must     have     been     injured

in t.hp crush and               he    replied       'Oh good          if they get        some     out    t h e r e ’ll be
more      room for        u s ’.

Just as       the a m b u l a n c e was making             its way        into    the gro u n d a call               came

over a tanoy sy s t e m               requesting      that       the    fans make         no a t t e m p t     to gain

e ntry to the           gro u n d     but assist Police            in bringing            out    the        injured.

Our      serial    was     then told to enter               the    ground.         Once we           pa s s e d through

the      outer    gates      I lost       contact w ith our S e r geant               and       Inspector         and

d i d n ’t see     them a g a i n       until     after     the Liverpool            fans       had     left    the

stadium.

The      first    person       I saw as we         passed        through the         gates       was      a man     in

his mid EG* s who was                  sat with      his    head between           his     knees        crying.          I

then saw a man             in his mid 3 0 ’s laid on the                   ground w ith a teenager

kneeling at         his      side.       The m a n was       having       difficulties               b r e a t h i n g and

appeared         to have an          injury to his          ribs.

I knelt      beside        him and helped            him    into a more             c o m f o r t a b l e position to

a id h is b r e a t h i n g .

I then w a l k e d       over       to an a m b u l a n c e w h i c h was        parked     next        to Gate

'C ’ .     I could see          two men       lying    on the          floor who were           obviously           dead.

A m b u l a n c e m e n were    giving      another        man    oxygen.

I then helped anot h e r PC                  to move       these       corpse       to one       side in order to

make     a space        for a m b u l a n c e s   to get     up and       down the alley.

At    this   stage       fans      began     coming    thro u g h Gate           ’C * in grea t e r          numbsrs

and more         bodies a n d        casualties were             brought    from the            pitch area.

M any of     the    fans who          came out were          very hostile           towards            the Police-,

passing      comments          such as       'It's    all    your bastards           fault’            and ’D o n ’t

just     fucking        stand      there you      bastards’.

I saw one fan say to several                      P o l i c e m e n who    had formed a cordon around

the bodies         of    the    dead,      ’You   bastards         are    going     to     pay for          this,

some     of you will           die    for what-: h a p p e n e d       here t o d a y ’.        Many        of the

f ans ware       quite      drunk       and some      who    were g e n u m e l y        t ry i ng     to    he 1 p the

Police were         really         little more        than a hi nderance              due       to     the amount        of

                                                                                                                        R 14

alcohol             t h e y ’d consumed.

As the            injured were         brought        out we         placed       them to       one    side,,     along        a

wall         and     I went      along    this wall           giving        advice       to the       friends      of    some

of those             injured and         placing        people         in the       recovery          p o s i t i o n and

Ma n y       of     the s e rgeants       seemed        to be        in a state          of    shock,     as we all

were and             I saw a Chief            Inspector        take      hold of one            sergeant        who was

s t a nding          next to me and           say to        him      "Come    on,       i t ’s up to y o u       sergeants

to take            control       of t h i s !*      The    sergeant          simply        looked away as              if he ?d

noi      heard the Chx e f I n s p e c t o r .

A Doctor             then    came     over    to me and e x p l a i n e d           he w o u l d      like to help.

(I found out                later     this was Mr.            Ashton).            I d i r e c t e d him to a man who

was      lying        face     down    on the       ground s u r r o u n d e d       by his       friends.          When

the Doctor               knelt    down next         to the man one             of    his       friends     said        ’What

do you want              you     bastard         fuck     o f f '.

he    replied            'Well    he should         get my mate          to fucking            hospital * «         I told

him to            calm down and do w h a t e v e r              the Doctor           told h 1m to.

I then            joined anot h e r ma n who was                  lying on the           floor        and was having

difficulties                breathing.           Howe v e r    he was        conscious          and was       talking.             I

told his friend                  to make      him more         comfortable.               1 then      walked      over       to

where        fans were           leaving      by Gate         ’B ’ .    M any      of   the     fans were        openly

crying and many were                     shouting         o b s c e nities      at myself          and    the    other

I then            wal k e d over      to the       opposite          side of      the alley           where     a man was

lying        on his         side.     This was          infact        the m a n     I had first          seen     as    I

ente r e d         the   ground.         I was     shoc k e d        that    he was       still       lying     in the

position' because                 it must      have       been 30 minu t e s            or     sc since       I had first

spoken        to him and hiis             companion.            The young           lad wit ri him to id me                 the

D o c t or had seen his               uncle and had said he must                          go    in the     next

                                                                                                                    R 14

ava i l a b l e    ambulance.

At this         time    I saw an am b u l a n c e          coming      thro u g h the main          gate and

heading         towards     us.        I went, over and             spoke w i t h     the a m b u l a n c e     driver

■and was        tiien joined        by a sergeant            who was        busy organ i s i n g         Che

t r a n s p o r t a t i o n of   the    injured.           1 informed him of the                 situation and

then      returned       to the        injured man.

At this         stage a young man               came    over      to me and told me              ha was a

medical         student,          I told him to go along                    the wall      at   the far side                of

the a l l e y w a y and examine               the    injured.

A few more minutes                passed       before       I was able        to get       the    inju r e d man

who was         lying    on the        floor    into an ambulance.

While all         this was        happening          I kept       corning in     contact         wit h    so ms      of

the officers            who were        in my serial.               P a r t i c u l a r l y PC £ 9 7 Bar res and

PC   1629       Rogan. H o w e v e r    I had       lost    touch wit h        the    rest     of my          serial.

At this         stage a sergeant               came along         and told us to go to the main

gate      ana     I remained       there       as    the West S t a n d was          emp-tiea of L i v e r p o o l

f a ns.

The atmos p h e r e at           this    time was          very     tense    and the majority' of the

fans were         very     host i l e and       I p e r s o n a l l y almost         ’expected"          to    be

a s sa u 1 ted.              y

One young man            came     up and asked me              if    I knew where         a particular               pub

was and         I said     I did       not.     He    replied        'You bastards          you    d o n ’t know

fuck      all'.

Another         Liverpool        fan a p p r o a c h e d myself         and a PC who was             s t a nding

next      to me and said            ’Do you         think    the     game will       be    played        today'’ .

I re pIi s d ’ I v e ry mu ch doubt                  it".

He   replied        ’Why    not,       they    did at H e y s e l ' .

During      the    time     that       I was    on duty at           these    gates       I myself        and

officers wit h me were                  s u b j e c t e d to a constant          flow of verbal                abuse.

            improper        to    react     in      any    other        way    as    many        of    the    fans    were    genuinely

            distressed           and     upset       by    what        they    had    e x p e r i e n c e d . But    more

            importantly           for    the     second         reason        that    it     would,          in    my opinion, have

            been       'very     d a n g e r o u s ’ to        have    reacted        in     any       other       wayother than          to

            ignore       t he    comments           and    accusations              levelled           at    us.

            At    approx.        5-15pm     we      were       joined     by    our     Sergeant             and    Inspector       and    our

            serial      was      reformed.           We    then        returned       to     our       Ford       Transit    van    and

            commenced           mobile    patrol          on    Penistone           Road.         We    then       returned    to

            Claywheels           Lane.     Food          was    provided        and     we       were       then    transported       back

            to    Thorne .

            At    no   time      during     this         incident        did    I myself              have    access    to    a radio.

            I    accept     that    even       if    I    had    had     access       to     a    radio       it    would    not    have

            served      any      real    purpose          in    t he    confusion          that        ensued       following       the

            events      which      took    place.

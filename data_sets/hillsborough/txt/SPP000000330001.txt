 This doc refers to a shot at 14.18.39 showing plenty of room in the pen (Twhich)
 I have not marked this section and so presumably did not think it relevant. I have not
 viewed this scene recently so do not know whether I would recognise it but even if I
 saw it I do not know whether I would remember whether I would have viewed it.

 It would seem from bottom of first sheet of Doc 110 that the camera was focused on
 the turnstiles and Leppings Lane This changes to Terraces on West Stand at
 15.02.53. Presumably this is the clip introduced by Sgt Killoch C539. I have had a
 copy supplied but unfortunately my copy does not track properly. I do not recollect h s r CM*i

   5. Notes of meeting of 19th July 1989, Paragraph 10 discusses the viewing of the
   video material by families so as to assure them no cover up. The matter had been
   approved by LJT, On the whole I did not favour the release of evidence prior to the
   hearing as thjjts not the common practice in coronal proceedings. It is not clear from
   these minutes Whether the videos were viewed.

   6. Note of meeting 191*1July 1989. Para 9 indicates that LJT allowed release of
\ statements representing the person who had made the statement. It is stated that this
 ^ can continue. Other statements to be considered on their merits. As stated I think I
   was against release of statements.

          Separate transparent folder for statement by Mr. Wardrope and letter o^JZS^ June

          Comment on Prof Ushers report
(> < &
          a. page 2 says Lee Nicholl as survived till 18th in fact according to inquest it was 17th

          b . p 4 and 5 describes various modes of asphyxia (suffocation, strangulation, chocking
          or transfixing chest).

          c. p 5 description of cyanosis says after 4- 6 minutes if victim struggling perhaps less
          brain cells cease to function, unconsciousness supervenes & ultimately vital centres in
          hind brain damaged and die. Note at inquests I seem to recollect that order was
          different with unconsciousness occurring much more quickly

           d. p 5 all but 9 death solely due to traumatic asphyxia.

          List the other cases where factors played a part One no 76 ruptured aorta. In 2 cases
          3 and 69 natural caused were significant contributory factor No 3,27,29,48,69,91,93,
          & 95 other factors but in 6 of these contributory factors due to chest neck or head
          injury.. .

also seemed to have at least some statements (seefor example Vol 70 P 60 copy
statement with Mr. King. I thought there was some discussion regarding this but not
yet found may be in vol 6-12. Not kept at local police station May be Fumival House.
Difficult to say what happened now. See misc list doc

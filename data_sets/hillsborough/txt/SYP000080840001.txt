             I am a single man living/ with my parents at the above address. I am a
                ^ a -T
             Liverpool F.C. Supporter and on Saturday 15th April 1989 I travelled

             in a coach with other members of the Cornwall Branch to the Supporters

             Club to the Liverpool v Nottingham Forest game at Hillsborough.

             When we arrived in Sheffeild there was some confusion over the tickets

             and we d i d n ’t actually leave the coach to go to the ground until just

             after 2.45pm.               We got outside the ground shortly afterwards.          We had

             tickets for the Leppings Lane standing.                     At this stage I was with
                                AA96
                       and
5.o£-
             Outside the ground there were no queues,                    just a m a s s of people outside

             the turnstile.               We intially stood at the back of this mass but then
L/w£
             other       people came behind and it built up until we were virtually                 in

             the middle of this mass.
                                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                                S2510

             The pressure around us at that time was nottoo bad and when we got

             near the turnstiles we saw that we were heading for V h e three                'A'

             turnstiles.     Our tickets were for turnstiles            ’B * a/nd we managed to

             push our way back to go around to that turnstile/                 We cou ld n’t get
                                    C*VT P01_JC£_       /¥T   L£jPP i            l Aa/'£:
             near turnstile     ’B * and a jflounted Police Officer told us that a gate

             had been opened and to A o         to around to the   bA   de.   As we went through
               CAT                 O
             the gates there was c u i i t e   a crush and I had to hold my hands up in the

             air to    stop myself falling on the person        in front.

             I have not been to Hillsborough before and I saw that most fans

             were   heading for a tunnel.         I was taken by the mass into the Ui nn e1

             and at    time there was no excessive       crush as such.However, \j/n the

             tunnel    I did lose contact with Scott.

           / When I got to the end of the tunnel         I think I went to the left             into

3 -0 . &    Pen 4.      Lee was still with me at that time.             The Pen was just one

             mass of people and with people still          coming/ in the tunnel from behind,

    / ^     we were     pushed forward.        This was about y or 4 minutes before the kick

             off.     In the Pen we were being squasheiy from the outset and we started

             looking for away out.          We coul dn’t get to the sides £nd we could n’t go

             back to the tunnel because of the pressure of people^/ We tried to

             edge ourselves forward and this is where          I got sejJerated from

             finished up about 4 or 5 feet from the fence.LH this position the

             pressure    increased and I saw them stop the /ame

             and can remember a line of Police Officers on the pitch.                 People were

             climbing out and at first the Police must have thought                it was a pitch

             invasion because they were trying to push them back.                 Wforen they

             realised what was happening they opened the gate and |/ried to get

             people out.      <3t 7 r m _   A=r                     f £/V(

             I reached a stage about 5 or 6 minutes after t h / ^ 4 m e           had stopped

             where although I was breathing I c ou ldn ’t take in any air because of

             the    pressure on my chest and I passed out. / All around me people were
                                                                                    PAGE    3

         in the same difficulty.           I saw a man afafout 10 feet off to my left and

         he had turned blue.         Also when I w a / coming down the terrace    I saw a

         man collasped and he was also bli             People were having to stand on

         top of him.      People knew he was the re but they ccKil dbn *t do anything

         about    it.   Some time afterwards      I came roundysmtside the tunnel    back

         near to the turnstiles where two lads were/looking after me and giving

                                                          and      and this was about 4.

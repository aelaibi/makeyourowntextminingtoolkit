This    duty       (PHASE        1)   concluded at 3pm or thereabouts,                                       whilst       on this

Phase     several          s u pporters were seen trying                                to swap tickets.                  One man

was    s ur r o u n d e d by about 6 s upporters                               on the      petrol      station

had quite a few fans                    from both sides wanting                               to   ’s w a p s ’ .     Two

I heard a m es s a g e            over my personal                            radio about a public                  house,       Notts.

outside     the      public           houses.

Shortly before 3pm                    1 heard a mess a g e                     to   close Leppings Lane,                    due to

volume     of people             outside                the turnstiles.                 The    rOad was            subsequently

closed     by o f f icers             on the actual                roundabout              duty.

About 3pm our serial,                     gathered on corner                        of Leppings Lane / together

a message          that        there was                crushing at the             gates and           could the           k i c k — of+

to be a ll ow ed to open the gate.                                 All          refused,       until      the       last message

for    our serial.

As a serial          we a tt e n d e d the gates and             I saw several          horses and a few

supporters,          some    100 at most.             We were     requested to          c o r d o n off the

front      of the e n t rances          to keep fans from the turnstiles.                         There were

quite a few Police O f f i c e r s                 there at this        time.

An a m b ulance was               called for,         to this         gate.     Upon its     arrival,          a

couple       of minu t e s     later,        the    driver and a t tendant           did not      seem to

know what was           happening,           stopping     on the       road outside.           Further         call

made     f o ^ a i T i b u l a n c e a nd 'it went    into the        entrance     to pos i ti on

KJL1 »       As the s u pporters             outside were        ext r e m e l y quiet       I turned to

w a t c h the ambulance.                I saw two      people     led      into the back        of    the

vehicle.

Anot h e r a m bu la nc e was           called and       I was    still       watching       ambulance         no.

1.    1 saw a y ou t h       carried         to the    rear     of this       vehicle,       thrown on the

floor and jumped upon.                    I thought       he was        fighting and was          being

restrained.           A mb ul a n c e    no.    2 attends       and     parks at KJLS.          The youth

was    then thrown          into the back of this                vehicle and         I saw 3 people

work i n g    on him,       trying      to save his         life.        I said to PC Welch,             standing

next     to me,      that    the you th was           dead.

Assis t a n c e was        then    called for         inside     the ground.,         1 was about 4 t h in

a line       of Police 2 or 3 deep and w a l k e d at the side                          of a m b u l a n c e       no.

2.     Nature       says    that you         look    inside,     which      I did and,        on turning

back,      I tripped.              I looked down and            saw a y outh laid dead at              the         side

of the a mb ul a n c e            no.   2.      Having gone           a r o u n d this one   I found that

there was anot h e r           laid to the front              of him.         As we went       into    the area

m a rk e d A/G      I h eard      people       s h o u t i n g “F U C K I N G BUSY'S ARE HERE,        W HERE THE

FUCK     YOU BEEN TIL L NOW",                and such     phrases.          I glanced ar o u n d and saw

quite a few          people       laid on the         ground,     some      being treated,           others

looked towards          the    ground      I saw P o l i c e m e n and supporters              running

ar o u nd on the field.              I. still     thought we'w e r e         heading       for a mass

fight    on the       grass.        We got to the           front     fence,       where    I saw 2 men

tieing       up a piece       of this fencing.               We made     our wa y to the No.              3 gate

a n d onto     the    field to my        right,        I heard sornone shout               for assistance,

I turned to see          several       men,      including Police,             passing a man through

anot h e r    hole    in the    fence.          I ran over        to them,         grabbed an arm and

helped       carry this       person onto the grass.                   Parked       in front    of the hole

in the fence was an ambulance.                        We     carried this man a r o u n d the              back

of this       vehicle.        I looked to see where                  this man       could be    laid and

saw bodies all a ro u n d the                  rear of the goal         area.        The only       clear area,

to the side          of the ambulance,            where       the goal       net back       post was

situated.        We    put the man on the               floor and       I started heart massage,

whilst       X believe    PC Knowles,            A1    or A3,     did mouth to mouth.                I was

also aware       of a no t h e r PC      checking           for a pulse.           We tried    to    revive

this man for          several       minutes,      w h e n we were       then joined          by a man          in

jumper and trousers,                who asked         the    c o ndition of the supporter and how

long we had been trying.                   When told he said             "LEAVE HIM".           We wrote

our numbers          on the mans       hand.          He wore a fawn and white                jumper and

was    heavily built.           We    pulled his            jumper    over    his head and went                back

to the fence,          where we grabbed another                   person being         carried over             the

wall.        On trying    to get this man               into a space          to    'work on',       we again

had to walk a r o u nd         the back         of the ambulance.              By this       time    the area

was    so crowded w ith bodies                 I had to stand on people                laid behind the

goal    mouth.        We bent       down to work            on this    person,       w hen we were            told

to    leave    it by the man          in the jumper            and trousers,          whom    I believed

was a Doctor.

I was then told to stand                 in the terrace w ith other Officers.                             I

looked a r o un d but         could not find any of my serial.                         I left       the
                                                                                                      PAGE

terrace and w a lk ed            onto the field.             I was shouted at by groups                   of

fans,     who        blamed me     personally for opening                the gate.        Several    youths

w a l ke d to rne and          showed me tickets            that   had not been       checked.

O B VI OU S L Y these were          the    people    pushing at the gates             before the game

started,        but     I said nothing as they were a l r e a d y               in fighting mood.

I did find mys e l f argu i n g at one                 stage with a youth.                He was w ith two

or three        others.        He was shouting about               the    line of Police across                 the

halfway       line and the          fact that s u p p o r t e r s were       carrying       dead to the

gym.       The y ou th was         ushered away by an older man,                   still    a Liverpool

supporter.              Iwas     then aware        that   I had become       the    centre    of

a t t r a c t i o n for about      a dozen supporters,             some trying       to    cairn     the

situation,            others     shouting.         1 then felt a push          in the      back,     I turned

to find PC M c F a r l an e and another,                  unknown,       officer    stood by rny side.

We then w it h d r e w         from the     confrontation.

A S up e r i n t e n d e n t was    now walking a r o u n d the field,              asking O f f icers           to

try to clear            the    field   if we       could,    without      incident.        Anyone     not

w an t i n g to       leave    should be just         left.        We did this      duty until        the

messag e       over     the speakers         said the        game was      postponed and would

s up p o r t e r s    leave    the stadium         in an orderly manner.             Together with

PC.-McFar l a n e , left          the ground via L e p p i n g s Lane and w a l k e d              back    to

the    roundabout         for Phase 3.

Some     two or three minu t e s            later we were           joined   by PS A s h t o n and the

remainder            of the Serial.

The Manger             of "The Owl'       Service S ta t i o n opened        his doors       for

s u pporters           to call    home and we a s s i s t e d him to          keep order       in and

a r ou nd the Station.

On    compl e t i o n of the        fans    leaving       the    stadium we a t t e n d e d ClayW h e e l s

           ACCOUNT OF HILLSBOROUGH INCIDENT SATURDAY 15 APRIL 1989


PC 243 LANDERS, A2 Sub-Division, Rossington.


I was in Sector 30 with PS 2627 Ashton (Rossington), PC 174 Welch
(Rossington), PC 1417 McDonnell (Edlington), PC 2905 Greatorex (Thorne),
PC 2804 McFarlane (Thorne), PC 2967 Frost (Armthorpe) and two others.

8 am
I commenced duty at my home station, being the Rossington Community
Constable. I carry my own personal radio.

8.45 am
DHQ Doncaster, parade and transport to Sheffield.

9.45 am
Hillsborough, North Stand briefing, followed by meal.

11.15 am

Leppings Lane/Pennistone Road North Roundabout.
Informed by PS Ashton that duties consists of standing with PC's Welch,
Greatorex and McFarlane, outside 'The Owl' Service Station on Pennistone
Road North, near to the roundabout. The aim was to stop Liverpool
supporters walking along this road to the Nottingham supporters and vice
versa.
We found that there were lots of supporters walking along this road, which
we believed would be 'barren' Liverpool supporters, arriving by bus from
the City, arriving presumably near to the Notts Fans and making their way
to Leppings Lane. Notts Fans arriving from the North, parking with Liver­
pool fans and making their way to their respective stands.
This duty (Phase 1) concluded at 3 pm or thereabouts, whilst on this Phase
several supporters were seen trying to swap tickets. One man was surrounded
by about 6 supporters on the petrol station forecourt. Together with another
Officer we attended in case of trouble and found a man selling a ticket
for £35. The ticket sold, the people parted company. Being at this location
we had quite a few fans from both sides wanting 'swaps.' Two vehicles,
one a dark Ford Granada Mk 2 and I believe a Capri, stopped and asked for
the location of a pub, which I was told was towards Wadsley Bridge on the
right. The men said that they were meeting someone with tickets.

I also saw several fans, mainly 18-30 years, carrying 4-packs of beer/lager
and drinking whilst walking towards the ground.

I heard a message over my personal radio about a public house, Notts Forest
side, being wrecked and assistance called, which was dealt with and calls
to two separate pubs to do with supporters drinking outside the public houses.
Shortly before 3 pm I heard a message to close Leppings Lane, due to volume
of people outside the turnstyles. The road was subsequently closed by Officers
on the actual roundabout duty.
About 3 pm our serial, gathered on corner of Leppings Lane, together with
other serials under the same command. About this time I heard a message
that there was crushing at the gates and could the kick-off be delayed i
hour - refused to delay game. Over next few minutes several messages from,
I believe a Superintendent, were made to be allowed to open the gate. All
refused, until the last message that was 'IF WE DON'T GET THESE GATES OPEN
SOMEONE WILL GET KILLED,' reply, "IF THERE'S DANGER TO LIFE OPEN THE GATES."
It was obvious that something was wrong at these gates and our Inspector
decided to attend the ground, bringing into effect Phase 2 for our serial.

As a serial we attended the gates and I saw several horses and a few supporters
some 100 at most. We were requested to cordon off the front of the entrances
to keep fans from the turnstyles. There were quite a few Police Officers
there at this time.

An Ambulance was called for, to this gate. Upon its arrival, a couple of
minutes later, the driver and attendant did not seem to know what was
happening, stopping on the road outside. Further call made for Ambulance
and it went into the entrance to position marked KJL1. As the supporters
outside were extremely quiet I turned to watch the Ambulance. I saw two
people led into the back of the vehicle.

Another Ambulance was called and I was still watching Ambulance No. 1.
I saw a youth carried to the rear of this vehicle, thrown on the floor and
jumped upon. I thought he was fighting and was being restrained.
Ambulance No. 2 attends & parks at KJL2. The youth was then thrown into
the back of this vehicle and I saw 3 people working on him, trying to save
his life. I said to PC Welch, standing next to me, that the youth was dead.

Assistance was then called for inside the ground. I was about 4th in a
line of Police 2 or 3 deep and walked at the side of Ambulance No. 2. Nature
says that you look inside, which I did and, on turning back, I tripped.
I looked down and saw a youth laid dead at the side of the Ambulance No.
2. Having gone around this one I found that there was another laid to the
front of him. As we went into the area marked A/G, I heard people shouting,
"FUCKING BUSY'S ARE HERE, WHERE THE FUCK YOU BEEN TILL NOW," and such phrases.
I glanced around and saw quite a few people laid on the ground, some being
treated, others obviously dead. I followed my serial member through the
tunel onto the No.3 terrace. We walked along the fence between 3 & 4. As
I looked towards the ground I saw Policemen and supporters running around
on the field. I still thought we were heading for a mass fight on the grass.
We got to the front fence, where I saw 2 men tieing up a piece of this
fencing. We made our way to the No. 3 gate and onto the field to my right,
I heard someone shout for assistance, I turned to see several men, including
Police, passing a man through another hole int he fence. I ran over to
them, grabbed an arm and helped carry this person onto the grass. Parked
in front of the hole in the fence was an Ambulance. We carried this man
around the back of this vehicle. I looked to see where this man could be
laid and saw bodies all around the rear of the goal area. The only clear
area to the side of the Ambulance, where the goal net back post was
situated. We put the man on the floor and I started heart massage, whilst
I believe PC Knowles, A1 or A3, did mouth to mouth. I was also aware of
another PC checking for a pulse. We tried to revive this man for several
minutes, when we were then joined by a man in jumper and trousers, who asked
the condition of the supporer and how long we had been trying. When told
he said, "LEAVE HIM." We wrote our numbers on the mans hand. He wore a
fawn and white jumper and was heavily built. We pulled his jumper over
his head and went back to the fence, where we grabbed another person being
carried over the wall. On trying to get this man into a space to 'work
on,' we again had to walk around the back of the Ambulance. By this time
the area was so crowded with bodies I had to stand on people laid behind
the goal mouth. We bent down to work on this person, when we were told
to leave it by the man in the jumper and trousers, whom I believed was a
Doctor.

I was then told to stand in the terrace with other Officers. I looked around
but could not find any of my serial. I left the terrace and walked onto
the field. I was shouted at by groups of fans, who blamed me personally
for opening the gate. Several youths walked to me and showed me tickets
that had not been checked. Obviously these were the people pushing at the
gates before the game started, but I said nothing as they were already in
fighting mood.

I did find myself arguing at one stage with a youth. He was with two or
three others. He was shouting about the line of Police across the halfway
line and the fact that supporters were carrying dead to the gym. The youth
was ushered away by an older man, still a Liverpool supporter. I was then
aware that I had become the centre of attraction for about a dozen supporters,
some trying to calm the situation, others shouting. I then felt a push
in the back, I turned to find PC McFarlane and another, unknown, Officer
stood by my side. We then withdrew from the confrontation.

A Superintendent was now walking around the field, asking Officers to try
to clear the field if we could, without incident. Anyone not wanting to
leave should be just left. We did this duty until the message over the
speakers said the game was postponed and would supporters leave the stadium
in an orderly manner. Together with PC McFarlane, left the ground via
Leppings Lane and walked back to the roundabout for Phase 3-

Some two or three minutes later we were joined by PS Ashton and the
remainder of the Serial.

The Manager of 'The Owl' Service Station opened his doors for supporters
to call home and we assisted him to keep order in and around the Station.

On completion of the fans leaving the stadium we attended Claywheels Lane
and awaited transportation home to Division.

7.30 pm
Doncaster Divisional Headquarters.

8 pm
Off-duty home station.

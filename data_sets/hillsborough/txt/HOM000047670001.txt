S W 1H 9A T                                         Date:         13 November 1997




W e have received requests from:
  (i) |                 j mother of the late Steven Joseph Robinson (Body File No 28), and
  (ii)                  mother of the late Lee Nichol (Body File No 95)
for copies of the bodies files to be released to their legal representatives, Ms A M Adlington,
Solicitor to the Hillsborough Family Support Group.

I have responded to both the above explaining that the files are with Lord Justice Stuart Smith
and that I will comply with their request once the file is returned.

Would it be possible for the scrutiny team to examine the two files at their earliest opportunity so
that they can be returned ahead of the bulk of the files that we supplied to you?. Can you also
please provide me with an estimated date of when the two files are likely to be available.

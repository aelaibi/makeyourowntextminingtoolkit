               2.20 pm. I then carried out a stationary duty outside the Leppings Lane
               end, on both sides of Leppings Lane where                                              alon« with other officer
               were concerned with public order and directing' supporters to the turnstyles.
               Although the majority of supporters were drinking alcohol from cans as they
               waited to enter the stand they were fairly well behaved*
               At 2.50 pm there appeared to be a sudden influx of Liverpool supporters

          into Leppings Lane. Many of the supporters who were now entering Leppings
        Lane     were intoxicated and were in much more of a panic to get into the
          ground# Myself and other officers became heavily involved in holding
          back large numbers of supporters who were desperately pushing to get to
          the tumsyle area. With the aid of a Police Vehicle with a Public Address
          System attached fans were continually being requested to hold bac£ and
          refrain from pushing* It was at this time that I found myself being pushed
          along with the crowd towards the Leppings Lane end tumsyle s.
          At approximately           pm, I heard a message over my personal radio to the
          effect of all personnel to go to the pitch and I went along with other
          officers along a tunnel which within a minute brought us onto the pitch
          near the Leppings Lane end. On entering the pitch I first saw some fans
          wandering into the goal area of the pitch and I first thought it was a
          pitch invasion which I have seen ocurr in the past. As I ran towards the
          goal area I soon realised that supporters were being crushed against the
          fences in fuont of the stands. Police Officers were frantically trying
          to pull fans onto the pitch to safety and within seconds fans were being
          brought out onto the pitch, I then became involved in giving heart massage
          and mouth to mouth resusitation to supporters who had stopped breathing.
           I completely lost track of time as I became involved with the attempts
          of saving the supporters.

E N D OF    REPORT
    PC 3291 SCHOFIELD   MAIN STREET POLICE STATION


    F •A . CUP SEMI FINAL HILLSBOROUGH - 1988




    In 1988 I was on duty at the Semi Final at Hillsborough

    stadium.

    After a morning briefing held at the ground,     I walked with

    other members of my Serial to Middlewood Road in the area

    approximately | of a mile away from the ground near to

    Middlewood Hospital and Wing Gardens housing estate.

    I patrolled this section of road along with other officers

    for the remainder of the morning and again during the

    afternoon after a lunch break at Claywheels Lane.      I patrolled

    that section of Middlewood before,   during and after the match.

    I recall that although busy with traffic,   that particular

    section of Middlewood Road was fairly quiet with very few

    football supporters on foot at this location.      No incidents

    occurred that I can bring to mind.

    After the match I remember the road again being very busy

    as supporters were on their way out of Hillsborough.      I

    do not remember which particular football team were

    travelling out on that section of Middlewood Road, but all

    supporters were in high spirits and no incidents took place.

           Dear Sir,

           Hillsborough - Superintendent R. Marshall

           Since I wrote to you yesterday, events have moved very quickly.

           1 can appreciate that the enquiry team wishes to make speedy
           progress and Superintendent Marshall has therefore agreed to try
           to complete his interview on Tuesday next the 19th inst.

          At the same iinn-, i understand that the Chief Constable does not
          wish to send my letters to the complainants * solicitors but would
          prefer to let me have their names and addresses so that I can
          contact them direct.

          Obviously, it will not be possible to obtain their considered
          response before the 19th and it will therefore be necessary to
          reverse the order in which I had hoped to proceed and deal with
          the criminal investigation first, followed by the complaints
          procedure. It is also obvious that, as the interim report of Mr
          Justice Taylor has already placed blame on the police and
          stigmatized senior officers as evasive and defensive, any finding
          that there is insufficient evidence for criminal charges would
          be bound to provoke a hostile reaction front the complainants and
          would have to be justified.

          1 therefore believe that the pressure on the Director of Public
          Prosecutions to follow the interim report will be very great. I
          do not doubt that his office requires him to be able to
          withstand that pressure and make an objective decision but the
          circumstances are unusual. There has already been a 'trial' -
          albeit a trial at which Superintendent Marshall was not cautioned
          or separately represented - which has in the eyes of the
          complainants found the police guilty and the fans completely
          innocent of any part in the deaths. Although rare, there have
          been enough cases of injustice apparently being done in the name
          of the law to make me very cautious indeed of taking anything for
          granted.

          1 am prepared to advise Superintendent Marshall to answer
          questions and assist the present enquiry on the 19th inst provided
          I can be assured that the evidence to which I refer in paragraph 7
          of my main letter of 6th June is before the Director and that he
          will be taking it into account when reaching his decision.
          However, a sinple assurance would not be sufficient, as there is
          so much room for misunderstanding and error. For example, it
          could be said afterwards that of the three thousand or so
          statements, most related to acts on the ground after the tragedy
          occurred and are relevant only to the rescue services and
          facilities at the ground.
Would it be possible to say that there is a substantial body of
evidence on file from householders, shopkeepers and licensees in
the vicinity of the ground relating to the behaviour of fans in
the hour or two before the match right up to 3.0 pm    and   to
acknowledge that most of that evidence was not made public at
the Taylor Enquiry. I assume that the Director had no
responsibility for selecting the evidence placed before the
Enquiry and will be able to say that the purposes of that enquiry
were different from the present enquiry and that the evidence may
well have been selected with different criteria in mind.

The only alternative, if the enquiry is to proceed on the 19th
inst, is for Superintendent Marshall himself, as a prelude to
answering any questions, to refer to that large body of evidence
as a factor which has not been taken into account previously and
to make it clear that whatever actions he took on the day were
taken in the face of a hostile crowd substantially affected by
drink and not in respect of a well-behaved and orderly crowd as
implied in the interim report. Unless this aspect is made clear,
any rejection of the solutions implied by the complaints cannot
properly be understood.  I simply cannot advise Superintendent
Marshall to answer questions on the assumption that he was dealing
with a crowd whose condition and behaviour were as described or
implied in the interim report.

It then remains to be seen whether any dialogue with the
complainants' solicitors will be fruitful. Unless agreement can
be reached, there is bound to be a furore whichever way the
Director decides.  If he decides that a prosecution is unlikely
to succeed before a jury, there is little doubt that the
complainants will arouse the media once again with their partisan
view.

If the Director in effect supports the interim report, I regret
that we shall be unable to let the matter rest. There is so much
feeling locally that the police had a raw deal that I anticipate
substantial public interest which will support the police and will
not be in the complainants' interests.

I myself would much prefer to try to reach an accord in advance
with the complainants which would avoid the worst excesses of
mutual recrimination. If that is not to be, we shall have to take
events as they arise.

Yours
VINCENr

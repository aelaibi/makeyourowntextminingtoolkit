                    You   very kindly sent    a detailed reply to the
              representations  which I forwarded to you from Mr Anthony
              Redmond of   the South Manchester Accident and Rescue Team
              following  their  involvement  in both   the Armenian  and
              Lockerbie disasters.

                    Mr Redmond was enormously appreciative of the trouble
              which you took in replying and has asked me to place before
              you his representations and further suggestions arising out
              of recent discussions, with which he has been involved, of
              the Casualty Surgeons Association (CSA).

                     As you will see Mr Redmond has taken the    initiative
              in securing    the support of Rotary International   for the
              funding of an office equipped with computer records of the
              location   of  24 hour availability of   all the necessary
              skills   and equipment that might be required,   to provide a
              short-notice response by trained medical and surgical teams
              to meet local and international disasters.     They are most
              anxious   that this initiative should have your blessing and
              support.

          Thankyou for send In?' me a copy of the letter from the Prime Minister.            I’a
          not sure where it leaves us, but i wouid like to address soree of the points
          she raises and hope thor,..- can be passed on to her. The annual general

          disasters yave apresentation.'          I have includedtheir remarks    where
          relevant.

           With re^aids tc> oversea:;. disasters and self sufficiency, 'International
           1'escue and i.hn Fire* f.«rj;--;ade were scif sufficient. However they went
           independantTv of each or.her and us, duplicating their supplies while we had
          •none. A spa Li amount ct cornjininiea.tjorj between thf services is all that is
           required and I as willing to develop the process.<vide infra).

          When discussing disasters at hnnio she quit..-- rijhtiy emphasises the
          importance of the loea'j response.. However, if wo rei.y on this a'ione we

          Ky third point is tnar if wc rc-3y ^siely on the local response wc assume
          that the local lire, police , ambulance ana medical .services are uninjured
          ar.d unaffected by the disaster.      Vhen a large scale disaster occurs this is
          unlikely to be true. The death ir. the earthquake of those responsible
          locally for disaster management was a major cause of the problems in co­
          ordinating. T.he rer-nonsp 'tc. the Armenian earthquake snd if anything remotely
          similar happ-iued b^r^ nur total rel lance on a local response could load to
          a serious dolav in mnbi.iising help.

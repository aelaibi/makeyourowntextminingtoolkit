                 OUTSIDE THE GROUND IT WAS ABSOLUTE CHAOS. THERE WERE NO

                 NOTHING REALLY. AT THE TURNSTILES THERE WERE NO QUEUES.THERE WERE
                 PEOPLE JUMPING OVER THE WALL INTO THE GROUND.I SAW THE CONCERTINA

MIDDLE WAS FULL IT WAS TERRIBLE. AT THE KICK OFF THERE WAS A SUDDEN SURGE AND
MORE FANS CAME PUSHING INTO THEGOUND. BECAUSE OF THE FENCES AT THE SIDES
THERE WAS NOWHERE FOR THE FANS TO GO. THERE WERE PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE
FENCES INTO THE POLICE BUT THEY WERE JUST THROWN BACK INTO THE STAND. YOU
COULD HEAR PEOPLE IN THE STANDS      SHOUTING FRO THE POLICE TO OPEN THE GATES AT
THE FRONT. I THINK THE FRONT GATES WAS OPENED AT ABOUT 1515HRS. THIS CAUSED
MORE PANIC PEOPLE WERE JUST CLIMBING OVER EACH OTHER TO GET OUT. I SAW BODIES
B E m g CARRIED OUT & POLICE AT AMBULANCE MAN PUMPING THEIR CHESTS. ABOUT
1 5 ® R S I SAW ABOUT 4 BODIES PLACES ON THE PITCH JUST TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE
OF THE GOAL, I KNOW THAT ONE WAS A GIRL, AND THEY COVERED THE FACES UP BY
PULLING THEIR CLOTHES OVER THEIR FACES.
THIS IS WHEN I LEFT THE GROUND.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH ft OTHER P’  ROPT.’

WHEN WE FIRST ARRIVED AT THE GROUND THERE WAS A RUMOUR THAT THE MATCH HAD BE
DELAYED FOR 30MINS. SO WHEN THE MATCH KICK OFF ON TIME THERE WAS A PANIC TO
GET INTO THE GROUND.
THE POLICING OF THE MATCH WAS BAD THIS YEAR, LAST YEAR IT WAS MUCH BETTER.

                 AND STARTED TO QUEUE FOR A TURNSTILE, AT THIS STAGE I REALISED I
                 WAS IN THE WRONG QUEUE, THERE WAS A 12 FT WALL DIVIDING THE TWO
                 TURNSTILES, I CLIMBED OVER THE WALL. ON TOP OF THIS WALL WAS A

PEOPLE TO CLIMB OVER THE WALL. AFTER I HAD CLIMBED OVER THE WALL I SAW THAT
THE BLUE GATES BEHIND ME LEADING TO THE TURNSTILE THAT I WANTED WERE CLOSED.
THE CONCERTINA GATES WERE THEN OPENED AND EVERYBODY WENT FORWARD, I WENT
THROUGH AS I DID SO I WAS AT FIRST UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE GATES WERE
LEADING TO THE TURNSTILES BUT I SOON REALISED THAT I WAS INSIDE THE GROUND,
NOBODY TOOK MY TICKET FROM ME I STILL HAVE IT. IT WA ABOUT 2.55PM WHEN I WAS
GOING DOWN THE TUNNEL, IT WAS REALLY PACKED, LOADS OF PEOPLE WERE GETTING
INJURED IN THE TUNNEL, THERE WERE NO POLICE OR STEWARDS DIRECTING PEOPLE SO
EtJKYBODY WAS GOING DOWN THE TUNNEL.WHEN I REACHED THE TERRACING IT WAS
p JIKED FULL I WAS FORCED BY THE CROWD TO THE FRONT OF THE TERRACING, I WAS
PHYSICALLY TRAPPED, I WAS JUST CRUSHED. AFTER A SHORT WHILE I PASSED OUT WHEN
I CAME ROUND I WAS STILLIN THE SAME POSITION, ALTHOUGH I WAS EVEN NEARER TO
THE FENCE. MYSELF AND OTHERS WERE SHOUTING AT THE POLICE TO OPEN THE GATE BUT
THEY JUST DIDNT SEEM TO DO ANYTHING.I COULD SEE THAT PEOPLE IN FRONT OF ME
WERE DEAD, I DECIDED TO CLIMB OVER THE FRONT FENCING , IN DOING SO I HAD TO
CLIMB OVER SOME OF THE BODIES AS I REACHED THE FENCE A POLICEMAN SAID" YOU'RE
FUCKING CLIMBING OVER PEOPLE, GET BACK" AND I WAS PUSHED BACK. I EVENTUALLY
CLIMBED TO SAFETY.

2. COUSIN;                                                WIRRAL, CHESHIRE

I DON'T KNOW THE OTHERS, BUT MY FRIENDS AND RELATIVES DO.

WE MOVED ROUND TOWARDS THE BIG CORRUGATED GATES AND THERE WERE POLICEMEN IN
FRONT OF THESE GATES SO WE CLIMBED A METRE HIGH RAILING FENCE TO GET TO THE
T«ISTILES.    WE GOT CARRIED THROUGH THE TURNSTILES WITH THE CROWD, IT TOOK 5
0 * 0 MINUTES. WE WENT ROUND THE BACK OF THE WEST STAND TERRACES AND GOT A
BURGER, THEN WE GOT ONTO THE TERRACES FROM THE WINGS BY THE SOUTH STAND AND
MOVED TOWARDS THE MIDDLE ABOUT 30 YDS FROM THE GOAL POST. THIS WAS A COUPLE
OF MINUTES BEFORE KICK OFF.
WE COULD HEAR SHOUTING AND SAW THE PUSH FORWARD AS ALL THE FANS RUSHED
THROUGH THE BIG GATES AND PUSHED FORWARD, AND WE MOVED BACK INTO THE CORNER
IN THE WINGS.
THERE WAS PLENTY OF SPACE IN THE TERRACES IN THE WINGS, SO MUCH THAT WE GOULET
SIT DOWN. WE COULD SEE ALL THE PEOPLE IN THE MIDDLE BEING PULLED OUT INTO THE
NEXT PENS AND ONTO THE PITCH.

THROUGH. A MOUNTED OFFICER MOVED US ALL AWAY FROM THE GATES, WE WERE NEAREST
PEOPLE TO THE GATES. A POLICEMAN OPENED THE GATES AND TOLD EVERYONE TO GO
THROUGH. THERE WAS NO ORGANISATION OUTSIDE AND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE
POLICE PRESENCE AND SOME ORDERLY QUEUES. I HAD A TICKET BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE
DIDNT AND WERE CLIMBING OVER THE WALLS. EVERYONE WAS ASKING FOR TKTS NEAR THE
TURNSTILES BUT THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE GOT THAT FAR. I HAD TIME TO GO TO THE
TOILET WHEN I FIRST GOT THROUGH THE GATES. THE OLY PLACE I COULD GO WAS UNDER
THE TUNNEL BECAUSE THEIS IS THE ONLY WAY I KNOE. THERE WERE NO STEWARDS
GIVING US DIRECTIONS AND THERE WAS NO ORDER. PEOPLE WERE EVEN URINATING IN
TH®&ROUND. THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONAL SIGNS AT ALL. WHEN I WAS THROUGH THE
TUNNEL AND WITH ALL THE CROWDS COMING IN I WAS SWEPT ALONG TO PEN B. WHEN I
WAS IN THEPEN IT WAS SO FULL AND CRAMPED AND I COULDNT MOVE BECAUSE THERE
WAS SO MUCH PRESSURE FROM BEHIND WITH THE PEOPLE COMING IN. I WANTED TO GO
RIGHT BUT MY BODY WAS BEING CRUSHED AND I COULDNT MOVE. PEOPLE WERE SHOUTING
FOR THE POLICE AND WHEN THEY WERE TRYING TO GET OVER THE FENCE POLICE WERE
PUSHING THEM BACK. BY THIS TIME I LOST MY BALANCE AND AT ONE STAGE MY MFEET
WERENT TOUCHING THE GROUND. IT TOOK ME TEN MINUTES TO FALL OVER. I ENDED UP
ON THE FLOOR, ONCE I FELL,PEOPLE FELL ON TOP OF ME, I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY
IN BREATHING. I WAS ON THE FLOOR FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND EVENTUALLY THE
PERSON ON TOP OF ME WAS LIFTED UP AND SOMEONE HELPED ME UP. I LOOKED AT THE
PITCH AND THE PITCH WAS FULL OF PEOPLE. I WAS PASSES ON TO THE PITCH. MY LEG
WAS HUTING. I OBTAINED BRUISED RIBS AND THE CALF MUSCLE IN MY RIGHT LEG WAS
CRUSHED.
               THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE POLICE OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE GROUND
AND I DID NOT SEE ANY STEWARDS THERE REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE.

             I LEFT THE PUB ABOUT 1400 HOURS AND ARRIVED AT THE GROUND AT
             ABOUT 1445 HRS,     THERE WAS A COUPLE OF POLICE HORSES ABOUT, BUT
             THE CROWD WAS JUST A MASS, NO     ORDER TO IT, I WAS SCREAMING FOR
             THE GATES TO BE OPENED, LADS WERE FAINTING, WE GOT INSIDE.   THEN
             THE GATE WAS OPENED, I THOUGHT IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO ATTHE
             TIME.   I WANT TO GET INVOLVED IN THIS ENQUIRY, IT IS THE BEST
             THING TO DO.

             LANE END IT WAS TERRIBLE. THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE THERE. I GO
             THERE A LOT AND ITS THE WORST IVE EVER SEEN IT. WHEN I GOT NEAR
             THE OUTSIDE GATES PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED AGAINST WALLS, PEOPLE
             WERE SCREAMING AND TRYING TO GET INTO THE ENTRANCE. THERE WERE

OUTSIDE THE GROUND AND I WENT UP TO ONE OF THEM AND LITERALLY BEGGED HIM TO
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SITUATION BECAUSE IT PEOPLE WERE OBVIOUSLY IN PAIN AND
PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE OUTSIDE WALLS EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD TKTS. I
NEARLY GOT INTO THE GROUND ONCE BUT WAS PUSHED BACK OUT AGAIN. I WILL NEVER
FORGET THE MOUNTED OFFICER HE HAD A BIG BLACK MOUSTAUSHE. HE WENT INTO THE
CROWD AND TOLD A COLLEGUE TO FOLLOW HIM WHICH HE DID. SOMEONE HAD THEIR TOE
TRODDEN ON BY A HORSE. WHEN I EVENTUALLY GOT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE I WAS
REALLY ANGRY BECAUSE I SAW SIX POLICE OFFICERS STANDING THERE INSIDE DOING
NQjfclNG. I WAS REALLY MAD AND I SAID TO THEM WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU ARE DOING
TjS toE IS UTTER CHAOS OUT THERE, GET OUTSIDE AND EARN YOUR MONEY. ONE ACTUALLY
LAUGHED AT ME AND THE UNIFORMED INSPECTOR MADE THEM ALL GO OUTSIDE. WHEN I
GOT THROUGH THE TUNNEL I WAS PUSHED INTO PEN B I TRIED TO GET OUT BECAUSE IT
WAS SO PACKED BUT I COULDNT MOVE. A LITTLE BOY WAS OBVIOUSLY IN PAIN AND KEPT
ON SAYING TO ME, "HELP ME PLEASE MISTER, DONT LET ME D I E "I TRIED TO HELP HIM
BUT HE WAS LOST IN THE CROWD, I DONT KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM. I DONT EVEN
KNOW WHETHER HE IS DEAD OR ALIVE. THERE WAS A BARRIER INTO ONE OF THE OTHER
PENS WHICH I CLIMBED IN ORDER TO REACH THE OPEN GATE ONTO THE PITCH, WHEN I
HAD CLIMBED THE BARRIER I HELP A LOT MORE PEOPLE OVER WHO WERE ALSO IN A BAD
WAY. ONE YOUNG TEENAGE LAD WAS PASSED OVER TO ME UNCONCIOUS. WHEN I GOT TO
THE PITCH I JUST COLLAPSED WITH EXAUSTION AND A POLICEMAN CAME OVER TO ME AND
ASKED ME IF I WAS ALRIGHT. I SAID I WAS BUT JUST WANTED TO BE LEFT ALONE. AT
THE FRONT FENCE WHEN IT FIRST ALL HAPPENED THERE WAS ONLY ONE POLICEWOMAN ALL
ALONE WHO JUST KEPT ON TELLING PEOPLE TO PUSH BACKWARDS. IT WAS A WHILE
BEFORE SHE WAS JOINED BY ANY OF HER COLLEGUES.THERE WAS ABSOLUTELY NO
O RG A N I S A T I O N AT THIS MATCH. THERE WERE NO STEWARDS AND NO SIGNS TO DIRECT
PEOPLE WHO WERE NEW TO THE GROUND. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CROWD CONTROL
BY THE POLICE AND THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOME STEWARDS IN THE GROUND.



STATES HE WILL BE WILLING TO MAKE A STATEMENT TO POLICE AT ANY TIME.

<< WHO_WITH       >>

WHEN I HAD BEEN PUSHED TO THE FRONT OF THE PEN IT BECAME REALLY CHAOTIC IN
THERE SO I JUST TRIED TO GET OUT OF THE PEN BUT I COULDNT MOVE. EVENTUALLY I
FELL TO THE FLOOR AND I LANDED ON ANOTHER MAN WHO WAS JUST LYING THERE STILL,
I THINK HE WAS DEAD. WHILE I WAS ON TOP OF THIS MAN PEOPLE WERE TREADING ON
MY LEGS AND ON MY BACK. I THINK I MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE FLOOR FOR ABOUT 20
SECONDS THEN A MAN PICKED ME U P .I HAD BRUISING TO MY LEGS BUT I DID NOT NEED
ANY TREATMENT. ONE SMALL GATE WAS OPENED IN THE PEN BUT POLICE ,OFFICERS WERE
JUST TELLING EVERYONE TO PUSH BACKWARDS AND THEY WOULD NOT LET ANYONE OUT. I
DQflK THINK THEY REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. I SAW PEOPLE TRYING TO CLIMB THE
Fk W t FENCE AND PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO LEAVE THE REAR OF THE PEN. AT ABOUT
0305HRS THE GAME WAS STOPPED. I DID NOT SEE ONE STEWARD IN THE GROUND BUT I
FEEL THAT HAD THERE BEEN SOME IT WOULD HAVE HELPED BECAUSE AS IT WAS NOBODY
WAS BEING DIERECTED AND THERE WERE NO DIRECTIONAL SIGNS. THERE WERE TWO OF MY
FRIENDS WITH ME AT THE FOOTBALL MATCH, THEY WERE:

 ...PUUSHED AGAINST. BETWEEN THE GGATES AND THE TURNSTYLE WAS ANOTHER LARGE
CROWD WHICH WAS JUST AS BAD. ONCE THAT HAD EASED OFF THE PARK GATES WERE
OPENED AND WE WENT THRU, BUT THERE WAS STILL A CROWD OF FANS FROM BEHIND, I
FELT A TAP ON MY SHOULDER, IT WAS A POLICE OFFICER WHO INFORMED ME THAT A
GATE WAS BEING OPENED AND THAT IT WAS QUICKER. I WENT THRU THE GATE AND NO
ONE ASKED ME FOR MY TICKET.        THE FIRST THINGGI SAW WAS THE TUNNEL INTO THE
GROUND. I WALKED TOWARDS IT        AND REMEMBER LAST YEAR THAT IT FULL, SO I CHANGED
MY MIND AND FOUND ANOTHER WAY INTO THE GROUND. THIS WAS PEN 4, WHICH WAS
0 M | THREE QUARTERS FULL. SOON AFTER KICK OFF I SAW FANS CLIMBING OVER THE
G i R TO GET OUT OF PEN 3. THIS CONTINUED AND THE POLICE SEEMED UNAWARE AS TO
WHAT WAS HAPPENING. A FAN RAN ON THE PITCH AND ALERTED THE REFERREE. WHEN THE
MATCH WAS STOPED IT WAS LIKE A CASCADE OF PEOPLE COMING OVER THE FENCE. I SAW
MORE FANS RIPPING DOWN THE PERIIMETER BARRIER, THEY WERE ON THE PIT5CH,
TRYING TO GET FANS OUT. THEN THEY WERE RIPPING UP THE BOARDS TO MAKE
STRETCHERS. AN AMBULANCE ARRIVED BUT IT WAS UTTER MAYHEM.THERE WAS AN OPEN
GATE AT PEN 4, WHICH FANS WERE USING,BUT ONCE THE TROUBLE OCCURED THE POLICE
CLOSED IT, THERE WERE NO ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR ABOUT THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR
THAT I COULD HEEAR. THE FIRST PERSON I HEARD WAS KENNY DALGISH, AND HE SEEMED
TO BE SHOUTING. THERE WERE A LOT OF BODIES ON THE PITCH AND WERE HEARD THAT
THE GAME WAS ABANDONED. I WAS ONE OF THE LAST TO LEAVE THE GROUND. ONE OF MY
PARTY WAS MISSING BUTT LUCKLEY WE FOUND HIM SAFE AND WELL.
I NOTICED THAT THERE WERE VERY FEW STEWARDS INSIDE THE GROUND TO HELP OR
DIRECT FANS. WE WERE STOPPED ABOUT 800 YRDS AND SEARCHED FOR ALCOHOL, BUT NOT
FOR TICKETS. WHEN THERE WAS A CRUSH WHY D I D N ’T THEY PUT THE GAME    BACK. WHEN
THERE WAS TROUBLE WHY W E R E N ’T THE POLICE MORE HELPFUL. LIVERPOOL FANS WERE
GIVEN INADEQUATE AMOUNT OF TICKETS. THERE WAS THE SAME PROBLEMS LAST YEAR
THAT W E R E N ’T TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR THIS YEAR. IT HAS BEEN STATED THAT THE
FANS HAD NO TICKETS, HOW DO THEY KNOW WHEN THE MAJORITY OF FANS WENT H 9ME
WITH THEIRS AS I AND MY FRIEND HAVE THEIRS. TTH1 ONLY IMERENCY SERVICE'THAT
SEEMED TO KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING WERE THE FIRE BRIGADE.

THEY ACTUALLY OPENED THE GATES. WHEN I CAME BACK OUT, I COULD HEAR ALOT OF
SHOUTING AND SCREAMING COMING FROM THE FRONT. I WENT TO THE FRONT OF THE
STAND AND LOOKED OVER INTO THE TERRACE BELOW. THE CROWD APPEARED TO BE
COMPACTED AND PANICKING. NO-ONE SEEMED TO REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT FIRST

12 FEET FROM THE FRONT OF THE PEN BUT THEN I GOT STUCK ON A BARRIER, I WAS
THERE ABOUT 10 MINS AND I COULD HARDLY BREATH THEN THE CROWD MOVED A BIT AND
I DROPPED TO THE FLOOR SO I COULD BREATH. I MANAGED TO GET UNDER THE BARRIER
AND TRAPPED MY LEFT ARM. I FELT IT STARTING TO GO NUMB, AND EVENTUALLY I
MANAGED TO FREE IT. IT WAS STILL A CRUSH AND A LOAD OF US SAID AFTER 3 WE'D
TRY AND PUSH BACK BUT WE COULD'T DO IT. ALL THE TIME PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING

THE TERRACE WAS ABSOLUTELY BACKED. IT WAS ONE IMMENCE CRUSH. MY COAT GOT
RIPPED AND ALSO MY TRAINING SHOES. THERE WAS A LAD NEXT TO ME THAT GOT HIS
ARMED BROKEN. I COULD NOT HELP HIM BUT SOMEONE PASSED HIM OVER THEIR HEADS
AND HE WAS DRAGGED UP INTO THE STAND. THIS WAS BEFORE THE KICKOFF. I DID NOT
SEE ANYTHING AFTER THIS BECAUSE I WAS CONCENTRATING STAYING ON MY FEET. ONE
LANE THEN GOT OVER THE SPIKES ONTO THE PITCH. A POLICEMAN GRABBED HOLD OF
HIM. I SAW THE POLICEMAN OPEN THE GATE AT THE FRONT AND PUSHED HIM BACK INTO
THE TERRACE. I COULD SEE TO THE LEFT BY A GATE AT THE FRONT OF THE STAND A
LAD WAS STANDING AND SHOUTING TO THE POLICEMAN THAT THERE WERE DEAD PEOPLE IN
T lASTAND BUT THE POLICEMAN DID NOT REALISE WHAT WAS HAPPENING. THEN THE
PRESSURE BECAME SO GREAT THAT I WAS LIFTED ONTO MY FEET FOR ABOUT FIVE
MINUTES AND THEN THE GAME WAS STOPPED. PEOPLE STARTED GETTING OVER THE FRONT
BUT FOR A TIME THE PRESSURE DID NOT ABATE BECAUSE THERE WERE STILL PEOPLE
COMING IN BEHIND. THEN I SAW PEOPLE HAVING HEART MASSAGE AND I STARTED
LOOKING FOR MY MATES. I SAW A PHOTOGRAPHER TAKING PICTURES OF A DEAD BODY A I
SAW FOUR YOUTHS DRAG HIM OFF AND START HITTING HIM. I RECEIVED BRUISED RIBS
AND BANGS.

YOU DOING HERE, YOU SHOULD BE FURTHER BACK." I SAID THIS BECAUSE HE NORMALLY
CONTROLS THE CROWDS AND WOULD BE BETTER FURTHER AWAY FROM THE GROUND. FRANK
SAID "I KNOW I SHOULD BE FURTHER BACK BUT IgVE BEEN TOLD TO STAY HERE". IT
WAS ABOUT 2.48PM. THEY TRIED TO CLOSE THE LARGE OUTSIDE IRON BLUE GATES TO
EASE THE PRESSURE OFF THE TURNSTILES BUT THE FORCE OF THE CROWD FORCED THE
GATES OPEN AND PUSHED ME TO THE LEFT HAND SIDE BY THE NORTH STAND TURNSTILES.
IT WAS ABSOLUTELY CHAOS. PEOPLE WERE GOING TO THE WRONG TURNSTILES AND BEING
T I M E D AWAY. WITH THE CRUSH I COULDN'T SEE IF THE TURNSTILES WERE CLEARLY
MillcED OR NOT. I WAS VERY FRIGHTED AND TRIED TO GO THROUGH THE NORTH STAND
TURNSTILE, I EXPLAINED TO THE CHAP THAT THE PRESSURE BEHIND ME WAS TOO GREAT,
GAVE HIM MY TICKET AND JUMPED OVER THE TURNSTILE. ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND, I
WENT TO THE LEFT, I KNEW THIS BECAUSE I REMEMBERED WHAT IT WAS LIKE LAST
YEAR. I WENT UP SOME CONCRETE STEPS AND SAW THE CONCENTINA GATES OPENED, IT
WAS ABOUT 6 MINUTES TO 3PM. THERE WAS DEFINATELY ALOT OF PRESSURE ON THOSE
GATES, AS THEY WERE OPENED THE FANS RAN THROUGH, I AGREE THAT THEY HAD TO BE
OPENED BECAUSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED OUTSIDE, BUT OBVIOUSLY WE
WEREN'T TO KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN LATER. OUTSIDE IN THE CRUSH I SAW ALOT OF
POLICEMEN SITTING IN VANS, THEY DIDN'T TRY TO HELP. ALL FIFTEEN OF US WERE
SPLIT UP IN THE CROWD. I THINK THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN HELD BACK HALF AN
HOUR WITH THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE APPROACHING THE GROUND. OUTSIDE THE TUNNEL
THERE WERE NO SIGNS OR OFFICIALS TO TELL PEOPLE THAT THEY COULD REACH THE
SIDE PENS AROUND THE SIDES.

BLUE GATES, WE WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE AND WERE SEARCHED BY THE POLICE IT
WAS THE TURSTILE IN THE MIDDLE. WE WENT TO OUR SEATS WHICH WERE ON THE FRONT
ROW OF THE BALCONY, THE TWO MIDDLE PEN PENS HAD PEOPLE IN BUT WERE NOT PACKED
AND THE OUTER PENS WERE EMPTY, THIS WAS ABOUT 220PM. TENS MINUTES LATER THE
MIDDLE TWO PENS WERE REALLY PACKED. ABOUT 250PM THERE WAS SURGE IN THE PPEN
AS THE TEAMS CAME ON THE PITCH THEN PEOPLE STARTED GETTING CRUSHED AND I
NOTICED THAT PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER THE SIDE FENCING OF THE PENS
B l^POLICE WERE TELLING THEM TO GET OFF. I SAW THEM PEOPLE BEING PASSED OVER
THE HEADS OF OTHERS DOWN BELOW.. THEN OTHERS TRIED TO CLIMB FROM BELOW UP
ONTO OUR TERRACE.. WE STARTED TO GET SQUASHED ON TOP THEN SO ME AND MY FRIEND
MANAGED TO GET OUT AND GOT TO THE CANTEEN AREA...THEN PEOPLE STARTED BRINGING
INJURED PEOPLE TO WHERE WE WERE SO WE STARTED HELPING WITH THEM... TWO
POLICEMEN WERE STANDING WITH THEM BUT THEY DIDNT LOOK AS THOUGH THEY KNEW
WHAT TO DO...I ALSO SAW A POLICEMAN TRYING TO TELL FANS TO BACK OFF THE
BARRIER HE LOOKED HORRIFIED AND WAS TRYING TO GET THE GATE OPEN ON THE
BARRIER... THE AREA THEY GAVE THE LIVERPOOL FANS WAS FAR TO SMALL... ALSO
THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE OFFICIALS DIERCTING PEOPLE WHERE TO GO TO THE
EMPTY AREAS..

WE GOT TO THE GROUND AT 2,50 PM. I RECOGNISED THE MOUNTED POLICE OUTSIDE AS
BEING FROM LIVERPOOL. THEY KEPT US FAIRLY ORDERLY AS WE WENT INTO THE GROUND.
WE WERE TOLD BY A POLICE OFFICER ON FOOT THAT THE GAME HAD BEEN PUT BACK TO
ALLOW SUPPORTERS TO GET INTO THE GROUND. THE ONLY DRUNKSI SAW ALL DAY WERE
TWO YOUNG LADS INS IDE. WE WENT INTO THE GROUND AND TO THE RIGHT AS I WENT IN
THE CENTRE LAST YEAR AND IT WAS TOO PACKED.BY 3PM THEY WERE CLIMBING OVER THE
FENCES ONTO THE PITCH. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY POLICE WERE STANDING
AROUND DOING NOTHING ON THE PITCH.

TUESDAY,5 MARCH 1991




I showed Mr Manning the paragraph on the 3rd page of
statement of 25.2.91 referring to Supt. Murray (first seven lines).
Mr Manning said that his client would emphatically deny that.
He also indicated that he and everyone else, including Mr Isaacs,
was aware o f _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ and he would not therefore put too
much credance on any statement anyway. I said I was interested
in ascertaining whether Mr Murray would agree with what was said
and he had answered that point.

LORD FERRERS MEETING WITH MICHAEL SHERSBY MP ON 8 MAY


We spoke yesterday about inclusion into the brief for
Lord Ferrers meeting, some material to cover the attached letter
from Mr Shersby.   I enclose a separate advice note which you may
wish to add to the brief.


As agreed with Private Office the meeting of 8 May should serve
to answer the point raised in the letter.

EVIDENCE BY THE POLICE FEDERATION TO THE TAYLOR INQUIRY



Mr Shersby will wish to know if the Police Federation can give
evidence to the Inquiry (see letter attached).




Line to take


It is open to the Federation to give written evidence.




If Lord Ferrers is asked if the Federation can present oral
evidence, the position is as follows.    The Federation did not
attend the preliminary hearing of the Inquiry and have not sought
leave to give oral evidence.    If they wish to do so they will
have to apply to the Inquiry.

           rI shall be grateful if you will let me know if it will be
            open to the Police Federation to give evidence to the Taylor
            Inquiry into the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster.

            So far as I can see, the terms of reference are wide and
            there is no restriction on who may give evidence, but I shall
            be grateful if you can confirm that it is open to the
            Federation to give evidence if they so wish.




            The Rt. Hon. Earl Ferrers,
            Minister of State,
            Home Office,
            50 Queen Anne's Gate,
            London SWl.

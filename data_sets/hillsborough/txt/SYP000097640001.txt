                        THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER
                                    15 APRIL 1989

                                        F IN A L R E P O R T O F IN Q U IR Y

                                                  IN T R O D U C T IO N

  1. O n 17 April 1989 I was appointed by your predecessor, the Rt H on Douglas H u rd CBE, M P to carry out
an Inquiry with the following term s o f reference:

  “To inquire into the events at Sheffield W ednesday Football G round on 15 April 1989 and to make
  recom m endations about the needs o f crowd control and safety at sports events.”

  2. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: M r Brian Johnson CBE, Q PM , DL, C hief Constable of
Lancashire, and Professor L eonard M au n d e r OB E, BSc, PhD , ScD, FEng, FI Mech E, Professor o f Mechanical
Engineering at the U niversity o f Newcastle upon Tyne.

   3. T he first stage o f the Inquiry was prim arily concerned with the investigation o f events at Hillsborough
S tadium on 15 April 1989 when 95 people were crushed to death at a Cup semi-final m atch between Liverpool
an d N ottingham Forest.

   4. O ver 31 days between 15 May and 29 June, I heard oral evidence from 174 witnesses at a public hearing
in Sheffield. I also received m uch written evidence by way o f submissions and letters.

  5. O n 1 August 1989 I presented an Interim Report setting out my findings as to how and why the disaster
occurred. Also, in accordance with your predecessor’s wishes, I m ade interim recom m endations aim ed at
preventing any further disaster and im proving safety in the short term.

   6. The Interim R eport and its recom m endations had o f necessity to be m ade quickly so that action could be
taken before the start o f the new football season due to open in m id August. Despite all the speed I could
muster, the recom m endations left very little tim e for pre-season action, especially in Scotland where the
fixture list started earlier than in England a n d Wales. I m ust pay tribute to the clubs, local authorities, police
an d oth er services for responding so prom ptly and for im plem enting the recom m endations so wholeheartedly.

    7. In my Interim Report I indicated that it would be necessary to conduct w ider a n d deeper investigations
before delivering a Final R eport on the needs o f crowd control and safety for the future. Accordingly, I invited
and have considered a large n u m ber o f w ritten submissions describing present practices and problems and
suggesting future changes. Those who have contributed are listed at Appendix 1 .1 am extremely grateful to all
o f them for their tim e and their views. I expect there are a nu m b er o f contributors and correspondents who
m ay look in vain for com m en t on each and every point they have raised. I hope they will understand that tim e
an d space m ake it necessary to be selective and to have regard to the m ain issues.

  8. I have also had num erous inform al meetings with those representing relevant public bodies, clubs and
spectator interests. These have been conducted as private discussion sessions rather th an hearings o f oral
evidence thereby enabling controversial issues to be explored an d theories tested.

  9. In all o f this I have continued to be assisted by the two Assessors. Each holds a professional app ointm ent
carrying heavy responsibility and I am deeply grateful to both for devoting so m uch tim e to assisting me. T heir
contributions have been o f the highest value. W hile the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am
comforted in the knowledge that b oth Assessors agree with it.

   10. At my request, Professor M a u n d e r chaired a Technical Working Party to review the technical aspects o f
the H om e Office G uide to Safety at Sports G rounds (1986 edition), “The G reen G u id e” . Each m em ber o f his
team has m uch relevant experience a n d the team was well qualified for its task. I am m ost grateful for the
co-operation and efforts o f each m em ber. The Report o f the Technical Working Party is at Appendix 3.

   11. In the course o f the Inquiry, the two Assessors a n d I have between us visited 31 sports grounds. They are
listed at A ppendix 2. O f those, 24 were soccer grounds, but we also attended at grounds featuring Rugby
U nion, Rugby League, cricket, tennis a n d golf. I wish to record o u r thanks to the club officials who so readily
and hospitably facilitated our visits; also to the officers o f local government, the police a n d the emergency
services who together with club officials conducted us round the grounds, explained their operations and
answered our questions fully and frankly. Seeing crowd control and behaviour before, during and after a m atch
from various sections o f the viewing areas was an essential source o f first hand knowledge. It brought alive the
w ritten and oral reports we received.

   12. I should like to express my thanks to the H om e Office team who have staffed this Inquiry so well. M r
Robert Whalley was appointed as its Secretary. He has handled all the adm inistrative arrangem ents
impeccably and has given m uch invaluable advice and assistance on every aspect o f the Inquiry. He was ably
and diligently assisted by M r Jo nathan Sweet, M rs M argaret Wither, M r Tony Moore, Mrs K ate H um phries
from the H o m e Office and my own Clerk M r Ernest Pott. I also renew my thanks to the West M idlands Police,
and, in particular, to M r Geoffrey D ear Q P M , DL, LLB, the C hief Constable, and M r M ervyn Jones MSc,
Assistant C hief Constable in full-time charge o f the investigation, who have continued to provide m e with
helpful inform ation at this second stage o f the Inquiry.

   13. Having m ade my findings as to the events at Hillsborough, I do not in this report say any m ore about
them save by way o f illustration. I am aware that inquests are still to be held, civil proceedings are in m otion
and the possibility o f criminal charges is un d e r consideration. However, those are not m atters for me. I
therefore turn now to broader issues as prom ised in paragraph 304 o f my Interim Report.

   14. My term s o f reference are extremely wide. They em brace crowd control and safety at sports events o f all
kinds. However, crowd problems are directly related to the nature o f the event a n d the num bers attending it.
Realistically, this m eans that attention needs to be concentrated on events within the scope o f the Safety of
Sports G round Act 1975 and the Fire Safety a n d Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987. Even m ore specifically, the
em phasis in this Report is especially upon football. The Hillsborough disaster and indeed other disasters
before it occurred in crowded football stadia. The num bers and the atm osphere at a football m atch have
created special problem s such as overcrowding a n d m isbehaviour not, so far, to be found to a like degree
elsewhere.

   15. That football is a special case has been expressly recognised by the G overnm ent in prom oting the
Football Spectators Act 1989. The Bill received the Royal Assent on 16 N ovem ber 1989. It had com m enced its
course through Parliam ent before the H illsborough disaster. Expressly because o f that disaster and the setting
up o f this Inquiry it reached the statute book un d er unusual conditions. It was always to be an enabling Act
whose im plem entation would require a Statutory Instrum ent. In order to have the provisions o f the Act in
place as soon as possible, the G overnm ent decided to proceed with it forthwith, notw ithstanding Hillsborough
an d this Inquiry. T h at decision was subject to an undertaking to bring the m atter back before Parliam ent on
two separate occasions. First, before the a p p o in tm e n t o f the Football M em bership A uthority un d e r the Act;
secondly, to debate the scheme which the Act provides should be drawn up by that Authority.

   16. I was expressly told by your predecessor upon my appoin tm ent that my term s o f reference included
consideration o f the national m em bership scheme provided for in the Bill. T hat was confirm ed on num erous
occasions by M inisters in the course o f the Bill’s passage through Parliament. It was m ade clear that although
the Act would be on the statute book before my Final Report, Parliament would have the opportunity to
consider any observations I m ight make, including any about the national m em bership scheme. Thus, to take
only two examples, M r Nicholas Ridley, then Secretary o f State for the Environm ent, said on the Second
Reading o f the Bill on 27 June 1989:

  “I began by referring to Lord Justice Taylor’s inquiry. I will emphasise again now what I said at the
  beginning. Parliam ent will have not one but two opportunities to debate a n d vote on the national
  m em bership scheme after we have received the report and in the light o f any com m ents that Justice Taylor
  m ay make on the scheme. By proceeding with the Bill now, we can put the framework for the scheme in place
  an d make it possible to move on rapidly w ith the scheme, if Parliam ent agrees that we should do so when it
  has seen what Lord Justice Taylor has to say.”
  (Official Report, colum n 850).

Secondly, at the C om m ittee stage on 6 July 1989, M r Colin M oynihan, the M inister for Sport, said:

  “I am certain that Lord Justice Taylor will feel in no way inhibited by consideration o f the Bill in o u r
  suggested form at, because we specifically am en d ed the Bill to provide for the Secretary o f State’s approval o f
  the scheme after the final rep o rt     the Bill is am ended to enable the House to consider in detail the
  recom m endations before we establish the Football M em bership Authority to draw up the schem e                To
  hypothesise on w hether Lord Justice Taylor is in favour o f a national m em bership scheme or w hether he
  m ay not even com m ent on it, is totally irrelevant because the Bill provides for the House o f C om m ons and
  House o f Lords to consider the report before setting up a Football M em bership Authority.”
  (Official Report, colum n 56).

   17. It m ust be a rare if not unique situation fo ra judge, appointed to conduct an Inquiry, to have within his
rem it consideration o f the m erits a n d provisions o f an Act o f Parliam ent already L. place. It cannot be for a
judge to opine upon the w isdom o r term s o f an Act expressing the established will o f Parliament. But, where
Parliam ent has passed an Act in such term s an d upon such undertakings as expressly to provide that the
Inquiry judge be uninhibited in com m enting upon it and that Parliam ent should have the opportunity to
consider his com m ents in further debate, then I conceive it to be his duty to express his views. My doing so
should not be interpreted as showing any lack o f the respect and deference due to Parliament. N ot to do so,
against the background I have described, would surely be thought surprising if not pusillanimous.

   18. In Part I o f this Report I state some lessons to be learnt from Hillsborough, examine the state o f football
today a n d propose a range o f m easures to give it a better future. In Part I I I consider, in detail, measures to
improve safety at sports grounds. Part III is concerned with crowd control at sports grounds and various
strategies for dealing w ith hooligans. In Part IV I consider the provisions o f the 1989 Act regarding the national
m em bership scheme. Finally, at the end o f the text, I set out my Recom m endations. So as to avoid confusion, I
have not set out my Interim R ecom m endations for the purpose o f comparison. Hardly any excisions have been
m ade. W here I have decided to repeat or am end the Interim Recom m endations, they are included in the single
list o f Final R ecom m endations. I hope this Report and the Final R ecom m endations m ay be instrum ental in
prom oting better a n d safer conditions at sports grounds in the future.

                         THREE SOM BRE L E SSO N S AFTER HILLSBO RO UG H

i. Previous Reports Unheeded
   19. It is a depressing and chastening fact th at mine is the ninth official report covering crowd safety and
control at football grounds. After eight previous reports and three editions o f the Green G uide, it seems
astounding that 95 people could die from overcrowding before the very eyes o f those controlling the event. In
January 1986, M r Justice Popplewell, whose report following the Bradford Disaster was the eighth in the
series, sum m arised those o f his seven predecessors. The Shortt Report o f 1924 followed disorder at the Cup
Final o f 1923. The Moelwyn Hughes Report o f 1946 followed the disaster at Bolton W anderers ground when
overcrowding caused 33 deaths. In 1966 the G overnm ent com m issioned the Chester Report on “The State o f
Association Football” . The H arrington Report o f 1968 drew attention to problem s o f crowd behaviour and led
to the Lang Report o f 1969 on the same subject. In 1972, Lord W heatley’s R eport on Crowd Safety at Sports
G ro u n d s followed the disaster at Ibrox Park where 66 spectators died. The McElhone R eport o f 1977 on
Football Crowd B ehaviour o f Scottish supporters was com m issioned by the Secretary o f State for Scotland. In
1984 an Official W orking G roup on Football Spectator Violence set up by the D epartm ent o f Environm ent
presented a further report.

  20. As a result o f the Wheatley Report, the first edition o f the Green G uide was issued in 1973, and
Parliam ent passed the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975. A second edition o f the G reen G uide was issued in
1976 and a third edition in 1986 incorporated recom m endations m ade by M r Justice Popplewell.

  21. Introducing his excellent and concise sum m ary o f the previous reports, M r Justice Popplewell said:

  “alm ost all the m atters into which I have been asked to inquire and alm ost all the solutions I have proposed,
  have been previously considered in detail by many distinguished Inquiries over a period o f 60 years” .

  Because his citations from those earlier reports are still highly relevant, I append his sum m ary o f them at
A ppendix 4.

   22. In my Interim Report I set out what happened at Hillsborough and why. T hat it was allowed to happen,
despite all the accum ulated wisdom o f so many previous reports and guidelines m ust indicate th at the lessons
o f past disasters and the recom m endations following them had not been taken sufficiently to heart. I
appreciate how easy it is to criticise with hindsight and that a new situation can always arise in hum an affairs
which has not previously been envisaged. But many o f the deficiencies at Hillsborough h ad been envisaged.

    23. The Moelwyn Hughes Report in 1924 had stressed the need to start controlling the crowd well back
from the entrance to the ground. The Green G uide required that “Turnstiles should be o f such num bers as to
a d m it spectators at a rate whereby no unduly large crowds are kept waiting for adm ission” (paragraph 44).
C hapter 8 o f the G u id e required “Arrangements should be m ade ... to contain pressures before they reach
dangerous p roportions”. C h apter 16 laid down m axim um capacity which was grossly exceeded in the fatal
pens at Hillsborough. Both the G reen G uide (C hapter 15) and M r Justice Popplewell had stated the need for
gates in the perim eter fencing to be adequate to perm it escape on to the pitch in an emergency. Why were these
recom m endations and others not followed? I suggest two m ain reasons. First, insufficient concern a n d .
vigilance for the safety and well-being o f spectators. This was com pounded by a preoccupation with measures
to control hooliganism. Secondly, complacency which led all parties to think that since disaster had not
occurred on previous occasions it would not happen this time. But there is no point in holding inquiries or
publishing guidance unless the recom m endations are followed diligently. T h at must be the first lesson.

ii. “It Couldn’t Happen Here”
  24. Amazingly, complacency was still to be found even after Hillsborough. It was chilling to hear the same
refrain from directors at several clubs I visited:-

     “Hillsborough was horrible - but, o f course, it couldn’t have happened here.”

  C ouldn’t it? The Hillsborough ground was regarded by m any as one o f the best in the country. It was selected
by the FA for the Cup semi-final and thought by them to be entirely suitable. The identical fixture had passed
off uneventfully the previous year. I have little doubt that if the disaster scenario had been described to the
m anagem ent at Hillsborough prior to 15 April, they too would have said “O f course, it couldn’t happen here”.
Yet som ething like it had happened at Hillsborough in 1981, albeit with less dire results. Moreover, I am
satisfied from eyewitness accounts I have received that there have been many other occasions when
overcrowding has led, at various grounds round the country, to a genuine apprehension o f im pending disaster
through crushing, averted only by good fortune. I have heard from Police C om m anders at a n u m ber o f the
grounds I have visited how relieved they are that capacities have been reduced in the interests o f safety.

  25. So, although the operational errors on 15 April were special to one ground an d one day, the lack of
precautions against overcrowding was not unique. I do not believe that sufficient safety measures were being
applied at all o ther grounds. The lesson here is that Hillsborough should not be regarded as a freak occurrence,
incapable o f happening elsewhere. All those responsible for certifying, using and supervising sports grounds
should take a hard look at their arrangem ents and keep doing so. Complacency is the enemy o f safety.

iii. A Blight on Football
  26. Football is o u r national game. We gave it to the world. But its image in o u r country has been much
tarnished. In my Interim Report I concentrated on overcrowding because it was the cause o f the Hillsborough
disaster. But w ider and deeper inquiry shows that overcrowding is only one feature amongst a n u m ber causing
danger or m arring football as a spectator sport. The picture revealed is o f a general malaise or blight over the
game due to a n u m ber o f factors. Principally these are: old grounds, poor facilities, hooliganism, excessive
drinking and poor leadership. Crowd safety and crowd behaviour with which I am concerned are closely
related to the quality o f the accom m odation and facilities offered and to the standards which are encouraged
and enforced. So I think it necessary to consider all these aspects.

Old Grounds
   27. Because we were first into the field, most o f our football grounds are now elderly. Between 1889 and
1910, 58 o f the clubs belonging to the current League moved into the grounds they now occupy.* M any o f
them are ill-placed on cram ped sites boxed into residential areas. W hen they were built, they were not intended
to cater for the stream o f coaches, vans and cars which now arrive and require parking space. Inside the
grounds decay and dilapidation are often extensive. The terrace accom m odation, in particular, is often
uncovered and little has been done to improve the layout in accordance with m odern expectations. This is
chiefly because the safety and com fort o f those on the terraces has not been regarded as a priority. In fairness,
lim itations o f space at some grounds make it very difficult to achieve a layout appropriate to present day
needs. By contrast, clubs in Europe and South America have the advantage o f grounds built more recently on
more spacious sites and planned to meet m odern conditions. W here im provem ents have been m ade to
o u r grounds they have often been patchy and piecemeal. This approach is itself a threat to safety. To build a
seated stand over a standing area, to enlarge o r divide a terrace, to rearrange exits and entrances o r to modify
turnstile areas - any o f these measures is fraught with safety implications. Yet often such changes have been
m ade to achieve one purpose without sufficient thought about the adverse side-effects which could result.

  28. This was exemplified by the sequence o f alterations at the Leppings Lane end at Hillsborough. Radial
fences were installed to divide up the terraces; this led to a reduction in the system o f crush barriers. The area
inside the turnstiles was altered for purposes o f segregation. Old signs were not removed; new signs were
inadequate. The result was a bewildering complex which contributed to the delivery o f excessive num bers
down the tunnel into pens 3 and 4.

Poor Facilities
   29. Football spectators are invited by the clubs for entertainm ent and enjoyment. Often, however, the
facilities provided for them have been lamentable. A part from the discomfort o f standing on a terrace exposed
to the elements, the ordinary provisions to be expected at a place o f entertainm ent are sometimes not merely
basic but squalid. At some grounds the lavatories are prim itive in design, poorly m aintained and inadequate in
num ber. This not only denies the spectator an essential facility he is entitled to expect. It directly lowers
standards o f conduct. The practice o f urinating against walls or even on the terraces has become endem ic and
is followed by m en who would not behave that way elsewhere. The police, who would charge a m an for
urinating in the street, either tolerate it in football grounds or do no more than give a verbal rebuke. Thus
crowd conduct becomes degraded and other m isbehaviour seems less out o f place.

   30. The refreshments available to supporters are often limited and o f indifferent quality. They are sold in
*Inglis: Football G ro u n d s o f G reat Britain p 10
surrounding streets from mobile carts and inside many grounds from o ther carts or from shoddy sheds. Fans
eat their hamburgers o r chips standing outside in all weathers. There is a prevailing stench o f stewed onions.
Adequate numbers o f bins for rubbish are often not available; so wrappings, containers and detritus are simply
dropped. This inhospitable scene tends to breed bad m anners and poor behaviour. The atm osphere does not
encourage pride in the ground o r consideration for others. I accept that m any fans are quite content to eat on
the h o o f when visiting a match, b ut there is no reason why the fare available should not be wholesome, varied
and decently served from clean and attractive outlets. Fast food establishments meeting these requirements
are readily to be found at railway stations and on high streets; why not at football grounds?

   31. At most grounds little attem p t has been m ade to provide pre-match entertainm ent. To do so could have
a double advantage. It would give the spectators m ore value for their money. It could also bring them in earlier
thereby avoiding congestion at the turnstiles in the last few m inutes before kick-off. Such entertainm ent as has
been tried has mostly failed to appeal to the spectators. They do not seem drawn by the musical offerings o f the
disc jockey or by m arching bands. The football supporters’ organisations com plain that supporters have not
hitherto been m uch consulted about this or about anything else affecting their well-being and enjoyment.

  32. In giving this dismal account o f the football scene, I have taken care to use the words “often”, “at most
grounds” or “at many grounds” . I acknowledge th a t there are notable exceptions where great im provements
have been effected and I do not suggest that every disagreeable feature I have described is to be found at every
ground. Nevertheless, the overall picture o f conditions and facilities to be expected by a standing spectator is
depressing. It is in stark contrast to the different world, only yards away, in the Board Room and the lucrative
executive boxes. I appreciate that they cater for an affluent clientele and bring in much-needed revenue. N o
one would expect or indeed want their plush carpeting or haute cuisine when visiting the terraces; but
accom m odation and facilities have often been below the basic decent standard necessary to give spectators
dignity let alone comfort.

  33. It is small w onder that attendances at m atches gradually fell off from a peak o f 77 million in the season
1949/50 to about 20 million in the late 1980s. N o doubt other reasons played their part; for example, the
emergence o f other spectator sports and television. Until the 1960s m ost m en worked on a Saturday m orning
and m any went straight to the m atch in the afternoon. But the 5 day week together with increased car
ownership m ade Saturday outings for the family a popular activity. O n top o f these factors, however, the
prospect o f attending football in the conditions I have described clearly becam e unattractive to many erstwhile
supporters. Added to this was the fear o f disorder. So far, I have not m entioned the further indignities endured
by supporters as a result o f hooliganism and the m easures taken to contain it.

Hooliganism
  34. D uring the 1970s, hooligan behaviour became a scourge at and around football grounds. Rival fans
abused and fought with each other on the terraces. T he pitch was invaded, som etim es to facilitate the fighting,
sometimes in an attem pt to abort a m atch by those whose team was losing and on occasions to display anger
and seek to assault a referee or a player who had incurred displeasure. Throwing missiles, either at a player or a
policeman or at rival fans, became another violent feature. W hen the police responded by searching fans for
missiles on entry, the practice grew o f throwing coins (which could not be confiscated). Sometimes the coins
were sharpened in advance to make them m ore damaging.

  35. Mass singing o f traditional songs, some o f nation-wide appeal, some local to the area or the club, had
become a part o f the terrace culture. But the repertoire becam e augm ented and degraded by abusive and
obscene chants aim ed at the referee or the opposing fans. A further nasty addition was racist chanting aim ed at
any black player o f either team.

   36. Hooliganism outside the ground also becam e rife. Supporters o f rival teams abused and attacked each
other. Hooligan gangs caused damage to trains, to buses, and to property on their route. Some deliberately
went out o f their way to rampage through local shops, stealing, wrecking and intim idating as they went - an
activity known as “steam ing”. After a m atch, rival supporters would attack each other on the way hom e in the
street, in public transport or in public houses.

Segregation
   37. To contain and control these manifold forms o f anti-social and crim inal behaviour there is now an
elaborate complex o f measures. The policy o f segregation was born in the 1970s. Gradually, it has called for
more and more extreme and expensive strategies by the clubs and the police. As each measure taken has been
circum vented by determ ined hooligans, further measures have had to be grafted on to the system. W itnessing
the full florid exercise taking place every Saturday afternoon nowadays makes one wonder how anyone could
have contem plated going to such lengths to facilitate the w atching o f football. But nobody did; it just grew.
   38. Clubs have sub-divided their grounds to keep rival fans apart by putting fencing and sterile areas
between them , by screening them from inciting each other, by separate entrances and exits and by perim eter
fences round the pitch. Many o f the fences are very high and are crowned with elaborate spikes and barbed
wire, the top sections being inclined inwards to prevent their being scaled. At some grounds a telescopic tunnel
is extended on to the pitch to protect the team s from missiles as they come on or go off.

   39. T he police start and finish their segregation exercise well away from the ground. Typically, special trains
or coaches carrying the away supporters are m onitored en route. The police meet them and escort the fans with
m ounted officers, dog handlers and foot officers, ensuring they go only to their allotted section o f the ground.
They are searched at the entrance for drink or weapons (as are the home fans). They are then confined in an
area caged by fencing for the duration o f the m atch. W hen it ends, the away supporters are often held back for a
quarter to half an h o u r whilst the hom e supporters are dispersed. They are then escorted away in the same
m a n n e r as they arrived and put back on to their trains or buses. Although the m ain body o f away supporters
can thus be policed as a group, those who arrive independently in cars or vans have freedom o f manoeuvre.
Occasionally trouble makers get into the wrong area and a violent episode occurs. Again, the further away from
the ground the spectators spread, the less the police can do to prevent sporadic confrontations. By and large
however, the police measures have worked to prevent violent outbursts in and around the ground.

  40. But at what a price! In addition to the poor facilities I described earlier (which are often worse for away
than for hom e fans) the ordinary law-abiding football supporter travelling away is caught up in a police
operation rem iniscent o f a colum n o f prisoners o f war being m arched and detained un der guard. I w atched the
escort o f Arsenal fans after a m atch at Stamford Bridge. They were held in the ground for thirty-five minutes
while the Chelsea supporters left. They were then escorted by a substantial body o f police to Fulham Broadway
underground station. There, to avoid overcrowding on the platform, they were adm itted to the station only in
m easured groups. Special trains were run to take them non-stop into the centre o f the city to avoid clashes at
nearby stations.

   41. Clearly, the police with th eir great experience o f controlling crowds at the ground considered this
strategy was necessary in the present climate. T h e ir views were confirmed in that despite th eir efficient and
good hum oured m anagem ent o f the m atch and its afterm ath, scuffles took place when some fans got into the
wrong section o f the ground. M oreover such police practice is not unique to o u r country. There are similar
hooligan problems for example in H olland. I witnessed a very similar operation carried out by the D utch
police at U trecht to control a train load o f supporters from Eindhoven.

  42. Necessary though such operations may presently be, they do nothing to enhance the image o f football as
a spectator sport followed for entertainm ent and pleasure. I know o f no other sport or en tertainm ent in a
civilised country in which it is necessary to keep those attending from attacking each other.

  43. A part from their im pact on the spectator, operations to control football crowds have other serious
repercussions. T he cost in money, m anpow er and d isruption is enormous. Last year, the cost o f policing
football in London was some £10 million o f which only £1 million could be recovered from the clubs.
According to the Football Trust, who meet one third o f the costs o f police charges incurred by clubs at matches
for the Football League, Scottish Football League and G M Vauxhall Conference, the cost to clubs during
1988/89 was £4.79 million. Since this relates only to costs inside grounds which can be recovered by the police,
the total cost to the police service is substantially more. H e r Majesty’s C hief Inspector o f C onstabulary for
England and Wales said, in his annual report for 1988, that:-

  “ Football continues to be a focus for h o o lig an ism ... dem ands on the police service continued at a high level.
  Typically, 5000 officers may be engaged on football duties on Saturdays during the football season.”

  The H om e Office estimate that the total cost o f deploying these officers is perhaps £200,000 to £300,000
each football Saturday. At m any League matches, policing requires some 300 officers in the ground with many
m ore outside and others performing related traffic duties. At high risk matches, Cup semi-finals and the like,
even greater num bers are deployed. At Hillsborough there were 800 officers in and around the ground.
Obviously officers deployed to football cannot be perform ing police duties elsewhere. Although m any are
brought in on an overtime basis (at a consequently heavier cost) police com m itm ents to the com m unity
elsewhere must be affected by the concentration o f such num bers in one place.

  44. W hen upwards o f 40,000 converge on a ground in a residential area the effect on the local com m unity is
very disagreeable. Large num bers o f fans chant in the streets, often offensively. They invade gardens to urinate.
Em pty cans and other garbage are d ropped in gardens, yards and in the street. Shops may be pillaged. Traffic is
congested or diverted. Streets are filled with parked coaches and cars. Side-streets are cordoned off by police to
protect residents. Recently, a police cordon was thought necessary at a half mile radius round Highbury when
Liverpool visited Arsenal. Residents had to establish their identity. The operation was successful in preventing
disorder but the need to conduct such operations and the resultant disruption contributes to the poor image o f
football in the com m unity at large.

What does Segregation Achieve?
  45. Segregation, which is the m ain feature o f present crowd control policy, aims only to contain and control
bad behaviour, not to elim inate it. Indeed, the very fact that rival fans are separated tends to increase and
polarise th eir hostility to each other. Segregation breeds an “us and th em ” attitude. The opposing supporters
can be seen as a physically distinct group upon w hom anim osity can be focussed. Again, the knowledge that the
“enem y” is physically restrained from violent riposte may encourage baiting and abuse which caution would
otherwise deter. There is force too in the view that if people are herded and confined as potential offenders,
that concept may in some cases becom e self-fulfilling. So, although segregation may have appeared the only
way to m aintain the excitement o f the adversarial atm osphere at football grounds whilst keeping the peace, it
merely controlled the sym ptom s o f hooliganism. The disease rem ained and may even have been intensified by
the segregation. O th e r games have not resorted to it. For example, there is no segregation at rugby league
m atches although the catchm ent sections o f population, from which support is drawn both to football and
rugby league, seem similar.

Who are the Hooligans?
   46. In chapter 5 o f his Final Report, M r Justice Popplewell exploded three popular fallacies about
hooliganism. First that it is som ething new; secondly, th at it is only found at soccer matches and thirdly, that it
is a specifically English disease. H e went on to consider the nature o f football hooliganism, the characteristics
o f the hooligan, possible causes o f hooligan behaviour and experience in other countries. I do not propose to
repeat his analysis. N othing has throw'n any doub t on it in the four years since he reported although m uch has
been written by journalists, academ ics and others. I agree w'ith him that there is no simple explanation for all
the m isbehaviour attached to football and there is no single remedy. It is im portant, however, to recognise the
clear distinction between quite different groups o f hooligans.

   47. There are those who m isbehave spontaneously in o r around the ground in response to some perceived
grievance - a goal against their team , a doubtful decision o f a referee or taunting from others. But there are
other groups who go out bent on causing trouble for its own sake. The latter were described by M r Justice
Popplewell as “the new hooligans” . Often they hold down good jobs during the week, dress stylishly and detach
themselves from those fans with club scarves who travel on official coaches or trains. They plan their violence
as a recreation in itself to which the football is secondary o r a mere background. Unfortunately, these groups
can fom ent trouble and galvanise support from fans who would not otherwise misbehave. Thus the effect of
the “new hooligans” can grow out o f proportion to their numbers.

   48. M r Justice Popplewell sum m arised his conclusions as to the nature and m otivation o f hooligan groups
at paragraph 5.90 o f his Final R eport as follows:-

      “ I (a) T hat there has always been a group, albeit a small group who find violence attractive; who
          currently find the football ground a convenient theatre for their violence and the football m atch the
          occasion for the display o f their aggressive tendencies which on other days and at other times they will
          be exhibiting in public houses, the city centre or elsewhere. T heir m ain target at football grounds is
          opposing fans. They choose to exercise th a t violence at a football m atch for a nu m b er o f simple
          reasons. T he date and place o f a m atch are fixed; the nature o f the opposition is known; its presence is
          certain, so is that o f the police. T heir own support is known. Its presence too is certain. The battle lines
          can be drawn. Thus plans can be m ade well in advance for the particular acts o f violence that they
          intend to create.

         (b) And while there is a good deal o f academ ic support for the view that violence was at one tim e the
         prerogative o f the so called “ rough” working class that is no longer the complete picture today. A
         m ajority o f today’s hooligans no do ubt do fit into that category, b u t some do not. They come from a
         variety o f backgrounds, m any have reasonable jobs and earn a proper living.

         (c) W hether they are m otivated by the same reasons as their predecessors can only be a m atter o f
         conjecture; there seems little reason however to believe otherwise.

      II (a) A second group im itates the first element I have identified. Thus those not particularly given to
         violence witness violence in others and see it being exercised, w ithout let or hindrance. People expect
          the spectators on the terraces to behave in an aggressive way and to use foul language. It then
          becomes accepted as the norm and thus becomes a part o f the pattern o f life which would not be
          tolerated elsewhere. This knock-on effect can be seen in violence in the streets o f o u r cities,
          unconnected with football.

          (b) The feeling o f anonym ity in the crowd gives rise to a loss o f inhibition and self-discipline. The
          association with those o f sim ilar disposition, the enthusiasm and the partisan support for the team,
          which itself causes an atm osphere, all create a situation which can readily give rise to violence.

     III T hen there is a third group (not always separate from the other two groups) who cause violence for a
         reason, either real or supposed. It may be an inability quickly to get into the ground; it may be the
         presence o f rival spectators in a part o f the ground to which the fans think they have a claim.

     IV Finally there are those, the vast majority o f spectators, who abhor violence and wish only for an
        afternoon o f pleasure at a football m atch.”

  The oral and written evidence I have received, the studies and reports I have read on the subject and my
own observations lead me to agree entirely with that summary. I would add only one further elem ent -
alcohol.

Alcohol
  49. T here can be no doubt th a t an excited and volatile crowd is more difficult to control and m ore prone to
disorder if it includes num bers who have been drinking. D rin k is not a m ajor factor affecting M r Justice
Popplewell’s group I. T h eir violence tends to be planned coldly and soberly. But group II is often rendered
disorderly and m ore readily imitates the violence o f others because inhibitions are removed by drink.
Likewise, group III responds to a grievance, is readier to take offence and reacts more impulsively and
violently because o f drink.

   50. D rinking before m atches increased in parallel with the growth o f hooliganism. Before the 5 day week,
those com ing straight from work to the football ground on a Saturday had little tim e to drink excessively.
D uring the 1960s and 1970s young men in their twenties acquired a new affluence and spending on drink
increased. The advent o f the superm arket with an off-licence provided num erous outlets for the sale of
canned beer; so it becam e easy to have alcohol at the m atch and on the way to it, w hether the local pubs were
open or not. Finally, apart from tim e and liquor being available, there has developed an attitude to drinking
in the U K not found to the same extent elsewhere - a cult o f drinking to excess. The spectacle o f young fans,
tanked up with beer, w hether near o u r own football grounds or (more damagingly to o u r reputation abroad)
at foreign football stadia is all too familiar. Yet, for example in Italy, the largest wine producing country in
Europe, football fans and indeed people generally do not drink to get drunk. Although they have their own
brand o f hooliganism (from the “U ltras” as they are known) alcohol is not a m ajor factor. Here it certainly is
and it rem ains so despite legislation banning sales or possession o f alcohol in football grounds and the
carrying o f alcohol on public service and hired vehicles b o und for such grounds.

Poor Leadership
  51. The hierarchy inside football has a n u m ber o f levels over and above the spectators. At the top is the
national m anagem ent o f the game. In England the Football Association is responsible for the ad m inistration
and welfare o f all football down to the lowliest am ateu r club and football in schools. The Football League is a
separate body with responsibility for the 92 professional League clubs. In Scotland and Wales there are
equivalent bodies. Below that top m anagem ent, each o f the League clubs has its own Board o f Directors.
Then there are the referees, the managers and the players. Finally there are organisations representing the
supporters - the Football Supporters’ Association and the N ational Federation o f Football Supporters’ Clubs.
One would have hoped that the up per echelons in this hierarchy would have taken a lead in securing
reasonable safety and comfort for the spectators and in enforcing good behaviour by precept and example.
Unfortunately, these hopes have not generally been realised an d indeed at tim es poor examples have been set.

  52. The FA and the FL have not seen it as their duty to offer guidance to clubs on safety matters. In their
written subm ission they said:-

  “O f course, both T he FA and T he Football League are concerned to ensure that crowd safety standards are
  the highest reasonably practicable. It is felt, however, that neither o f these authorities should be charged
  with the responsibility o f setting detailed safety standards or enforcing th e m .”
They have been m uch concerned to avoid pitch invasions because they interfere with the sm ooth progress
o f the fixture list and incur criticism and penalties from the European football authorities. But advice, for
example, as to turnstile lay outs, the division o f viewing areas and, until recently, on ratios o f seating to
standing areas has not been forthcoming. As another specific example, in selecting Hillsborough as the venue
for the Cup semi-final, the FA did not consider in any depth whether it was suitable for a high risk m atch with
an attendance o f 54,000 requiring to be segregated, all o f w hom were, in effect, away supporters lacking week
in week out knowledge o f the ground. N o special inspection was made; no consultation with Sheffield
Wednesday or the local authority took place.

   53. As for the clubs, in some instances it is legitimate to wonder w hether the directors are genuinely
interested in the welfare o f their grass-roots supporters. Boardroom struggles for power, wheeler-dealing in
the buying and selling o f shares and indeed o f whole clubs sometimes suggest that those involved are more
interested in the personal financial benefits or social status o f being a director th a n o f directing the club in the
interests o f its supporter customers. In most commercial enterprises, including the entertainm ent industry,
knowledge o f the custom er’s needs, his tastes and his dislikes is essential inform ation in deciding policy and
planning. But, until recently, very few clubs consulted to any significant extent with the supporters o r their
organisations.

   54. Encouragem ent and indeed requirem ent o f good behaviour by the fans should be a prim e aim o f club
m anagem ent. Here again positive leadership has often been lacking and on occasions counter-productive. It
cannot help to prom ote good behaviour if a club chairm an has his photograph in the program m e presenting a
cheque for £750 by way o f recoupm ent to a club player fined that sum by the FA for m isbehaviour on the
pitch. The same applies to ano ther chairm an who extended a VIP welcome to hom e com ing “supporters”
convicted o f m isbehaviour whilst attending a m atch in Greece, even if he was sceptical as to the fairness of
the crim inal process.

   55. Then there is what happens on the pitch itself. Long departed are C orinthian Casual standards;
accepting decisions o f the referee w ithout d em ur, affecting a m odest diffidence on scoring a sensational goal.
For m any years now referees’ decisions have been regularly challenged by spread arm s and entreaties; even an
unsensational goal has caused the scorer to be hugged and em braced all the way back to the centre spot. The
cool self-control o f C orinthian Casuals will never return. Perhaps we should not lam ent its departure since
there is no harm in a reasonable show o f joy in success. But, more recently, things have gone further. On
scoring a goal a player nowadays often rushes straight towards the perim eter fencing and either affects to
climb it or, with fists raised and shaking, goes on his knees to excite response from supporters. Little has been
done to stop such dem onstrations which are calculated to hype up the fans into hysteria.

   56. At the other extreme from dem onstrations o f joy and trium ph, violence on the field o f play by tackles
aim ed at op ponents’ legs, stamping, elbowing and holding is com m only to be seen. U ntil lately, the FA’s
response to such violence amongst players has been weak. Negligible fines on offenders, without penalty to
the clubs either in fines or loss o f points, have tended to discredit the FA’s discharge o f its disciplinary role. In
the last couple o f m onths, prom pted by a series o f m uch publicised incidents and by m edia criticism, a firm er
line has at last been adopted. These incidents have involved violent conduct by players off the ball. At the end
o f the m atch between Norwich City and Arsenal on 4 N ovem ber 1989, a nu m b er o f players on both sides
were involved in an incident when punches were exchanged. The referee said he was not going to m ake any
report on the matter. The FA initially announced that if there was no report from the referee there was
nothing they could do. However, wiser counsels prevailed; officials o f the FA saw the incident on video and
decided to take action. In the result Norw ich City were fined £50,000 and Arsenal £20,000. O ther incidents
occurred within days at three other grounds involving violence on the field between players and, in one
instance, managers.

   57. To complete this survey o f the present football malaise, it is necessary to m ention the media. Football
is highly newsworthy. For the World Cup, provision is being m ade at the San Siro stadium , M ilan for no fewer
than 5,000 journalists. In the dom estic U K scene, the long haul throughout the season to become League
cham pions or C up winners is followed not only by the millions who actually attend m atches but by many
millions more via the media. They watch games and listen to the pundits endlessly discussing them on
television; they read about them in the newspapers and they fill in the football pool coupons. So players and
spectators are exposed to constant scrutiny. W hen scuffles or fights occur, w hether on the field or on the
terraces, they are inevitably witnessed by millions and such incidents o f bad behaviour are aggregated into a
reputation tarnishing the national game as a whole. W hen o u r supporters go to Europe, they are preceded by
this reputation. It is expected they will behave badly, so w hether they do so initially or not they are likely to
meet a hostile reception from their counterparts. T hus incidents are provoked an d the syndrom e continues.
   58.    I have sought in the broadest term s to identify those features which disfigure football today. But
despite them , and despite the decline in attendances from the peak years, the game still com m ands massive
public support and interest. Indeed, in the last couple o f years there has been some increase in attendances
for reasons to be explored later. After the h orror o f Hillsborough and the analysis o f football’s troubles which
it has prom pted, the lesson is surely that now is the m om ent for the fullest reassessment o f policy for the
game. Accordingly, before considering detailed recom m endations for securing a basic level o f safety and for
im proving crowd control, I think it appropriate to consider how the low standards described in this chapter
could be raised.
                                                     CHAPTER2

                                     A B E T TER F U T U R E F O R FO O TB A LL

  59. It is not enough to aim only at the m in im um measures necessary for safety. T hat has been, at best, the
approach in the past and too often not even that standard has been achieved. W hat is required is the vision
and im agination to achieve a new ethos for football. G rounds should be upgraded. Attitudes should be more
welcoming. The aim should be to provide more m odern and comfortable accom m odation, better and more
varied facilities, more consultation with the supporters and more positive leadership. If such a policy is
im plem ented it will not only improve safety. There will also be an im provem ent in behaviour, making crowd
control easier.

   60. At some clubs changes have already been m ade towards realising this new concept o f how football
should be. For example, at Ibrox Park, scene o f the appalling disaster in 1971, there has been a total
transform ation. The old main stand remains and still has some standing areas in front o f it. But three new
stands have been built round the rest o f the ground. They are colourful, convenient and are all-seating. They
are constructed so as to provide a covered concourse at first floor level running the length o f the stand. At the
rear o f th a t concourse throughout its length are m odern lavatories for both sexes. At the front are attractive
fast food service points offering a good range o f food and drinks (but no alcohol). T he walls are clean; the
flooring is o f studded rubber. M ounted overhead, at regular intervals o f a few yards along the whole
concourse, are television sets tuned to a sports program m e giving inform ation on the d ay ’s fixtures, excerpts
from previous m atches and general sports coverage. These arrangements encourage fans to arrive in good
tim e, to have wholesome refreshments in a clean and pleasant setting, to enjoy on the television the kind o f
pre-m atch entertain m ent which genuinely interests them , to visit a decent toilet, and then to walk up a few
steps to take th eir seats for the match. All o f this is under cover and it is enjoyed not just by the affluent b u t by
the ordinary supporter. Significantly, the facilities are not abused. Occasional graffiti do appear but are
wiped away prom ptly and the overall impression is that if spectators are offered civilised conditions they
com e to respect them.

All-Seating
  61. There is no panacea which will achieve total safety and cure all problem s o f behaviour and crowd
control. But I am satisfied that seating does m ore to achieve those objectives than any other single measure.

  62. It is obvious that sitting for the duration o f the m atch is more comfortable than standing. It is also
safer. W hen a spectator is seated he has his own small piece o f territory in which he can feel reasonably
secure. H e will not be in close physical contact with those around him. H e will not be jostled or moved about
by swaying or surging. Small or infirm or elderly men and women as well as young children are not buffeted,
sm othered or unsighted by larger and more robust people as on the terraces. The seated spectator is not
subject to pressure o f numbers behind o r around him during the match. He will not be painfully bent double
over a crush barrier. Those m onitoring num bers will know exactly how m any are there without having to
count them in o r assess the density by visual impression. There will still, o f course, be scope for crowd
pressure on stairways whilst entering and especially when leaving, but involuntary and uncontrolled crowd
m ovem ents occasioned by incidents in the game are effectively eliminated.

   63. It is true th at at m om ents o f excitement seated spectators do, and may be expected to, rise from their
seats. But the m om en t passes and they sit down again. I also recognise that seating is only regarded as more
com fortable than standing if cover is provided. The consensus is that, although standing on an exposed
terrace on a wet day is disagreeable, sitting in the rain is worse. So, increased seating does require th at cover
be provided.

  64. A part from comfort and safety, seating has distinct advantages in achieving crowd control. It is
possible to have disturbances in a seated area and they have occurred, but with the assistance o f C C TV the
police can imm ediately zoom in with a cam era and p inpoint the seats occupied by the trouble-m akers as well
as the trouble-m akers themselves. Moreover, if num bered tickets are issued to nam ed purchasers, the police
have a further aid to identifying miscreants.

  65. N u m bered tickets m atching n um bered seats also help to identify forgeries. Forged tickets for standing
areas may not be discovered. In the past, they simply led to inflated num bers on the terraces at all-ticket
matches. But there can only be one valid ticket for each num bered seat and the existence o f a forgery is
im m ediately exposed.
  66. The evidence I have received has been overwhelmingly in favour o f m ore seating accom m odation. At
present, the ratio throughout the 92 League clubs in England and Wales is about two thirds standing to one
third seated. But whilst most are in favour o f reversing th at ratio, there are those who wish to retain a
propo rtion o f standing room. Amongst them are the FA and the football supporters’ organisations.
Essentially they deploy three arguments.

   67. The first is an emotional one based on a desire to retain the traditional culture derived from the close
contact o f the terraces. “My grandfather stood here; my father stood here with me; why shouldn’t I stand here
with my son?” is a commonly expressed view. Moreover, to m any young m en the cam araderie o f singing
together, jum ping up and down, responding in unison to the nam ing o f the players, their emergence on to the
pitch, the scoring o f a goal, an unpopular decision - all o f these are an integral part o f enjoying the match.
They like being part o f an am orphous seething crowd and do not wish to have each his own place in a seat.

   68. The second argument is that conversion to all-seating will reduce the num bers o f fans who can be
ad m itted to the ground; so, many would-be spectators will be disappointed. This assumes a significantly
greater density being perm itted for standing places th an for seating. It also assumes that the size o f present
crowds regularly exceeds projected all-seated capacity. But the FA’s own evidence showed that during the
1988/89 season the num ber o f occasions when attendances at League clubs exceeded projected all-seater
capacity ranged from nil to 16. The 16 attendances were at Liverpool, who have accepted the need for
all-seating. For only three clubs in the first and second divisions did the attendance exceed the projected
all-seated capacity on more than 10 occasions, an d for 21 out of 44 clubs in these two divisions the
attendance never exceeded the projected all-seated capacity. In only one case (Liverpool) was the average
attendance during the season in excess o f the projected all-seated capacity.

  69. Finally, cost. Spectators do not want to pay and, it is argued, m any could not pay the substantially
higher price o f a seat as against the cost o f standing.

  70. I am not convinced that the cherished culture o f the terraces is wholly lost when fans are seated.
W atching the more boisterous and dem onstrative sections at all-seater grounds, I have noted no absence o f
concerted singing, chanting, clapping or gesticulating in unison. The c om m unal spirit is still there and finds
ready expression. To such extent as the seating limits togetherness o r prevents movem ent, that price is surely
worth paying for the benefits in safety and control.

   71. Moreover, the m axim um density which experience now shows to be acceptable in standing areas tends
to take the force out o f the first two arguments. If standing density is little m ore th a n seating density, the
m elded mass previously found on terraces becomes m ore diffuse and the intensity o f the togetherness
becom es little greater standing than sitting. Likewise, at such a density, the difference between the admissible
num bers standing and sitting become marginal. It can be m ade up by having two or m ore tiers o f seating
where previously there was only one tier o f standing.

   72. As to cost, clubs may well wish to charge som ewhat more for seats than for standing b ut it should be
possible to plan a price structure which suits the cheapest seats to the pockets o f those presently paying to
stand. At Ibrox, for example, seating is £6, standing £4 - not a prohibitive price or differential.

The Trend in the UK
   73. The superior safety o f seating has already persuaded a num ber o f clubs in the U K to convert their
terraces to seating either totally or predominantly. Following Hillsborough, Liverpool have announced their
intention to adapt their famous Kop to seating. In Scotland, Aberdeen’s ground at Pittodrie became all-seater
in 1978; Clydebank followed suit; St Johnstone’s new ground at Perth is all-seated. Wembley stadium will
early in 1990 accom m odate 80,000 spectators, all-seated.

  74. Those opposed to all-seating point out that previous attem pts to introduce it have met with spectator
resistance. Coventry City was the first English club to install seating throughout its ground in 1981. In 1983
the club reverted to allowing 2,000 to stand. In 1985, after visiting fans o f M anchester City tore up seats and
used them as missiles, the ground reverted to standing. Q ueen’s Park Rangers also moved towards all-seated
accom m od ation but removed some seats un d e r pressure from supporters.

  75. Since then, however, Hillsborough has happened; thinking has changed; responsible com m ent by
governm ent, football authorities and m edia has prepared the way for change. Moreover, there are now seats
available which cannot be manually torn and used as missiles. Those at U trecht, for example, have
survived intact for seven years despite usage and deliberate experimental tests o f their strength.
   76. It is possible that in the early stages o f conversion there may be instances o f fans standing on the seats
or in front o f them because they are used to standing or in o rder to register a protest, but I am satisfied that in
England and Wales as in Scotland and abroad spectators will become accustom ed and educated to sitting.
The evidence I have received shows that more recently, where seating has been installed, the fans have come
to accept and like it. At Ibrox Park, for example, the seated areas are the most popular and tickets for them
sell in preference to those for standing. Significantly, trouble from m isbehaviour and physical injuries have
been reduced since most o f the crowd became seated. Such trouble and accidental injuries as still occur are
prim arily in the remaining standing areas. It is planned to convert them to seating in the near future.

Sir Norman Chester Centre Research
  77. The Sir N orm an Chester Centre for Football Research, attached to the University o f Leicester, is
funded by the Football Trust. In N ovem ber 1989 the Centre undertook a survey o f registered members o f the
Football Supporters’ Association to discover the views o f com m itted football fans on a nu m b er o f the issues
after Hillsborough which are covered in my Report. The extension o f seating was one such issue. N um erous
questions were asked on a num ber o f different hypotheses. The Report states th at substantial m ajorities in
the sample were in favour o f m aintaining the status quo on the seats/terraces balance at their own clubs.
However, the Report continues:

  “ 53.6% claimed they would actually support the drive for m ore seating (sic) if they were reasonably priced
  an d covered. The addition o f these last two points - concessions on price and cover - also seemed to have
  dram atic effects in reducing levels o f opposition to the prospects o f all-seated facilities as we shall see
  later”.

W hen all-seating was put to the sample there was a majority against it, but the Report goes on:

  “Finally, and perhaps significantly, opposition in our sample to the introduction o f all-seated facilities
  dim inishes considerably when one introduces provisos on price and protection from the elements. W hen
  this is done, more people in our sample support all-seaters than oppose th e m .”

Europe
  78. The trend towards seating is even stronger in Europe and is now being driven by decrees o f both
national and European football authorities.

   79. In Italy the im m inence o f the 1990 World C up com petition has forced the pace o f progress. T he Italian
M inistry o f the Interior decreed on 25 August 1989 that for open air facilities with a capacity o f more than
10,000 spectators at football games and for covered ones with a capacity o f more th an 4,000 spectators no
standing will be allowed after 30 April 1990. Those facilities m ust have only num bered seats each not less
than 0.45 metres wide. The San Siro stadium in Milan will by then seat 85,000 spectators; the Olimpico
stadium in Rome will seat 87,000.

  80. In Holland, U trecht’s ground built in 1982 has seating for 12,000 and standing room for 8,000. The
club already intended to convert the latter to seating. However, on 6 D ecem ber 1989 the D utch equivalent o f
the FA (the KNVB) agreed with the D utch clubs to cut the standing capacity o f football grounds by 10% each
year over the next decade so as to render football stadia in the N etherlands in effect all-seater at the end o f the
1990s.

  81. In following this phasing H olland’s policy is in accord with a resolution presently u n d er consideration
by UEFA (U nion des Associations Europeennes de Football). The resolution proposes that for the 1990/91
season only 80% o f the standing tickets may be sold, that figure to be reduced every season by 10% until 1999.

   82. FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association) passed a resolution on 26 July 1989
providing that as from the prel i mi nar y com petition for the 1994 World C up (starting in au tu m n 1992)
“m atches may in principle only be played in all-seater stadia” . T he resolution went on “as from 1993 it will
be the duty o f the Confederations and N ational Associations to hold high-risk m atches in their zones only in
all-seater stadia.” High-risk m atches are defined un d er UEFA Regulations as follows:

     “I All UEFA final and semi-final ties o f the UEFA club com petitions as well as final tou rnam ent
        matches o f the European Football Cham pionship.

     II W hen declared as such by UEFA on the basis o f previous incidents o f supporters o f one or both
        team s or o f other exceptional considerations.
     III W hen it is expected th at visiting team supporters will exceed 10% o f stadium capacity or will exceed
         3,000 persons.

     IV W hen full capacity stadium is expected or more th a n 50,000 spectators present.

     V W hen the m atch is likely to attract a large num ber o f emigrants/foreign workers originating from the-
       country o f the visiting team , who live either in the country where the m atch is being played or in
       neighbouring countries.”

   Thus world and European football authorities are clearly determ ined to enforce the conversion o f stadia to
all-seating, so far as international matches and other matches under their control are concerned. It is true that
their resolutions will not be binding in regard to League o r dom estic football matches. But they are a pointer
in the direction o f safety and control and as such have been em ulated by Italy and Holland domestically.

  83. Furtherm ore, I am told by the FA that they regard themselves as duty bound to follow, in the dom estic
football scene, any Resolution passed by FIFA although strictly such Resolution is binding only in
international m atches or matches between U K clubs and clubs from abroad. Thus, the FA regard the
Resolution o f 26 July 1989 as effective in relation to the League, Cup and other dom estic fixtures from 1993
onwards. T he Resolution does not force clubs to install all-seating as a condition o f staging high-risk matches.
There is still the option to use only those parts o f the ground which have seating. Clearly, unless these are
substantial, attendance will be m uch reduced. O ne would therefore expect the m ajor clubs to adapt their
grounds to accom m odate the m axim um seating they can manage by the tim e the Resolution takes effect.
Smaller and more im pecunious clubs may prefer to postpone conversion. However, if a small club with little
seating accom m odation draws a large first division club at hom e in the C up in 1993 (a high-risk match) it will
be able only to use its limited seating accom m odation or the game will have to be played at a better equipped
ground elsewhere.

The Football Spectators Act 1989
   84. The intention to follow this same trend was stated by your predecessor, M r Douglas H urd, in a
statem ent to the H ouse o f C om m ons two days after Hillsborough. He a d d e d :-

  “This would involve the disappearance o f terraces at (major) grounds. It might also involve am endm ents
  to strengthen the Football Spectators Bill so that its provisions for the licensing o f grounds m atched this
  concept”.

  In the event, m achinery for im plem enting increased seating is to be found in section 11 o f the 1989 Act.
There, provision is m ade for the Football Licensing A uthority (set up under section 8) to be directed by the
Secretary o f State to include in any licence to ad m it spectators a condition im posing requirem ents as respects
the seating o f spectators at designated football m atches at the premises; “an d it shall be the duty o f the
authority to comply with the direction” .

Association Football only or Designated Grounds?
   85. In considering seating an d standing, I have concentrated so far on association football because it
attracts the largest and most volatile crowds and has been troubled with misbehaviour. But should
recom m endations about seating be confined to association football or should they go further? W herever a
line is drawn com plaint may be m ade that it is illogical, but two possibilities seem more logical than most;
either to confine recom m endations to the 92 clubs in the Football League or to apply them to grounds
designated under the 1975 Act as am ended. The latter course would include a num ber o f Rugby League,
Rugby U nion and cricket grounds. I acknowledge that so far, happily, m isbehaviour at those grounds has
been m inimal. However, even leaving aside possible m isbehaviour, where there are large num bers there is a
risk o f overcrowding. A well attended Rugby m atch o f either code may attract num bers in excess o f those
attending m any Football League matches. There would seem little reason for requiring a fourth division
League club to convert to seating whilst perm itting m ajor Rugby clubs to keep their terraces indefinitely.

   86. O n the o ther hand, proposals for all-seating would clearly be inappropriate in relation to sports events
at which spectators are accustom ed, and should be entitled, to move about. For example, at horserace
meetings, spectators may wish to view horses in the paddock, place bets, view races from different vantage
points and enjoy the other facilities o f what is a social occasion as well as a sports event. O ther examples of
events at which spectators move about and should be free to do so are greyhound racing and golf
tournam ents.
  87. The criteria for designating a sports ground u n d er the 1975 Act as am ended are laid down in section
KD;
  “The Secretary o f State may by o rd er designate as a sports ground requiring a certificate u n d e r this Act (in
  this Act referred to as a “safety certificate”) any sports ground which in his opinion has accom m odation for
  more than 10,000 spectators.”

  Section 1(1 )(A) perm its the Secretary o f State to substitute such other n um ber as he considers appropriate
for the nu m b er 10,000.

   88. Clearly the purpose o f such designation is to bring safety o f grounds with capacity for substantial
num bers un d er the control o f the local authority. W hilst some grounds with a capacity o f more than 10,000
may currently have an average attendance o f only say 3,000, there is always the prospect o f a visit from a large
club, an attractive C up draw, or an upturn in fortunes bringing in larger crowds. Safety provisions m ust be
capable o f coping with such events. Indeed, danger is more likely to result if there is an occasional m atch with
a large attendance th an if such m atches were regular since those controlling it and those attending it will be
inexperienced.

   89. For these reasons, I think recom m en dation s to increase seating should be applied to all designated
grounds. I appreciate th at the m achinery provided in section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989 can be
used only to regulate the extension o f seating at association football grounds. However, the Secretary o f State
has power und er section 6(2) o f the 1975 Act, as am ended, to provide for securing safety by regulations and
may prescribe term s an d conditions to be inserted in Safety Certificates under section 15 A as indicated in the
next chapter. These powers could be used, even w ithout the provision in section 11 o f the 1989 Act, to
prescribe m andatory rules about seating. So, by a com bination o f his 1989 Act powers and his 1975 Act
powers or solely by exercising the latter, the Secretary o f State can require the progressive extension o f seating
at designated grounds.

  90. I therefore conclude and recommend that designated grounds under the 1975 Act should be required in
due course to be converted to all-seating. I do so for the compelling reasons o f safety and control already set
out; also, so far as association football is concerned, because the present trend at hom e and abroad an d the
rules o f the world and European football authorities make the move to all-seating irresistible.

Phasing
  91. Unless some tim e factors are specified, progress towards all-seating may well be protracted. This is
recognised in the phasing proposed in the UEFA Resolution quoted above and in the m achinery set up in
section 11 o f the Football Spectators Act 1989.

  92. For high-risk association football matches I welcome and endorse the adoption by the FA of the FIFA
Resolution requiring no standing tickets to be sold after 1993 and its application to domestic fixtures.

   93. As to other matches, I consider that w ithout the im petus locally o f the World Cup, which is the spur
for speedy change in Italy, and having regard to the present state o f our grounds, it would be asking too m uch
to require conversion in the U K in the next two or three years. For all grounds designated under the 1975 Act
except for first division and second division League grounds, and national stadia, I think a timing along the
lines suggested in the Resolution under consideration by UEFA (and now adopted in Holland) is reasonable ie
that standing tickets should be reduced by 10% per year starting with a 10% deduction effective from August
1990 and so be phased out by August 1999.

   94. However, I recommend that grounds in the first and second divisions of the League and national stadia
should be all-seated by the start of the 1994/1995 season. It is at those grounds that the larger crowds attend
and, in the interests o f both safety and crowd control, I consider they should have seating for all spectators in
five years rather th an ten years. The reduction in standing tickets should therefore be at 20% per annum from
August 1990 and be complete by August 1994. Any club promoted to the second division of the League should be
given a reasonable period in which to comply. A similar approach should be adopted in Scotland.

Planning Ground Improvements
   95. Increased seating and oth er ground im provem ents will require expert planning and m uch finance. As
to planning, it is crucial that before clubs em bark upon m ajor work, they should have the best inform ation
and advice on m odern ground design. Conversion to seating cannot necessarily be achieved merely by fixing
seating onto existing terraces. For example, sight-lines, access to seats, gangways, roof cover and other factors
m ay require more extensive changes to the layout. Some clubs m ay be able wholly to redevelop their existing
grounds; others may be limited by space, finance o r crowd needs to more m odest alterations. In some
instances, the best course would be to move to a new site either alone or in conjunction with ano ther club.
U ltim ate decisions on these options m ust be for the club m anagement. N o doubt, some o f the bigger clubs
will be able to engage the foremost contractors in this field to advise them and carry out the work. But even
for them , and certainly for the lesser clubs, it would be o f great value to have a body fully apprised o f the latest
developm ents in ground design, capable o f giving expert advice on possible schemes and on ways and means
o f achieving them.

An Advisory Design Council
  96. I therefore support the suggestion of Professor M aunder’s Technical Working Party that there should be
established an Advisory Design Council to fulfil this role. It should, in my view, be set up by the FA and the F L
whose functions should include offering a service of this kind to the clubs. By way o f analogy, in Italy this
function is exercised by the C om itato O lim pico Nazionale Italiano (CONI). After studying many grounds,
including those in M adrid, Vienna a n d Athens, CO N I produced an excellent pam phlet on “ Design Criteria
for Safe Com fortable and Large Sports Facilities” supported by detailed studies showing how they can be
achieved. These, together with m odels which may be inspected at C O N I’s headquarters in Rome, show how a
m odern stadium can be designed from car park to pitch so as to secure safety an d crowd control.

Research
  97. It has come to my attention only recently that the Sports Council published in 1981 a “ H andbook o f
Sport and Recreational Building Design” , and in 1989, a work entitled “Arenas, a Planning, Design and
M anagem ent G u id e ”. The 1981 work included, in volume three, studies on outdoor sports stadia. The 1989
work concentrated on indoor stadia. It seems that neither o f these works was sent to the FA or the FL, nor
have they acquired them . Again, in July 1986, the Institution o f Structural Engineers formed an ad hoc
com m ittee “to bring together all current technical knowledge relevant to the appraisal o f sports grounds and
their individual elements. The co m m ittee’s task was to establish a fully referenced body o f knowledge within
three years which would be com plem entary to the ‘G uide to Safety at Sports G rounds’.” The ad hoc
com m ittee has prepared a fifth draft o f its report which will be finalised after the recom m endations in my
Report have been considered.

   98. It is highly desirable that such worthwhile research as I have m entioned should all be brought together
to achieve m axim um benefit. W ith a form idable building and conversion program m e for football grounds
ahead, an Advisory Design Council set up by the FA and FL could make the best use o f all available research
here an d abroad to assist and advise clubs.

Finance
   99. The scale o f the changes I recom m en d will necessarily require heavy expenditure, albeit over an
extended period. It is not my function to make detailed proposals for financing the work. T h a t is for football
m anagem ent and essentially for the clubs. However, lest it be thought th at I have m ade proposals regardless
o f feasible funding, I ought to indicate sources and m ethods o f finance which should make the im provements
practicable, and some o f the fiscal argum ents which have been addressed to me.

The Football Trust (FT) and the Football Grounds Improvement Trust (FGIT)
   100. Assistance in financing safety measures is presently available from the FT and the FGIT. T he form er
is funded by the three m ajor pools com panies (Littlewoods, Vernons and Zetters) from the “Spot the Ball”
C om petition, at the rate o f 21% o f turnover, yielding over £9 million a year. The total given to British football
since 1958 now approaches £120 million. T he Trustees are empowered to use their funds to prom ote
measures for the control or suppression o f unruly behaviour in relation to football; to assist clubs to meet the
obligations o f the Safety o f Sports G round s Act 1975; to improve grounds and facilities for those who play
an d watch the game and for any o th e r purpose they consider to be a benefit to the game o f football in Great
Britain and N orthern Ireland. The FT allocates just over h alf its income (ie over £4.5 million) to assisting
expenditure by League clubs on ground safety and improvements. This is done through the FGIT, a second
independent trust. T he F G IT was established in 1975, the arrangem ents being modified later in 1979 when
the FT was brought into being.

    101. Although it helps to fund m any o ther works, from those at international grounds down to those at the
lowliest clubs, the Trust continues to give first priority to assisting expenditure essential to the grant o f a
Safety Certificate for a designated ground. U n d e r its trust deed, the F G IT is able to make grants o f up to 75%
o f the total cost available to clubs carrying out work as a necessary condition o f th eir being given a Safety
Certificate under the 1975 Act. Accordingly, should my recom m endation o f m andatory increases in seating
be m ade a condition o f the Safety Certificate, the work would be eligible for a grant from the FGIT.

    102. However, even at £4.5 million a year, the F G IT fund would be insufficient. A dditional financial
requirem ents fell upon the League clubs on the im plem entation o f the 1975 Act and still more after the fire at
Bradford City’s ground in May 1985. By February 1988 over £37 million had been paid out in grants.
Pressures on finance led to the suspension o f im provem ent grants in June 1987. The F G IT was able to
reintroduce im provem ent grant aid on a limited basis during the closed season o f 1988. However, the range
o f works required to upgrade the League grounds inevitably means that resources o f the F G IT would be
spread quite thinly. They will not be sufficient to finance the kind o f im provem ents I have suggested, but the
Trust provides a structure fo rd o in g so. By way o f example, Sheffield Wednesday received a grant o f £595,000
for the im provem ent o f the Kop end at Hillsborough. This was in addition to some £431,000 given to the club
for a total o f 21 safety projects between Septem ber 1978 and O ctober 1988. Even so, funds o f this o rd er will
be insufficient to build new all-seated stands. How then, can additional revenue be generated?

Fiscal Considerations
   103. T hree argum ents have been addressed to me by the football authorities suggesting alterations in tax
structure to make funds available for ground improvements. Fiscal policy is for governm ent and ultimately
Parliam ent to decide, not fo ra judge. All I can usefully do is to set out the arguments.

  (a) VAT on the Spot the B all Com petition
   104. The Football Trust have suggested that if VAT were abolished on receipts from this com petition,
some £5 to £6 million would be available. This would a m ount to a direct subsidy from the Treasury. It would
be contrary as I understand it not only to present government thinking but to long established principles o f
fiscal policy. If that is so, a different and perhaps more propitious approach would be for the FA to urge the
Pool Prom oters Association (PPA) to increase their contribution as part o f a strategy to ensure the healthy
developm ent o f the game from which the PPA makes its money.

  (b) Pool B etting Tax
   105. A second case m ade by the FA is for a reduction in Pool Betting Tax now standing at 42.5%. The
suggestion is a reduction to 40% which would yield some £16 million. This, it is said, could be passed on to
assist ground im provem ents in one o f two ways: either the G overnm ent could continue to tax pool betting at
the current level but make a donation to football equivalent to 2.5% o f the tax recovered, or it could reduce
the tax rate to 40% on the strict understanding that present proposals as to how any reduction o f the 42. 5%
might be used were am ended to allow football to derive the entire benefit from the money thus saved by the
pool companies.

   106. T he FA seek to support their argum ent by reference to the structure o f tax on horse racing. They
claim the com parison shows football to be unfairly treated. In horse racing, the duty on off-course betting is
8%; on-course betting is not now taxed. There is a Horserace Betting Levy which goes to the im provem ent
and m aintenance o f race courses. However, the com parison between football pools and racing is not o f like
with like. T he relationship o f stakes to winnings is different. The Football League presently receives £14
million a year from the PPA for the use o f its fixture list. There is no paym ent sim ilar to this in racing. N o r is
there an equivalent in racing to the Football Trust o r the FGIT. The Horserace Betting Levy is essentially
based on voluntary agreem ent and is not regarded by the Treasury as a tax. There could be no basis for a levy
on football pools unless there were agreement between the PPA and the Football League.

   107. For these am ongst other reasons, the racing analogy may not add weight to the FA’s argum ent on pool
betting tax. However, ap art from that analogy, the FA subm it there is a strong case for some reduction o f the
42.5% tax. The Chester Report o f 1968 recom m ended the establishm ent o f a football levy. T he Rothschild
Royal Com m ission on G am bling recom m ended in 1977 a reduction in the pool betting tax from the level at
that tim e o f 40% to 37% to establish a levy board. The FA and the FL do not favour the creation o f a football
levy board. They consider that the Football Trust and the F G IT are appropriate bodies to receive and
adm inister any money accruing to football were a reduction m ade in the pool betting tax. I can only say that
the case f o r a m odest reduction in the pool betting tax which convinced the Rothschild C om m ission in 1977
is arguably stronger now that the rate stands at 42.5%. It must in general be for com m ercial undertakings to
be self-financing. This applies throughout the entertainm ent industry o f which football clubs are a part. The
football authorities appreciate and accept that they must find the necessary funding substantially from their
own resources. Nevertheless, if grounds all over the country are to be upgraded and in some instances
re-located so as to achieve safety for spectators, im provem ent in the quality o f life for residents near grounds
and a reduction in the expensive police com m itm ent to controlling matches, it can be argued there is a case
for financial assistance, if not by direct subsidy then by some tax reduction.

   108. W hether or not the FA’s argum ent for tax reduction finds favour, there may well be scope for
reassessing and possibly increasing the contribution m ade by pools to football. It would not m atter w hether
such contribution is to be by voluntary levy, by an increase in the present percentage rate on receipts from the
Spot the Ball C om petition or by increasing the am o u n t paid for the use o f the fixture list.

  (c) C apital Allowances
  109. C om plaint is made th at no capital allowances can be claimed against tax in respect o f ground
improvements.

   110. W hen asked why they seem ready and able to spend large sums, som etim es into millions o f pounds,
for a single player in preference to spending money on improving their grounds, the clubs usually give two
reasons.

   111. First, the attendance and satisfaction o f their supporters depends essentially on success; so buying a
brilliant player has priority over ground improvement.

Transfer Fees
   112. They say the popular perception o f transfer fees as excessive and extravagant is mistaken. The
money, I was told again and again, simply circulates round the League clubs. It is calculated to bring on
b udding players. The level o f paym ents is high, but it is forced up by prices continental clubs with huge
financial backing (like Juventus from Fiat) are able to pay.

   113. T he “circulation” argum ent runs like this. First division club A buys an ace player for £1 million
from club B. This enables club B to buy three players at, say, £250,000 each from three o th e r clubs, C, D and
E. Clubs C, D and E each buy two up-and-com ing but not yet arrived players from lesser clubs for perhaps
£100,000 each. So the process and the prices continue downwards eventually enabling the poorer clubs to
keep going by cashing in on players they have trained from scratch. Meanwhile, to finance their £1 million
purchase, club A may sell two or three players who are past their best to lower division clubs. This analysis
may well have some validity, but there are notable exceptions. For example, when a French club bought a
player from an English club for over £4 million the money had not been circulating round the League clubs.

A Levy on Transfer Fees?
   114. Even if the “circulation” argum ent has some validity, the fact rem ains that transfer fees have reached
a level which m any regard as grotesque and certainly out o f all proportion to the am ounts spent on ground
im provem ent. There is a case for the football authorities im posing a levy on such fees, the proceeds going to
the F G IT to fund ground improvements. I suggest consideration be given to this.

Tax “Anomaly”
   115. Secondly (and this is the tax argument) football clubs have a strong fiscal inducem ent to spend on
players rath er than ground improvements. Payments for players are allowable revenue expenditure.
Im provem ents to the ground are not. In Brown (Inspector o f taxes) v Burnley Football a n d A thletic C om pany
L td 1983 A ER 244, it was held that expenditure on a new stand to replace an old unsafe one did not qualify as
an allowable deduction w hether as a repair or as provision o f plant. It is arguable that a fiscal provision which
penalises the redevelopment o f grounds whilst encouraging the paym ent o f huge transfer fees is an anomaly,
that it sends the w rong signals to clubs, and th at it encourages them to neglect questions o f safety in favour of
prom otin g success on the field. To accede to this argum ent m ight fall foul o f the m axim th at hard cases make
b ad law. But as a m atter o f policy, it is argued that the encouragem ent o f expenditure on ground
im provem ents by a fiscal concession m ay well bear re-examination.

Club Financing
   116. W hatever may come from the Pool Prom oters Association via the two Trusts, or from any tax
concession, in the end the bulk o f the finances for ground im provem ent m ust be raised by the clubs
themselves. Here, clubs are at a disadvantage com pared with their European counterparts. O n the continent
most grounds are owned by local authorities which lease them to the clubs. They are regarded as providing a
com m unal facility and often the stadium is available for a variety o f sports and other functions; sports
facilities and offices are built into the stadium complex.
   117. Nevertheless, there are ways o f financing im provem ents if the club m anagem ent is enterprising and
resourceful. Sponsorship is one. Presently it brings £17.5 million into football annually. Advertising on
electric score boards and on hoardings round the ground as well as on tickets, program m es and m em bership
cards is another. Associated companies m arketing sports wear and other m erchandise with the club’s logo,
the sale o f television rights, the issue o f debentures, and the sale o f shares to the public are other methods
which can be and have been used. In particular, I would expect the football authorities to seek the highest
possible price for television rights. U n d e r current contractual arrangem ents, the Football Association
receives some £6 million pa from the sale o f television rights for dom estic broadcasts, o f which some £2.5
million is distributed to clubs. They also receive between £0.75 million and £1 million for the sale o f
television rights overseas. Separate arrangem ents apply at Wembley. The Football League contracted some
two years ago to sell the television rights for League matches for £ 11 million, linked to the Retail Price Index.
The television com panies know that football on the screen has a vast following. They should be expected to
pay a substantial price for the rights to relay popular matches. For their part, the football authorities should
ensure th a t this valuable source o f revenue is directed towards improving stadia as a high priority.

   118. The cost o f covered seating throughout the 92 clubs in the Football League has been investigated by
the FA. Whilst the assessment can only be a rough estimate an d is subject to fluctuations due to inflation and
other factors, the consultants suggested that to install seating throughout all the grounds might cost about £30
million. To provide cover over all those areas could cost a further £ 100 million. It should be noted, however,
that no breakdown o f that figure is given. Moreover, it assumes “all existing uncovered standing capacity
should become covered”. Given current attendances, it would seem unnecessary that all th at capacity should
be covered. In m any instances, attendances are always well below the perm itted capacity o f the ground. In
those cases, a m uch smaller scale solution involving the rebuilding or redevelopm ent o f only part o f the
ground would be sufficient. There would be little point in providing covered seating accom m odation
throughout a ground if there is no realistic possibility o f more th a n half o f it being used. Costs may therefore
be less daunting for the smaller clubs than the consultants’ estimates suggest.

Upgraded Stadia or New Stadia
  119. At m ajor grounds where substantial resources can be generated, vast im provem ents can be m ade on
existing sites if there is sufficient space. I have seen a n u m b er o f imaginative examples o f ground
redevelopment. It has been achieved at Ibrox Park and is in the course o f being achieved at Old Trafford,
W hite H art Lane and H am pden Park, to give only four examples.

  120. However, I agree with the evidence from the Sports Council as to the need for space to facilitate car
parking, external and internal circulation and sufficient exits and entrances to the spectator areas. They
said:-

  “T he location o f m any existing football grounds in central city or town sites precludes this provision (of
  space) which implies the adoption o f a gradual but progressive policy o f disposing o f grounds in densely
  developed areas and replacing the facility on the urban periphery. The Council believes th a t opportunities
  exist for such developments on a self-funding basis in m any instances. This would also provide the
  opportunity for more than one club to be based at newly developed stadia constructed to a high
  specification and built to meet new dem ands for safety an d com fort”.

St Johnstone
   121. I was impressed by the way this had been done at three particular grounds. At St Johnstone in
Scotland, the solution has been to involve private capital directly. The ASDA superm arket chain bought the
site o f the old St Johnstone Football Club in the centre o f Perth, redeveloped it as a superm arket, an d built
the club a brand new all-seated stadium for 10,000 spectators on the outskirts o f the town. The site was, in
effect, donated by a local farmer. It is close to a motorway exit and provides for extensive car parks. I accept
that this confluence o f factors m ight not be easy to reproduce elsewhere. In particular, land prices in some
areas would be prohibitive and planning permission very difficult to obtain. A greenfield site is likely to be in
a conservation or green belt area and the choice o f sites is lim ited by the need to m ake the ground accessible
to townsfolk albeit outside the town.

Utrecht
   122. I saw two examples abroad where these problems had been tackled resolutely. At U trecht an old
stadium on the outskirts o f the town was totally redeveloped on the same site ostensibly at nil cost. The
contracting company which rebuilt the stadium (Ballast N edam ) is now in consultation with 11 clubs in
England and Scotland with a view to building sim ilar projects in partnership with the Football Association
and British Aerospace o f which it is a subsidiary. T h e ir concept involves the recognition that in the past, for
all but a h an d fu l o f days in the year, a stadium complex has usually and wastefully lain deserted. At U trecht
the stadium is owned by the municipality. T he space underneath the stands and in the corners o f the ground
has been developed to provide accom m odation for com m ercial use. The rent provides the municipality with
sports accom m odation which pays for itself. Some 6,000 square metres o f commercial working areas and
24,000 square metres o f commercial offices have been incorporated into the complex. T he commercial uses
o f this accom m odation include office accom m odation, snack bars, sports facilities, photocopying an d office
equipm ent services, a driving school and a hairdresser. The large parking area is used except on m atch days
as a “park and ride” facility for those working in the more congested areas o f the city. The advantages for
business are that shops and offices enjoy a prestigious high profile address with all necessary services and
facilities. For the community, the com m ercial stadium serves as an arena both for trade and recreation.
Appendix 5 is a photograph showing the stadium with the com m ercial infill in the corners and out into the
carpark.

Nimes
   123. The stadium at N im es in Southern France is also owned by the m unicipality . It was built recently on
the outskirts o f the town with extensive parking and good access to road com m unications. T he cost was some
£ 17 million o f which £ 16 million came from the m unicipality itself. The justification for this expenditure o f
public funds is the belief that the stadium is a com m unal asset. It provides not only a stadium for football or
rugby but an extensive range o f other sports facilities built into the complex. These include a gymnastic hall
capable o f hosting international matches, an “o m n isp o rt” hall for tennis, basket-ball and volley-ball, a judo
hall, facilities for fencing and billiards, and a large exhibition hall which, at the time o f our visit, had just
been used for a car sales exhibition.

Local Authority Assistance
   124. All these three stadia are on a com paratively small scale. St Johnstone seats 10,000. U trecht
accom m odates 20,000 and N im es about 2 8 ,0 0 0 .1 accept th a t in the current financial climate and with our
different approach to com m unal funding, local authorities are unlikely to be able to provide subsidies for
such stadia, although local authorities do subsidize, for example, swim m ing baths, theatres and other leisure
facilities which may serve fewer o f their citizens. However, clubs which wish to move from centre town sites
to new sites on the outskirts o f town may well be able to find a purchaser as St Johnstone did with ASDA.
Likewise, those who wish either to build a new stadium on the outskirts or to redevelop their stadium in town
may be able to do so in a way which incorporates space for com m ercial lettings.

    125. In such situations, although the local authority may be unable to assist with finance, it could play a
useful role in bringing parties together an d as planning authority. It could take a favourable view, for
example, o f a planning application which involved the provision not only o f a com m unal sports stadium but
o f further facilities, w hether for sport o r otherwise, benefitting the com m unity as a whole. There has recently
been a n u m ber o f attem pts by clubs to find greenfield sites for new grounds only to be turned down at each
attem pt on planning grounds. Clearly, an application for a football ground in a conservation area or green
belt poses planning problems. But, although the protection o f such areas is an im portant principle, two other
considerations may also carry weight. First, that the quality o f life o f residents living adjacent to a football
ground in a town would be m uch improved by resiting it elsewhere. Secondly, that if we want safety and
improved standards at grounds there are some clubs which will need a new site at which to achieve them. To
this end, local authorities should surely give what assistance they properly can. One useful example o f the
mutual assistance which a club an d a local authority can give each other is an agreement m ade between
Millwall and the L ondon Borough o f Lewisham. The latter agreed to pay £70,000 a year to the club which for
its part agreed inter alia to m ake the ground available for various activities beneficial to the local community.

Ground Sharing
    126. W hether o r not incom e-earning facilities are incorporated into a sports ground, it seems uneconom ic
that the stadium itself should be used by only one club, in effect once a fortnight. T he cost to each club both
o f upgrading or building a stadium and o f m aintaining it could be halved if sensible sharing arrangements
could be made. But there is resistance to this. A nu m b er o f cities have two clubs, each with its own ground.
Such is local rivalry th at the idea o f ground sharing seems an ath em a to many, Yet, faced with the expense o f
seating and ground im provem ent, it would make financial sense. O pposition to sharing an entirely new
ground may be marginally less th an to one club sharing a n o th e r’s existing ground. Recently M r Peter
Robinson, C hief Executive o f Liverpool FC, was quoted as saying:

  “I f someone were to build a high-quality stadium on Merseyside, we and Everton would be quite happy to
  share it - even though the idea m ight not appeal to the fans at first”.
  I f two clubs could sell their inner city grounds with planning permission, the resultant capital would go a
long way to building a m odern shared stadium on a m ore suitable site.

  127. It works abroad. AC M ilan and Inter Milan share the San Siro stadium. In Turin, Juventus and
Torino also share. Genova and S am pdoria provide a third example.

  128. As long ago as 1981, in the Sports C ouncil’s H an dbook o f Sports and Recreational Building Design,
Volume Three (O utdoor Sports), ground-sharing was considered in a technical study o f stadia. T he author,
M r Faulkner Brown, wrote at page 24:—

  “Several courses would appear to be open to football clubs. One is that they might rationalise their position
  and, wherever possible, jointly use a single stadium. This could happen at Sheffield, N ottingham and
  Bristol. Fulham could move in with Chelsea and Brentford with Q ueen’s Park Rangers. Inter-M ilan and
  AC Milan, for all their deep rivalry, do live happily enough together in the giant San Siro stadium . The
  British clubs could all retain their identity, halve their overheads and realise handsomely the value o f their
  freehold properties, if they could cope with their fiercely held views o f club individuality and club pride.

    Another alternative would be, where possible, for clubs to offer unused land adjacent to the stadium for
  development and, in realising the assets from the land, to plough them back into the cost o f stadium
  reconstruction. This, o f course, has h appened at Lord’s an d is having some noticeable effects at the Oval
  and in other county cricket grounds.

    A further alternative is to build additional sports facilities alongside the stadium, not necessarily in
  em ulation o f the ancient Greek example (but nevertheless there is a parallel), so that a large nu m b er of
  sports clubs could use all the facilities. This scheme has been developed to some extent both in the U nited
  States and on the continent.”

Super-Stadia
   129. So far, I have referred only to club grounds. But there is a case for having a small n u m ber of
super-stadia capable o f accom m odating very large crowds for international matches or m ajor Cup ties. At
present, the only such stadium in the U K is Wembley which will accom m odate 80,000 all-seated. Like
Wembley, any other stadia o f large capacity could be available not only for football but for other sports, for
pop concerts and o ther large events.

   130. A consortium comprising British Aerospace, the FA and Ballast N ed am (who built the U trecht
stadium ) is presently considering the building o f a new national stadium at Birmingham to accom m odate
100,000. There is a suggestion that this project, if carried through, would provide a replacement for
Wembley. However, it may well be th a t there is room for both. This would give a venue in London and a
venue in the M idlands for m ajor events. H am p d e n Park has served as Scotland’s international football
ground for many years and when planned im provem ents are complete it should continue to do so. It is
arguable that one more large stadium may be required in the north o f England but the upgrading o f a ground
such as Old Trafford might well suffice to achieve this purpose.

Leadership and Example
   131. I turn from stadia and money to one aspect o f football which gives wide scope for im provem ent at
very little cost. M uch is written about the m isbehaviour o f spectators; but m isbehaviour is often imitative.
Hooligans in the crowd find others who will copy them . Similarly, incitem ent from the pitch o r bad
behaviour by players has a malign influence on the crowd. For many fervent followers, the men on the pitch
are heroes to be revered and em ulated. After a goal, when the scorer dem onstrates to the fans behind the
fencing, the resultant surge forward and hysteria is bad for safety and bad for crowd control. It should not
occur. Worse still, when players fight, the fans follow suit. Lest anyone doubt this, the recent examples o f
fighting between players bear it out. In two o f the four incidents in N ovem ber 1989, crowd m isbehaviour
resulted directly from fighting between players. At Highbury, fans came out on to the pitch to jo in in. At
U pton Park, scuffles between W im bledon and West H am players provoked surging, fighting and coin
throwing on the terraces.

   132. It is in the first instance up to the players themselves, then the referees, the managers and the club
directors to stop both incitem ent and violence by players w hether on or off the ball. The referees, managers
and directors have power to do this. If and when they fail to use it, the FA m ust take a firm disciplinary line
using their very full powers to fine those involved including the clubs and to penalise the clubs in points. If all
else fails, there is no reason why violence on the pitch should have any im m unity from the law o f the land or
from police action.
   133. O n the positive side, m anagem ent could do much to create a better atm osphere in the grounds by
what they say and what they write in program m es and magazines. By consulting with supporters they could
enlist the goodwill an d help o f the decent m ajority to isolate an d rebuff m isbehaviour from the m inority
rather than imitate it. A cam paign for better behaviour could be launched by the clubs through their
literature and backed by managers a n d players using their popular hero appeal.

    134. I should add that violence on the pitch is not confined to soccer. T here has been a growing incidence
o f stampings and punchings in Rugby U n io n games even at the highest level. Reaction from referees, clubs
and even international selectors has tended to play such incidents down. Although spectator behaviour has
not, as yet, been adversely affected by such incidents, the authorities ought to deal firmly with them before
that happens and in any event, simply because violence should be put down.

Family and Membership Areas
    135. M uch progress has been m ade at a n u m b e r o f clubs recently in bringing women an d children back to
watching football by creating separate family areas. Similarly, partial m em bership schemes have enabled
clubs to reserve parts o f the ground exclusively to members. This has had the dual advantage o f creating areas
o f reliable good behaviour and offering discounts, favourable travel facilities an d other benefits to members.
T he good behaviour depends on those who pay for m em bership being more likely to be responsible an d upon
their risking loss o f m em bership if they transgress.

   136. At a n u m b e r o f grounds, family areas have been de-segregated in the sense that families drawn from
away supporters have been perm itted to share family areas with home supporters. I have already indicated
how segregation has tended to worsen hostility between rival fans. It is difficult once segregation has been
practised to dispense with it, certainly at a stroke. These jo in t family areas may prove to be the first step in a
retreat from segregation. If the process can be extended gradually to allowing m embers o f the visiting club to
share the m em bership area o f the hom e club, useful progress will have been made. It will be m ade easier if
there is seating rather th a n standing.

The Disabled
   137. I received evidence from the Royal Association for Disability and Rehabilitation (RADAR) an d the
Access Com m ittee for England drawing attention to the opportunity which redevelopm ent o f grounds
presents to make better provision for disabled people. M any clubs already m ake provision for the disabled
but this is by no m eans universal. Particular attention is needed to the provision o f safe an d adequately
spacious viewing areas for w heelchair users, with a seat alongside for a com panion, protected from the
weather, accessible to toilet facilities designed specifically for the disabled, a n d easily reached from a car park
(with reserved car spaces for Orange Badge holders) by means o f ramps. The needs o f other disabled people -
those who have difficulty walking, the partially sighted, an d those with im paired hearing - require special
attention, for example by the provision o f handrails, clear signposts, steps painted in bright colours, an d the
use o f electronic scoreboards to supplem ent loudspeaker announcem ents, if these people are to be able to
atten d sporting events enjoyably a n d safely. I endorse the im portance attached to these suggestions an d I
hope th at the comprehensive im provem ents which I am proposing will include careful attention to them.
Clubs should regard th em as integral to their planning, not as an optional extra.

Conclusion
  138. I hope in these two chapters I have m ade it clear that the years o f patching up grounds, o f having
periodic disasters and narrowly avoiding many others by m uddling through on a wing a n d a prayer m ust be
over. A totally new approach across the whole field o f football requires higher standards both in bricks and
m o rta r a n d in h um an relationships.
                           PART II - SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS
                                                    C H A PTER 3

                                               THE FRAMEWORK

Minimum Standards of Safety
   139. It is a truism that safety and crowd control are inter-dependent. If a crowd gets out o f control safety
will be in jeopardy. Measures to control the crowd, such as fencing, almost always have an im pact on safety.
Nevertheless, I shall seek to treat each separately. In this Part I shall deal with m anagem ent and features o f
the ground affecting safety.

    140. I have already stressed the need for football m anagem ent to give higher priority to the safety and
well-being o f spectators. Clearly, the cost o f safety measures and improvements can m ore easily be borne or
raised by the successful clubs than by those struggling to keep going. But the safety of spectators invited to a
ground cannot be left to depend upon the affluence o f the club. T here must be prescribed m inim u m
requirem ents which have to be fulfilled at any ground if spectators are to be ad m itted there. T he evidence of
practice pre-Hillsborough and indeed post-Hillsborough, right up to D ecem ber 1989, convinces me that the
provisions presently in place, statutory and otherwise, have not been strong enough to enforce that basic level
o f safety.

Legislation for Safety
   141. T he principal instrum ents aimed at achieving a framework for safety are the Safety o f Sports
G rou nd s Act 1975 as am ended by the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1987 and the H om e Office
G uide to Safety at Sports G rounds (Green Guide).

    142. T he 1975 Act, as am ended, requires a Safety Certificate to be issued by the local authority in respect
o f designated sports grounds. It is an offence (Section 12(1 )(d)) to contravene any term or condition o f the
Certificate. T hus the requirem ents o f the Certificate are m andatory but what those requirem ents should be is
in the discretion o f the local authority.

  143. Section 2(1) o f the 1975 Act provides:-

  “A safety certificate shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or
  expedient to secure reasonable safety at the stadium when it is in use for the specified activity or activities,
  an d the terms an d conditions may be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stadium .”

  144. Originally, certain obligatory terms had to be inserted in Safety Certificates. Section 2(2) provided:-

  “ W ithout prejudice to subsection (1) above, a safety certificate -

    (a) shall specify the m axim um num ber o f spectators to be adm itted to the stadium;

    (b) may specify the m axim um num ber to be adm itted to different parts o f it; and

    (c) shall include terms and co nd itions:-

        (i) as to the number, size and situation o f entrances to an d exits from the stad ium or any part o f it
        (including means o f escape in case o f fire or other emergency) and the means o f access to any such
        entrances or exits;

        (ii) requiring those entrances, exits and means o f access to be properly m aintained and kept free
        from obstruction; and

        (iii) as to the number, strength and situation o f any crush barriers.”

    However, when the Fire Safety and Safety o f Places o f Sport Act 1 9 87 e x t e n d e d the application o f the 1975
Act from sports stadia to all sports grounds, there was substituted for section 2(2), by section 19 o f the 19 87
Act, a new section 2 ( 2) and a new section 15 A giving power to the Secretary o f State by order to lay down what
terms and conditions a Safety Certificate shall include. N o order has yet been made but guidance from the
H om e Office has recom m ended local authorities to approach their function under section 2( 1) in accordance
with the criteria in the superseded section 2(2). (See H om e Office Circular 7 1 / 1 9 8 7 dated 2 5 N ovem ber
 1 9 8 7 , A n n e x A, paragraph 6.)
    145. So, presently, local authorities are not bou nd to include terms or conditions oil any particular aspect
o f safety in the Certificate. In practice, they no dou bt follow the H om e Office guidance. They also take
account o f the G reen Guide.

G reen Guide
  146. The latter, however, is by way o f guidance only. It provides as follows:-

  “6. D eviations from individual guidelines are possible w ithout necessarily detracting from the overall
  safety o f the ground. The variety o f type, function and layout o f sports grounds and the inter-relationship
  o f the different parts o f them m eans that a flexible approach should be m aintained to take account o f the
  p articular circumstances at individual grounds” .

  Such flexibility is obviously highly desirable in relation to some aspects o f the guidance. But flexibility can
become degraded. W here a local authority has chosen to incorporate the criteria o f the G reen G uide into a
Safety Certificate there has been scope for considerable deviation from provisions which ought to c om m and
standard adherence. Thus, for example, at Hillsborough where the Safety Certificate required compliance
with certain G reen G uide recom m endations and a departure was shown to have occurred, the defence was
that the G u ide expressly provided for flexibility so that a deviation from its provisions was a m atter of
legitimate discretion.

   147. In view o f this and evidence I have received suggesting that the G reen G uide may not be followed as
closely as is desirable, I consider that when it is revised it needs to be given more effect. At present there is a
risk o f slackness developing in the absence o f any m andatory provisions. There would appear to be two
alternative courses open. It would be possible to m ake the term s o f the Green G uide m an dato ry throughout.
However, I think that this could be too rigid and in relation to some peripheral matters impractical. The other
course is to make som e o f its provisions obligatory inclusions in the Safety Certificate. I prefer this.

   148. There are some requirements of such crucial importance to safety that it should be mandatory for
Safety Certificates to specify them. I consider those specified in the original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act fall
into this category. Moreover, so far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “shall” should be substituted
for “ may” . This is critical to ensuring that no discrete area becomes overcrowded.

   149. Accordingly, I recommend that the Secretary of State exercise his specific powers under section 15A
or his general powers under section 6(2) by order or regulation to achieve this. In specifying the requirements
in the Certificate, for a particular ground, the local authority should follow the G reen G uid e criteria; but
once that is done an d the appropriate figures and term s for that ground have been decided no room should be
left for flexibility. By the stage when the local authority has specified the requirem ents in the Certificate,
flexibility has been exhausted.

   150. W here a local authority incorporates any other provision of the Green Guide into the Safety
Certificate it should make it clear whether that provision is to be complied with absolutely or with
discretionary flexibility. For example, paragraph 88 o f the G reen G uide provides that a ram p subject to
heavy crowd flow should preferably not exceed a gradient o f 1 in 10. Should a local authority require in a
Safety Certificate th a t a club comply with a G reen G uide recom m endation as to gradients it should make
clear w hether it restricts gradients to a m axim um o f 1 in 10 or whether it leaves flexibility to the discretion of
the club.

   151. In putting the responsibility for the Safety Certificate upon the local authority, Parliam ent no doubt
had two sound reasons; first, since all sports grounds differ in their layout and environs, local knowledge
ought sensibly to be utilised in laying down an d m onitoring terms and conditions; secondly, a local body can
respond quickly to any problem which may arise. Nevertheless, there are two aspects o f such local
ad m inistration which can cause problems.

  (i) The Advisory Group
    152. T he issue, review and enforcement o f Safety Certificates should be based upon efficient professional
inspection and opinion and should be conducted in a businesslike manner. In Sheffield, the Safety
Certificate procedure both for Hillsborough and for Sheffield U n ite d ’s ground at Bramall Lane was
unsatisfactory as 1 indicated in paragraphs 150 to 158 o f my Interim Report. I hope th at this was exceptional.
It is important that there should be a safety team consisting of appropriate members of the local authority’s own
staff, representatives of the police, of the fire and ambulance services and of the building authority. W hat name
is given to this group does not in the end matter. At Sheffield it began by being called the Officer Working Party.
W hen Sheffield City Council took over from South Yorkshire County Council, the nam e was changed to the
“Safety o f Sports G rounds Advisory G ro u p ”, or the Advisory G rou p for short. In my interim
recom m endations (N um ber 17) I said an Advisory G roup should be set up. I had in m ind the type o f safety
team already referred to. Apparently, in some quarters, it was thought that I was suggesting a second body
called an Advisory G roup to advise the safety team. This was not so. Also, in that recom m endation, I
suggested that representatives o f the club and o f a recognised supporters’ club should be m em bers o f the
Advisory Group. I have reconsidered this in the light o f evidence and advice received. T he responsibility for
the Safety Certificate is exclusively th at o f the local authority. I therefore thin k th at the correct course is that
representatives of the club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation should be consulted, since they may
have relevant suggestions or criticisms to make, but they should not be full m em bers o f the team.

  153. I repeat my recommendation that the Advisory G roup’s terms of reference should encompass all
matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and attendance at matches.
There should be a chairman from the local authority, and an effective procedure. Resolutions should be recorded
and regular written reports should be required for consideration by the local authority.

  (ii) A Review Body
   154. The other disadvantage o f Safety Certificates being issued locally is that different standards may be
applied by different authorities even in practically identical situations. A safety team, or some very
influential m em ber o f it, may be much stricter in one place than the com parable authority elsewhere. I have
had complaints that since Hillsborough measures appropriate to a larger ground have been rigidly and
inappropriately enforced at grounds with negligible attendance. Conversely, it is possible that too indulgent
or lax an approach may be adopted or develop in a particular locality. Again, simply left to solve their own
problems, there would be little opportunity for local authorities to learn from com parison with solutions
adopted elsewhere. In these circumstances, it has been suggested that there should be a National Forum in
which local authority teams could meet periodically to discuss an d com pare their procedures, and that there
should be a national overseeing and inspecting body to m onitor and review the consistent discharge by local
authorities o f their certificating duties. Having discussed this with local authority representatives both in
England and in Scotland I am satisfied that two approaches are not necessary. The better course is to have a
National Inspectorate and Review Body. This is now provided for in the Football Spectators Act 1989 by section
13. It is there laid down that the Football Licensing Authority shall have the function of keeping under review
the discharge by local authorities of their functions under the 1975 Act. The FLA may, having consulted the
local authority and certain local officers, require term s and conditions to be included in any Safety
Certificate. The section empowers any inspector appointed by the FLA to m ake inspections and inquiry as
necessary. The local authority may by notice be required to furnish the FLA with inform ation regarding its
discharge o f its 1975 Act functions.

   155. I warmly welcome the appointment of a national body to conduct these inspecting and reviewing
functions. Assuming it successfully discharges those functions, the effect should be to improve the efficiency
and consistency o f practice with regard to the issue and review o f Safety Certificates. This would be enhanced
if the review body were to circulate, to all local authorities from tim e to time, advice based upon their
experience o f problems and solutions at various grounds. (See also R ecom m end ation 16 o f the report o f the
Technical Working Party at A ppendix 3).

   156. Because the Football Spectators Act 1989 applies only to association football, the inspecting and
reviewing role of the FLA would be exercisable only in relation to Safety Certificates at football grounds.
Nevertheless, this remit of the FLA should be extended to cover all grounds designated under the 1975 Act and
indeed all grounds requiring Safety Certificates or licences under P arts III and IV of the 1987 Act. Should Part
I of the 1989 Act either not be implemented or be substantially delayed, the same functions should be given to
another suitably constituted body to cover all sports grounds.

   157. It has been suggested that the Health and Safety Executive could fulfil this function if necessary or
indeed that it could m onitor spectator safety under the provisions o f the Health and Safety at Work Etc Act
1974. However, its resources would need to be increased. Moreover, until now the Health and Safety
Executive, being primarily concerned with the safety o f employees pursuant to the 1974 Act, has not
extended its surveillance to include spectators at football grounds. The H o m e Office evidence on this point is
as follows:

  “The Health and Safety at Work Act could also be used to enforce general spectator safety at sports grounds.
  Section 3 o f the Act is wide ranging in that it places a duty on an employer to conduct his undertaking in
  such a way as to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that persons not in his em ploym ent who may be
  affected thereby are not exposed to risks to their health or safety. A sports or other entertainm ent
•
    “undertaking” would fall within this category. However, it is the stated policy o f the Health and Safety
    Com m ission that, as a general principle, they and the Executive wish to avoid duplication o f enforcement
    with other authorities. The HSE would not therefore generally attem p t to enforce the requirem ents o f
    Section 3 o f the 1974 Act when they overlap with duties im posed by other more specific legislation where
    other authorities have responsibility for policy and enforcement. T he Safety o f Sports G rounds Act 1975
    represents more specific legislation and the Health and Safety Executive does not enforce Section 3 o f the
    1974 Act to secure the safety o f spectators at sports grounds. This arrangement is agreed between the
    Health and Safety Executive and the H om e Office.”




                                                        27
                                                    CHAPTER4

                                         SU BSTA N T IV E P R O V IS IO N S

   158. Having considered the framework for safety provided by the statutory provisions and the Green
 Guide, I must now deal with certain key substantive provisions.

 Capacity
   159. I accept the Technical Working Party’s statem ent th at “the safe allowable capacity o f any viewing
area w hether seated or standing is the least o f (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the num b er o f persons who can leave
through a normal exit system within a prescribed tim e at the end o f an event, (iii) the num b er o f persons who
can leave through an emergency exit system within a prescribed tim e and (iv) the num b er o f persons who can
be ad m itted through the turnstiles serving that area within one hour.” The “prescribed tim e ” for norm al exit
is said in paragraph 230 o f the G uide to be 8 minutes. The “prescribed tim e ” for emergency exit is not
definitively fixed in the G uide as it will vary from area to area. It will need to be determ ined by the local
authority on advice from the Advisory G roup and especially the fire service.

   160. Subject to factors (ii), (iii) and (iv), where there is a properly designed seating area, capacity is simply
determ ined by the num ber o f seats. Increasingly, therefore, problems o f m axim um capacity will fade out as
seating is phased in. But, as long as we have standing areas, grounds will be vulnerable to overcrowding and
m ax im u m limits m ust be set and achieved.

    161. T he Green G uide provides in paragraphs 221 and 222 for a m axim u m density o f 54 persons per 10 sq
metres assuming a terrace or viewing slope in good condition. For some reason, not easy to understand, the
G uide also provides the lower figure o f 27 persons per 10 sq metres when the slope or terrace “materially
deviates from the recom m ended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
packed” . This might be taken to imply that whatever the hazards there is no need to reduce capacity below
27. In the heading to Chapter 16, the Green G uide emphasises that “account should be taken o f the features
o f the individual ground, its configuration, general condition, use and any deviations from the G uide’s
provisions.”

   162. It became clear from evidence before me at both stages o f this Inquiry that not only was the
m ax im u m o f 54 per 10 sq metres grossly exceeded at Hillsborough; insufficient was being done generally to
ensure either by counting or by informed assessment that the G reen G uide criteria were observed.
Accordingly, I reaffirmed the advice in the G uide an d recom m ended that a reduction o f 15% be m ade as an
interim measure to improve the safety margin. The question now is what should be the final recommendation
on this difficult subject.

    163. I entirely agree with the Technical Working Party th a t there is no benefit to be gained from retaining
the lower figure o f 27 or any other m in im um figure. Indeed, it could be a dangerous suggestion. The scale of
permissible density should be from 0 up to the maximum figure applicable only in good conditions. I note
the Technical Working Party’s view that “a uniform ly distributed density o f 5.4/m 2 should be safe in static
conditions in fu ll com pliance with the Green Guide”. However, the words in italics are crucial to their view.
It is one thing to place 54 docile people evenly in an area o f 10 sq metres on a terrace and say they should be
safe. It is quite another if they are excited, if they sway or surge to and fro, if one en d o f the area is a better
viewing point than the other and if account is taken o f possible incidents in the crowd eg a scuffle or a
firework. Any o f those factors can cause bunching; bunching can quickly becom e crushing.

   164. Most clubs have responsibly applied the recom m ended 15% reduction. Some have jib bed at it;
understandably, in view o f its im pact on revenue. O n the other hand, as I have already observed, some Police
C o m m and ers expressed relief that num bers have been reduced. I must also point out that, even whilst the
reduction has been in force, events have shown how easy it is for crushing to occur.

   165. At the start o f the 1989/90 season, on 19 August, Coventry were at hom e to Everton. There were
com plaints afterwards o f congestion and crushing before the m atch outside the turnstiles and after the match
as spectators pressed to get out.

   166. Even more worrying was an incident on 9 D ecem ber at Ayresome Park when Middlesbrough were at
hom e to Leeds. I have not conducted a full inquiry into the incident having no rem it to do so. But I have
received a full report from the police. I have also viewed m ore than once a video film o f what happened. It
was horribly reminiscent o f Hillsborough.
   167. T he following facts are clear. Leeds supporters had been allocated, as a standing area, a wedge-shaped
pen “D ” at the south east corner o f the ground. It was flanked by a narrow sterile area on each side. T here was
a broad gangway running from top to bottom o f pen “D ” . The perimeter fencing at the front o f the pen was
topped with spikes. T here was not a single gate to the pitch. T he only way out for those at the front was by a
gate at each side into the sterile area and thence through another gate to the pitch. Those gates were closed
during the match. T he capacity o f the pen in accordance with my interim recom m endation was 2108. Leeds
supporters were adm itted to the pen, families with very young children being put at the front. The gangway
was not kept clear. Some Leeds supporters m anaged to get tickets for the opposite hom e end o f the ground
causing apprehension o f trouble. A nu m b e r o f them were taken out and moved into pen “ D ” from the pitch
side. O ther Leeds fans with tickets for the wrong end were also allowed into pen “D ” from the back. Shortly
after the m atch started, there was distress am ong those at the front o f the pen. After two surges down part o f
the pen where there were no barriers from front to back, the police had to assist in getting spectators,
especially children, out o f the pen. This was done principally over the fencing although the side gates were
opened and shut a nu m b er o f times. In the event, 14 people had to be treated for m inor injuries in the
am bulance room. Five spectators, three o f them children aged 10, 11 and 12, were taken to hospital with
chest injuries, lacerations and bruising.

   168. The local authority, the police and the club were clearly shocked by this incident and have taken
prom pt remedial action. Additional crush barriers are to be installed, additional gates are to be provided
including one for pen D, the capacity o f that pen is to be halved. Admission to all parts o f the ground, save the
visitors’ section (pen D), is to be for m em bers only to prevent away supporters buying tickets for the home
end. Finally, there is to be a phased program m e which will extend seating to all spectators by 1991/1992.

  169. This incident and its afterm ath pro m p t the query: does there have to be a disaster or near-disaster at
each ground to trigger radical action? I hope not.

   170. The perm itted capacity o f the pen was exceeded, although it is not clear to what extent. The police
view is th a t it was only by about 60 persons. In a sense, the smaller the excess the more the point is m ade that
danger can occur very quickly on a standing terrace even with moderate numbers. Some argue that reducing
num bers and giving spectators m ore room simply enables a surge to gather greater m om entum ; that the
tighter people are packed together the less the scope for surging or misbehaviour. This was the philosophy
which allowed excessive num bers to be packed into pens prior to Hillsborough. The only sensible conclusion
is th at unless both num bers and terrace layouts are strictly controlled, there will always be a risk o f crushing
on a standing terrace. T he com bin atio n o f num bers, excitement and partisanship, even leaving aside
misbehaviour, has a potential for danger.

   171. C om parison with criteria adopted abroad is instructive. France and Belgium adopt the Green G uide
figure o f 5.4/m 2. But in Holland, the m ax im u m standing capacity is 4 /m 2. In Italy, the rule varies between
municipalities. In Milan the figure is 2/m 2. In R om e it is 4 /m 2. But in Italy little difference is recognised in
principle between the figures permissible for standing and those for sitting.

    172. Weighing all these factors I do not th ink it would be right to recom m end a substantial departure from
the effect o f the 15% interim reduction. Now, rather than take a figure and deduct a percentage from it, what
is required is a specific figure for maximum standing density when terrace conditions are good by Green Guide
criteria. I recommend that that figure should be 47 per 10 sq metres and I would substitute 47 for the figure of
54 in the Green Guide. The effect is approxim ately a 13% rather than a 15% reduction from the former figure
o f 54. I wish to stress as forcefully as I can, however, that this figure is a maximum and it is for the local
authority acting on the recommendation of its Advisory Group to make necessary and realistic reductions from
that figure in respect of any feature of the terrace which deviates significantly from Green Guide criteria or has
any other significant shortcoming.

Counting Them In
   173. It is no use fixing a m axim u m capacity for a pen or enclosure unless there are reliable means of
ensuring it is not exceeded. I therefore repeat my recommendation that the number of spectators entering each
self-contained pen or oth er stan din g area m ust be limited electronically, mechanically, by a ticketing
arrangement, by counting or otherwise. T he best arrangem ent is one which makes all facilities for a single
viewing area self-contained; access should be through turnstiles solely serving th at area via a concourse doing
likewise with its own toilets and refreshm ent points. This point has already been clearly m ade in paragraphs
101 and 206 o f the Green G u id e :-

  “ Each section should ideally be self-contained an d should be serviced by its own entrance/exits,
  refreshm ent facilities and to ile ts . . .”
  T h a t way the num bers can be accurately recorded at the turnstiles on entry and no extra spectators can get
into the area from elsewhere at half-time or after visiting com m o n toilets or snack-bars.

  174. Arrangements must be made to close off further access to each pen or area when maximum capacity is
about to be reached and to close the turnstiles leading to the relevant area.

Gangways
  175. T he Green G uide, in paragraphs 97 to 99. makes recom m endations as to gangways as follows:-

  “Spectators should be discouraged from standing in lateral gangways because this disrupts free m ovem ent
  about the ground (or w ithin sections o f it). Also, spectators on the terrace steps behind the gangway may
  have their view obstructed, which will cause them to stretch and strain, and so generate dangerous
  pressures within the crowd. Spectators would be discouraged from standing in these gangways if they were
  sunk from 100mm to 200m m an d if crush barriers were provided behind b ut not im m ediately in front o f
  them.

    Similarly, spectators should be discouraged from standing in radial gangways. These are relatively long
  and uncontrolled downward paths through terraces, and are difficult to keep clear, especially when sited in
  popular viewing areas, eg b ehind the goal area at a football ground. It is helpful to sink them 150mm to
  200m m and to interrupt an otherwise continuously descending gangway by turns along, say, lateral
  gangways.

    W here sinking gangways, lateral or radial, is not thought to be practical, their boundaries should be
  highlighted with paint and spectators advised by signs not to stand there. Stewards may be needed to
  enforce this instruction.”

    176. In my view these provisions need to be much tougher. I agree with the Technical Working Party that
gangways should be kept clear. T here is no point in having them, in calling them gangways and in excluding
them from the area used to calculate capacity under paragraph 221 if spectators are allowed to stand in them .
T he whole point o f crush barriers on terraces is to prevent unrestrained m ovem ent o f large masses o f fans
from back to front down the terrace. It they are allowed to stand in the gangways where there are no barriers,
such m ovem ent can occur w ithout inhibition. The incident at Ayresome Park on 9 Decem ber 1989 involved
ju st that. Two surges causing crushing against the fence came down the terrace unrestrained by barriers.

   177. Whilst paragraph 98 o f the G u ide notes the difficulty o f keeping radial gangways clear, it can be done.
O ne way is to fix a radial rail on each side o f the gangway and parallel to it, inhibiting lateral m ovem ent into
the gangway from the standing areas. A nother surprisingly effective m ethod which I saw used successfully by
Millwall is to put red and white tapes in the same position to indicate the gangway as a no-go area for
standing.

  178. Gangways should be painted in a conspicuous colour (yellow is used most commonly) whether they are
sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be
painted.

Fencing
   179. Perhaps the m ost emotive an d disputed topic in this field is what should be done about perimeter
fences. They were installed at m any grounds to prevent pitch invasions during the 1970s. After Hillsborough
there was a strong clam our to take them down. Some clubs did. W ithin weeks o f Hillsborough, however, there
were unruly incidents involving pitch invasions at more than one ground, as I noted in paragraph 308 o f my
Interim Report. I deferred making any interim recom m endation involving structural alterations at the
interim stage, confining myself to saying that gates to the pitch ought to be kept fully open.

   180. Since then, whilst visiting grounds, I have seen a full range o f practices from one extreme to the other.
There is no consensus. At some grounds eg Highbury, there have never been perim eter fences. At others, like
Anfield and W hite H art Lane, there were fences but they have been taken down. At other grounds the fences
vary in height and design. Some are fearsome high structures with florid arrangements of spikes, redolent of
medieval weaponry. They look m ore suited to a prison than a sports ground. Com ing down the scale, there
are high fences with only vertical spikes and lower fences w ithout spikes; fences o f wire mesh and fences of
strong metal; fences with a good provision o f gates directly to the pitch, fences with only one gate per large
pen (like Hillsborough), and some with no gate at all (as in pen D at Ayresome Park). Again, some clubs have
left their gates to the pitch fully open as I recom mended. Some have taken the gates out and left blank spaces;
some have opened the gates but put red and white tape across the gap; others have kept the gates open during
the m atch, but closed them towards its conclusion to stop pitch invasions at the final whistle. Others again
have kept the gates closed and bolted but m anned individually. At Millwall’s ground, an effective procedure
is followed before each match whereby it is announced over the public address system that stewards will
d em onstrate the gates affording escape to the pitch. The stewards then do so in the m an ner o f an air
stewardess dem onstrating emergency procedures. T he gates are then closed to, b ut not locked.

   181. This wide variety of practices is surprising. If a club were concerned only with its own supporters,
divergence o f practice would be readily understandable. Club A might say: “O u r supporters can be trusted
not to invade the pitch; so no fencing” . Club B might say: “Some o f our supporters have shown that given the
chance they will invade the pitch, so we must have high fences to stop th e m ” . But all the clubs in any division,
including clubs o f type A and B, visit each other; so one has fans o f club B, used to being caged in at home,
being given the chance when visiting club A to invade the pitch. They do not seem to m ake a point o f doing so
with any frequency. However instances do occur, as I have m entioned; they are unpredictable and may
happen at any tim e depending probably upon the occurrence o f some incident thought to be provocative.
W hen they occur, they can cause serious danger. There is risk o f injury to players, to the referee an d to the
police, quite apart from the risk o f injury through fighting between fans. It is true, as is often said, that so far
no fatality has resulted from a pitch invasion, whereas 95 people died against a fence installed to prevent such
invasion. But if fighting between fans starts on the pitch area, it is difficult to stop and injuries can be caused.
At Selhurst Park on 13 May 1989, five police officers and 16 supporters required hospital treatment.

   182. Since each club in a League division has to cope during the season with at least some o f the
supporters o f all the other clubs in the division, the widely differing solutions to the fencing problem m ust be
due to different attitudes rather than objectively different needs. The different attitudes taken by clubs or
local authorities stem from the difficulty in balancing or deciding the priority o f three crucial considerations:

    i.    Fences, especially high, spiked fences, are intimidating, ugly and demoralising.

    ii.   A dequate measures must be taken to prevent pitch invasions for the reasons already given.

    iii. W hatever the measures taken to prevent pitch invasions, there m ust be adequate provision for
         escape in emergencies.

   183. At some grounds, point ii. has been regarded as p a ram o un t so that i. has had to give way. At others,
either point i. or, especially after Hillsborough, point iii. have carried greatest weight so as to remove or
greatly reduce the fencing.

  184. Is there any way o f achieving a satisfactory balance o f all three considerations? I believe so: that it is
possible to have sufficient obstacles to pitch invasion w ithout prison-type fences and also to provide for
escape in emergency. I deal with the three considerations in turn.

  i. H igh Spiked Fences
   185. I agree with the view th at high, prison-type fences with spikes and overhanging sections should go. The
spectacle o f these huge cage-like fences is inconsistent with a sports ground being for pleasure and recreation.
Moreover, I believe such intim idatory fences have an adverse affect on both the morale and the behaviour of
fans. They feel badly treated. H aving to stand in a cage for your Saturday afternoon recreation inevitably
causes resentm ent. R esentm ent often results in hostility to those controlling the match. A sour relationship
develops and continues between the fans and those in authority, making the job o f police and stewards much
more difficult. Being inside the cage provokes some to hurl abuse or missiles at those outside, rival fans,
players or police. T h e security o f the fencing (in that the rival fans cannot penetrate it) encourages bravado to
indulge in such activity. The spiked fences imply an expectation that trouble will or may occur. They also
h am p er a clear view o f the game. To remove them would signal the advent o f a new future for football and
especially a new attitu de from the authorities to the spectators. Accordingly, I consider that when perim eter
fencing is used it should not exceed a prescribed m axim um height and all spike arrangements an d top
sections angled inwards should go. This view is in accord with the recom m endation o f the Technical Working
Party (A ppendix 3 paragraph 20). But what should be the prescribed m axim um height? T hat leads to
consideration ii.
  ii. Adequate M easures to Prevent Pitch Invasions
  186. UEFA regulation B6 o f 1988 requires as follows:-

  “Protection o f the playing field by m eans of

  (a)   a fence o f at least 2.2 metres in height or a m oat or else

  (b)   a barrier with adequate policing so as to make it impossible for spectators to enter the field o f play.

  Fences m ust have sufficient security gates opening towards the playing field and in the case o f m oats or a
com bination o f moats and fences adequate other security passages should be provided".

   187. Inquiries show that the figure o f 2.2 metres was chosen simply by reference to the height o f existing
fencing at various grounds especially in West G erm any and the need to choose a height o f fence which would
am ou nt to “a real obstruction” to pitch invasion. As to the word “impossible” similar inquiries suggest that
the intention was to leave it to the police c o m m and er to decide what resources he might need. Should a pitch
invasion occur, UEFA would consider all the circumstances before deciding what if any action to take.

   188. In my view a fence should be o f sufficient height to be a serious obstacle to pitch invasion. It should
provide sufficient obstruction to enable the police to take timely action should pitch invasion be attem pted
without being so high as seriously to interfere with vision or to give a feeling o f im prisonm ent. Although I
appreciate the UEFA regulation says “at least 2.2 metres” , these criteria lead me to recommend that
perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres. T h a t measurement I take from ground level at the
front of the terrace to the top of the fencing ie the 2.2 metres may consist entirely o f fencing or partly o f wall
and partly o f fencing m ounted on the wall. For example, at Ibrox Park the fencing is about 1.45 metres high
but it is m ounted on a wall and the total height o f wall and fence is 2.2 metres.

   189. In making this recom m endation I am merely indicating a m axim um height should perimeter fencing
be used. I do not suggest there m u st be such fencing or indeed any fencing. Those clubs which presently have
no perim eter fencing may well thin k it safe to continue that way. Others may emulate them . Still m ore may
consider that they can dispense with fencing or bring it to a lower level than 2.2 metres in front o f their family
areas or their seated areas. As the seating areas increase it should progressively be found possible to achieve a
corresponding reduction in fencing. These options, subject to the m axim um height o f 2.2 metres which I
have indicated, should be left to the discretion o f local authorities acting on the advice o f their Advisory
G rou p which will have consulted the club and supporters.

   190. I should make clear that I have thus far referred only to perimeter fencing at the pitch side o f viewing
areas. Different considerations may well apply to the height o f radial fencing used to segregate rival fans. The
m axim um height o f such fences should be a m atter for local decision and may depend for example on
w hether there are sterile areas between pens o f rival fans; but I still recommend that no spikes be used.

   191. Some may feel I am being naive or over-optimistic in recom m ending that fencing be brought down to
a lower level. Hooligans may take advantage o f this relaxation to have, literally, a field day. However, I draw
attention to those grounds where fences have already been brought down to or below the level I recom m end
and others where there are none at all. If we wish to m ake progress, some initiative m ust surely be taken to
stop the cycle of bad behaviour met with repression inducing worse behaviour.

   192. Besides, there are other ways o f deterring pitch invasions than by dauntingly fortified fences. O ne is
to balance the lowering o f the fences with a prohibition against going on to the pitch w ithout reasonable
excuse. I shall deal with th at in the next chapter. T he other is by alternative physical means.

Safety Corridors
   193. O ne m ethod has been adopted, so far successfully, at Anfield, G oodison Park and W hite H art Lane.
It involves reserving a safety corridor or dry m oat between the front row o f standing spectators and a
perim eter fence or wall o f m oderate proportions. The two photographs A ppendix 6 illustrate the Liverpool
and Everton versions o f it. The front few steps o f the terrace are sacrificed as a viewing area and left as a
sterile strip. Behind that area, the front row o f crush barriers is filled in and m ade continuous with no gaps.
T he Everton version has no fence above the perim eter wall. At Anfield there is a low red rail fence. That
arrangem ent does not absolutely prevent pitch invasion, but it inhibits it. Moreover, anyone or any group
m in ded to get to the pitch has first to get over the front crush barrier, then cross the corridor, then get up the
steps or over the wall onto the perim eter track. At W hite H art Lane there is finally a line o f advertising
hoardings to be scaled. By that tim e the police should be able to intervene. At high-risk m atches no doubt
police could patrol the sterile area.
Moats
   194. T he safety corridor at these three grounds is not truly a dry moat. But I have seen examples both in
Holland and Italy o f a concrete dry m oat providing a total obstacle to pitch invasion. At Utrecht, there is a
deep broad moat; provision is m ade to enable spectators to descend into the m oat and use it as a passageway
for entrance and exit. A photograph is at A ppendix 7. At the San Siro stadium in Milan, there is a similar
m oat at one side o f the ground which will be extended all round. At present there is no provision for access to
it or across it to the pitch b ut I was told in Rom e that access to the pitch by bridges will have to be provided to
accord with the Italian regulations.

   195. To interpose a full scale m oat o f the U trecht or Milan type between the spectators and the pitch
requires considerable space. It is easier to provide it as an integral part o f the design of a new stadium than to
introduce it as a m odification o f an old one. At most U K grounds the space between pitch and spectators is
very limited and to introduce a m oat would involve a large loss o f viewing area. Nevertheless, it is a solution
worthy o f consideration and especially so for a new stadium. Its advantage is th at it effectively prevents pitch
invasion without im peding vision or im porting a prison atmosphere. A few rows back from it, you are not
even aware o f its existence. Its disadvantage, apart from the space it requires, is the difficulty o f com bining it
with access to the pitch in emergencies.

  iii Emergency Escape
   196. Hillsborough showed conclusively that, if there are to be perim eter fences, there m ust be sufficient
gates to perm it escape to the pitch and they m ust be immediately available in an emergency. T h at lesson was
reaffirmed by the recent incident at Ayresome Park. I know there is a school o f thought opposed to access to
the pitch in any circumstances, preferring that alternative evacuation routes should all be away from the
pitch. Thus, at some grounds (Hillsborough was one) emergency plans did not require gates to the pitch or
take any such existing gates into account in calculating the tim e required for alternative routes of evacuation.
At Hillsborough, evacuation was to be via the central tunnel, or alternatively through the radial gates at the
back o f the terrace and round the ends o f the west stand. But, if the emergency arises at the front o f the
terraces (as it did) those alternative routes cannot and did not afford timely relief. Presently, although
emergency access to the pitch could readily be gained at both Anfield and Goodison Park, the plans do not
rely on emergency evacuation in th a t direction. T he tragic Bradford City disaster, in which fire swiftly
engulfed a stand, would have caused much greater loss o f life had there not been ready access to the pitch. It
can no doubt be argued that inflam m able stands with neglected underspaces should not recur, that with
m odern stands constructed o f non-inflam m able materials there should be no risk o f a n o ther Bradford, and
that if capacities and safety m easures are observed no Hillsborough situation should recur. T he solemn fact is
that those two disasters did occur. O ne cannot predict what emergency may arise to m ake evacuation away
from the pitch either wholly impractical or too slow.

  197. The UEFA regulation cited above recognises that where there are fences access to the pitch should be
preserved. I agree with that view and recommend th at emergency access to the pitch should be provided.

   198. How should this be done? There is no significant problem where there are either no fences or none
higher than crush barrier level. At Anfield or G oodison Park, for example, it would not be difficult to get over
the front crush barrier into the “dry m o a t” an d thence to the pitch. T h at arrangem ent could be modified to
include radial gangways at intervals running straight down to the “dry m o a t” through gaps in the front
barrier. This would give even readier access. It must be for local judgem ent to balance the need for ready
access to the pitch in emergencies with the need to deter such access otherwise.

   199. T he m ore difficult problem arises at grounds where fences o f up to 2.2 metres are deem ed necessary.
In such fences there must, in my view, be sufficient gates not less than 1.1 metre in width as approved by the
Green Guide. It is no use seeking to specify how many gates will be required by reference to the length of
fencing at the front o f a given pen or other enclosure. T he length o f the frontage is only one factor. Much will
depend on the depth o f the terrace and the num bers it is perm itted to hold. I prefer, in concurrence with the
Technical Working Party (A ppendix 3 paragraph 22) to say th at the gates should be sufficient in number to
enable the pen or other enclosure to be evacuated in the time required for any other emergency evacuation route.
Such gates should be evenly spaced along the frontage of the pen to avoid congestion on exit.

The Gates at Nimes
   200. O ne solution to this problem is the system installed in the new stadium at N im es which I visited
together with the Assessors. There, the fence consists o f a nu m ber o f electrically operated panels which open
as gates to the pitch, as shown in A ppendix 8. There are six sections o f the ground. T he fencing in each section
is governed by a trigger gate which may be operated electrically or manually. T he post upon which it is
m ounted has an electro-magnet which holds the mechanism inside the post in a position keeping the gate
shut. W hen a button is pressed, the magnet is de-activated, the gate descends in its m ounting and is free to
swing towards the pitch. As it does so, it releases the next gate which is also m ounted on a swivelling device
within its post, operating by gravity to open the gate. This do m ino effect continues throughout the section. It
can be arrested by som eone leaning against one o f the gates from the pitch side b ut how far anyone there
could w ithstand substantial crowd pressure is doubtful. T he trigger gate can be operated manually bu t this
seemed to require considerable force. To shut the gate again seemed to require considerable force and a lifting
m otion. The gates are about nine inches higher than the front floor o f the terrace, but there is no sum p such as
often exists in grounds in the UK. T he system could be adapted to U K grounds but there are a n u m b er o f
factors upon which greater reassurance might be required. If the gates were fixed on top o f a low wall such as
that at Leppings Lane, there would be a danger o f crushing in the sum p or at least o f broken limbs as people
tried to get out. The system has been in operation at Nimes for only a few m onths and has not been severely
tested to show that it would be effective u n d e r crowd pressure. Although a firm is licensed to m arket the
system in 34 countries worldwide, o u r inform ation is that so far they have been fitted only at Nimes and
Toulon although one or two oth er French clubs are interested. In these circumstances the robustness o f the
fencing and the effects o f English weather upon it are as yet unproved. At Nim es the system operates with a
level walkway on th e spectators’ side o f the fencing. Apart from a very small step, the pitch is at the same
level. To achieve this arrangem ent would require considerable alteration to the layout o f m any UK grounds
involving in particular raising the lower part o f terraces to make them level with the pitch and with the
b otto m o f the fencing.

Gates Unlocked
   201. I m ade an interim recom m endation to leave gates fully open when the pen or enclosure was
occupied. This was for three stated reasons; first, to afford instant access to the pitch; secondly, to provide
visual reassurance to fans after Hillsborough that there was an escape route and thirdly, to keep police and
stewards alert to conditions inside the gateway. 1 also had in m ind that the num bers and size o f gates might at
som e grounds be in adequate an d I was not making any recom m endation for structural change at that stage.
Along with reduced capacities, provision o f sufficient gates and lower fences, 1 must now consider w hether to
keep or modify my recom m endation to leave gates fully open. I know that some Police C o m m anders have
been anxious that to do so is an invitation to pitch invasion; hence the practice at some grounds o f closing the
gates near the end o f th e game or keeping them shut but not locked. I would still hope that gates would be left
fully open wherever those in command feel this can safely be done. However, I recommend that whether they be
fully open, partially open or closed they be kept unlocked throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is
occupied. They should thus be easily available for emergency exits and spectators should be confident o f this.

   202. I repeat my interim recommendation that all gates in radial and perimeter fences of pens or other
self-contained areas should be painted in a different colour from the rest of the fences and marked “Emergency
Exit”.

Authorising Access to the Pitch
  203. Interim recom m endation nu m b e r 9 provided as follows:-

    * 9. There should be in respect o f each gate in a perim eter fence (or group o f gates if they are close
  together) a police officer authorised to decide whether o r not to allow spectators through a gate to relieve
  overcrowding. . .”

    D espite the m uch greater alertness to the possibility o f an emergency which now exists, following
Hillsborough, I still believe it necessary to make a recom m endation to ensure that proper provision is m ade
for swift action to authorise the opening o f gates in the event o f an emergency. However, it has been drawn to
my attention that strict observance o f this interim recom m endation verges on the absurd where a pen
contains only a handful o f spectators. Moreover, to be bou n d to provide a police officer at each gate or group
o f gates in all circumstances involves a heavy com m itm ent o f police manpow er which would be even heavier
with an increase in the num ber o f gates. Accordingly, I have decided to recommend that although each gate
should be manned when the enclosure is occupied, whether such manning should be by a police officer or by a
steward is for the Police Commander to decide. In either event plans should ensure that the police can authorise
access through gates to the pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

Monitoring Crowd Density
   204. It is convenient to m ention a modification I think sensible regarding interim recom m endation 5.
T hat provid ed :-
  “ * 5. At each m atch, there should be on the perim eter track, for each self-contained pen or other terraced
  area, a steward (if the club is m onitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are m onitoring it) whose
  sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress throughout the
  period th e area is occupied by spectators. W hoever is so appointed should be in ad d ition to any other
  steward or police presence. H e should have ready access to the police officer authorised under
  R e co m m end ation 9 below, and by radio to the control room .”

  I repeat that recommendation (with a slight change of wording to achieve clarity) but qualify it to avoid
absurdity when numbers are small. The recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other
standing area where the spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not
exceed one third of the area’s maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.

Cutting Equipment
  205. In th e im m ediate afterm ath o f Hillsborough, I recom m ended that suitable and sufficient cutting
eq u ipm ent should be provided to enable spectators to be released from behind perim eter fencing. Assuming
the reco m m ended m axim u m capacities are observed, th a t fences are lowered, that sufficient gates are
provided and left unlocked, cutting equipm ent should not be necessary. Something in these provisions would
have to go badly wrong for such equipm ent to be required. Nevertheless, I recommend that the equipment
should be maintained in case of some unforeseen emergency.

Functions of Police and Stewards
   206. W hich functions should be discharged by the police and which by the club’s stewards is one o f the
m ost vexed questions. To describe the background to the argum ent I can do no better th a n repeat what I said
in my Interim Report at pages 28 and 29.

  “W ho should M o n ito r the Terraces?

     161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be both? O r should it be by arrangement,
  d epending upon the ground o r section o f the ground in question?

     162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a m atch on its premises for reward is
  responsible for securing safety at that event. T he Green G uid e (1986) provides:


    “23. T he safety o f the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
    a d m in iste r th e ground in which it is held, ie the “ m anagem ent”. This responsibility applies in both
    n orm al and emergency situations . . .

    195. . . .th e re are five basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

         (a) controlling or directing members o f the public who are entering or leaving the ground, to help
         achieve an even flow o f people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal o f spectators on the terraces or
         viewing slopes;

         (b) patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies, eg raising alarms or extinguishing fires;

         (c) m anning entrances, exits and oth er strategic points, especially exit doors an d gates which are
         continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

         (d) assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control; and

         (e) u n dertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

  T he Interim Popplewell Report
     163. T here was considerable controversy in the course o f the public inquiry held by M r Justice
  Popplewell in 1985 as to the responsibility o f the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report,
  M r Justice Popplewell quoted from a report produced for th e M inister o f Housing and Local G overnm ent
  in 1969 as follows:-

    “T h e responsibility for controlling crowd behav iou r is divided between the police an d the club operating
  the ground. T he broad line o f division being that police are responsible for movem ent o f spectators in
  public thoroughfares an d from public thoroughfares into th e ground, while the club is responsible for the
  control o f spectators once they are on the club’s premises . . .”
 M r Justice Popplewell said he did not quarrel with that view and went on to observe that in practice the
 police have to take charge and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragrap i
 3.8):

   “It follows, therefore, that as a m atter o f practice, while the physical safety o f th e building and the
   m aintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground m ust always be the responsibility o f the club, the
   police have to take the de facto responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all th a t entails, during the
   game...”

 M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation o f the ground as a procedure in which only the police
 could bear the responsibility o f supervising the organisation o f the crowd.

 T he Final Popplewell Report
     164. H e harked back to this subject in chapter 4 o f his Final Report. There, he cam e down m ore firmly
 in favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said Because, as a m atter
 o f practice, police officers have regularly attended in large num bers at football grounds, it has somehow
 been assumed by the clubs th at the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed
 from them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement o f law and order. Those
 responsible for organising a private function, however, have the prim ary and continuing obligation an
 responsibility to ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises. M r Justice
 Popplewell ended that section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly em phasised that it is upon the club, or
 the occupier o f the ground who is putting on the function, that the prim ary and continuing obligation
 rests.”

     165. There remains, however, th e question w hether there are some grounds or parts o f grounds where
  the club may need to rely upon the police (whom they pay to attend) to control filling o f pens and
  m onitoring them for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the
  club, they may need, and by agreement be entitled, to employ the police to act as their agents in certain
  circumstances. This very difficult and grey area as to club and police responsibility will need to be reviewed
  in greater depth at stage two o f this Inquiry.”

  Since Hillsborough was concerned with a disaster on the terraces, I headed that passage W ho should
m o n ito r the terraces?”. But the wider question is: who should control the entry o f spectators, their placing
and movem ent whilst in the ground and their exit from it? It is undisputed th a t the club, as a m atter of law,
has a duty to take reasonable care for the safety o f the spectators invited to its premises. There have, however,
been two practical difficulties about the club, rather th a n the police, being de facto in charge.

  207. First, the club discharges its duty through stewards. They are part-tim e employees or assistants whose
duties are confined to match days. M any o f them are seasoned supporters o f the club and som e tend to e
elderly: others are keen young supporters. D ue either to age or youth, many therefore lack the physique to
cope with awkward customers. They are usually not well paid, part o f their “re m un eratio n” (indeed all of it at
som e clubs) consisting o f the opportunity to see th e game. As the subm ission from the Association of C le
Police Officers o f England, Wales and N orthern Ireland (ACPO) puts it:

  “(Stewards) are at best casual workers (usually working one day in two weeks), they are probably not people
  who have a supervisory role in ordinary life and are not always equipped or used to giving directions or
  facing obstruction. Many are retired people and pay is not so attractive as to guarantee com m itm ent.

  W hilst there are exceptions, I have frequently been told that the stewards presently employed at many
clubs are o f limited capacity and reliability.

   208. Secondly, there has to be a police presence at a m atch to m aintain law an d order. Police are trained to
give an d enforce instructions. This, together with the uniform they wear and the respect for a n d f e a r of the
law which the majority o f spectators have, gives the police far more authority than stewards. Moreover, i
trouble arises, whether from m isbehaviour or from any other cause, the police will inevitably be drawn into
assum ing control. They have all the means to do so at their disposal - the control room , the CC            , t e
planned deploym ent o f serials o f officers round the ground, a com m unications system to co-ordinate them
and reserves on call. T he submission from ACPO suggests that in these circumstances, and to avoid
confusion, the police ought to accept prim e responsibility for controlling the crowd. I quote two passages
from their argument:
  “It may be that the ambiguous position o f the police is part o f the problem - that is acknowledging the
  club’s responsibility for safety on the one hand, whilst routinely assuming all those tasks o f stewarding
  which the stewards cannot do, either because o f the truculence o f supporters or the limited talents o f the
  stewards themselves, on the other. It has to be said that the present lack o f clarity in these arrangements can
  lead to som ething o f a ‘dog’s d in n e r’. In som e clubs th e police actively control the stewards, in others the
  stewards are quite independent and, despite som e im provem ents, standards o f stewarding vary
  considerably with many being too old or simply unreliable...

    ... It may be b etter to acknowledge th at if trouble is anticipated o r if crowd control is going to test the
  ground capacities then, in the interests o f public safety, police should take control over the stewards
  through th eir supervisory c h ain ”.

    “As to the question o f ‘responsibility’, the m atter o f civil liability should not cause us to resile from our
  decisions if they are necessary. Dual responsibility for safety is a recipe for confusion. The police are always
  going to seize th e initiative in a crisis; crowd control is always going to be inextricably linked to criminal
  hooliganism: the police are never going to accept direction from stewards; stewarding will never (at least
  not in the foreseeable future) be able to cope w ithout som e law enforcement backup; and finally police do
  ‘own’ most o f the m eans o f control. In these circum stances the police m ust accept a leading role and,
  despite the requirements and civil liabilities o f football clubs, themselves take on supervision o f the overall
  conduct o f events wherever crowd safety is an issue.”

   209. T he question is one o f balance. Carrying delegation to its ultimate, clubs could lean back and leave it
to the police to take over the m anagem ent o f spectators from street to terraces an d back again, with stewards
performing a m inim al role. This would involve a very heavy police co m m itm ent and indeed the
com m itm ent at present is very substantial. As already indicated, some 5,000 officers or more are deployed
every Saturday at football matches.

Costs of Police and Stewards
  210. The tem ptatio n to the clubs to leave it all to the police is stronger if they are not required to make
realistic paym ent for police services. N o charge is m ade for officers outside th e ground since m aintaining law
and order in the streets is a normal public function o f the police. At the present time, th e practice as to
recovering costs o f policing inside the grounds from clubs varies greatly from place to place, different
formulae being used. In some areas, the charge m ade is the actual cost o f the officers attending in the ground.
At others, it is m ad e on a sliding scale dependent on w hether the m atch is category' A (high-risk) B or C. At
others it is dependent on the size o f the crowd attending. At some, it appears to be entirely arbitrary and at
one ground it is said to be nil. In my view a more consistent and businesslike approach should be made to such
charges. If clubs were to find it m ore economical to recruit efficient stewards than to delegate duties to the
police, there could be a significant reduction in the n u m b e r o f police deployed at football grounds to the
benefit o f the com m un ity at large. If this is to happen, stewards must be fit, active and robust. I would suggest
they should be between the ages of 18 and 55. They must also be fully trained. Some clubs presently have
efficient stewards whom they recruit individually and train fully with the assistance o f the police. Others hire
security firms to bring in a well-trained team o f stewards.

Division of Functions
  211. T here are clearly many aspects o f crowd control and m anagem ent which are capable of being carried
out by efficient stewards. M anning gates, directing spectators to th e correct areas and to their seats, keeping
gangways clear, m onitoring the density o f packing in pens or enclosures - indeed, the duties specified in
paragraph 195 o f the G reen Guide, as already quoted. At most grounds, and in most parts o f each ground,
these duties ought to be capable o f being performed by properly trained stewards. Where that is so, clubs
should require stewards to perform the duties and should not take the option o f leaving all to the police.

  212. However, I accept that there may well be particular areas o f a ground, perhaps on visitors’ terraces
and particularly at high-risk matches, which call for the greater authority and resilience o f the police. W hat
the division o f functions should be must be a m atter for local decision and in the last resort for the Police
C om m a n d e r to determine.

Written Statement of Intent
  213. I therefore repeat my recommendation that there should be a written document setting out the
respective functions of club and police for crowd safety and control “and in particular for the filling of each
self-contained pen or other terraced area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid
overcrowding.” (Interim recom m endation 4). T he aim should be for the club through its stewards to perform
all those functions o f controlling spectators o f which they are capable having regard to th e quality o f the
stewards, the layout o f the ground and the nature o f the match. Where they are not able to discharge any such
function the police should perform it. As the proportion o f seating at grounds increases, control by stewards
should becom e the norm.

  214. In making interim recom m endation 4, I used the phrase “written agreem ent”. This led to anxiety
that what was required was a binding legal contract which would deprive the police o f any flexibility in
response to circumstances o f the day. My intention was not to shackle either party by a binding contract; it
was simply to have a docum ent setting out how functions were to be divided so th a t no m isunderstanding
could arise whereby one party thought the other had undertaken some duty and vice versa. I am content that
the document be referred to simply as a “statement of intent”, so that it can be subject to alteration w ithout
breach o f contract should circumstances so dem and.

Police Commanders
  215. T he ultim ate control at any match must be that o f the Police Com m ander. He has authority to decide
how many officers he needs and to deploy them in and outside the ground. H e has, if necessary, to take such
decisions as to postpone kick-off, to stop the m atch, to evacuate the ground or any area o f it. Police
C om m and ers tend to rem ain in post for lengthy periods. They thus acquire skill, experience and special
knowledge o f the problem s at th eir particular ground. However, there must com e a tim e for change. It is then
essential for the new C o m m a n d e r to have adequate tim e and training to acquaint him self with his functions
and the problems o f policing peculiar to the ground. Training for such functions should be the subject of a
specific course to be attended by senior officers presently acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do
so. Such a course would give induction training in the basic strategy of policing football matches and would also
give opportunity for the pooling o f experience and the solution o f com m on problems.

Rate of Admission
   216. An im p o rtan t causative factor at Hillsborough was the congestion which built up outside the
turnstiles in the last 20 m inutes before kick-off. Twenty-three turnstiles were required to adm it 24,24(5
spectators; only seven turnstiles were available to ad m it the 10,100 with tickets for the west terraces. M uch
was m ade in evidence o f the late arrival o f the Liverpool fans. However, further evidence at stage two o f the
Inquiry suggests that the late arrival o f large num bers is a com m on feature at many grounds. Apart from
those wishing to drink as long as possible (whom I consider in chapter 6) there are many who do not care to
stand or even sit for a long period in addition to the 90 minutes o f the match. Moreover, at all-ticket m atches
or to those with tickets in seated areas, there seems little reason to arrive early since places are assured. The
absence o f any attractive pre-m atch entertainm ent is a further disincentive to early arrival. Whilst measures
should be taken to encourage earlier entry to the ground, it is essential that turnstiles or other entrances can
cope safely and efficiently with spectators as and when they arrive. To do this requires sufficient turnstiles or
o ther entrances to adm it, if necessary, a large late influx without dangerous congestion. T hat involves
assessing th e rate o f flow through turnstiles or gates and the tim e within which they should be capable o f
adm ittin g all the spectators they are intended to serve.

   217. I accept the view o f the Technical Working Party that the G reen G u ide figure o f 750 persons per hou r
is too optim istic a turnstile flow-rate. It may be achieved o r even bettered in ideal conditions. But as soon as
there is a build-up, the flow-rate will diminish. There are also delays caused by those with no tickets, those
with wrong tickets or other problems. I accept the recommendation that 660 should be the maximum notional
rate. The Green Guide should be amended accordingly.

  218. I repeat my interim recommendation that the turnstiles serving a discrete area should be capable of
admitting its holding capacity within one hour. Unless this can be done, there will be a risk o f serious
congestion in the last h a lf or q uarter o f an hour. If it cannot be done, the permitted capacity1of the area must be
reduced accordingly. This recommendation relates to one of the crucial matters contained in the original section
2(2)(c)(i) of the 1975 Act and should therefore be a requirement of the Safety' Certificate.


Communications
  219. T he efficient deploym ent and co-ordination o f police and stewards d epend upon effective systems of
com m unication. R adio systems are susceptible to two problems; excessive air traffic on the channels in use
and the volume o f noise from the crowd.
   220. I f large num bers o f officers are issued with radios and are all entitled to use the same channel,
confusion may result should a m ajo r incident occur. In such an event, m any officers may wish to speak
simultaneously. Especially if the channel is used on “talk-through” (whereby all officers including those in
control give and receive messages without priority) the C o m m an der in the police room may be unable
effectively to issue orders. Again, if the level o f crowd noise is high, as it often is, an officer on the perim eter
track may have great difficulty in hearing messages. Although ear pieces are o f some assistance, they are not
totally successful in excluding crowd noise and are not usually issued to every officer carrying a radio.

   221. M r Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recom m ended that “early attention should be given by
the H om e Office Directorate o f Telecom munications to consider the practicality o f producing a more
suitable personal radio for the police”. In his Final Report, he returned to the subject at paragraphs
4.102-104. By that time, he reported that “a detailed study is being com m issioned by the H om e Office
D irectorate o f Telecommunications into the problem o f personal radios”.

   222. The Directorate produced an upgraded specification. As a result, supplies o f two new m odels have
been m ade available. They are the Philips PFX and the M otorola M T600E. These radios have greater range
and clarity than those previously used. They also give access to many m ore channels. To take advantage of
this, the police have been allocated eight additional U H F frequencies.

   223. Police C om m anders have told me that, in addition to any other channel or channels in use, there
should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate with his senior
officers round the ground. This is o f the first im portance since it enables the C o m m a n d e r to use the
inform ation coming to him in the control room to deploy his forces prom ptly and effectively at any part of
the ground without radio interruption. I recommend this should be done.

  224. As suggested by the Technical Working Party, I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
Report as to communications, with one exception. A sentence in one recom m endation suggested that
“consideration should also be given to the use by police officers o f a simple code o f hand signals to indicate to
the control room the existence o f certain emergencies or requirem ents.” I am persuaded by evidence from the
police that the use of hand signals could create a risk of confusion and I do not therefore repeat that suggestion.

Other Topics in the Green Guide
  225. I have in this chapter considered specifically a n u m ber o f key safety factors covered by the Green
Guide. I have suggested respects in which the G uide should be strengthened or am ended. In ad dition to those
topics, the Technical Working Party considered a number of further aspects of safety - crush barriers, stands,
ingress and egress, stairways and ramps, inspections and testing, fire safety, emergency power and disabled
spectators. I accept and adopt the Technical Working Party’s Report and recommendations on those matters
(A ppendix 3). W ithout repeating them in this text, I add only a few additional comments.

   226. As to crush barriers, paragraphs 25 to 28 o f their report recom m end a sim pler and clearer test
procedure th a n that in the current Guide. In particular, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery
after the required loading test will depend upon the material from which the barrier is constructed eg concrete,
steel or wrought iron. When the Guide is revised, acceptable values for various materials should be specified.

   227. T h e G reen G u ide does, in paragraph 6 o f Annex C, refer to the possibility o f doubts arising as to the
safety o f a b arrier “for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion of
connections)”. It does not, however, presently make any special m ention o f the need to inspect crush barriers
for possible corrosion. T h e evidence from the Health and Safety Executive after their inspection o f barriers
at Hillsborough suggests that corrosion is a serious threat to the safety o f metal barriers. When the Green
Guide is revised, the need to inspect for possible corrosion should be specifically mentioned and emphasised.

Co-ordination of Emergency Services
  228. It is vital that adequate provision should be m ade for possible emergencies arising from fire or
accident an d from illness or injuries however caused. I repeat the recommendations I made in my Interim
Report regarding co-ordination of the emergency services. In addition, although it is m entioned in paragraph
176 o f the Green G uide, I emphasise that “jo in t consultation between m anagem ent, police, fire, am bulance
and o th er emergency services should take place in order to produce agreed plans o f action for all foreseeable
types o f emergency." Such plans should include, for example, contingency arrangem ents for adm issions to
particular hospitals in the event o f a n u m b er o f casualties and consideration o f possible casualty clearing
areas at the sports ground. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control
room to the local headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained at all times so that emergency
calls can be made instantly.
First Aid, Medical Facilities and Ambulances
   229. T h e scale o f available medical facilities has been the subject o f controversy. After Hillsborough, there
were com plaints o f insufficient basic equipm ent such as stretchers. I repeat what I said in my Interim Report
at paragraphs 298 and 299:—

  “298. It would be unreasonable to exp'ect, at any sports stadium , medical facilities capable o f dealing with
  a m ajor disaster such as occurred. To have in advance at the ground, oxygen, resuscitators, stretchers, other
  equipm ent and medical staff sufficient to deal with over 100 casualties is not practicable.

   299. W hat is required is a basic level of provision for first aid, for professional medical attention and for
  am bulance attendance, together with a system o f co-ordination with the emergency services which will
  bring th em to the scene swiftly in whatever num bers are required. W hat will a m o u n t to an appropriate
  basic provision for the future e g th e equipm ent in a first aid room, requires expert evaluation and advice”.

  230. The Scottish ambulance service has developed a “major incident equipment vehicle” designed and
equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties. It is packed with 50 stretchers, blankets, and medical supplies and is
in effect a travelling storehouse for such equipment. A vehicle of that type is deployed in addition to other
ambulance attendance at matches with crowds over 25,000. This provision goes a long way towards meeting the
criticism raised after Hillsborough and I recommend that it be adopted elsewhere.

  231. I repeat the Interim Recommendations I made under this heading subject to two variations. First, it has
been sensibly urged that it is unreasonable to require a medical practitioner to be present throughout a match
where attendance is very small. At such a m atch it is suggested that to have a medical practitioner on call
would be sufficient. I agree with this and recommend that the full-time presence of a doctor should not be
required where there is no reasonable expectation of more than 2,000 spectators attending.

   232. Secondly, some clubs have told m e that they can secure private am bulance services more
economically than those from the appropriate ambulance authority. They accordingly wish to have freedom
to choose. I modify my Interim Recommendation in deference to this argument by requiring at least one fully
equipped ambulance from, or approved by, the appropriate ambulance authority should be in attendance at all
matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

Status of the Green Guide
   233. I have recom m ended that som e safety factors covered by the G uide should be m ade m andatory
requirements in Safety Certificates. Those apart, I consider the G uide should rem ain a non-m andatory set o f
guidelines. Sports grounds vary greatly in th eir layout and fixtures. It m ust be open to a local authority to
judge the propriety o f deviating in som e respect from the Green G u ide recom m endations at a particular
ground. However, I agree with the Technical Working Party that where there is a d eparture from a specific
recom m endation o f the Guide, the local authority should be aware o f it and should be satisfied that such
d eparture is justified for good reason.

Revision of the Green Guide
  234. N either I nor the Technical Working Party have sought to revise or redraft the specific wording o f the
Guide. We have simply indicated where and to what effect it should be altered. Detailed consideration o f the
revision must be for a suitably qualified body to be set up by the H om e Office for the purpose. The Technical
Working Party, in addition to their report, have prepared detailed supplem entary notes on some aspects o f
the G u ide which will be available and I am sure useful to those revising it. Accordingly, I recommend that the
Home Office set up a body to revise the Green Guide as a matter of urgency.

Sports Grounds Within Part III of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
  235. This Part o f the 1987 Act applies in relation to a sports ground which is not a designated sports
ground but which provides covered accom m odation in stands for spectators. A Safety Certificate is required
where such a stand provides covered accom m odation for 500 o r more spectators. By section 27(1) the Safety
Certificate:-

  “shall contain such terms and conditions as the local authority consider necessary or expedient to secure
  reasonable safety in the stand when it is in use for viewing the specified activity or activities at the ground,
  and the terms and conditions may be such as to involve alterations or additions to the stand or any
  installations in or serving the stan d .”
  236. These provisions apply to a variety o f sports such as tennis, golf, horseracing, greyhound racing or
m otor racing.

   237. I have received a num b er o f com plaints that local authorities, perhaps in response to Hillsborough,
have sought to apply th e full rigour o f my Interim Recom m endations to sports grounds requiring a Safety
Certificate und er these provisions, not being designated sports grounds un d e r the 1975 Act. O n occasion this
has been done without regard to the G reen G uide or to H om e Office guidance. Examples given are
requirements in relation to greyhound stadia regarding the presence o f a medical practitioner, the size o f a
first aid room, and capacity o f parts o f the stadium other than the covered stand itself.

  238. T he Green G u id e provides at paragraph 5 as follows:-

  “T he G uide is intended to cover grounds where sporting events o f all kinds are held and where the
  gathering o f large crowds is likely to present a safety problem. However, m uch o f the guidance has
  particular application to football stadia and this should be borne in m ind when applying the G u id e to
  grounds used for other sports and m odifications may prove necessary, because the measures to meet
  problems o f stadia used for association football may not always be necessary at other grounds used for
  other types o f sports. For example, if a ground has no terraced or sloped viewing areas, crush barrier
  requirements are unlikely to be o f concern” .

  A sim ilar approach is appropriate in relation to my Final R ecom m endations. They are essentially directed
towards designated sports grounds. M any are relevant to other sports grounds but will need to be applied
with due regard to the different circumstances at those other sports grounds.

  239. O ne appropriate function o f the inspecting and reviewing body, which I propose should cover all
certificating and licensing o f sports grounds, would be to ensure that recom m endations in the G reen G uide
and those m ade in this Report are applied sensibly across the varied range o f sports grounds.

Sports Grounds Within Part IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987
   240. This Part o f the 1987 Act relates to ind oo r sports licences. It introduced am endm ents to the
L ondon G overnm ent Act 1963 an d the Local G overnm ent (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 requiring
a licence to be granted by the relevant local authority where premises are to be used for “any entertainm ent
which consists o f any sporting event to which the public are invited as spectators” (a “sports
entertainm en t”).

  241. U n d e r this legislation, th e relevant local au thority:-

  “may grant to any applicant, and from tim e to tim e renew, a licence for the use o f any premises specified
  in it for any sports en tertainm ent on such term s and conditions and subject to such restrictions as may be
  so specified” .

  242. I have received evidence from a n u m b e r o f bodies com plaining that the procedure followed in
pursuance of these provisions often requires different applications to be m ade by different applicants for
different “sports entertain m ents” at the sam e premises. Apart from the expenditure o f tim e and effort, such
m ultiple applications tend to be expensive to am a te u r sports organisations which are often impecunious. The
suggestion is m ade that a procedure should be available whereby a licence for a range o f “sports
en tertainm ents” at the sam e premises could be obtained by a single operator periodically. This m atter
merits review by the ap propriate authorities.
                 PART III - CROWD CONTROL AND HOOLIGANISM
                                                 CHAPTER 5

                                  POLICE PLA N N IN G A N D CONTROL

   243. T he role o f the police is crucial to crowd control. In my findings as to what happened at Hillsborough
a n d why, I criticised the police operation on the day and especially som e senior officers. I did, however,
recognise th a t the South Yorkshire Police had a good record, that day apart, for handling difficult crowd
problem s successfully. I also com m ended many ju n io r officers for their efforts to rescue an d assist those
crushed or trapped at Hillsborough.

   244. I should like here to pay tribute to police forces generally for their invaluable work in m aintaining
o rder at sports events and especially in and outside football stadia, Saturday after Saturday. W ithout them,
sports events would be chaotic and indeed many could not be perm itted to take place. T h eir service is often
thankless and not infrequently they are subjected to abuse and worse from those they are there to serve.

   245. They would be superhum an if on occasions they did not react, at any rate verbally, to the stress and
provocation they have to endure. This leads many fans to feel the police are against them. Moreover, it is
often difficult in the confusion o f a crowded scene for firm police action against m iscreants not to impinge
also, o r focus by mistake, on the innocent. T he latter then feel aggrieved and others becom e aggrieved on
th eir behalf.

  246. It is therefore vital that police discipline and self-control be of the highest standard and that friendly
relations with supporters are cultivated. I know an d have myself seen that this is achieved at many grounds.
But there are reports that, at some places, some police treat supporters, especially away supporters, with a
m easure o f contem pt. W hen this happens it unfortunately sours the attitude o f the supporters towards all
police.

  247. Accordingly, Police C om m anders should in their briefings stress the need to balance firm control
with good h u m o u r and patience.

  248. As to the planning of police operations and the techniques to be considered, I repeat my interim
recommendations (numbers 6 and 26 to 30) which are now recommendations 16,44 to 4 6 ,4 9 and 51.

Police Control Room
   249. It is essential to efficient police operations that their control room inside the ground should be well
placed, of sufficient size and well equipped. A n u m b er I have seen have been very good. Some are too small,
however. There should be room for at least the Commander, his deputy and enough officers to man the radios,
telephones and CCTV screens. The room should leave space for others who may need from time to time to visit
the room eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services. The room should
command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator areas surrounding it. It should where necessary be
sound-proofed against excessive crowd noise. Failure to provide the police with a satisfactory control room is
misguided thrift.
                                                  CHAPTER 6

                                                  ALCOHOL

  250. There can be no doubt that excessive drinking by fans significantly aggravates problems o f crowd
control. Because alcohol tends to remove inhibitions and self control, those who have drunk too m uch may
become aggressive and even violent especially when provoked. Short o f this, however, alcohol can m ake fans
resistant to sensible and reasonable instructions, more im patient and less considerate o f others. All o f this
increases the problems for police and stewards in managing large num bers which is difficult enough even
with co-operation.

Legislation
   251. In Scotland, serious crowd misbehaviour, m uch o f it drink-related, led to the ap pointm ent in 1976 of
the Working G roup chaired by M r Frank M cElhone MP. T he recom m endations o f his report were followed in
the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 which m ade it an offence to be in, or to attem pt to enter, a
designated ground while in possession o f alcohol o r to be in, o r to attem pt to enter, th e ground whilst drunk.
It also bann ed the possession o f alcoholic liquor on public service vehicles carrying passengers to or from a
designated sporting event and by a m en dm ent this ban was extended to vehicles adapted to carry nine or
more passengers.

  252. I am in no doub t after discussions with senior Scottish police officers that this measure has greatly
reduced the problem o f m isbehaviour at Scottish football grounds. Sectarian violence still has to be
contained, especially at Rangers and Celtic matches. There is still trouble from the “new hooligan” groups,
known in Scotland as “casuals”. But m uch o f the m isbehaviour o f groups II and III in the Popplewell
classification has abated due to the firm enforcement o f the 1980 Act by the Scottish police.

  253. In England and Wales this lead was followed in the Sporting Events (Control o f Alcohol etc) Act 1985
which m ade sim ilar provisions.

    254. There is, however, an im p o rta n t difference between the Scottish provisions and those applying in
England and Wales. In Scotland, the ban on alcohol is absolute. N o sales o f alcoholic drink are perm itted in
the ground. In England and Wales, section 3 o f the 1985 Act permits Licensing Justices to grant exem ption
from the ban on sales in the ground. This is subject to alcohol not being sold or consum ed at any part o f the
ground from which the sporting event may be directly viewed and to oth e r conditions im posed by the
Justices. It is open to the Justices to revoke or vary an o rd er and the police have power to shut down the sale
o f alcohol at a particular event if they consider it would be detrim ental to orderly conduct or safety.

Alcohol Sales in Grounds?
   255. It is against this background that I m ust consider the submission o f th e FA and others that sale o f
alcoholic drink in football grounds should be generally perm itted without need to obtain an exemption order.
T he argument is that the ban on such sales does not prevent fans from drinking. It merely drives them to
drink in public houses until a short tim e before the match. They then arrive late, often inebriated and
truculent, thereby causing congestion and other problems at entrances. Far better, it is said, to make alcoholic
drink available at the ground so as to bring them in earlier. Since service o f drink inside the ground is slow
and selling points are crowded it is argued that the visitor will be lucky to buy m ore than one round. He is
therefore unlikely to becom e drunk from drinking inside th e ground.

  256. Ideally I accept that people attending a football m atch should be able to buy refreshments including
alcoholic drink just as they can at th e theatre or other places o f entertainm ent. I hope, in halcyon days ahead,
a better atm osphere at football grounds may justify bans being relaxed. I do not, however, think the present
tim e is ripe for such relaxation.

  257. I have m entioned the great im provem ent o f crowd behaviour in Scotland where the ban is absolute
and has been in force now for nearly 10 years. N o doub t oth er factors such as increased seating have played
their part in this. T he im provem ent has been recognised by th e G overnm ent, and is the m ain reason why the
Football Spectators Act 1989 has not been applied to Scotland. Thus M r M oynihan, the M inister for Sport,
said on the T hird Day o f the C om m ittee Stage (Official Report, colum n 83):
    There has been a marked im provem ent in the behaviour o f football crowds in Scotland, which is accepted
   by all parties and the Scottish Football Association. The Scottish Office is monitoring developments
   closely and . . . it does not believe that it is necessary to legislate for a national mem bership scheme in
   Scotland. However, it will be able to take action in the future should the position deteriorate”.

   In England and Wales, the ban has had only four and a h a lf years to operate and is watered down by the
 availability o f exemptions. W here it is thought appropriate, there is nothing to prevent clubs from applying
 to th eir local justices for an exemption. T here may regrettably be places where the local circumstances,
 known to the justices, warrant refusal o f an exemption. At many others, it will be granted as indeed it has
 been already at a nu m b e r o f grounds.

  258. W hen such exem ptions exist, there is no clear evidence to suggest that late arrivals are greatly
reduced. Indeed, the argum ent th a t no-one can get d ru nk in the ground because o f the problems o f getting
served or because only low alcohol beer is available, seems to me contradictory to the m ain argument. Those
who wish to drink full strength beer in quantity will not be m uch attracted by the service offered inside the
ground.

   259. In these circumstances I consider it would be a retrograde or at least prem ature step at this tim e to
restore a blanket licence to sell alcohol at designated sports events. I do not go so far as to suggest that the
total ban applicable in Scotland should be extended to England and Wales ie that no exemptions should be
available. But I do not believe it appropriate to relax the present restrictions.

   260. Are there other steps which could and should be taken to reduce problem s from excessive drinking?

Arrests
    261. I have referred to the provision in Section 2 o f the 1985 Act making it an offence to be in, o r to
 attem pt to enter, a designated sports ground whilst d run k or in possession o f intoxicating liquor. The impact
o f these provisions clearly depends upon enforcement. Here again there is a contrast between Scotland and
England. In England, although arrests are made, there is a tendency to eject many offenders without arresting
them. In Scotland the police take a firm line. They do not eject offenders; they arrest them. The English
approach may partly be due to a com m endable desire not to be seen as hostile to football spectators.
However, it is also a m atter o f expediency. M aking an arrest requires the arresting officer to take the offender
to a police room and go through the prescribed procedure and paperwork. This takes the officer away from
his post for a m in im um o f a quarter o f an hour. At some grounds (Hillsborough was one) evidence suggests a
m uch lengthier absence is com m on. Clearly, if a serial o f eight officers is posted to a bank o f turnstiles, three
or four arrests may greatly reduce the team for a significant period. There is a tendency, therefore, to avoid
making arrests save in the worst cases. I do not wish to advocate repressive measures which would be counter
to all I have said about the need for a new attitude towards spectators. O n the other hand, it cannot be a good
ground for declining to make an arrest that one cannot spare an officer to do it. I therefore recommend that
consideration be given to streamlining arrest procedures so as to divert an arresting officer from his post for
the minimum time. One method I have seen adopted is for the officer to give only basic details o f the arrest
and be photographed with the offender before resuming his duties. He can then return after the m atch to
complete the docum entation.

Closing Bars
   262. In some areas, bars in the vicinity o f the ground are closed either throughout a match day or between
certain hours. This may be required by the Justices or it may be the result o f agreement between police and
publicans. Such a measure may however have limited effect. To close the pubs in a radius o f one or two miles
o f the ground simply diverts drinkers to bars outside that range and may aggravate late arrival. Moreover,
beer from shops with off-licences probably accounts for as m uch pre-m atch drinking as that bought in bars.
This said, it may well be sensible to limit the availability o f alcohol especially before a high-risk match. How
effective the measure can be depends on the locality. In L ondon or other large cities it could have little
impact; in a more isolated town it could be very effective.

Early Kick-Offs
   263. Traditionally, kick-off at football m atches has been at three o ’clock. T hat may formerly have been to
accom m odate those who worked on Saturday mornings. By an oth er tradition, perm itted hours in pubs led to
a recognised drinking period from m id-m orning until three o ’clock. The com bination o f these two traditions
often brings fans to a match with too m uch drin k on board. There is therefore much to be said for an early
kick-off especially in a high-risk match. It gives less o pportunity for prolonged drinking sessions immediately
before the game. A mid-day kick-off gives tim e for away supporters to reach the ground but less tim e for early
arrivals to kick their heels and lift th eir elbows in bars.

  264. It is true th a t an early kick-off will discharge the fans earlier at the end o f the match. Some anxiety
has been expressed as to w hether drunkenness avoided before and during the m atch may have more hours to
build up after the game causing problem s for the police and the local com m unity in the evening. This could
be so, but there are two moderating factors. First, drunken behaviour in the town, although a problem for the
police, is less likely to cause serious danger to many people th a n at a m atch where it may be com po u nd ed by
excitement, partisanship and incidents o f the game an d where large num bers are in a confined space.
Secondly, the segregation exercise often results in the bulk o f away supporters being escorted back to their
road or rail transport as soon as the m atch is over rath er th a n lingering in the town.

Sunday M atches
   265. Sunday matches ought also to be a considered option. O n a Sunday, there is less traffic, especially
commercial traffic, to com pete with those arriving for the match. Arrival, parking and departure are
therefore easier for them in private coaches and cars. It is true that public transport generally on a Sunday is
less plentiful but special arrangem ents are often m ade for m ajo r events. Again, bars and indeed many places
o f en tertainm ent being closed on Sundays, there is less incentive to have a night on the town after a Sunday
game.

                                           T IC K E T S AND T O U T S
Information on Tickets and Signs
   266. It is vital to good crowd control that those attending a sports event should have clear directions where
to go. It makes for confusion and hence added problems for stewards an d police if spectators are milling
about looking for th eir appropriate entrances. The congestion at Hillsborough was aggravated by poor
inform ation on the tickets and poor signposting outside and inside the turnstiles. I therefore repeat my
recommendations th a t tickets and signs should provide simple, clear and consistent information to
spectators.
  267. All available measures should be taken in the printing o f tickets to prevent forgeries being produced.
Computer Record of Tickets
   268. It would greatly help to defeat forgery and theft of tickets as well as assisting in the apprehension of
those misbehaving in the ground, if clubs maintained a record on computer of ticket sales. This is done in
Italy where season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches in seated areas are num bered and a record is
m aintained o f the nam es and addresses o f purchasers. Such inform ation is o f great value to the police in
identifying forgeries and tracing offenders. Clearly, season tickets for seats could be m ade attractive if
favourable terms were offered (especially to young supporters). This would enable the authorities to know for
a whole season who was occupying a particular seat. As seating accom m odation increases this would give
greater inform ation and control.
Fans W ithout Tickets
   269. One problem which creates difficulties for the police is the arrival o f would-be spectators without
tickets at an all-ticket match. Although I found there was not a large body o f such fans at Hillsborough there
undoubtedly w-ere some. At other matches the num bers have not only been large; they have been determ ined
to gain entrance by one means or another. If they could not acquire tickets at the ground they have created so
m uch trouble that the police have judged it best to let them in. Sometimes this has been for payment; on
occasions, even free. The rationale has been that it is better to have troublem akers inside the ground where
they can be m onitored than roam ing round the town at large. Obviously, the practice o f admitting fans
w ithout tickets has a bad knock-on effect. Bands o f fans unable to get tickets believe th a t if they turn up and
create sufficient clam ou r the police will adm it them.
Police Policy
  270. This must not be allowed to continue. It is intolerable th a t those with no tickets should be able to
blackmail their way into a ground. “If you do n 't let us in we’ll force the gates o r wreck your town”, is not a
threat to which a police force should submit. The policy o f adm itting such people is also unfair to those who
have taken the trouble and spent money to buy tickets. It further involves, at a capacity match, letting in fans
for whom there may be insufficient space. It may also create problems o f segregation. Above all, it is allowing
the m ob to rule.
  271. True, I held th at in the crisis which developed at the Leppings Lane turnstiles on 15 April 1989,
opening gate C was justified since life would otherwise have been at risk outside the ground. However, that
was a m atter o f life and death. It arose because o f inadequate facilities and inadequate crowd control. I would
hope such a situation will never recur. If anything like it should recur, preservation o f life must clearly be
param ount. But when the police have an option to let fans without tickets in or keep them out, their policy
must clearly be to exclude them. Unless th at rule is firmly and universally applied and known the problem
will grow.

All-ticket M atches
   272. All the evidence I have received suggests that great caution should be exercised before making a
m atch all-ticket. To do so can assist in achieving segregation. In general, it should how-ever be done only
where a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected. There should then be little difficulty in selling all the
tickets in advance. The point o f m aking such a m atch all-ticket is to prevent the arrival o f greater num bers
than the ground can accom m odate. However, if a less popular m atch is m ade all-ticket, it may turn out that
only a m odest proportion o f the tickets is sold in advance. If then fans arrive without tickets, they will be
aggrieved at being turned away when there is space available. Moreover, the club will be tem pted to give in to
them and sell tickets on the day. This discredits the all-ticket policy an d may cause breaches o f the
segregation strategy. I therefore recommend that all-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a
capacity or near capacity crowd is expected and that, having so designated them, clubs maintain a firm policy of
not selling tickets at the match.
Touts
   273. The recom m endations in the last two paragraphs are designed to deter those without tickets from
turning up at m atches and so obviating any trouble they may be tem pted to cause. However, many fans
w ithout tickets turn up at the ground in the hope o f buying them from touts.

   274. D uring my visits to sports grounds I have found universal condem nation o f touts by all involved in
organising and m anaging large stadium events. A part from the obstruction they themselves cause', touts
attract fans w ithout tickets to attend at grounds in the hope o f getting in. Moreover, they sell tickets to all
comers regardless o f their allegiance. Thus tickets for the hom e area at a soccer match fall into the hands of
away supporters and vice versa. The result is to frustrate the efforts o f clubs and police to achieve peaceful
segregation. Pockets o f alien affiliation planted amongst hom e supporters form a focus for hostility and often
violence results. A part from these objections, voiced by the FA, the FL, the police and the clubs, most
supporters also detest touts because they often corner the m arket for a popular match and offer tickets at
grossly excessive prices.

   275. From all these quarters the plea is to take positive action against ticket touts at football matches.
I am m indful o f the need for caution before advocating a law limiting liberty to conduct oneself and one’s
business freely and according to established practice. I likewise accept that market forces should, in general,
operate freely in the comm ercial field. Nevertheless, I am satisfied from what I have read, heard and seen
that outside football grounds the presence and activities o f touts have a grossly anti-social effect leading both
directly and indirectly to disorder. Directly, through obstruction and the attraction o f numbers without
tickets. Indirectly, because o f trouble from those so attracted who, in the end, cannot or do not buy tickets
and from those who buy their way into an opposition enclave.

   276. Touts operate, o f course, at places oth er than football grounds. They are to be found, for example, at
national rugby stadia, at the All England Lawn Tennis Club at W im bledon and at countless other sporting
events. D epending on how one defines “touting”, the activity could include selling unwanted tickets for the
opera, the theatre or concert halls. Touting usually means, however, not just selling at face value a ticket you
cannot use, bu t selling num bers o f tickets at an inflated price as a commercial venture. There is a clear
distinction between the im pact o f touting at football grounds and elsewhere. Football is the only sport at
which segregation is practised to prevent violence. This is because it is the sport where violence inside and
outside the ground is, at present, most prevalent. There are therefore strong grounds for regarding football as
a special case as the G overnm ent has recognised by prom oting the Football Spectators Act.

  277. W hatever the policy merits o f freedom to trade and market forces, they m ust surely yield to the
m aintenance o f safety and the prevention o f disorder. Touts at football matches put both at risk. At other
sports and in other leisure fields the tout does not endanger safety or order to the same extent. Accordingly,
w hatever view one takes o f him, he can be left to ply his trade there. But so far as football is concerned, in my
view touting should be m ade unlawful. T he fast buck should stop here.

   278. At present, police can deal with touts only by somewhat strained and stretched use o f existing laws.
They arrest them for obstruction even if the physical obstruction caused is minimal. Alternatively, they make
an arrest on the grounds that they suspect the tout o f carrying forged tickets, although the suspicion o f forgery
may merely be convenient conjecture. After holding the tout during the m atch the police release him and the
now valueless but genuine tickets are returned to him . Growing wise to this, many touts now carry only two or
three tickets at a tim e, relying on a ru n n e r to bring up m ore from a “banker“ standing off with perhaps
h undreds o f tickets in his possession. If the salesman is arrested the merchandise is not all lost. Police should
not have to stretch the law to deal with a public mischief. There should be a specific prohibition which police
can then enforce.

    279. How to formulate a prohibition against touting at football grounds will require careful consideration
and drafting. It could be made an offence to sell tickets for and on the day of a football match without
authority from the home club to do so. A nother way would be to prohibit such sales within a specified radius
o f the ground on the day o f the match. Yet ano th er would be to prohibit sales o f tickets for a football m atch at
more than face value. This third alternative would perm it any genuine purchaser o f a ticket who found he
could not use it to recoup his outlay by selling his ticket outside the match. Its disadvantage would be the
difficulty o f proving a tout had sold at m ore than face value; ways would also be devised to evade the
prohibition. I tend to favour the first alternative which is simple and capable o f easy proof. T he genuine
ticket holder, finding him self unable on the day to use his ticket, and not perm itted to sell it outside the
ground, should be perm itted to return it to the club and recover his money. Clubs should be prepared to
accept such tickets in the interests o f fairness and o f having a law which defeats touts. If touting outside the
ground is banned, fans with no tickets for an all-ticket m atch could have no excuse for turning u p outside
hoping to get in.
                                                  CHAPTER8

                              POLICE STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

Cautious Optimism
  280. I tu rn now to ways o f curbing m isbehaviour and dealing with hooligans. At the outset, I m ust record
that there are grounds for cautious optim ism about m isbehaviour inside football grounds although the same
cannot be said o f behav iou r outside and en route. Evidence I have received from various police forces, from
ACPO, from the football authorities and from the clubs suggests that measures taken in the last couple of
years have reduced incidents o f violent m isbehaviour inside grounds. Also, for the first tim e for decades,
there has been a small bu t steady increase in attendances at matches in each o f the last three years. This has
occurred despite reductions in capacity. It is attributed by police and football authorities and by supporters’
organisations to greater confidence by the decent majority o f spectators that violence in the ground is un der
control.

  281. These welcome signs m ust be seen in perspective. D isorder in the ground has been, for the most part,
controlled not eliminated. There have still been occasional outbursts o f violence in recent months. All that
can be said with confidence is that the police are now m uch better equipped and informed to deal with
hooligans than they were three years ago and their operations have been more successful in controlling
disorder.

CCTV
  282. In particular, the installation o f CCTV has greatly improved police surveillance o f the crowd both
inside the ground and at the turnstiles.

   283. In 1985, after the Bradford Disaster, the Football Trust m ade funds available to install C CTV at all
first and second division football grounds. Unfortunately, the systems initially installed, although the best
available at the tim e, proved to be o f inadequate quality for identification purposes. Moreover, operators
initially lacked the training and expertise necessary to make effective use o f the equipm ent.

  284. A n u m ber o f clubs now have better equipm ent and most o f the rem ain d er o f the 92 clubs in the
League have applied to the Football Trust for funding to enable th em to do likewise. The Football Trust, not
unnaturally, wish to be sure the money will be well spent. They have therefore asked that an agreed
specification should be laid down as to the quality o f the C CTV to be installed. ACPO hope to provide this as
soon as possible.

  285. In the two years ending Ju ne 1989, about 200 operators were trained in the use o f CCTV at matches.
A training video is also available to all police forces.

  286. Already, CCTV has had a m ajor impact on the hooligan problem inside football grounds as well as
proving extremely useful to m o n ito r safety measures. If any trouble appears on the screen or is reported from
any q u arter o f the ground, the C CTV can zoom in on the incident. The police can then record w'hat occurs on
colour video and on h ard copy prints. Individuals can be picked out by facial appearance and the colour of
their clothing. The evidential effect o f such a video recording has proved formidable. It has persuaded
hooligans, who would previously have sought to challenge oral evidence o f identification, to plead guilty.
Hooligans know cam eras are keeping a roving watch and their activities in the ground are inhibited by that
knowledge. Police evidence suggest that as a result o f CCTV surveillance and the police strategies it
facilitates, the m ore com m itted hooligans now concentrate th eir activities outside the ground, attacking
opposing fans on their way to or from matches.

National Football Intelligence Unit
   287. ACPO have for some years encouraged the development o f an intelligence network nationwide. A
national index o f football liaison officers was set up to collect, record and pass on inform ation about the
behaviour, past and anticipated, o f club supporters, especially the hooligan element. Thus, before a m atch,
the police responsible for it can receive inform ation from the football liaison officer in the visiting club’s area
as to the propensities o f the visiting supporters and any known plans any element am ong them may have.
Although this scheme has proved useful, the need was recognised for a central unit equipped with a com puter
to gather, record and dissem inate intelligence. ACPO, in their written submission, say:-
•
      “Hooligan gangs operate across a wide area and may o f course be involved in crim inal escapades in any
      town between their point o f departure and the venue o f the fixture. Furtherm ore, in recent tim es there is
      good evidence th a t they will often plan criminal violence which has nothing whatever to do with football.
      There is a need to overview such events to identify patterns and recognise what is behind seemingly
      unconnected events.”

       288.      The N ational Football Intelligence U nit has now been set up. It is based in London; staff are in post;
    the U n it is being funded by the H om e Office. It is hoped the c o m pu ter will be installed shortly. The U n it will
    then be o f great value in dealing not only with domestic football-related crime b ut also with hooligans
    travelling to m atches abroad.




                                                              49
                                                     CHAPTER9

                                         OFFENCES IN THE G R O U ND

   289. Although incidents o f physical violence inside grounds are now m uch fewer, there remains an
undercurrent o f unruly behaviour which can and occasionally does result in disorder. Three activities in
particular have this potential: (i) throwing coins and other missiles (ii) chanting obscene or racialist abuse
(iii) going onto the pitch without reasonable excuse.

    i.   There can be no possible excuse for hurling missiles at a sports ground. It is not only dangerous in
         itself. It may and often does incite others to do likewise; that may and often does provoke retaliation.
         Violence may then escalate.

    ii. No-one could expect th a t verbal exchanges on the terraces would be as polite as those at a vicarage
        tea party. But shouting or chanting gross obscenities or racialist abuse ought not to be permitted. If
        one starts, others join in, and to the majority o f reasonable supporters, as well as to those abused, the
        sound o f such chants from num bers in unison is offensive and provocative.

    iii. Running on the pitch often provokes and is the prelude to disorder. This is not just because it
         interrupts the game or because it invades the hallowed turf. It is often d one with the intention o f
         attacking someone. Even if the invasion is not with intent to attack the referee, a player or opposing
         fans, it tem pts others to follow suit. If rival fans com e onto the pitch violence will probably break
         out. Even if they do not, there may well be violent exchanges with police seeking to repel the
         invaders. A fan may run onto the pitch merely to congratulate a goal scorer. But his action could well
         provoke opposing fans (displeased by the goal anyway) to invade the pitch with less benign intent.

  290. Ought not these activities therefore to be m ade criminal offences? This has been raised before. M r
Justice Popplewell considered the same three activities. After discussing w hether they should be m ade
separate offences, he concluded, on analogy with the Scottish “breach o f the peace” , that a simple offence o f
disorderly conduct at a sports ground would sweep up not only the three activities m entioned above but other
disorderly activities too. He concluded, at paragraph 4.74 o f his Final Report, as follows:

  “4.74 Quite clearly a new offence in England and Wales o f disorderly conduct or breach o f the peace on
  the lines o f the Scottish com m on law offence, would be o f substantial assistance in dealing with
  hooliganism. It would avoid the problem o f trying to define all the different types o f behaviour which give
  rise to disorder at football m atches and would undoubtedly enable the police to take action m uch earlier
  than they can under the present law. This offence should be confined to sports grounds where the
  disorderly conduct is likely to have such a devastating effect on crowd safety. Disorderly conduct would
  clearly include throwing a missile, running onto the pitch, seeking to climb over or to pull down a perim eter
  fence, shining a m irror towards a batsm an, throwing bottles o r cans onto the field o f play, or interfering
  with a greyhound or horse race. I suggest that it should be triable sum m arily and there should be a power o f
  arrest. I recommend, therefore, that consideration should be given to creating an offence o f disorderly
  conduct at a sports ground."

  291. This recom m endation was not taken up. At the time M r Justice Popplewell reported, the Public O rder
Act 1986 was in preparation. It created new offences relating to public o rd er b u t none specifically related to
conduct inside sports grounds. Evidence from the H om e Office gives two reasons for this. First, it was thought
wrong in principle to treat football or sports grounds as a special case. Secondly, it was apparently thought that
the provisions o f the 1986 Act, especially section 5, sufficiently covered the field.

  292. As to the first reason, one m ust surely look at the nature o f the mischief. The three specified activities
would, o f course, be an anti-social nuisance anywhere. But at a designated sports ground they are fraught
with potential disorderly consequences. There is good reason therefore to treat as a special case the
prohibition o f these activities at such grounds. By analogy, having alcohol in one’s blood over a fixed limit
has been m ade an offence only in relation to driving, because it is dangerous to the public in that special
context.

   293. The second reason requires an exam ination of sections 4(1) and 5(1) o f the 1986 Act. So far as is
relevant, these provide as follows:-

  “4( 1) A person is guilty o f an offence if he -

     (a) uses towards another person threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour . . .
         with intent to cause that person to believe th at im m ediate unlawful violence will be used against him
         or another by any person, or to provoke the im m ediate use o f unlawful violence by that person or
         another, or whereby that person is likely to believe that such violence will be used or it is likely that
         such violence will be provoked . . .

  5(1) A person is guilty o f an offence if h e -

   (a)   uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour . . .
         within the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be caused harassm ent, alarm or distress thereby”.

  294. Throwing missiles could only be caught un d e r section 5 as “disorderly behaviour” if the additional
element were proved that it was “within the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be caused harassment, alarm
or distress thereby”. To adduce evidence o f this last element may be very difficult indeed. It should surely be
sufficient to show that the accused threw a missile at a football match.

     295. As to obscene or racialist chanting sim ilar difficulties arise. Although the chanting may be proved
abusive o r insulting it would also have to be shown, un d e r section 4, that it was used “towards another person
. . . with intent to cause th a t person to believe th at im m ediate unlawful violence will be used against him etc”.
P ro o f o f those elements may not be possible.

  296. U n d e r section 5, whilst again the chanting may be proved to have contained “abusive or insulting
words” , it may be difficult to show that this was done “within the hearing or sight o f a person likely to be
caused harassment, alarm or distress thereby” . The words may cause nothing other than disgust.

   297. N o r does section 18 o f the Act help. U n d e r the heading “Acts intended o r likely to stir up racial
ha tre d ”, the section provides as follows so far as is relevant:-

  “ 18(1) A person who uses threatening, abusive or insulting words or b e h a v io u r . . . is guilty o f an offence
  if-

    (a) he intends thereby to stir up racial hatred, or

    (b) having regard to all the circumstances racial hatred is likely to be stirred up thereby”.

  298. Racialist abuse o f the kind chanted at football m atches is probably not intended to stir up racial
hatred. N o r could it readily be proved th a t racial hatred was likely to be stirred up. The effect o f such
chanting is to give cheap and ignoble am u sem ent to those participating whilst causing offence and
em barrassm ent to those abused and to the decent majority o f fans.

  299. For these reasons, I do not consider th a t the activities which M r Justice Popplewell concluded should
be the subject o f a crim inal offence are covered by the 1986 Act. He set out the arguments for and against
legislation to prohibit them at paragraphs 4.42 to 4.74 o f his Final Report. I do not rehearse those arguments.
I agree with his conclusion that on balance, despite the difficulties o f drafting and enforcement, these
activities should be prohibited. M r Justice Popplewell concluded that a “catch-all” offence o f disorderly
conduct at a sports ground should be considered. I appreciate the force o f his reasoning. However, I would
prefer to see separate offences in respect of each of the three activities I have mentioned. The object o f the
legislation m ust be not merely to prosecute offences when they occur b ut to deter them. If there is a specific
offence o f throwing missiles at a designated sports ground, a separate specific offence o f chanting obscene or
racialist abuse there and a third specific offence o f going on the pitch without reasonable excuse there and, if
full publicity is given to the legislation, hooligans will know precisely what is prohibited and that they do
those things at their peril.

  300. As to going on the pitch, I have a reason for recom m ending prohibition additional to those which
convinced M r Justice Popplewell. I have recom m ended lowering the level o f fences and removing spikes and
overhanging sections. T hat relaxation is m ade in the interests o f the decent majority o f supporters who have
no yen to invade the pitch. To back up the lesser deterrent effect o f lower fences I think it prudent to have a
criminal sanction against pitch invasion.

   301. I appreciate that at some sports grounds there is a trad itio n o f running onto the pitch when the game
is over simply from joie de vivre o r to pat players on the back. At Murrayfield, for example, schoolboys sit on
forms on the pitch side o f the perim eter fencing and run on harmlessly at the end o f the game. Again, going
onto the pitch to escape some hazard on the terraces in an emergency should, o f course, be legitimate.
Accordingly, the offence should be aimed at prohibiting invasion o f the pitch w ithout good reason or
reasonable excuse. The police will in this as in many other situations have to exercise sensible discretion and
judgm ent.

                               CLUB STRATEGIES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

   302. Various club schemes to exclude hooligans have been undertaken or suggested.

Luton
  303. In M arch 1985, Millwall visited Luton with a large contingent o f “supporters”. W idespread disorder
broke out causing injuries to both fans and police. Serious damage was also done in and outside the ground as
well as to trains returning to London.

  304. Following this episode, Luton FC decided to adopt a H om e Only Supporters Scheme excluding away
supporters and allowing only Luton m em bers and their guests to attend matches. I am grateful to the
m anagem ent o f Luton FC and to the Bedfordshire police who explained to me the history, operation and
m erits o f this scheme.

   305. Applicants for m em bership normally reside within 25 miles o f Luton. Those further away must
justify why they wish to join. A m em bership card entitles the m em ber to buy a ticket for entry, either in
advance or on the day, and to bring in with him up to three guests. The card has a bar-coding and must be
presented to obtain a ticket in advance. To buy a ticket on the day, the card is “swiped" through a
com puterised reader by the m em ber at an outer set o f turnstiles at the Kenilworth Road end o f the ground.
P aym ent for a ticket is then made at another inner set o f turnstiles. Those m em bers who misbehave are
deprived o f m em bership. A banned list is m aintained on the computer. It consisted, at the tim e I received
evidence, o f only six names. If entry is attem pted by using a banned card, a red light shows and the turnstile
will not open. A steward then escorts the holder to an office outside the turnstiles where the problem is
investigated.

    306. The scheme started in August 1986. The equipm ent installed initially proved unsatisfactory. Some o f
the problem s were: failure through condensation, delay whilst the reader checked the c ard ’s validity, and the
fact th a t a Barclaycard could do the trick. After a n u m ber o f attem pts at rectification, this equipm ent was
a b ando ned and a different firm o f suppliers was engaged. I should m ention that equipm ent from the first
source was installed at Plym outh where it also failed after a n u m ber o f attem pts and the experim ent was not
pursued further.

  307. The second system at L uton has proved effective after some teething troubles. It has been working
satisfactorily now for nearly two seasons.

Benefits of the Scheme
   308. Both the club and the police are happy with the effects o f the scheme. The exclusion o f away
supporters naturally excludes the hooligan elem ent which they would have included. But it also removes the
focus for the aggression o f any hom e hooligans. W ith no visitors to attack or bait, it is said that the hooligan
elem ents in Luton have faded away. They have not sought to jo in the scheme, nor do they seem to travel to
away games. The town has also benefitted. Shops which previously had to board up their windows now enjoy
a peaceful Saturday trade which has increased by 40%. Arrests at matches have dropped from over 100 per
season before the scheme to nil. Police costs have been greatly reduced. The club accepts that initially there
was a fall in attendances, but claims they are rising again. In 1985/6, average attendance was 11,100, in
1 9 8 6 /7 itw a s 10,3 00,in 1987/8 it was 8,038 and in 1988/9 it was 10,039.

  309. The list o f benefits is impressive and there can be no doubt that the scheme has been a success for
Luton. But would it be successful elsewhere?

   310. Luton is, in the football context, somewhat isolated geographically from other clubs, their fans and
their catchm ent areas. In this, its situation differs greatly from, for example, L ondon clubs or those on
Merseyside, G reater M anchester or the M idlands. Hence the assum ption th a t those within 25 miles o f Luton
are likely to be natural Luton supporters. Luton also differs from clubs in the larger conurbations by size of
crowds, th eir average num bers being only about one-quarter o f those at large clubs. The banned list is tiny. An
im p o rtan t feature o f the Luton scheme is the use o f outer and inner turnstiles for which the ground has ample
room. M any other grounds do not.
  311. At Luton, the card-holder him self “swipes” his card through. T he club and the police acknowledge
that, if the card had to be passed to a turnstile operator to “swipe” it through, entry would be considerably
retarded. They also accept that the essential feature o f L uton’s success has been the ban on away supporters
rather th a n the m em bership card scheme itself.

Ban All Away Supporters?
  312. If this is the touchstone o f success in elim inating hooliganism, why not introduce it generally and
have no away supporters at any football m atches nationwide? This has been considered before and rejected.
M r Justice Popplewell in his Interim Report recom m ended that:

  “Urgent consideration should be given to introducing a m em bership system in England and Wales so as to
  exclude visiting fans”.

  However, in his Final Report he modified this and recom m ended that:

  “Consideration should continue to be given to some form o f m em bership scheme for Football League
  clubs in England and Wales”.

  313. Clearly the Governm ent has rejected the idea o f a ban on all away supporters which forms no part o f
the scheme o f the Football Spectators Act 1989.

  314. To exclude all away support would be a draconian step. It would halve the nu m b er o f m atches fans
could attend. It would seriously dim inish clubs’ revenue and deprive football grounds o f a healthy
atm osphere o f rivalry, which some say is a casualty o f the L uton scheme. But perhaps the conclusive point is
that it would be impractical and possibly counter-productive in the cam paign against hooliganism.

  315. To exclude away supporters from Luton is one thing. Those excluded can at least go at present to any
other m atch instead. But to exclude all away supporters from all m atches and especially to exclude them from
“local derby” m atches or m atches in large cities could cause serious disorder. If M anchester City supporters
could not go to Old Trafford when their team plays there, o r Chelsea supporters follow their team to
Highbury or to their neighbours Q ueen’s Park Rangers, trouble could result. There would be attem pts and
devices to defeat the scheme and get into the ground in defiance o f it. T here could well be disorder outside
grounds. T he more fanatical supporters and the hooligans would be unlikely to stay hom e and play patience.

Aw ay Members Only
   316. There is a halfway house between freedom for all comers and a ban on all away supporters. This is to
m ake entry to sections o f the ground for away supporters by ticket only; tickets to be allocated strictly to
m em bers o f the away team ’s travel club and no tickets to be available on the day o f the m atch. This scheme
builds on an existing practice adopted at some grounds for key matches, for example the Liverpool v Arsenal
m atch in May 1989 to decide the cham pionship. It also builds upon existing club m em bership schemes.
M ost clubs have a club m em bership scheme o f some sort following an agreement between the football
authorities and the G overnm ent in February 1987, whereby all clubs were to introduce schemes covering at
least 50% o f each ground’s capacity by the beginning o f the 1987/8 season. Com pliance was patchy and
varied from a m em bership o f over 40,000 at M anchester U nited to one or two clubs which did nothing at all.

    317. The away m em bers only solution encourages the prom otion o f m em bership schemes offering
discounts, favourable travel facilities and other benefits. It aim s to limit away supporters to those, in effect,
vouched for by the away club. M isbehaviour would result in loss o f m em bership and thus exclusion from
future away matches as well as loss o f other m em bership privileges. The scheme has the unan im ou s approval
o f the 48 third and fourth division clubs, given at th eir annual general m eeting in Jun e 1989.

   318. As with any proposed solution to the hooligan problem, this scheme cannot be watertight. It has to be
recognised that any m em bership scheme is vulnerable to abuse arising from the loss or theft of cards and
from the determ ined activities o f those who, for w hatever reason, do not possess them . The away members
only scheme does at least hold out good prospects o f im proving behaviour in the away supporters’ enclosure
since only those vetted by the away club will be allocated tickets there. T h a t may deter others from travelling
but there may still be some who are determ ined to travel and get in. O n occasion, the FA has ordered that a
club’s supporters having a bad record for causing disorder can be ad m itted at away m atches only if they are
accredited members o f their own club. Leeds U nited is an example. This has, on the whole, proved beneficial.
However, on occasions, Leeds non-m em ber supporters - perhaps those living near the ground Leeds U nited
•
    are due to visit - manage to get tickets intended for home supporters at or from the ground. They then get
    into the wrong end and cause trouble. This seems to be what happened at Ayresome Park on 9 Decem ber
     1989. M uch therefore depends upon the care and scrutiny given to ticket allocation by the home club. Often
    it is too easy for segregation plans to be thw arted by ready availability to all o f tickets from the hom e club
    w hether at the box office or even by credit card over the telephone. I appreciate the difficulty o f identifying
    surely home and away supporters but clubs should review their procedures with a view to tightening them .

      319.    Despite its imperfections, I consider the away m em bers only solution has some m erit both in
    excluding undesirables from away supporters’ enclosures and in encouraging the growth o f club m em bership
    schemes conferring real benefits on members. It should be given further consideration.

                        OTHER PO SSIBLE M EA SU R ES AGAINST HOOLIGANS

Exclusion Orders
   320. At present, pursuant to Part IV o f the Public O rder Act 1986, a court, on convicting a person o f an
offence connected with football has power, in addition to im posing a sentence, making a probation order or
discharging him, to make an exclusion order prohibiting him from entering premises to attend any football
match. T he exclusion order must be for not less than three m onths. If a breach is proved, the offender is liable
to im prisonm ent for one m onth, to a fine or to both.

  321. This provision has not m ade m uch impact. It has not been greatly used by the courts. W hen orders
have been made they have tended to be for too short a period. O n one occasion, absurdly, Justices im posed a
three m onth exclusion order on an offender appearing before them in May! A great weakness o f a bare
exclusion order is the difficulty o f discovering w hether it is being obeyed or flouted.

   322. By section 27(5) o f the Football Spectators Act 1989, the provisions o f the Public O rder Act 1986
relating to exclusion orders shall cease to have effect when the Secretary o f State, by Statutory Instrum ent,
brings the 1989 Act into effect. So exclusion orders will go, to be replaced by expulsion from the national
m em bership scheme under Part I o f the 1989 Act and restriction orders un der Part II, as I shall explain in the
next Chapter.

Enforcing Exclusion by Attendance Centre Order
   323. Were exclusion orders to be retained and used more realistically there are two additional measures
which could be taken to enforce them . First, there could be provision for attaching to an exclusion order a
requirem ent to attend at an appointed centre on the occasions o f designated football matches. Failure to
attend would imm ediately be detected and would render the absentee liable to further penalties including
im prisonm ent.

  324. Such a measure would have a n u m b e r o f merits. A mere ban on entering grounds may be flouted
without detection and in any event does not ban presence near the ground. An attendance centre order would
provide a means not merely to ban a hooligan from entry to a ground but to keep him physically from going
there. He would thus be prevented from causing trouble outside o r near the ground as well as inside it. This
would be achieved w ithout adding to the prison population, unless he defaulted, and without any elaborate
scheme impinging on spectators generally. The provision would be the logical counterpart in the dom estic
scene to the provisions o f Part II o f the 1989 Act relating to foreign matches.

Is it Practicable?
   325. I appreciate that detaining convicted hooligans during designated m atches in the dom estic football
program m e is a bigger undertaking and would im pose a m ore restrictive penalty than requiring them merely
to report on the occasions o f English m atches abroad. It is necessary, therefore, to consider the present
structure o f attendance centres, w hat extension o f it might be necessary, the resource im plications and the
fairness o f such a measure.

Attendance Centres
  326. At present section 17 o f the Crim inal Justice Act 1982 empowers courts to make attendance centre
orders for young people under 21 who:

    (a) have been convicted o f an im prisonable offence;

    (b) have defaulted on paym ent o f their fines etc; or

    (c) have failed to comply w ith the requirem ents o f a probation or supervision order.

  A ttendance centre orders may no t be used for those who have previously been given a custodial sentence
except in special (undefined) circumstances. The m in im u m length o f an order is 12 hours, except for those
under 14. The m axim um is 24 hours under 17, an d 36 hours for those aged 17 to 20.
  327. At present there are 137 centres: 111 ju n io r centres for those aged under 17, and 26 senior centres for
those aged 17 to 20 (males only). The senior centres are, for the most part, in the larger conurbations. The
H om e Office has recently reviewed the use o f the ju n io r centres and some with low attendance figures are
being closed.

  328. M ost centres are in school premises. They are normally open for 2 (junior) or 3 (senior) hours every
other Saturday, usually, b ut not invariably, in the afternoon. Each centre is staffed by an officer in charge,
norm ally an off-duty or retired police officer, assisted by other instructors. Regimes include physical
education and at least one other activity.

  329. Subject to these factors, attendance centre orders can be made at present against those convicted o f
football related offences. They cannot however be imposed on anyone over 21, or anyone who has had a
custodial sentence.

   330. Effectively to exclude the offender from football grounds, it would be necessary to have the centre
open at least on every Saturday afternoon during the season. To try to include week-day evening m atches
would create difficulties in making centres available and might be thought too oppressive on the offender. If
power to make orders were extended to cover those over 21 and those who have served a custodial sentence,
the centre would have to provide for a more challenging type o f offender. It would probably be thought
inappropriate to mix 17 to 20 year old attenders with more hardened hooligans.

Resource Implications
   331. Such an extension would probably involve an increase in the nu m ber and calibre o f staff. Presently,
as indicated earlier, staff include retired and off-duty police officers. More such personnel would be required.
However, such increases might be m odest in com parison with the police resources likely to be required to
im plem ent the national m em bership scheme (see paragraphs 420 to 423 infra).

Fairness
  332. I would not suggest that the im position o f an attendance ord er should be a m andatory
accom panim ent to an exclusion order. It would be a discretionary power available to the courts to be used in
accordance with the same criteria as apply in Part II o f the 1989 Act, ie no such order could be m ade unless
the court was satisfied that making it in relation to the accused would help to prevent violence or disorder at
or in connection with designated football matches ( c f section 15(2) o f the 1989 Act). This would enable the
courts to keep the num bers o f orders within manageable limits and to apply them only in serious cases where
the offender might otherwise be in danger o f a custodial sentence.

  333. In such situations, if the offender were judged by the court to be a com m itted football hooligan, and
were required to attend for say two hours each Saturday in the football season, to a m axim um o f 36 hours (ie
nearly h a lf a season) or even 72 hours, he could not surely have any just grievance. The order would be less
harsh th a n even the shortest prison sentence and, from the public’s point o f view, m uch m ore effective.

   334. I recognise the practical difficulties in implementing extended attendance centre orders but, if those
difficulties can be overcome, the scheme would have considerable merits. I accordingly recommend that
consideration be given to implementing it.

Tagging
  <

  335. A second possible measure to enforce exclusion from the ground and its environs is electronic
m onitoring or tagging. This device is used successfully in the U nited States. Pilot schemes are presently being
run here by the H om e Office. Accused persons on rem and are kept un der supervision using anklets with
small radio transm itters linked to a central computer. Despite reports o f some difficulty with the pilot
schemes, M r Jo h n Patten in an answer to a Parliam entary Q uestion on 10 January 1989 stated:-

  “ It is already clear that the technology can be put to practical use and that the procedures for fitting the
  eq u ip m en t an d m onitoring defendants are practicable. It would now be desirable to test the use of
  electronic m onitoring on a trial basis in an area in which substantial num bers are likely to be eligible for its
  application as a condition o f bail.”

Moreover, you are reported as having said to the Bow G roup on 11 D ecem ber 1989:-
  “There is a need for courts to have powers to make curfew orders, confining offenders to their hom es at
  certain times. This should not be a 24 hour house arrest. They need to be able to go to work if they have a
  job, attend training courses or probation centres, or receive treatm ent for alcohol or drug misuse. But some
  types o f crime - pub brawls, for example, or car thefts - could be reduced by curfew orders. I very much
  hope that our experim ents with electronic m onitoring will enable it to be extended from defendants on
  rem an d to sentenced offenders, so as to make a curfew order properly enforceable".

  336. If the experim ents do enable the tagging to be extended to sentenced offenders, it would be a most
useful an d effective way o f ordering convicted hooligans, excluded from grounds, to rem ain at home during
designated matches. T heir obedience to the orders could be m onitored w ithout excessive resource
requirem ents.

   337. I therefore recommend th at consideration be given to using this technology in the sentencing of
offenders convicted of football-related offences.

                   PART IV - THE FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT 1989
                                                  CHAPTER 12

                                 OBJECT AND PROVISIONS OF THE ACT

   338. The principal object o f the Football Spectators Act is to break the link between football and
hooliganism. It aim s to do this by a national mem bership scheme requiring spectators to purchase and hold
m em bership cards w ithout which they will not gain adm ission. Those who com m it relevant offences or
otherwise misbehave in a football context will be deprived o f m em bership and thus be excluded from
attending matches. It is hoped that by this strategy hooligan activity will be elim inated both inside and
outside football grounds. Thus, M r Ridley, then Secretary o f State for the Environm ent, said at the launch of
the Bill on 17 Jan uary 1989:—

  “ For the first tim e, there will be an effective and com prehensive procedure to keep hooligans away from
  football matches. O f course there will be attem pts to abuse the system but if the scheme is effective, those
  attem pts will fail. We believe that it offers the real prospect o f ending football hooliganism both inside and
  outside grounds. If hooligans know that they will not be allowed into football matches, they will have no
  incentive to travel to them. The link between football and hooliganism will be broken and football will
  cease to be a focus for violence.”

Provisions of Part I
  339. The Statute is an enabling Act and permits the Secretary o f State to make an order by Statutory
Instrum ent to bring it into operation (section 27(2)). I do not propose to set out all the provisions o f the Act in
every detail. In the broadest terms, however, Part I o f the Act is to the following effect.

  340. Section 1(5) provides for a national mem bership scheme (“the schem e”) to restrict “the generality o f
spectators attending designated football matches to persons who are m em bers o f the schem e” . Section 1(2)
gives the Secretary o f State power to designate football m atches or an individual match.

  341. Two new bodies are to be appointed by the Secretary o f State. The first is the Football M em bership
Authority (FMA), a corporate body with articles o f association. The FM A is to be responsible initially for
drafting the scheme (section 4(1)). The Secretary o f State is empowered to approve the scheme, again by
Statutory Instrum en t (section 4(3)). The FMA is then to be responsible for the adm inistration o f the scheme
(section 3(1)). Section 7 disqualifies from becom ing or continuing to be a m em ber o f the scheme anyone
subject to an exclusion order un d e r section 30 o f the Public O rder Act 1986 (after conviction o f an offence
connected with football) whilst he is so subject. Also, anyone convicted o f a relevant offence, being one o f
those listed in Schedule I to the new Act, is likewise disqualified. Anyone so convicted is disqualified for five
years if he receives an im m ediate prison sentence and for two years if not.

   342. The second body is a quango to be called the Football Licensing Authority (FLA) (section 8). The
FLA is to be responsible for the grant (section 10( 1)) or refusal (section 10(3)) o f a licence to a dm it spectators
to any premises to watch any designated football match there. It has power to impose conditions on the
licence (section 10(4) to (7)), to m ake inspections and inquiries (section 10(8)) and to vary a licence (section
10( 10)), suspend or revoke it (section 12). In making decisions under section 10, the FLA is to have regard to
w hether the equip m ent, the premises and the responsible persons there are such as to secure com pliance with
the scheme.

  343. The FLA also has ancillary functions, as noted earlier; first, to include in a licence, if the Secretary of
State so directs, a condition as to seating (section 11); secondly, to keep un der review and oversee the
discharge by local authorities o f their 1975 Act functions regarding football grounds and Safety Certificates
(section 13).

Contents of the Scheme
  344. Section 5(2) prescribes as follows:-

  “The scheme m ust include provision -

    (a) securing that the only spectators perm itted to attend at designated football m atches are authorised
        spectators;
    (b) providing for tem porary m em b ership o f the scheme, including (in particular) the tem porary
        m em bership o f football club guests;

    (c) providing for the ad m ission as spectators at designated football m atches, w ithout their being
        members o f the scheme, o f -

          (i)   disabled persons, and

          (ii) accom panied children,

          in such circumstances and subject to such conditions as are specified in the scheme;

    (d) securing that persons who are disqualified under section 7 below are excluded from mem bership
        while so disqualified;

    (e) providing for the exclusion from m em bership, for an appropriate period not exceeding two years
        determ ined und er the scheme, o f persons who are, by reference to circum stances specified in the
        scheme, determ ined under the scheme to be unfit for m em bership and for notifying persons who are
        excluded from m em bership o f the grounds for the exclusion;

    (f) im posing pecuniary penalties on any persons having functions under the schem e for failure to
        discharge those functions;

    (g) imposing requirem ents as respects the procedure to be followed in dealing with applications for
        mem bership o f the scheme and requiring that in Wales any application form for m em bership o f the
        scheme shall also be available in Welsh;

    (h) im posing requirem ents on responsible persons as respects the procedure to be followed and
        eq uipm ent to be used in relation to any designated football m atch to secure that, except in an
        emergency, the only spectators adm itted to and perm itted to rem ain on the premises are authorised
        spectators;

    (i)   to such effect, in relation to the adm ission o f spectators to the premises, as the Secretary o f State may
          specify in writing;

    (j)   establishing and m aintaining a central register o f m em bers of the scheme;

    (k) regulating the form and contents o f m em bership cards; and

    (1) establishing procedures for the making and consideration o f representations against decisions m ade
        under the scheme refusing or withdrawing m em bership o f it and for the ind ependent review o f the
        decisions in the light o f the representations;

and in this subsection “accom panied children” m eans persons under the age o f 10 years in the charge o f an
authorised spectator.”

  345. Section 5(3) prescribes, inter alia, that the scheme may make provision for the im position o f charges
for m em bership cards (section 5(3)(b) and by section 5(3)(c)):-

  “for th e adm ission as spectators at designated football matches, w ithout their being m em bers o f the
  scheme, o f descriptions o f person specified in the scheme in such circum stances and subject to such
  conditions as are so specified”.

  346. M y short sum m ary o f Part I om its a n u m b e r o f provisions eg the constitution o f the FMA and o f the
FLA, details o f offences, defences to them and appeals, D ata Protection Act 1984 im plications etc.

Provisions of Part II
  347. Before proceeding to discuss the im plications o f Part I o f the Act, which are highly controversial, I
should refer to the provisions o f Part II which are not. Although I assume my rem it is lim ited to sports events
within the jurisdiction to which Part I applies, the scheme o f Part II is, I think, relevant.
 348. The aim o f Part II is to prevent convicted hooligans from travelling to m atches abroad including
matches in Scotland and there by m isbehaviour causing trouble and dam aging our national reputation.

   349. The scheme, again stated in broad terms, is to give courts power to make a restriction order after a
conviction for a relevant offence, in addition to any other sentence (section 15). Such an o rder is to be for five
years if it accom panies an im m ediate sentence o f im prisonm ent; otherwise for two years (section 16(1)). It
imposes a duty to report at a police station (unless exempted) on the occasion o f designated football m atches
abroad. Failure so to report is an offence punishable on sum m ary conviction by up to one m o n th ’s
im prisonm ent, by a fine or by both (section 16(5)). There is provision in section 22 for making restriction
orders consequent upon convictions in countries other than England and Wales for “corresponding offences”
to those listed in Schedule 1.

   350. Even those implacably hostile to the provisions o f Part I are mostly in favour o f Part II. In my view it
is a sensible and practicable measure to take against a persistent m ischief practised by a small m inority but
with national repercussions. To adapt a famous dictum , never in the field o f sport has so m uch odium been
brought upon so m any by so few. The scheme is aim ed directly and solely at the few whose m isbehaviour
abroad brings such o dium upon English football supporters generally. I welcome it.

                                THE NATIONAL M E M B E R SH IP SC H EM E

   351. Returning to Part I, it is crucial to a full evaluation o f its likely im pact to know the term s o f the
scheme to be approved. At present there is no approved scheme, n o r even a draft scheme, since the FM A has
not yet been appointed, although the FA and FL have been offered “first refusal” for ap p o in tm en t as such. I
do not know therefore how and in what term s such a scheme would comply w ith the requirem ents o f section 5
set out above.

   352. The only guide presently available is the Invitation To Tender (ITT) and the Statement O f
R equirem ents (SOR) prepared by Ernst & Young, M anagem ent Consultants, in conjunction with the
D epartm ent o f the Environm ent. This docum ent is directed to com panies which have shown interest in
tendering for the contract to supply the relevant technology. The IT T was dated 1 D ecem ber 1989 and
required tenderers to respond by 19 January 1990. As I write this report th at date is still ahead and so the
response is n ot known. Presently there are seven potential tenderers.

General Requirements of the ITT and SOR
  353. The successful tenderer will be required to set up, manage and operate a company, the “scheme
operating com pany” (SOC) to run the entire scheme. It will work under the overall policy, supervision and
control o f the FMA. At the outset o f the ITT, certain key objectives have been identified as follows:-

  “ 1. Minimise the turnstile process time and the queuing problems that m ight occur in large crowds close
   to kick-off and keep them within acceptable limits.

   2. Fund the scheme, taking account of its costs and also the possible disincentive effect to supporters of
   paying m em bership fees.

   3. Ensure the application process, card production and issue procedures meet the requirem ents within
   acceptable turn a ro u n d times to spectators.

   4. Deal with invalid card holders at entry points and ensure that offenders against the m em bership rules
   are dealt with fairly and that any punishm ent can be enforced.

   5. Keep within manageable limits the size o f the referral file containing banned m em bers to ensure that
   speed o f access to it is acceptable and still have sufficient protection against the use o f lost, stolen, forged
   cards and pass-backs on m atch days.”

  354. The SOR provides as follows:-

  “ A part from ensuring financial integrity and acceptability o f the m arketing strategy, the FM A will be
    concerned to ensure that:

    1.   the n u m ber o f supporters is maxim ised while recovering the cost o f the scheme

    2.   the scheme does not add to problems outside grounds

    3.   the scheme assists in reducing hooliganism.”

  T hat the scheme must be self-funding is further stressed in the IT T as follows:-

  “ The Football M em bership Scheme will be self-funding, that is, the SOC will be responsible for all costs
    and expenses (including set-up costs) incurred in carrying out its obligations under the contract and
    shall reimburse the FM A for expenditure incurred by the FM A both on the SOC’s behalf relating to the
    scheme and in respect o f the FM A fulfilling the requirem ents o f the Act.

   The costs o f running the FM A will also need to be recovered from the incom e generated by the SOC.

   The levels o f m em bership fees including any variations over the period o f the contract, will be subject to
   the prior approval o f the F M A ” .
Ground Modifications
  355. As to the cost o f ground modifications, the IT T notes:

  “ It is anticipated th at there could be a significant cost involved in accom m odating the m em bership
  validation system at some grounds. Therefore any m odifications to be m ade to the existing turnstile
  equipm ent and the inclusion o f any new turnstiles should be entered against this item .”

Applications for Membership
  356. Applications for m em bership o f the scheme must be made in person, not by post, using a standard
application form. The form will include personal particulars and the type o f application. This may be for
adult m em bership, renewal, replacement, change o f details, temporary, ju n io r or senior m em bership. The
form will state the m em bership period (normally two seasons), the applicant’s nom inated club allegiance,
second club allegiance and national allegiance. It will include a box to allow exclusion from any m ailing lists.
The Post Office and the clubs will act as collection points for handling applications and carrying out an initial
verification process. This will require the applicant to produce evidence to prove identity and one or more
passport standard photographs. The collecting agent will be responsible for checking the form, the
acceptability o f the photographs and their general likeness to the applicant as well as the other evidence of
identification. He will also accept the fee.

  357. The SOR provides:-

  “ Vetting o f applications at the point o f presentation in a collection agency m ust be consistent and m ethods
  to ensure that vetting procedures are followed m ust be employed. The integrity o f the system as an
  anti-hooligan m easure will depend on this vetting procedure.”

  358. The SOR states that the m ajor problem in handling the application will be to ensure that the attached
photographs are linked to the application details to enable the subsequent correct printing o f m em bership
cards.

Validation Procedures
  359. I concentrate on applications for adult, ju n io r or senior m em bership. In these cases, the SOR
provides two basic validation procedures which m ust be followed. The first is a “person check” , explained as
follows:-

  “The purpose o f this check is to stop supporters getting m ore than one m em bership card. The reason being
  that a ban on one m em bership registration would still leave the supporter in possession o f another
  m em bership card. Therefore there will be both a nam e and an address check against the m em bership
  registration database (postcoding o f all addresses will obviously make this procedure a lot faster and it may
  be necessary to insist upon postcodes from the start). Also it is not sufficient to undertake a straight nam e
  and address check due to different ways to spell nam es and addresses. The prim e contractor should
  propose m ethods to ensure that adequate checking is undertaken against deliberate m ultiple applications.”

   360. Secondly, there must be a “referral file check” . The referral file will contain particulars o f the
following:

  “ - persons banned from m em bership (existing members)

    - persons who are considered to be undesirable due to their past record who have not yet applied for
      m em bership (this will include those with existing exclusion orders against them)

    - lost/stolen m em bership cards either by direct notification or due to an application for a replacem ent
      card

    - fraudulent copies.”

Provision and Updating of Information to Clubs
  361. The national referral list will be com m unicated to all 92 League clubs. Moreover, the list will have to
be updated weekly d uring the football season to add fresh instances o f any o f the four categories o f exclusion
m entioned in the last paragraph; also, to remove from the list those no longer excluded eg after a successful
appeal.
  362. Each club will also be given the nam es o f those successful applicants who have claim ed allegiance to
the club. From this inform ation the club will be required to keep a register o f its own members.

Exploitation of the System
   363. The ITT provides for the FM A by itself or a designated agent to be responsible for approving and
co-ordinating the SOC’s com m ercial exploitation o f the N ational M em bership File and extracts from that
file. This is said to be “in order to protect and prom ote the reputation o f football to avoid any possible
conflict with existing and future com m ercial activities at a club and national level” . The FM A may also
licence clubs to use data relating to m em bers who express allegiance to that club on term s and conditions to
be agreed.

Membership Cards
  364. It is m andatory that the m em bership card must carry a photograph o f the m ember, the m em ber’s
nam e, full m em bership number, the expiry date, club allegiance if any and national allegiance. The
m em bership n u m ber m ust be in a “m achine readable form on the card as it is the only m ethod o f rapidly
enough m atching the card against the national referral file”.

  365. The card will need to meet standards for size and durability; it will need to last for more than the
norm al m em bership period (two years) as this may be increased later.

  366. The security level must ensure that:

  “ - cards are not forgeable

   - photographs cannot be replaced

   - m achine readable m em bership num bers cannot be changed

    - printed details on the cards cannot be changed

    - supplies o f blank cards are held in a secure environm ent.”

  All o f this assumes that the m em bership cards “will be the ‘plastic credit-card’ type”.

Entry Checking Procedures
  367. I now come to requirem ents having a critical bearing on safety and crowd control. They concern the
checks and procedures at turnstiles. The following six provisions are m andatory:

    i     A spectator m ust present a valid current m em bership card to the turnstile operator.

    ii    “A spectator must be authorised to hold the m em bership card and be p erm itted to attend the
          designated match. (Note: it has been accepted th at the turnstile operator will not be able to compare
          the photograph on the card with the person presenting the card as well as undertaking electronic
          checking).”

    iii   The card must no t be “present on the referral file” and

    iv    can only be used “once per designated m atch.”

    v     “The turnstile operator m ust not let any person into the m atch w ithout them (sic) producing a
          m em bership card and validating that card using the procedures and equ ipm ent provided.”

    vi    “The system should be capable o f directing m em bers into their p erm itted sections o f the ground,
          using the prim ary and secondary club allegiance field (unless playing each other) in the mem bership
          n u m b er to determ ine through which entry points the m em ber may pass.”

Turnstile Alarm
   368. I f a card fails any o f the six basic checks sum m arised above, the system m ust alert the officials
(stewards an d /o r police). It m ust also be capable o f alerting the turnstile operator but not alerting the
spectator while in the turnstile.
  369.   Three types o f failure are envisaged.

    (1) Referral file check shows the card is subject to a ban; card notified as lost or as stolen; alternatively,
        the card has been used previously at th a t m atch (pass-back).

    (2) Equipm ent/card m alfunction, m em bership expired,tem porary card not valid for m atch. .

    (3) Card being presented at the “wrong” turnstile or no card at all.

Detection
  370. The procedure to be followed in relation to each o f these three types o f failure is m andatory and
im portant in the evaluation o f the scheme for safety an d crowd control.

  371. If the failure is o f type (1):-

  “The suspect should be apprehended and taken to an investigation area either inside or outside the ground.
  These will be situated at convenient places around the ground. It is anticipated that there will need to be
  one investigation area on each side o f the ground, although this is likely to depend on ground conditions”.

  If the failure is o f type (2):-

  “The card will be retained at the entry point and a receipt for the card given to the spectator. This receipt
  will contain either the m em bership nu m b er or some m ethod to identify the retained card later. The
  spectator will be advised to contact the club after the m atch when the problem may have been resolved” .

  If the failure is o f type (3):-

  “The spectator is turned back from the entry p o in t” .

System Contingency
  372. Systems at turnstiles m ust be capable o f operating “a degraded service” in the event o f system
m alfunction. This m ust include replacem ent o f any m alfunctioning unit within five m inutes and alternative
power supplies if the system relies on external power. I f cabling is used it m ust be tam p er p ro o f and m ore than
one route m ust be provided between “every turnstile installed un it” and the processing unit. Turnstile
systems m ust not depend on a single club com puter system.

Performance and Environmental Conditions
  373. Finally, two m andatory provisions are laid down which are o f great im portance to safety and crowd
control.

  374. As to perform ance the SOR provides:-

  “ It is critical that the conducting o f the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures described in this and
  the next section m ust give rise to no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. The m axim um
  additional tim e which will be considered will be no m ore th a n 1 second per entry to the normal ground
  entry rate for a particular turnstile and ground configuration at all tim es”.

  375. As to environm ental conditions, the provision is:-

  “Any systems installed at turnstile locations will have to operate reliably in the conditions experienced in
  an outdoor, all-weather, all-year environm ent. Power supplies to turnstiles will be unreliable.”

Summary
  376. As with my analysis of the statutory provisions, this sum m ary o f the contents o f the IT T and SOR is
not exhaustive. It seeks only to indicate how the scheme is intended to work and what is expected o f it.

                         A R G UM EN TS RAISED BY CRITICS OF THE SCHEM E

  377.     Having sum m arised the intended objects and benefits o f the scheme and the means by which it is
required to achieve them , I turn now to th e argum ents against the scheme raised by its critics.

  (i) Disproportionate?
  First, it is said that the scheme with all its complex ramifications is out o f proportion to the problem.
  Setting up the technology and m aintaining it secure and in working order; adapting grounds to install it;
  dealing with millions o f applications swiftly; issuing millions o f cards, renewing them, coping with lost and
  stolen cards; setting up a referral list, distributing it and updating it; training staff; coping with banned
  cards and other failures at the turnstile; processing offenders; dealing fairly with appellants - these, and
  other ancillary measures, am o u n t to an enorm ous undertaking. It is aim ed principally at keeping hooligans
  out o f the ground, but, so it is said, th e problem inside grounds is less than it was and could be m et by other
  less complex and less am bitious strategies.

  (ii) Unfair?
  In aim ing to exclude a m inority o f hooligans from the football scene, it is com plained th at the huge
  majority o f decent spectators are to be put by the scheme to trouble and expense. Each fan will have to go
  through the application procedures, presenting his form, proving his identity, purchasing and producing
  photographs. He will have to pay between £4 and £10 a year to join the scheme in addition to paying for
  m atch tickets. He will have to keep his card, rem em ber it on match days, guard it from loss and theft, and
  renew it from tim e to tim e for fu rth er payments. Should he forget it, or lose it, should it be stolen or become
  damaged, he will be put to trouble to replace it and to gain entry to m atches meanwhile. It is argued that
  measures against hooligans should target the hooligans only, not inconvenience millions o f spectators in
  the hope o f weeding out a few.

  (iii) Casual Spectators
  There is anxiety that the scheme will, in effect, exclude from football the spectator w ho attends only on a
  casual basis or for a rare m atch which takes his fancy. Such a spectator, it is argued, would not go to the
  expense or trouble (especially the latter) o f buying a m em bership card simply to attend an occasional
  m atch. This category o f spectator is thought possibly to account for some 20% o f present attendances -
  sizeable num bers to be deprived o f their present freedom to watch football.

  (iv) D im in ish ed Club Revenue
  Taking these lost casual visitors together w ith form er regular attenders who may also find the scheme a
  disincentive, the clubs fear their revenue will be severely reduced. For this reason, inter alia, they have been
  strongly opposed to the scheme.

  (v) Danger o f Congestion a n d Disorder
  There is concern that the am bitious technology, which is yet to be produced and tested, may fail.
  Alternatively, that even if, by persistence and through trial and error, it could in the end be m ade to
  function reliably, there may be serious failures in the teething period. In either o f these events the fear is
  that congestion at the turnstiles could cause serious danger or disorder.

  (vi) Will the S chem e Defeat Hooligans?
  Even if the technology works according to plan, will it (a) exclude determ ined hooligans from inside the
  ground and (b) also induce them to stay away from the environs of the ground? The criticism is that it
  may do neither o f these things, especially not the latter.

  (vii) Police Resources
  T here is concern, especially from the police themselves, as to the num bers o f police to be deployed and the
  facilities they will need at the ground to cope w ith problem s arising from the scheme at the turnstiles.
  These will involve banned cards, lost cards, stolen cards, unreadable cards and determ ined hooligans
  trying by various m eans to buck the system.

In short, critics say the scheme proposes a sledgeham m er to crack a nut; a sledgeham m er which may not
swing at all but, if it does, may not swing safely or even reach the nut.
Arguments Relevant to this Inquiry
    378. O f the seven argum ents I have just briefly sum m arised, the first four do not bear directly upon safety
o r crowd control. They m ay have considerable force and (ii) and (iii) do bear upon m atters considered in Part
I o f this Report (especially better treatm ent o f spectators). However, they raise issues o f policy which are
essentially for Parliam ent. Accordingly, I say no more as to those four points.

  379. O n the other hand, argum ents (v), (vi) and (vii) do bear very relevantly upon safety and crow'd
control. They are therefore w ithin my rem it and I shall explore them in turn.

                                DANGER OF CONGESTION OR DISORDER

Present Risk of Congestion
   380. Congestion outside turnstiles and consequent injuries or disorder are already recognised risks. Those
risks are aggravated by the lim ited n u m b e r o f turnstiles available and the limited scope for increasing them at
many old grounds. They are also increased by the late arrival o f a large p roportion o f the crowd, which is a
com m on occurrence.

  381. D uring the last busy 20 m inutes before kick-off, queues, or sometimes a phalanx, o f waiting
spectators, tend to build up. If the delivery through the turnstiles is delayed or slowed down, that build-up
grows and its pressure further retards the turnstile operation. The next stage is th at those waiting become
restive, fearing they will not get in for the kick-off. Crowd noise from the ground, denoting th at the team s are
out, increases impatience. There is then real danger o f pressure towards the turnstiles causing injuries and
panic causing disorder. This is what happened at Hillsborough. It is said th at it nearly happened again,
despite Hillsborough and the interim recom m endations, at Coventry on the first day o f the new season.

Additional Time to Check Cards
  382. These risks have existed even without a national m em bership scheme. Since the scheme requires
that all spectators passing through the turnstiles must produce their m em bership cards for checking, it is
inevitable that some additional tim e will be taken for each spectator.

  383. In realistic acknowledgement o f the risk this might create, the IT T states as its first key objective:-

  “M inim ise the turnstile process tim e and the queuing problem s that might occur in large crowds close to
  kick-off and keep them within acceptable limits”.

  The SOR likewise requires the FM A to ensure:-

  “T he scheme does not add to problem s outside grounds”.

  M ore specifically, I repeat the m an datory provision o f the SOR as follows:-

  “It is critical that the conducting o f the six basic checks and any follow-up procedures ... must give rise to
  no significant delays to ground entry at turnstiles. The m axim um additional tim e which will be considered
  will be no m ore th a n 1 second per entry to the norm al ground entry rate for a particular turnstile and
  ground configuration at all tim es” .

  384. Even if this is achieved, it would reduce the num bers per hour admissible through a turnstile from
the norm o f 500 (m entioned in A ppendix 3 at paragraph 33) to about 436.

  385. But can it be achieved? This depends upon two factors: (i) what has to be done at the turnstile; (ii)
w hether the technology can achieve the required rate; not only in favourable conditions but in real life and
despite attem pts to defeat it.

    (i) Procedures at the Turnstiles
  386. The six entry checks which have to be undertaken at the turnstile (see supra paragraph 367) require
the spectator to “present a valid current m em bership card to the turnstile operator”. So, in the normal case,
there will be a passing o f the card to the operator, a validation o f it by him, and a return o f the card to the
holder - all o f this to be additional to buying a ticket or (at an all-ticket m atch) presenting a ticket and having
the stub returned.

  387. The system as prescribed in the IT T depends upon the operator getting possession o f the card
because it has to be “retained” at the turnstile if there is a failure o f type (2) eg m alfunction or card expired.
This requirem ent is significant when one is dealing with a tim e factor not to exceed 1 second. The scheme is
unlike that at Luton, for example, which m ust be quicker since (a) there are two sets o f turnstiles with an
operator only at the inn er set and (b) the m em ber swipes his own card through at the outer turnstile. If the
IT T were to be changed to follow the Luton example, however, w hat would happen at grounds where there is
insufficient space for two sets o f turnstiles and how would the operator get possession o f the card so as to
“retain” it if there were a m alfunction?

  388. If the turnstile alarm alerts the operator to a failure o f type (1) - a banned, lost or stolen card or
pass-back - the suspect is to be apprehended. The turnstile operator will therefore have no more to do with
him; but how long it will take to have the suspect apprehended inside or outside the turnstile will depend on
the police presence to which I shall turn later.

  389. If the failure is o f type (2), apart from retaining the card, the operator is required to give the holder a
receipt for it which “will contain either the m em bership nu m b er or some other m ethod to identify the
retained card later” . Since the o perator will be unable to anticipate the card num bers o f those which fail for a
type (2) reason, he cannot have a receipt ready in advance. If he has to make one out, hand it to the entrant
and explain the procedure for redeem ing the card later, the exercise would take considerably longer than 1
second - especially if, as would be likely, there is some backchat.

  390. It is true th at the SOR requirem ent that the schem e m ust add no more than 1 second to the turnstile
time, although said to be m andatory and critical, could be changed. However, in my view the authors o f the
SOR were right to choose 1 second as “the m axim u m additional tim e which will be considered”. At 500 per
hour, each entrant has 7.2 seconds to go through the turnstile. A n y additional tim e could cause difficulty; 1
second is an additio n o f nearly 14% to the existing 7.2 seconds and more th a n 1 second would, as the SOR
says, be unacceptable.

  391. If the failure is o f type (3) - wrong turnstile: no card - the IT T requires that “the spectator is turned
back from the entry p o in t”. The evidence I heard at Sheffield from m any police witnesses, and all I have seen
and read since, makes it clear th at where there are queues, let alone a phalanx, try ing to get som eone who is
wedged in the narrows o f a turnstile back through those waiting is at best a slow, laborious and un popular
exercise. At Hillsborough, the crush m ade it impossible.

    (ii) The Technology
   392. It has yet to be shown that a com puterised system can be produced which is capable, even in
favourable conditions, o f achieving reliably the requirem ents o f the ITT. So far as I am aware, nowhere has a
com puterised system been installed to cope with the massive num bers o f people, in the short period o f tim e
and in the all-weather context which will be required by this scheme, quite apart from the added problem s of
attem pted disruption. The scheme therefore invites tenderers to break new ground. The fact that it has not
been done before does not, o f course, show that it cannot be done. But it does require greater caution and a
more extensive testing procedure th a n if there were a successful precedent.

  393. The only com parable exercise which has been attem pted was a Football Identity C ard Scheme in
Holland. T hat failed in its early stages and has been shelved. However, I should stress that the D utch scheme
was very different from that proposed u n d er the 1989 Act. It involved only five clubs with a bad history of
hooliganism and it applied only to the away m atches o f those clubs. Only 25,000 cards were issued. Much
depended on careful control o f ticket sales. The scheme was introduced at the start o f the 1989/90 season.
Unfortunately, the opening m atches o f the season featured two o f the five clubs hosting two o f the others.
Ticket sales were not controlled effectively, the clubs were hostile to the scheme, away supporters were
adm itted w ithout tickets and supporters on both sides com bined to defeat the experiment.

  394. In these circumstances, I do not thin k that the failure o f the Dutch scheme can found a fair argument
against the totally different scheme proposed in the 1989 Act. W hat it does show is the need to make any such
scheme p ro o f against wrecking tactics.


Demonstration
   395. O ne o f the seven potential tenderers gave a dem onstration to a Parliam entary group using a
laboratory prototype to show the technology they could deploy. That being so, a sim ilar dem onstration was
arranged for me and my Assessors. We were shown a “sm art-card” and how it could be program m ed and used
as a football m em bership card. Each “sm art-card” contains its own m ini-computer. M uch inform ation can
be stored inside it. The dem onstration showed the holder passing the card over a reader and the possible
responses o f red, am ber or green light, depending on w hether the card was valid, doubtful o r invalid.
Advertising possibilities and other packages o f benefits were also explained and illustrated.
  396. I was extremely impressed by what we were shown. However, this was a single card, at a single
simulated turnstile, in warm, dry, indoor conditions, w ithout a large national referral file to be searched and
without anyone trying to circum vent or wreck the system.

Police Apprehensions
  397. I quote from the written evidence subm itted by A C PO :-

  “The question, however, which m ost concerns police officers relates to the efficacy o f the technology. The
  (Act) naturally does not detail how it will work or what is required o f it but, it is clear that, unless it is robust
  and virtually trouble-free, it will be counter-productive. In the worst case it could be massively
  counter-productive. At the least each turnstile m ust have access to a national database and must be able to
  survey th a t database almost instantaneously. The m achine itself must be durable against sabotage . . . and
  must work w ithout persistent f a u lt.. . .

  All o u r experience to date has been th at com puter salesmen have offered much and delivered little. The
  police feel that they m ust be involved in the specification for any technology and would need to be satisfied
  that it works before support could be given to this scheme. The consequences o f repeated failure, hostile
  queues, interm inable delays and the rest, are unthinkable”.

Computer Reliability
   398. T he concern expressed in th a t passage about com puter perform ance is not unduly cynical. Many
people have personal experience o f com puter failures in one field or another. The com puter “going dow n” at
an airport causing delays at check-in, co m puter errors in banks, problems with com puterised entrances to the
L ondon U nderground, and, recently, com puter “viruses”, are merely a few examples. These problems
continue to occur from tim e to tim e even with com puter systems which have been thoroughly tested, which
are widely used and have long ago passed through what was thought to be the teething period. In m any cases
such failures cause delay or annoyance but not danger. The technology for the present scheme, however, has
not yet been through the stage o f teething troubles. Moreover, the scheme could cause dangerous build-ups if
the technology either failed wholly or failed to work at the stipulated rate. In the L ondon Underground,
where build-ups were occurring, a m anned entrance channel has had to be provided at many stations
alongside those which are com puterised, as a safety valve. To have to open extra non-com puterised entrances
at football grounds would (unlike the U nderground) scupper the system. Its whole and sole point is to exclude
hooligans by com pu ter checking.

  399. In fact, the Act seems to leave it open to the FMA to include in the scheme power for a person in
authority to open gates and let spectators in, w hether they have m em bership cards or not, should an
emergency arise (section 2(2), section 5(2)(h), section 5(3)(c) and section 10(12)(a)). If the exercise o f that
power should have to be considered, all the problems which arose outside Hillsborough would arise again
- deciding w hether the power should be exercised o r not; if so, at what m om ent and by whom; making a clear
decision and com m unicating it; coping with the in-rush and the loss o f control and o f segregation it may
cause. If the power had to be exercised, the scheme would be discredited at that place on th at day and perhaps
generally.

Relaxation in an Emergency
   400. I said in the last paragraph th a t the Act “seems to include power” to relax the turnstile requirem ents
in an emergency. But the power is only to be inferred by implication from the four sub-sections I have cited.
Nowhere is the power expressly given; nor is it said who shall exercise it or how “an emergency” is to be
interpreted. The adm ission o f authorised spectators only, and only by production o f their m em bership cards,
seems to be fundam ental to the scheme. Yet there is no stipulation in the Act that cards have to be produced.
N o doubt this could be provided for in the approved scheme. But since anyone other th an an authorised
spectator com m its a criminal offence by entering the ground, adm itting a non-authorised spectator is a
serious m atter and could am ount to aiding and abetting a criminal offence. It is therefore surprising that the
Act does not indicate who is to have power to declare an emergency so as to adm it all and sundry and in what
circumstances.

Tests
   401. W hat testing ;s envisaged? The IT T provides for a “system testing strategy”. This is divided into
“laboratory41 prototypes and pilot system tests. Two clubs have volunteered and been accepted to be the pilot
sites for the latter form o f testing. They are Derby County and Reading. It is envisaged that at least four
different levels o f test will be carried out at each o f the two clubs. These four levels are likely to be:
    i     issue m em bership cards to existing members;

    ii    issue cards to all hom e or away supporters;

    iii   small all-ticket match (hom e and away supporters);

    iv    large (near capacity) all-ticket m atch.

  402. The IT T provides:

  “ Each test will try to simulate as close (sic) as possible the live situation with problem cards being used at
  ra n d o m ” .

  403. I foresee two problem s which beset this testing procedure. First, the difficulty o f making the test
conditions truly simulate those which will obtain when the scheme is working nationwide. For example, only
two clubs are to be used for the tests “with problem cards being used at ran d o m ”. Unless the com puters at the
two clubs have to search a referral list (w hether real or simulated) as long as the national referral list may turn
out to be, they will not have been adequately tested for capacity and speed. The estim ated volum e of
“b a n n e d ” cards, according to the SOR, is between 5,000 and 20,000 per annum . The estim ate o f stolen and
lost cards is between 20,000 and 80,000 per annum . It is not clear w hether “per a n n u m ” refers to the
num bers on the referral file in any given year or to the num ber o f fresh bannings, losses and thefts each year.
Taking the more conservative approach, however, they could jointly am ount to 100,000 per annum .
Accordingly, for a realistic test, the com puters at the two clubs would have to be able swiftly to pick out the
“problem cards” from a list o f up to 100,000 - somewhat different from the Luton list o f six.

  404. The size o f the referral list may have an im portant bearing on the speed at which the technology can
work. I repeat that key objective n u m b e r 5 in the IT T stipulates:-

  “Keep within manageable limits the size o f the referral file containing banned m em bers to ensure that
  speed o f access to it is acceptable etc”.

   How is the referral file to be kept “within manageable limits"? Its size will surely depend upon the num ber
o f cards banned, lost or stolen. T here can be no m anagem ent control o f the num bers lost and stolen and the
nu m b er banned will depend on the n u m b e r o f convictions or acts o f m isbehaviour m eriting a ban. The only
way o f keeping the n u m ber ban n ed “w ithin manageable limits” would be not to ban all those who may
deserve it, which would bring the schem e into disrepute.

  405. The SOR estimates that the n u m b e r o f cards which are unreadable or otherwise require investigation
may be up to 3% o f the cards being checked. So at a capacity match with 50,000 present, the test would
require 1,500 m alfunctioning cards to be random ly issued. Presumably, the nu m b er o f unreadable cards
would tend to grow during the first two years o f the scheme as the first issue o f cards accumulates damage
from rough treatm ent.

  406. Again, with pilot tests at only two clubs, the hooligans’ response will be unpredictable. They may try
to sabotage the scheme at the pilot clubs which would really put the technology to the test. They may,
however, prefer to misbehave at some other ground where no tests are in progress. W hen the scheme is
im plem ented generally, they will be unable to go to any such “other ground” and may only then make their
attem pts to sabotage the scheme.

Human Guinea-pigs
  407. The second problem is th a t tests can only be carried out by using real spectators. Bank com puters and
other com pu ter technologies can be tested by putting through figures, data and print-outs. This system can
only be tested by putting through people. So in the very testing o f w hether the system may cause danger,
danger may be caused.

Disruption and Sabotage
  408. The whole raison d ’etre o f the scheme is the perceived need to elim inate from football a hooligan
element so substantial, and so d eterm ined to make trouble, as to justify this enorm ous undertaking. Since the
scheme seeks to defeat such determ in ed hooligans, it must be assumed th at the hooligans will seek to defeat
the scheme. They will see it as a challenge. Wrecking or circum venting it will add a new piquancy to the
perverse pleasure they derive from their activities. M r Ridley recognised this on the launch o f the Bill, in the
passage I have quoted, when he sa id :-

  “O f course there will be attem pts to abuse the system but if the scheme is effective, those attem pts will
  fail” .

   409.    Accordingly, the technology will not only have to be capable o f fulfilling the requirem ents o f the
scheme w ithout m alfunction, in all weathers and at the stipulated speed. It will also have to be resistant to the
ingenuity and d eterm ination o f those who may seek to sabotage it or find a way round it. It will need to do
these things not ju st m ost o f the time, but all o f the time. This is a very tall order, and for the reasons I have
set out above, I have the gravest doubts if it can be met. Should it not be m et in full, the safety im plications
would be serious indeed.




                                                        71
                                                        C H A P T E R 16

                                  WILL THE SC H E M E WEED O U T HOOLIGANS?

  410. Even assum ing that the technology can be m ade to work reliably and is not disrupted or sabotaged,
two questions still arise on whether the scheme is likely to achieve its objects, (i) Will the scheme in fact weed
hooligans out o f the ground and (ii) will they also be deterred from causing trouble outside the ground or at
places en route?

(i)     E xclusion fr o m the Ground

  411. The strategy depends first upon the court banning the hooligan after conviction o f a relevant offence
or the FM A b anning him after some misbehaviour. But to im pose a ban is one thing; to enforce it is another.
True, the banned hooligan will not lawfully be able to enter by presenting a valid m em bership card o f his
own, once he is on the referral list. But he may still enter by other means.

   412. A serious defect in the scheme is the acceptance that the entry procedure will not involve checking
the photograph on the card against its presenter. Such checking is precluded by the need for speed. But the
m ain rationale o f having a photograph of the m em ber on his card is defeated if it cannot be relied upon to
exclude som eone else from using the card and will be checked only should the user later be apprehended for
an offence. So if a banned hooligan can get hold o f a valid card he could gain entry. N ot being scrupulous by
nature, he may steal one, borrow one or even buy one, for it is not unlikely th at a black m arket in cards will
develop. D espite requirem ents in the IT T to prevent such abuses, m ultiple applications and forgeries may
also be successfully made.

   413. It is nothing to the point to say that if a banned hooligan enters the ground by using a stolen or
borrowed card and is there arrested for an assault, he will have com m itted not one but two offences, the
assault and the unlawful entry. He could be charged w ith the assault even w ithout the 1989 Act, and w ithout
his com m ission o f the assault, the unlawful entry is likely to go undetected. N o r does it seem sound to say
that if he so enters and is not seen to com m it an offence in the ground, all is well. At the very least, the system
is brought into disrepute when he brags to his mates that he has beaten it. Police evidence suggests, moreover,
th a t the m ore sinister members o f hooligan gangs often do not use violence themselves, but, from a vantage
point in the ground, direct the activities o f others.

  414. I refer again to the submission from ACPO, a body w ith special knowledge o f the hooligan problem
and o f how hooligans are likely to react:-

      ‘T h e success o f the proposals will eventually be judged at two levels.

      First, there is the question as to w hether this legislation w ill:-

        (a) progressively remove hooligans from the football grounds and

        (b) deter the allegiance o f those who are involved in trouble and violence but do not necessarily attend
            matches.

      Second, and in a sense more fundamentally, the question rem ains whether or not the simple mechanics o f
      processing m em bership cards through turnstiles can actually be achieved.

      The police view over a long period o f tim e has been that these provisions are, to a great extent, marginal to
      the problem , if for no other reason than they cannot exclude the possibility o f fraud by people who are, by
      definition, hell bent upon defeating the system, and because it will take a very long tim e before a significant
      n u m b e r o f potential hooligans are excluded by the scheme. There are some countervailing advantages:

        (i)   the deterrent effect may be considerable;

        (ii) the club disciplinary system may well be able to take strong action on the evidence o f CCTV alone;

        (iii) the game will be able to exclude m any o f the very worst offenders.

      Nonetheless, the police view is that m any o f the measures that we have already taken . . . are having a
      significant effect and are far more critical to the problem o f hooliganism”.
(ii)   E lim ination fr o m the Area a n d Routes N ear the Ground
  415. I have already noted th a t hooliganism inside the ground has been reduced, largely by CCTV, but has
been transferred outside the ground. I refer again to the subm ission o f ACPO:

  “Two aspects o f control have done m uch to change the nature o f hooliganism. The legislation which
  prevented the general supply o f alcohol in transit and the universality o f CCTV have m ade a m ajor impact.
  Taken together the effect has been th at displays o f wild aggression from hordes o f drunken supporters are
  m uch less frequent. The hooligan has moved out o f the cam era’s range and in a word, there has been
  “displacem ent” away from the terraces to the darker confines o f the stadium or to other venues such as
  public houses and to the transit system” .

   416. This, together with other police evidence I have received, shows that although football generally and
a m atch in particular provide the occasion an d the focal point for hooligan activity, m any hooligans do not
regard it as essential to be able to enter the ground. They need the converging crowds and the inter-club
rivalry or enm ity o f a m atch to set the scene for their violence. They do not need the football itself. M r Ridley,
in his observations quoted above (paragraph 338) said:-

  “If hooligans know th a t they will not be allowed into football matches, they will have no incentive to travel
  to th e m ” .

  However, exclusion from the ground does not necessarily remove the incentive for hooligans to tu rn up
there.

   417. I fear it may be merely wishful thinking to assume that football hooligans, banned from inside
grounds, will not, if they are free to do so, tu rn up and cause trouble outside, in public houses or in the town.
It would be surprising if hooligans o f M r Justice Popplewell’s group I (paragraph 48 supra) were totally to
ab andon their activities o f attacking and baiting away supporters just because they could not themselves get
into the ground.

  418. It is argued by advocates o f the scheme that elim inating hooligans from outside the ground, as well as
inside it, has been achieved at Lutcn. However, the success at Luton does not in my view bear directly upon
the likely outcom e o f the national scheme. The m ain factor in Luton’s success has been the ban on away
supporters which removes the focus for violence. There are also the other factors already noted, the
geographical position o f Luton, the com paratively small attendances and the fact that the Luton scheme has
operated at only one club.

  419. I therefore have grave doubts w hether the scheme will achieve its object o f elim inating hooligans
from inside the ground. I have even stronger doubts as to w hether it will achieve its further object o f ending
football hooliganism outside grounds. Indeed, I do not think it will. I fear that, in the short term at least, it
may actually increase trouble outside grounds.
                                                 C H A P T E R 17

                                            POLICE RESOURCES

  420. The scheme envisages that the checking procedure at turnstiles will let valid card holders through but
will produce the three types o f failure already described. Each o f those three types o f failure may involve an
offence by the person presenting the card and the first type is quite likely to do so. There will therefore have to
be police present to apprehend the suspect, investigate the circum stances and, it may be, make an arrest. I
have already quoted the estim ated failures o f types (1) and (2) anticipated in the SOR. Even assuming the
estimates are correct for the grounds as a whole, there will be no means o f knowing how many problem
cards” wall be presented at any particular bank o f turnstiles. There will need to be enough police to be able to
m onitor each turnstile throughout the adm ission period. If a banned card is presented, the entrant will need
to be taken by an officer to “an investigation area”. T he SOR anticipates there will need to be one
investigation area at each side o f the ground. Presumably, staff there will be equipped with the m eans to
investigate the problem card fully. It may then be necessary for the suspect to be arrested and processed.
W hilst the officer who has apprehended him is away from the turnstile through which the suspect came,
further card holders should be com ing through the same turnstile at a rate o f about 1 per 8 seconds or faster.
There will therefore need to be enough officers to cope with further problem cards. Even if the apprehending
officer merely takes the suspect to an investigation room and hands him over to officers stationed there
before returning to his post, the turnover rate at the turnstiles would need a substantial num ber o f officers.
Requiring stewards to do the jo b may be in appropriate since arrests may have to be made. Again, if the
suspect realises he may be about to be arrested, he may seek to rush off and lose him self in the crowd. So
dealing with presenters o f “problem cards” may have to be done solely by the police. I f the scheme showed,
after an initial period, that the incidence o f “problem cards” h ad settled dow’n to a m odest number, the police
com m itm ent could be reduced. But initially, considerable num bers will be needed to perform these functions
in addition to those habitually undertaken.

  421. Police anxiety about this com m itm e n t o f resources is sum m arised as follows by ACPO:

  “The second level at which the technology causes concern relates to procedures following a “red light” at
  the turnstiles. Policing at turnstiles at present is very selective and the Police Service could not
  countenance providing the sort o f cover which would allow for a quick response to each turnstile in the
  event o f a problem. The only powers conferred in the Bill are on the police and on the face o f it every
  attem pt to enter which activates a “red light” suggests an offence is being comm itted. At M anchester
  U nited for example 30,000 people will pass through the turnstiles in just over 20 m inutes before kick-off.
  There are about 100 turnstiles and the prospects o f policing this system are absolutely daunting .

  422. The example o f M anchester U n ited in that passage is confirm ed by the club itself in a paper on the
national m em bership scheme entitled “A U nited Perspective” . At page 3, the club says:

  “We have yet to be shown the com puter hardw are that will do the work successfully. M anchester U nited
  has run a com puterised box office for m ore than 15 years now an d it is well known that what is prom ised by
  com puter com panies rarely, if ever, performs to anything like its supposed potential in “real situations
  where they may have had no experience. Average attendances at Old Trafford are around 40,000 but on
  occasions this figure can go as high as 56,000. Experience shows that around 50% arrive in the last 30
  minutes before kick-off and this num ber increases substantially for evening m atches.”

   423. There is a risk therefore that, at big matches, police control o f procedures at the turnstiles during the
last 20 minutes before kick-off, in addition to their present duties, may create serious problems. Apart from
the num bers o f officers needed, space will have to be found for investigation rooms. It is doubtful whether
one “investigation area” at each side o f a ground like Old Trafford will suffice. I therefore have strong doubts
about the practicality o f policing the scheme effectively.

                       STRATEGIES AGAINST H O O LIG A NISM - C O N CLU SIO N S

  424. I fully understand and respect the reasons which p rom pted the prom otion an d enactm ent o f the
Football Spectators Act 1989. However, it follows from my com m ents in the last three chapters that I have
grave doubts about the feasibility o f the national m em bership scheme and serious misgivings about its likely
im pact on safety. I also have grave doubts about the chances o f its achieving its purposes an d am very anxious
about its potential im pact on police com m itm ents and control o f spectators. For these reasons, I cannot
support the im plem entation o f Part I o f the Act.

Suggested Strategy
  425. As has been said many times, there is no single measure w'hich will defeat football hooliganism and
even a package o f measures will take tim e to have effect.

  426. T hat said, the strategy I would suggest is to consider relying upon a com bination o f all or some o f the
following measures:-

    (i)   Developing the detection and evidential potential o f CCTV and the new N ational Football
          Intelligence Unit;

    (ii) Prohibiting, by creating crim inal offences, three specific activities in the ground:

          (a) throwing a missile;

          (b) chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

          (c) going on the pitch w ithout reasonable excuse;

    (iii) Extending the courts’ power to make attendance centre orders, in conjunction with exclusion orders,
          for football related offences on occasions o f specified m atches so as to keep hooligans away from
          football grounds;

    (iv) Using electronic m onitoring (tagging) for the same purpose.

   427. These four measures are all aim ed solely at the hooligans and will impinge only on them. Moreover,
(iii) an d (iv) are the only m easures, other th an im prisonm ent, aim ed not only at b anning hooligans from the
ground but also at preventing them from getting into it o r near it during matches. P u t together with progress
towards all-seating, im proved acco m m odation , better facilities, improved arrangem ents for crowd control
a n d better training o f police a n d stewards to achieve it, I believe these measures would give the best chance o f
elim inating or m inim ising football hooliganism.
                             PART V - FIN A L R E C O M M E N D A T IO N S

All-Seated Accommodation
  1. The Secretary of State should ensure that spectators are admitted only to seated accommodation at
matches played at sports grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 in accordance with
the timing set out in Recommendations 2 to 4 below.

  2. Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the 1993/4 season at high-risk matches as
defined under the UEFA Regulations set out in paragraph 82 above.

  3. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 above should apply with effect from the start of
the 1994/5 season to all matches at grounds in the first and second divisions of the Football League, the
Premier Division of the Scottish Football League, and at national stadia, subject to a reasonable extension of
time in the case of a club promoted to the second division of the Football League or the Premier Division of the
Scottish Football League. Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 20% of the
present standing capacity (such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8
below), the first 20% deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1994.

  4. Subject to Recommendation 2 above, Recommendation 1 should apply with effect from the start of the
1999/2000 season to all matches at all other grounds designated under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975.
Standing accommodation at these grounds should be reduced annually by 10% of the present standing capacity'
(such present standing capacity to be calculated according to Recommendation 8 below), the first 10%
deduction being effective from August 1990 so as to eliminate standing by August 1999.

Advisory D esign Council
  5. The Football Association and the Football League should establish an Advisory Design Council whose
functions should be:

    (a) to conduct and marshal research into the improvement and design of football stadia;

    (b) to disseminate regularly such information and expertise as they acquire in this field to members of the
        Football League and, on request, to other football and sports clubs in England, Wales and Scotland.

N ational Inspectorate and Review Body
  6. (a) If Part I of the Football Spectators Act 1989 is implemented, section 13 should be brought into force
giving the Football Licensing Authority the functions and powers therein specified (power to review the
discharge of functions by local authorities). If Part I of the Act is not implemented or is substantially delayed,
other arrangements should be made for the discharge of the functions and powers in section 13 of the Act by the
appointment of a body to exercise them.

      (b)       In either event, the body exercising those functions and powers in relation to association football
should also be entrusted with similar functions and powers regarding the discharge by local authorities of their
certifying and licensing functions in relation to other sports grounds and sports entertainments pursuant to the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 and Parts III and IV of the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act
1987.

M axim um Capacities for Terraces
  7. W7here a viewing terrace is divided into pens or areas which are self-contained, the Safety Certificate
should specify the maximum number of spectators to be admitted to each such pen or area.

A pen or area is to be deemed “self-contained” notwithstanding that it has a gate or gates affording access to
another pen or area and whether such gate or gates be open or shut.

  8. Each figure for maximum capacity should be assessed in accordance with Chapter 16 of the Green Guide
(“the Green Guide figure”) subject to the following qualifications:-

    (a) the maximum density permitted under paragraphs 221 and 222 of the Green Guide (when the terrace
        or viewing slope is in good condition) should be 47 not 54;
#
        (b) the minimum figure specified in paragraphs 221 and 222 (when the terrace or viewing slope materially
            deviates from the recommended guidelines, so as to constitute a possible hazard to individuals closely
            packed) should be 0 not 27;

        (c) in arriving at “the Green Guide figure”, proper and realistic allowance must be made for all factors
            which should reduce the permissible density including those specified in paragraphs 220 to 224
            inclusive of the Green Guide.

      9. Arrangements should be made:-

        (a) to limit the number of spectators entering each self-contained pen or area to the maximum capacity
            figure assessed in accordance with Recommendation 8 above either electronically, mechanically, by a
            ticketing arrangement, by counting or otherwise, and

        (b) to close off further access to such pen or area when its maximum capacity is about to be reached.

      10. The maximum notional rate at which spectators can pass through a turnstile should be 660 persons per
    hour, not 750 per hour as stated in paragraph 47 of the Green Guide. The maximum rate for any particular
    turnstile must take full account of all circumstances including those given as examples in paragraph 47.


    Filling and M onitoring Terraces
       11. There should be a written statement of intent, agreed between the club and the police, setting out their
    respective functions as to crowd safety and control and in particular as to the filling of each self-contained pen or
    other standing area and the monitoring of spectators in each such pen or area to avoid overcrowding. Any
    variation of the document in respect of an individual match should be agreed in writing in advance.

      12. (a) At each match, there should be on the perimeter track, for each self-contained pen or other standing
    area (subject to (b) below), a steward (if the club is monitoring that area) or a police officer (if the police are
    monitoring it) whose sole duty is to check crowd conditions in that area for possible overcrowding or distress
    throughout the period the area is occupied by spectators. Whoever is so appointed should be in addition to any
    other steward or police presence. He should have ready access to a police officer who can authorise access
    through gates to the pitch under Recommendation 20 below.

          (b)       This Recommendation need not be applied to any self-contained pen or other standing area where the
    spectators present, or reasonably to be expected, during a particular match do not exceed one third of the area’s
    maximum permitted capacity, or 2,000, whichever is the lower.


    Gangways
      13. Gangways should be kept clear, in accordance with paragraphs 97 to 99 of the Green Guide. Gangways
    should be painted in a conspicuous colour whether they are sunk or not. The Safety Certificate should require
    that no standing is allowed in gangways and that they be painted.


    Fences and Gates
      14. All spikes or similar constructions on perimeter or radial fences, and any sections overhanging or
    returning inwards towards spectators, should be removed.

      15. Perimeter fencing should be no higher than 2.2 metres, measured from the top of the fence to the lowest
    point at which spectators may stand, and including any wall or other foundations forming part of the perimeter
    boundary.

      16. All police officers and stewards with duties in relation to the standing areas and especially those with
    duties under Recommendation 12 above, should be fully briefed and trained with regard to the recognition of
    crowd densities, to the recognition of signs of distress and to crowd dynamics. Training should include
    demonstrations at the ground and photographs, designed to enable stewards and officers to recognise different
    crowd densities.

      17. There must be provided in any perimeter fence of a pen or other self-contained area sufficient gates of a
    minimum width of 1.1 metres to enable that pen or area to be evacuated onto the pitch in the time prescribed for
    an emergency evacuation of that pen or area.


                                                             77
   18. All gates in radia! or perimeter fences of pens or other self-contained areas should be painted in a
different colour from the rest of the fence and marked “Emergency Exit’’.

  19. Where there is a perimeter fence in front of a pen or enclosure, all gates to the pitch should be kept fully
open during the period when spectators are in the pen or enclosure, wherever those in command feel that this
can safely be done. Whether they be fully open, partially open or closed, they should be kept unlocked
throughout the period when the pen or enclosure is occupied.

   20. Each gate in a perimeter fence affording access to the pitch from a pen or enclosure should be manned by
a steward or by a police officer when the pen or enclosure is occupied. Whether such manning should be by a
police officer or by a steward should be decided by the Police Commander. In either event, the Police
Commander should appoint one or more police officers with power to authorise access through gates to the
pitch immediately in the event of an emergency.

  21. Suitable and sufficient cutting equipment should be provided by the club at each ground where there are
perimeter fences to permit the immediate removal of enough fencing to release numbers of spectators if
necessary. Agreement should be reached as to whether the equipment should be used by police, the fire brigade
or stewards. Whoever is to use it should be trained to do so. Whether to use it should be a decision of a
nominated senior police officer at the ground.


Crush Barriers
  22. All crush barriers should be visually inspected each year for signs of corrosion. Any barrier found to be
affected by a significant degree of corrosion should be repaired or replaced.

   23. The layout of barriers in each pen or terraced area should be reviewed immediately (if this has not
already been done following the Interim Report) to ensure that it complies with the criteria contained in
Chapter 9 of the Green Guide. If it does not, the assessment of the maximum capacity figure for that pen or
terraced area, in accordance with Recommendation 8 above, should reflect the fact.


Safety Certificates
   24. The Secretary of State should exercise his powers under either section 6(2) or section 15(A) of the Safety
of Sports Grounds Act 1975 so as to make mandatory in Safety Certificates those conditions specified in the
original section 2(2) of the 1975 Act. So far as the original section 2(2)(b) is concerned “shall” should be
substituted for “may”.

  25. In assessing these mandatory requirements in the Certificate for a particular ground, the local authority
should follow the Green Guide criteria. Once that is done, the resultant figures and terms for that ground
should be specified in the Safety Certificate and no variation from them should be permitted other than by
formal revision.

  26. W'here a local authority incorporates any provision of the Green Guide into the Safety Certificate, other
than one within the scope of Recommendation 25 above, it should make clear whether that provision is to be
complied with absolutely or with discretionary flexibility.

   27. There should be an immediate review of each Safety Certificate (if this has not already been done
following the Interim Report) by the responsible local authority', which should consult the club in respect of
which the Certificate is issued, the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and the building authority.
Such a review should include an inspection of the stadium. Its object should be to ensure that the operative
conditions of the Certificate are complied with and to add or substitute any condition shown to be necessary as a
matter of urgency following the findings and Recommendations in this Report.

  28. Any local authority within whose area there exists a sports ground designated under the 1975 Act for
which no Safety Certificate has yet been issued should proceed forthwith to remedy the situation.

  29. Every Safety Certificate should be reviewed by the local authority at least once annually and each
Certificate should require to be renewed annually.

  30. Each local authority should review its arrangements for issuing, monitoring, enforcing, reviewing,
amending and renewing Safety Certificates (if this has not already been done following the Interim
Report). Such review should require that there exists or is provided an accountable administrative structure
whereby the functions of the local authority are regularly and effectively supervised by senior officers and
elected members and decisions are properly taken in accordance with the local authority’s rules.

   31.   To assist the local authority in exercising its functions, it should set up an Advisory Group (if this has not
already been done) consisting of appropriate members of its own staff, representatives of the police, of the fire
and ambulance services and of the building authority. The Adv isory Group should consult representatives of the
club and of a recognised supporters’ organisation on a regular basis. The Advisory Group’s terms of reference
should encompass all matters concerned with crowd safety and should require regular visits to the ground and
attendance at matches. The Advisory Group should have a chairman from the local authority, and an effective
procedure. Its resolutions should be recorded and it should be required to produce regular written reports for
consideration by the local authority.


Duties of Each Football Club
  32. Each turnstile should be inspected and its potential rate of flow measured (if this has not already been
done following the Interim Report). Thereafter, regular inspections should be made to ensure that each turnstile
remains capable of admitting spectators at the rate anticipated.

  33. The correlation between each viewing area in the stadium and the turnstiles serving it should be such as
to ensure that all the spectators intended to be admitted to that viewing area can pass through the turnstiles
within one hour. If that cannot be done, the capacity of that viewing area should be reduced accordingly. Since
this Recommendation includes terms and conditions within the scope of the original section 2(2)(c)(i) of the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975 it should be given effect in the Safety Certificate (see Recommendation 24
above).

  34. Turnstiles should be closed when the permitted capacity of the area served by them is about to be reached
and arrangements should be made to ensure quick and effective communication with turnstile operators for this
purpose.

  35. Closed circuit television should be so installed as to enable crowd densities outside the ground, within
concourse areas and in pens and other standing areas, to be monitored before, throughout and at the end of a
match.

  36. All signposting for spectators both outside and inside the ground should be comprehensively reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report). It should, in relation to the arrangements for each
match, be unambiguous, eye-catching, simple and clear and should be designed to ensure the rapid movement of
spectators to their appropriate viewing areas. Any redundant signs should be removed.

  37. Information on tickets should be unambiguous, simple and clear and should correlate absolutely with the
information provided in respect of each match both outside and inside the ground. Retained ticket stubs should
contain information necessary to guide spectators once inside the ground.

  38. Information on tickets requesting spectators to be in position by a particular time should be reviewed (if
this has not already been done following the Interim Report) by clubs in conjunction with the police to ensure
that it corresponds with the planned arrangements for admitting spectators to the ground.

  39. Clubs should consider maintaining a record on computer of ticket sales before the day of the match, for
season tickets and tickets for all-ticket matches for seated areas, containing the names and addresses of those
purchasing tickets.

  40. All-ticket matches should be confined to those at which a capacity or near capacity crowd is expected.
When a match has been designated all-ticket, clubs should not sell tickets at the match and should take steps to
advise the spectators of both clubs accordingly.

  41. Each club should consult with a recognised supporters’ club as to the provision of pre-match
entertainment aimed at attracting spectators to the ground in good time.

   42. Clubs should recruit and retain sufficient competent stewards. They should be fit, active and robust, and
preferably between the ages of 18 and 55. Clubs should ensure that stewards are fully trained, aware of their
duties under Annex B of the Green Guide and under the statement of intent (see Recommendation 11) and able
to perform them.


                                                         79
  43. The club should provide a police control room which is:-

     (a) well placed, so as to command a good view of the whole pitch and of the spectator area surrounding it;

     (b) of sufficient size for the commander, his deputy and enough officers to operate the radios, telephones
         and CCTV screens. There should be space for others who may need from time to time to visit the room
         eg other senior officers, club management or a member of the emergency services;

     (c) well equipped with CCTV, radio and telephone facilities and, where necessary, sound-proofed against
         excessive crowd noise.

  It should be the duty of the club to provide a room and equipment to the satisfaction of the chief officer
nominated under Recommendation 44 below.


Police Planning
  44. The Chief Constable of each police force in whose area there is one designated sports ground or more
should nominate a chief officer to liaise with the management of each football club and local authority
concerned in respect of the safety and control of crowds.

  45. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground, and the pre-match briefing of all
officers on duty there, should alert such officers to the importance of preventing any overcrowding and, if any is
detected, of taking appropriate steps to remedy it.

  46. The Operational Order for each match at a designated sports ground should enable the police to cope
with any foreseeable pattern in the arrival of spectators at a match and in their departure. It should provide for
sufficient reserves to enable rapid deployment of officers to be made at any point inside or outside the ground.

  47. Police planning should provide that ticketless fans should not be allowed to enter a designated sports
ground except in an emergency.

  48. Arrest procedures inside and outside designated sports grounds should be reviewed so as to keep to the
minimum the period during which an arresting officer is away from his post.

  49. The option to postpone kick-off should be in the discretion of the officer in command at the ground.
Crowd safety should be the paramount consideration in deciding whether to exercise it.

  50. Consideration in consultation with the club should be given, especially for high-risk matches, to the
possibility of an early kick-off or a Sunday fixture.

  51. There should be available in the police control room the results of all closed circuit television monitoring
outside and inside the ground and the record of any electronic or mechanical counting of numbers at turnstiles
or of numbers admitted to any area of the ground. Officers in the control room should be skilled in the
interpretation and use of these data.

   52. Consideration should be given to the provision of a specific training course for senior officers presently
acting as Police Commanders and those in line to do so. Such a course should include training in the basic
strategy of policing football matches.

  53. Police authorities should review the charges they make to clubs for the costs of policing inside grounds so
as to ensure that realistic charges are made. The Home Office should take steps to ensure consistency of
practice, subject to local discretion and the need to have regard to local circumstances.


Communications
  54.     There should be sufficient operators in the police control room to enable all radio transmissions to be
received, evaluated and answered. The radio system should be such as to give operators in the control room
priority over, and the capacity to override, others using the same channel. Additional channels should be used,
where necessary, to prevent overcrowding of the airwaves.


                                                       80
  55. There should always be a command channel reserved solely for the Police Commander to communicate
with his senior officers round the ground.

   56. To complement radio communications, there should be a completely separate system of land lines with
telephone links between the control room and key points at the ground.

  57. Within the control room, there should be a public address system to communicate with individual areas
outside and inside the ground, with groups of areas or with the whole ground. Im portant announcements should
be preceded by a loud signal to catch the attention of the crowd despite a high level of noise in the ground. This
arrangement should be prominently advertised on every programme sold for every match.

  58. Use should be made where possible of illuminated advertising boards to address the crowd.


Co-ordination of Emergency Services
   59. The police, fire and ambulance services should maintain through senior nominated officers regular
liaison concerning crowd safety at each designated sports ground.

  60. Before each match at a designated sports ground the police should ensure th a t the fire service and
ambulance service are given full details about the event, including its venue, its timing, the number of spectators
expected, their likely routes of entry and exit, and any anticipated or potential difficulties concerning the
control or movement of the crowd. Such details should be readily available in the control rooms of each of the
emergency services.

  61. Lines of communication, whether by telephone or by radio, from the police control room to the local
headquarters of all emergency services should be maintained a t all times so th at emergency calls can be made
instantly.

  62. Contingency plans for the arrival at each designated sports ground of emergency vehicles from all three
services should be reviewed. They should include routes of access, rendezvous points, and accessibility within
the ground itself.

  63. Police officers posted at the entrances to the ground should be briefed as to the contingency plans for the
arrival of emergency services and should be informed when such services are called as to where and why they are
required.


First Aid, M edical Facilities and Ambulances
  64. There should be at each sports ground at each match at least one trained first aider per 1,000 spectators.
The club should have the responsibility for securing such attendance.

  65. There should be at each designated sports ground one or more first aid rooms. The number of such rooms
and the equipment to be maintained within them should be specified by the local authority after taking
professional medical advice and should be made a requirement of every Safety Certificate.

   66. (a) A t every match where the number of spectators is expected to exceed 2,000, the club should employ a
medical practitioner to be present and available to deal with any medical exigency at the ground. H e should be
trained and competent in advanced first aid. H e should be present at the ground at least an hour before kick-off
and should remain until half an hour after the end of the match. H is whereabouts should be known to those in
the police control room and he should be immediately contactable.

       (b)        At any match where the number of spectators is not expected to exceed 2,000, the club should make
arrangements to enable a medical practitioner to be summoned immediately to deal with any medical exigency
at the ground. H e should be trained and competent in advanced first aid. T he arrangements made should be
known to those in the police control room.

  67. At least one fully equipped ambulance from or approved by the appropriate ambulance authority should
be in attendance at all matches with an expected crowd of 5,000 or more.

   68. The number of ambulances to be in attendance for matches where larger crowds are expected should be
specified by the local authority after consultation with the ambulance service and should be made a requirement
of the Safety Certificate.


                                                        81
  69. A “major incident equipment vehicle”, designed and equipped to deal with up to 50 casualties, should be
deployed in addition to other ambulance attendance at a match where a crowd in excess of 25,000 is expected.


Offences and Penalties
 70. Consideration should be given to creating an offence of selling tickets for and on the day of a football
match without authority from the home club to do so.

  71. Each of the following activities at a designated sports ground should be made a specific offence: -

    i.    throwing a missile;

    ii.   chanting obscene or racialist abuse;

    iii. going on the pitch without reasonable excuse.

  72. Consideration should be given to extending the courts’ powers to make attendance centre orders for
football related offences on occasions of designated football matches. The provision should be capable of
imposition on an offender aged 21 or over and subject to a maximum of 72 hours in the case of an offender aged
17 or over.

  73. Consideration should be given to the use of electronic monitoring (tagging) in the sentencing of offenders
convicted of football related offences.


Green Guide
  74. As a matter of urgency, the Home Office should set up a body to revise the Green Guide in accordance
with this Report, these Recommendations and the Report of the Technical Working Party (Appendix 3).

  75. In any revision of the Green Guide, the values to be achieved by way of percentage recovery after the
required loading tests on crush barriers should be specified. Acceptable values for various materials should be
specified.

  76. W hen the Green Guide is revised, the need to inspect crush barriers for possible corrosion should be
specifically mentioned and emphasised.

                                                                                                 22 D ecem ber 1989


D ear Sir Peter

You invited the Technical Working Party “to review technical aspects o f the guide to Safety at Sports
Grounds; identify areas requiring clarification o r am endm ent; and recom m end accordingly.” I have pleasure
in subm itting its Report, which has been agreed by all members. Detailed supplem entary notes dealing with
certain o f the technical features will be available for your use in due course.

We note that the G uide is not confined to football grounds and stadia but includes guidance on all sports
grounds, and we have borne this in m ind in o u r considerations. Although not within o u r term s o f reference,
and for that reason not addressed in o u r Report, we recognise that efficient and effective stewarding is an
integral element o f crowd control and safety. O u r recom m endations com plem ent, rather than supplant, the
need for such stewarding.

The Technical Working Party met first on 18 O ctober and held five formal day-long meetings supplemented
by m any working papers and informal discussions during the period available for report. T he heavy pressures
o f the tim etable could not have been accom m odated w ithout the fullest co-operation o f those concerned, and
I record my thanks to all members o f the Technical Working Party and to its Secretary for the integrity,
co m m itm en t and enthusiasm with which they approached the task.

                                                                                          LEONARD M AUNDER




                            R E P O R T O F T H E T E C H N IC A L W O R K IN G PARTY

The Green Guide
    1. The Technical Working Party recognises the valuable contributions o f successive editions o f the G uide
to Safety at Sports G rounds, com m only known as the Green G uide. Its scope and status are described in its
introduction as follows: “This booklet provides guidance to ground m anagem ent, local authorities and
technical specialists such as engineers on measures for improving spectator safety at existing sports grounds.
It is a voluntary guide and has no legal force”.

   2. In view o f the variability o f existing sports grounds in function and in scale, there are serious difficulties
in establishing comprehensive an d general regulations, backed by legal force, to cover all the complex details
o f design an d construction. Adherence to the standards set by Building Regulations should provide a
measure o f uniformity in respect o f new work at sports grounds. Nevertheless, the Technical Working Party is
strongly o f the opinion that a m uch higher degree o f standardisation than presently prevails should be sought
in practice.

   3. It considers that a revised issue o f the G reen G uide should form the basis on which a designated ground
o r stand is certified by the certifying authority, and recom m ends that any departures from its guidance on
technical provisions that may arise from local circumstances should be fully defined and should be subject to
approval in writing by the certifying authority.

A Centre of Expertise
   4. The Green G uide covers a wide range o f material, m uch o f which concerns the physical characteristics
o f grounds. Its successive issues have been published in response to a n u m b er o f serious accidents at football
grounds. This process has led to incremental advances in the G uide as experience has grown, but the
Technical Working Party does not believe th at such a process, although essential, is by itself sufficient to cope
with present-day requirements.

  5. M any British football grounds were first constructed a long tim e ago, and im provem ents have been
introduced largely on an individual basis. A central body o f knowledge applicable to the complex design o f
such grounds has been conspicuously absent although a start has now been made. As a result, progress has
been piecemeal.

   6. The Technical Working Party considers that this is a serious defect. A continuous and expanding body
o f public knowledge, drawn from the relevant professional fields, is required to provide a basis for good
individual designs at m odern standards. At a tim e when substantial im provem ents are und er consideration,
including a higher proportion o f seated accom m odation, it is im perative to establish an d to disseminate
rigorous standards o f design if expectations are to be fulfilled. The work o f organisations in other countries,
including the C om itato Olim pico Nazionale Italiano (CONI), can provide a valuable reference. The
Technical Working Party recognises, too, the im portant work undertaken in this country by the Sports
Council. Its recent guide to the planning, design and m anagem ent o f indoor arenas is a noteworthy attem pt
to draw together a considerable body o f research and practical experience. Similarly, other work on outdoor
stadia has taken place and is currently proceeding under the Council’s aegis. It is im portant that resulting
publications should be widely dissem inated and th at any guidance on o utd o o r stadia should make particular
reference to the structural aspects o f safety, comfort and crowd control.

   7. The Technical Working Party therefore recom m ends the form ation o f a central body, under a title such
as the Advisory Council for Sports G rounds, to provide an authoritative source o f knowledge for all those
involved in the design and construction o f outd o o r stadia. A detailed specification o f its structure and
funding is not proposed at this stage but, as envisaged, its m em bers would be drawn from the relevant
professional fields and would com m ission specialist advice when necessary. It would be independent o f any
Inspectorate. The relationship o f such a body to other organisations is a m atter for further discussion, but it
is suggested that the Football Association and the Sports Council might wish to play leading roles.

Seating and Standing
  8. The Technical Working Party notes that FIFA has agreed regulations on seating for certain classes o f
football matches, and that the regulations are to be im posed w’ithin a short time-scale. It also recognises that
the British tradition o f standing on terraces runs counter to these international requirements.

   9. It is clear that if British clubs are to continue within the international community, they will be obliged
to close their standing accom m odation for m atches that fall within the FIFA definition. For other matches,
the Technical Working Party recognises that, whilst standing accom m odation is not intrinsically unsafe, the
benefits to spectator com fort and crowd control brought about by all-seater stadia are likely to accelerate the
move towards such venues. The Technical W orking Party accepts, however, that although the introduction o f
all-seater stadia for leading, well-supported football clubs may be both beneficial and practical, clubs in the
lower divisions may find it less so and the removal o f all standing accom m odation at these grounds may
affect their viability. Alterations to seating from standing arrangem ents at existing grounds may have both
design and cost implications through the im pact on such m atters as spectator sight-lines and crowd density.

   10. In addition, it must be recognised th a t there are m any sports (horse, greyhound, m o to r racing an d car
rallying for example) where the nature o f the sport favours the mobility o f large sections o f the crowd and
where viewing from standing areas is an essential element. Any recom m endations towards all-seater stadia
m ust therefore be carefully worded.

Capacities
   11. The Technical Working Party recognises that the safe allowable capacity o f any viewing area, whether
seated or standing, is the least o f (i) its holding capacity, (ii) the num ber o f persons who can leave through a
norm al exit system w ithin a prescribed tim e at the end o f an event, (iii) the nu m b er o f persons who can leave
through an emergency exit system w ithin a prescribed time, and (iv) the n u m ber o f persons who can be
ad m itted through the turnstiles serving that area within one hour.

   12. The theoretical holding capacity o f a seated viewing area is simply the n u m b er o f seats in good
condition which comply with the relevant G reen G uide recom m endations including those relating to
distance from exits and gangways and size and spacing. D eterm ination o f the holding capacity o f a viewing
terrace or slope is not so simple; factors th a t m ust be taken into account include the strength and spacing of
the crush-barriers, the position o f gangways, the dim ensions and physical state o f the steps, the effective
standing area, and the acceptable packing density.

   13. A packing density o f 5.4/m 2 is recom m ended in the current Green G uide as the m ax im u m allowable
figure for terraces and viewing slopes th at meet all the specified guidelines. A reduced figure o f 2 .7 /n r is
presently recom m ended for areas deviating materially from the guidelines. The Technical Working Party sees
no point in retaining reference to the lower figure and recom m ends that there should be no lower limit to the
reduction; ie if the enclosure had such poor safety standards that it was totally unfit as a viewing area the
figure should be zero.

   14. As to the m axim um figures, the Technical Working Party concludes that a uniformly distributed
density o f 5.4/m 2 should be safe in static conditions where the terraces are in full compliance with the Green
G uide. It recognises, however, that there will be variations o f density w ithin a given enclosure, and allowance
should be m ade to accom m odate this factor in the final determ ination.

   15. The Technical Working Party recom m ends that the m axim um allowable average packing density
determ ined by the Inquiry should establish a general reference for certifying authorities. For an individual
ground, the packing density applicable to a given standing area should be derived from this figure, the full
figure for areas in good condition and reduced figures for areas in poorer condition. Detailed calculations o f
holding capacities should then be determ ined on the basis o f the agreed packing density for that specific
enclosure or other relevant factors. These calculations should take into account specific features o f the
crush-barriers a n d fences and o f step dim ensions as illustrated in the Green Guide. The Technical Working
Party recom m ends a thorough review o f the examples currently contained in C hapter 16 o f the G reen Guide,
and the inclusion o f appropriate diagrams.

Structural Elements
   16. It is a fundam ental requirem ent o f safety that structures at grounds should provide spectators with
safe accom m odation and safe m eans o f ingress and egress. They should also enable police and stewards to
exert proper control over crowd movements. If a conflict should occur between these objectives, a substantial
re-arrangem ent may be required; in no circumstances should safety standards be com prom ised. The
Technical Working Party recom m ends that references to sub-divisions in C hap ter 14 o f the Green G uide be
reviewed with these considerations in mind, and that the C hapter as a whole should reflect these principles
m ore positively.

Separation of Viewing Areas and Pitch
   17. The Technical Working Party recognises the im portance o f physical barriers as deterrents to pitch
invasions. It also recognises th a t not all viewing areas present the same risk, and recom m ends that
consideration be given to differentiating those areas requiring higher levels o f security from other areas, such
as seated accom m odation and m em bers’ enclosures, where a lesser degree o f security might be acceptable.

   18. The general principle o f separation endorsed by the Technical Working Party is that the means
adopted should provide sufficient security against pitch incursions to enable the police to take timely and
effective action should such incidents occur. Clearly a balance has to be struck between crowd control and
safety.

    19. A configuration recom m ended for w ider consideration consists o f a perim eter barrier on the
pitch-side backed by a parallel and continuous crush-barrier on the terrace-side, set back from the perim eter
barrier so as to provide a clear walk-way between the two; except in emergencies, spectators would not be
allowed to enter the walk-way. Such an arrangem ent would reduce the risks associated with a com m on feature
o f British grounds, namely that the front steps o f terraces are substantially lower than the level o f the pitch:
im m ediate attention should be given to the elim ination o f this hazard.

  20. The Technical Working Party recom m ends that the m axim um height o f perim eter fences should be
determ ined in relation to the UEFA standard o f 2.2m. It also recom m ends the removal o f overhanging
sections and spiked or barbed-wire attachm ents at the tops o f fences.

   21. A form o f separation increasingly adopted in new stadia is the dry moat. To be effective, a dry m oat
m ust be sufficiently wide and deep, and should be protected by fences on both sides to ensure that spectators
and players do not fall into it. W here enough space is available, a m oat may offer an attractive solution, but
its application to older grounds is likely to be restricted by lim itations o f space.

Emergency Access to Pitch
  22. The Technical Working Party recom m ends that emergency access to the pitch should be provided
from all adjacent viewing areas. It considers the provision o f gates or gaps in any formal barrier to be in all
cases advantageous for the evacuation o f adjacent enclosures and essential except where adequate, safe


                                                        91
#

    alternative arrangem ents exist. W here fences, barriers or m oats are installed the m ajority view o f the
    Technical Working Party is that there should be clear gangways leading to emergency exits on to the pitch.
    Such gangways m ust be properly identified and kept clear at all times. The exit gates or gaps should be at least
    1.1 metres wide o r as wide as the gangways feeding into them , whichever is the larger and should be sufficient
    in dim ensions and spacing to allow evacuation o f the enclosure within a prescribed time. The Working Party
    recorded a m inority view that the need to police gangways exacerbated friction on terraces, and that
    gangways were not always essential for proper crowd control and safety.

    Crush Barriers
      23. A review o f the procedures for inspection and testing o f barriers is recom m ended. The Technical
    Working Party considers that greater emphasis should be given to thorough recorded and certified annual
    visual inspections o f all crush barriers. Particular attention should be given to the developm ent o f corrosion.

      24. It is further recom m ended that 25% o f barriers, evenly spaced through each enclosure as designated by
    a com petent engineer, continue to be tested each year. In addition, all barriers which the inspection has
    identified as o f possibly sub-standard condition should also be tested.

       25. The adopted test m ethod should be capable o f applying to b arrier rail, post and foundation anchorage,
    a loading equivalent to a uniformly distributed load 1.20 x the design load o f the barrier as at present.

       26. The test procedure should be revised in line with current practice for structural testing to incorporate
    (i) a detailed visual inspection o f the barrier, (ii) a bedding-in cycle taken to a percentage o f the design loading
    an d (iii) a single cycle o f p roof testing taken as at present to 1.20 x the design loading. Deflections at all
    significant points should be recorded.

      27. After the full p roof load has been held for a m in im u m o f five m inutes the deflections should be
    recorded prio r to release o f loading an d the p erm anent residual unloaded deflections recorded after the load
    has been released.

      28. The Technical Working Party recom m ends the adoption o f two criteria for acceptable structural
    perform ance (i) th at no significant defects, including corrosion, are revealed by inspection and (ii) th a t the
    percentage recovery o f deflections after release o f the load during proof-testing achieves acceptable values.
    The specific values required will d epend on the m aterials o f construction.

      29. The Technical Working Party recom m ends that the distinction currently drawn in the G reen G uide
    between “peak” an d “non-peak“ viewing areas for the purpose o f assessing barrier spacing should be
    abolished. All areas should comply with the peak viewing specifications.

    Stands
      30. A substantial part o f C h apter 10 o f the G reen G uide, 'Roofed Stands with Seated A ccom m odation’,
    deals with tem porary structures. It is recom m ended that this material should be placed in a separate Chapter,
    and that it should give explicit references as required to British S tandards and to applicable regulations.

       31. The rem ainder, which might be called ‘Covered Standing and Seated A ccom m odation’, should clarify
    the special requirem ents for safety that are involved, noting that fire risk is not the only hazard and that
    statutory control o f the requirem ents may be vested in different authorities. Appropriate references to
    Building Regulations should be made. It is im p o rtan t to ensure that all spectators can be cleared into safe
    protected escape routes within prescribed times, although such routes need not be exits from the stand as a
    whole.

    Ingress/Egress
      32. The current Chapters on Ingress and Egress in the G reen G uide (Chapters 5 and 6) contain m uch
    useful inform ation, but are nonetheless in need o f some revision. C onsideration was given by the Technical
    Working Party to the possible am algam ation o f features com m on to both ingress and egress, but despite the
    com m on ground it is recognised that em phases might well differ. The Working Party does not therefore
    recom m end am algam ation o f the individual Chapters.

    Ingress
      33. The Technical Working Party felt that C hapter 5 needed expansion to incorporate additional clauses
    on (a) the positive counting and recording o f those passing through each turnstile; (b) the location of


                                                              92
am enities inside the ground to avoid obstructing or disrupting the flow between turnstile and enclosures; (c)
the sub-division o f enclosures; (d) the adequacy o f well distributed entrances into large enclosures to
facilitate even packing; and (e) the design o f entrances so as to avoid local pressure on spectators caused, for
example, by downward ramps. Informative diagrams should be adopted and general principles laid down,
wherever possible. The Technical Working Party would not favour the introduction o f numerical examples
which might, in any event, be difficult to establish. It views the current m axim um notional flow rate per
turnstile o f 750 persons per hour (as set out in paragraph 47 G reen G uide) as too high, and recom m ends a
figure o f 500 as the m edian for a normal turnstile. Furtherm ore, it recom m ends that variations up or down
be approved by the certifying authority, subject to a m axim um upper limit o f 660 persons per hour.

Egress
  34. G reater cross-referencing with other Chapters is required, and the Technical Working Party favours
expansion or a m endm ent o f a n u m b er o f paragraphs. In particular, the density figure set out in paragraph 54
in respect o f reservoir areas is felt to be too high, an d the m em bers o f the Technical Working Party
recom m end that, where reservoir areas cannot be removed from egress routes, a lower density o f 35-40
persons per 10 sq metres be substituted. The Technical Working Party favours greater em phasis on
networking, and believes that the Green G uide should include a stipulation th at each ground produce proper,
networked plans, delineating all aspects o f ingress/egress.

Enclosures/Turnstiles
  35. The Technical Working Party strongly recom m ends that there should be a direct one-to-one
relationship between banks o f turnstiles a n d enclosures in order to m aintain accurate counts o f entries. A
review o f the current state o f League grounds had shown that sub-divisions such as had occurred at
Hillsborough were uncom m on, and had generally been initiated by police for crowd control. W here such
sub-divisions do exist, it is imperative that the total num ber o f spectators entering each sub-division should
be counted separately.

Stairways and Ramps
  36. The Technical Working Party notes the dangers presented by stairways and ram ps, particularly those
used by the public in large num bers, an d recom m ends extensive redrafting o f the G reen G uide to present
more sharply the hazards involved. It recognises that the standards o f safety required for stairways and ramps
which form part o f the access between enclosures and an exit and those which exist as gangways within
enclosures differ and recom m ends that the differences be explained in m ore detail. Particular attention
should be given by certifying authorities to acceptable upper limits on the gradients o f ram ps and stairways.
The m ax im u m gradient for ram ps set out in the current G reen G uide was felt acceptable.

  37. Similarly, the Working Party believes th at the channelling o f flows by the provision o f handrails should
be given greater emphasis. The recom m ended width o f channel for both stairways and ram ps should not
exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast, and the width o f up to 1.8 metres perm itted by paragraph
76 should therefore be reduced accordingly. H andrails should extend, by at least 300m m beyond the top and
bo tto m o f any stairway or ramp.

  38. The difference between handrails, balustrades and barriers on o r near the top and bo tto m o f stairways
and ram ps, and their appropriate strength requirem ents, needs to be clarified.

  39. The Technical Working Party recom m ends the inclusion in the G reen G uide o f a greater num ber of
diagram s illustrating the potentially hazardous situations in relation to stairways and ram ps and o f the
principles behind the provisions.

Inspections and Tests
   40. Inspection and tests o f all equipm ent and structures at grounds are vital features o f good operation.
T heir range is wide, extending from visual inspection before and after each event to regular testing of
structural com ponents. It is a m atter o f serious concern that the interpretation o f requirem ents by those
responsible is unacceptably variable. The Technical Working Party considers that action should be taken to
ensure that com m on high standards o f inspection and test are realised, and makes the following
recom m endations.

  (i)   The Green G uide should include a com prehensive tabulation o f inspections and tests covering the
        essential technical features o f grounds. It should prescribe the m in im u m frequencies at which the
        inspections and tests should be conducted.
#
      (ii) The required levels o f com petence o f those carrying out the inspections and tests should be defined.

      (iii) Records o f the results o f inspections and tests, including the identification o f defects and the remedies
            adopted, should be certified by those carrying out the work.

      (iv) A national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the ad option o f com m on standards of
           inspection and test. Its term s o f reference should include the com pilation and m aintenance o f a
           national register o f organisations employed to carry o ut inspections and tests; central recording o f the
           extent and type o f the inspections and tests adopted at individual grounds; and the provision o f advice
           on inspection and test for those responsible for carrying out the work and for certifying authorities. It
           would be in the interest o f com m on standards if an Inspectorate o f this kind dealt with the grounds o f
           all relevant sports, and consideration should be given to its form ation through an association o f their
           governing bodies.

    Fire Safety
      41. There is general recognition amongst Technical Working Party m em bers that the current C hapter on
    Fire Safety (C hapter 11) is well-defined. It contains m uch useful advice on egress and means o f escape,
    application o f which is not restricted to fire risks and which would bear repetition in other Chapters.

       42. The Technical Working Party considers th at it is essential to m aintain simple, clear lines o f authority
    and com m unication; independent input from individual bodies is to be avoided. W ith that in m ind, its
    m em bers believe that consultation on all safety m atters should be directly with the certifying authority who,
    in turn, would consult with the fire, police, and oth er authorities.

    Emergency/Auxiliary Power
      43. The Technical Working Party considers th a t the current G reen G uide contains insufficient
    inform ation on auxiliary power. It recom m ends a separate chapter on the topic with a requirem ent that
    emergency power should be sufficient to m aintain an adequate level o f lighting, and public address system
    and to operate any electronic gates, alarms etc for a period o f three hours from the tim e o f failure o f the
    normal supply.

    Communications
      44. The Technical Working Party considers that too little weight has in the past been attached to the need
    for a comprehensive com m unications system, capable o f reaching both inside and outside the ground.

       45. C hap ter 12 o f the Green G uide therefore requires substantial am en d m e n t to reflect the im portance o f
    effective com m unications systems, the need to m ake use o f high-technology equipm ent, and the value of
    closer co-operation between club and police personnel. The Technical Working Party considers that Interim
    R ecom m endations 31 -34 should be retained perm anently and incorporated into the G reen Guide.

    Disabled Spectators
      46. The current Green G uide fails to address the specific problems encountered by disabled spectators
    and the Technical W orking Party recom m ends the introduction o f a C hapter to cover these aspects. It should
    deal in particular with Ingress and Egress and with the provision o f self-contained viewing areas.




                                   SU M M A R Y O F M A IN R E C O M M E N D A T IO N S

    The Green Guide
       1. A higher degree o f standardisation in stadia design and construction is required. An updated and
    revised G reen G uide should form the basis on which a designated ground or stand is certified. It should
    incorporate appropriate diagram s and refer to relevant Building Regulations.

    Advisory Body
      2. There should be a single, central body (called perhaps the Advisory Council for Sports G rounds) to
    provide an authoritative source o f knowledge for all those involved in the design and construction o f stadia.


                                                             94
#
    Seating/Standing
      3. W hilst standing accom m odation is not intrinsically unsafe, all-seater stadia bring benefits to spectator
    comfort, safety and crowd control. The im plem entation o f higher proportions o f seated accom m odation
    should be governed by com m on high standards o f design and construction.

    Capacities
      4. Capacity depends on standards o f ingress, egress and safety generally as well as the acceptable packing
    density and the effective area o f the accom m odation. The current m axim um packing density o f 5.4/m 2
    recom m ended in the Green G uid e for standing terraces should be safe in static conditions where the terraces
    are in full compliance with the Green G uide. It should be recognised, however, that densities normally vary
    over an enclosure, and an allowable average figure should reflect this consideration. The reduced figure of
    2.7/m 2 should be abolished and there should be no specified lower limit. I f an enclosure has such poor safety
    standards th at it is totally unfit as a viewing area, the figure should be zero.

    Separation of Viewing Areas and Pitch
      5. C onsideration should be given to different perim eter arrangem ents appropriate for different areas o f a
    ground.

       6. The m eans o f separation adopted should provide sufficient protection against pitch incursions without
    com prom ising spectator safety. The m axim um height o f fences should be determ ined in relation to the UEFA
    standard o f 2.2 metres. O verhanging sections and spiked o r barbed-wire attachm ents should be removed.

      7. A ttention should be given to the elim ination o f spectator viewing from front steps o f terraces which are
    substantially lower than the level o f the pitch.

    Emergency Access to the Pitch
      8. Emergency access to the pitch should be provided from all adjacent viewing areas.

       9. Exit gaps or gates should be at least 1.1 metres wide or as wide as the gangways feeding into them,
    whichever is the larger. All gangways must be clearly identified and must be kept clear o f spectators in normal
    circumstances.

    Crush Barriers
      10. A review o f the procedures for inspection and testing o f barriers is recom m ended. G reater emphasis
    should be given to thorough recorded and certified annual visual inspections o f all crush barriers, and to the
    establishment o f an unam biguous testing procedure.

    Stands
       11. The Green G uide should contain a separate C h a p te r on tem porary structures, with ap propriate
    references to applicable regulations and British Standards.

    Ingress
       12. The current m axim um notional flow rate per turnstile o f 750 persons p er hou r is too high. A figure of
    500 should be adopted as the m edian with a m axim um upper limit o f 660 persons per hour. Variations from
    the m edian must be approved by the certifying authority.

    Egress
      13. W here reservoir areas cannot be removed, a lower density o f 35-40 persons per 10 sq metres should be
    adopted. Each ground should produce networked plans delineating all aspects o f ingress and egress.

    Enclosures/Turnstiles
      14. There should be a direct one-to-one relationship between banks o f turnstiles and corresponding
    enclosures. W here sub-divisions exist, it is im perative that the totals entering each sub-division are counted
    separately.

    Stairw ays and Ramps
       15. The recom m ended width o f channels should not exceed three persons (unit widths) in line abreast.
    H andrails should extend by at least 300m m beyond the top and bottom o f any stairway o r ramp. T he design
    and strength o f handrails, barriers and protection on or near stairways or ram ps should be clearly defined.
    R am ps should not produce dangerous crowd pressures.

    Inspection and Tests
       16. A ction should be taken to ensure th at com m on high standards o f inspection and test are realised. A
    national Inspectorate should be established to oversee the adoption o f such standards. Its term s o f reference
    should include com pilation and m aintenance o f a national register o f organisations employed to carry out
    inspections and tests; central recording o f the extent and type o f inspections and tests at individual grounds;
    and the provision o f advice.

    Communications
      17. The Green G uide should be am end ed substantially to emphasise the im portance o f effective
    com m unications systems capable o f reaching both inside an d outside the ground.

    Disabled Spectators
       18. The G reen G uide should contain a separate C hapter to cover this subject.

      2.1 W hen my Interim Report was published, it might have been thought by some that the suggestions
    which I set out had only recently been considered. It was said to be unfair to expect the football clubs to have
    taken earlier steps to arrange their affairs. It was urged th at they should now be entitled to m ore tim e and
    m ore money in o rd er to deal with the problems o f crowd control and safety at their grounds. The problem of
    crowd control and safety had, so it was said, suddenly arisen. I have to say th at almost all the m atters into
    which I have been asked to inquire and almost all the solutions I have proposed have been previously
    considered in detail by m any distinguished Inquiries over a period o f sixty years.

    The S hortt Report
      2.2 O n 11 June 1923, the then Secretary o f State for the H om e D epartm ent asked the R t H on Edward
    Shortt KC to form a C om m ittee to inquire, amongst other things, into arrangem ents m ade to deal with the
    abnorm ally large attendances on special occasions, especially attendances at athletic grounds. This arose
    from disorder which occurred at Wembley Stadium on the occasion o f the first Cup Final on 28 April 1923.
    The C om m ittee reported on 13 M arch 1924. The Report was presented to Parliam ent and published as
    C o m m and Paper 2088 at the princely sum o f 6d.

      2.3 About responsibility for control inside grounds the Report had this to say:

      “As regards the general question of the apportionment of responsibility inside the ground as between the
      police and the ground authority, the principle to be followed should, in our judgment, be th at the police should
      be responsible for all matters appertaining to the preservation of law and order and that for arrangements for
      the convenience of the public the ground authority should be responsible. It is, however, most important not
      only that the police arrangements should be under the control of a single officer, but also that the duties for
      which the ground authority is responsible should be assigned to a definite individual, who should be
      competent to give instructions and to deal with any incident which arises. If responsibility is definitely
      allocated in this matter it appears to us that, in ordinary circumstances, there need be no difficulty in this
      division of duties and that no disadvantage need result from the existence of dual control so long as the closest
      co-operation is maintained between the two authorities at all times. We are of the opinion, however, that if any
      emergency arises or there appears to be the slightest probability of a disturbance, it is essential that control
      should pass into the hands of one individual, and we recommend that, in the case of grounds providing
      accommodation for more than 10,000 persons, on all occasions when specially large attendances are
      anticipated or for other reasons unusual excitement is to be expected, arrangements should be concerted
      beforehand by which one individual can at any moment take control of the situation.”

      2.4. T h a t paragraph o f the report continued:

      “The question in such circumstances would have become one of the preservation of law and order and we
      therefore have no doubt that the control should then pass into the hands of the senior police officer present,
      and we consider that such officer would be justified in any circumstances, whether in accordance with a
      pre-arranged scheme or not, in assuming control if he considered it necessary for the purpose of the
      restoration of order. As part of the arrangements for this purpose we think that, in the very large grounds,
      there should be a central control box in telephonic communication with all parts of the ground and that the
      principal police and ground officials should be stationed there so th at they may be in constant touch with the
      situation.” ...(Paragraph22).

      2.5 About stewards the Report said:

      “We understand that there is no uniform practice with regard to the employment of stewards at sports
      grounds, that in some cases they are only used to show spectators into the seating accommodation, and
      that, in cases where stewards are employed for packing of the standing room, they are only employed when
      there are specially large crowds. We consider it desirable in the interests of safety that, for the purpose of
      handling a crowd, stewards should be employed in any case where the crowd is likely to approach the capacity
      of the ground. For seating accommodation stewards should always be employed. It is in the highest degree
      important that any such stewards should be properly trained in their work and intimately acquainted with the



                                                                97
  part of the ground placed under their charge. We doubt whether it is practicable to secure suitable men for
  this purpose unless they are given continual experience in the work, and we therefore recommend that every
  ground with a capacity exceeding 10,000 which provides terraced accommodation for its spectators should
  maintain, or have a call upon, an adequate staff of efficient stewards, and should ensure that they keep
  proficient by requiring them to perform duty at frequent intervals. Stewards should be organised as a
  disciplined body and should act under the control and supervision of their own officers. They should wear a
  distinctive badge of authority, which they should not be able easily to discard.” (Paragraph 27).

  2.6 The Report had this to say about precautions against fire:

  “We have been somewhat surprised to find that in many cases little or not precaution is taken against the risk
  of fire in stands. We do not suppose that either the risk or the consequences of fire would be so serious in an
  open stand as in a closed building, but we consider it most important that adequate arrangements should be
  made to deal with any outbreak which might occur.” (Paragraph 40).

but concluded generally:

  “ We are assured that these governing bodies are only too anxious to secure that their sport is carried on under
  conditions which will promote the public safety, and we feel that at this stage it is safe to leave the matter to
  them .” (Paragraph 47).

The Moelwyn Hughes Report
   2.7 The next report (published as C m nd 6846) arose out o f the disaster at Bolton W anderers’ Football
G round on 9 M arch 1946. M r R Moelwyn Hughes KC was appointed by the then H om e Secretary to conduct
an enquiry into the circumstances o f the disaster which arose by the presence o f some 85,000 spectators.
50.000 had been expected. Because o f the press o f people in an enclosure two barriers collapsed and 33
people were killed.

  2.8 It is interesting to observe th a t the previous best attendance at Bolton in the 1945-46 season had been
43.000 and it was amply policed by a force o f 60. O n this occasion there were 103 police to control 85,000
spectators, which is about 1/10th o f the present ratio o f police to spectators at football grounds both inside
and outside the ground.

  2.9 M r Hughes m ade a n u m ber o f recom m endations. He said:

  “Burnden P ark is typical of most home grounds of the leading football teams in the country. They have grown
  stage by stage from humble beginnings on sites acquired when the large gates of these days were not
  anticipated, or when the clubs had not achieved eminence. It would be idle to suggest that the grounds, or
  large sections of them, should be rebuilt, but if they are to be made reasonably safe and if the risk of repeating
  the tragedy of Burnden P ark is to be avoided, then, I have formed the clear view that the following steps must
  be t a k e n . . . ” (Page 10).

   2.10 The recom m endations included inspections o f the enclosures, scientific calculation o f the m axim um
n u m ber to be allowed entry, counting those entering the ground by m echanical means and central
co-ordination o f the system, all to ensure the adm ission o f a safe nu m b er o f spectators.

  2.11 So far as future regulation was concerned the Report said:

  “The preceding safety measures cannot be secured without legislation. A D epartm ental Committee reporting
  on Crowds to a previous H ome Secretary in 1924 (Cd 2088) anaemically recommended that adequate
  provision for safety be left to the pressure of the governing bodies in sport. T he most important of these was,
  of course, the Football Association, which had not deigned to appear before the C om m ittee. . .

  T he legislation should empower the Home Secretary to issue general regulations for different kinds of
  grounds and the broad conditions necessary for safety.

  No ground of any considerable size should be opened to the public until it has been licenced by, I suggest as an
  appropriate licensing authority, the local authority. The issue of the licence would depend upon satisfying the
  authority as to the construction and equipment of the ground, its compliance with regulations and the
  proposed maximum figures of admission to the different parts.”
#
      2.12 M r Hughes went on to say:

      “Compliance with tl\e recommendations of this Report will cost money. They will involve grounds in a loss of
      gate money on popular d a y s . . . The insurance for greater safety for the public demands a premium.”

    M r Hughes ended his report by saying:
      “I earnestly hope that, if the proposals I have made in this Report, or similar suggestions, commend
      themselves to you, Parliament will not be slow in granting you the necessary powers.” (Pages 11-12).

    The Chester Report
       2.13 M r Hughes’ words fell on d e a f ears. It was another 22 years before there was a further report
    com m issioned by the G overnm ent on the problem s o f football. In June 1966, the then Secretary o f State for
    E ducation and Science appointed M r N o rm an Chester CBE, as he then was (Warden o f Nuffield College,
    Oxford), to chair an Enquiry. His term s o f reference were:

      “To enquire into the state of Association Football at all levels, including the organisation, management,
      finance and administration, and the means by which the game may be developed for the public good; and to
      make recommendations.”

      2.14 M r Chester m ade this observation about crowd behaviour:

      “ In recent years there has been an increase in disorderly behaviour by spectators. During the period
      1946-1960 there were 195 cases brought to the attention of the FA, an average of 13 per season. In the
      following six seasons 148 cases were reported, an average of 25 per season. The matter was discussed some
      time ago at a meeting between representatives of a number of police forces (including the British Transport
      Police), the Football Association and the Football League. Both these governing bodies have been very
      concerned at this development.”

      2.15 The Report continued:

      “We have not been able to devote the time and resources to the study of this problem which its complexity
      deserves. We very much welcome the initiative of the Birmingham Research Group, of which D r J A
      Harrington is Research Director and have been fortunate enough to see the Group’s preliminary report. We
      are sure that its findings will be of value to all concerned.” (Page 97).

    The Harrington Report
      2.16 This was m ade to the then M inister o f S p o rt.1It observed:

      “Some spectators carry knives, hammers, sticks and spikes, choppers, and other offensive weapons like
      powdered pepper which are not necessarily used for violent purposes but may be used in threatening displays.
      T here is also the problem of singing or chanting bawdy or obscene songs and phrases some of which are also
      threatening and provocative.” (Page 8).

      2.17 About riots the Report said:

      “W hile such riots must be regarded as almost unknown accompaniments of football in this country, their
      potential seriousness and danger were exemplified recently by football riots in Turkey, where many people
      were reported killed. W hile comparable riots seem unlikely here, it would be foolish to rule out the possibility
      of much more serious crow d disturbances at football matches than we have yet experienced.” (Page 9).

      2.18 The Report regretted inactivity thus far:

      “The question of public safety and crowd control at football matches was dealt with by a departmental
      committee report published in 1924 (Cond. 2088) and the inquiry into the disaster at the Bolton Wanderers
      Football Ground in 1946 (Cond. 6 9 4 6 ) . . . Unfortunately the most helpful suggestions in these reports have
      often been ignored, though the committee’s recommendations do carry some weight with boards of football
      clubs” .

      2.19 T he Report went on:
      “The absence of national legislation outlining minimum standards of safety and amenity at football grounds
      means that some club managements do not feel obliged to put their grounds into a state considered by the
      police to be necessary for crowd control.” (Page 33).

                                                                     99
#
     2.20 And continued:

     “We feel that improved ground facilities would not only help to deal with the hooligan problem but do
     something towards its prevention. Clubs often seem keener to spend money on the purchase of players than to
     undertake any major spending on ground improvement which would increase safety’ and make hooligan
     control easier. The loss of revenue which a club may suffer from alterations may be the determining factor.
     There is of course no obligation on a club to convert a ground which can accommodate 50,000 to one which
     takes a smaller number in conditions of greater safety and comfort. Letters from members of the public
     suggest that already some are staying away because of their dislike of poor facilities, overcrowding, and
     disturbances, so that the neglect of ground improvement may ultimately be self defeating.” (Page 34).

      2.21 So far as responsibility is concerned, the Report said:

     “We think that those responsible for club management and the governing bodies of football should accept far
     more responsibility for keeping their crowds in order. T his applies not only within the stadium itself but to
     club supporters travelling in groups to and from matches. O ne gets the impression that some clubs disclaim
     any responsibility for the behaviour of their supporters and if the atmosphere of a Roman holiday is not
     deliberately fostered it is looked on with considerable tolerance. Football matches are commercial enterprises
     conducted for profit on private premises and clubs have therefore a heavy responsibility for keeping order and
     safety for the public on their premises.” (Pages 35-36).

      2.22 In its sum m ary the Report concluded:

      “The solution of the problem of hooliganism in the football stadium is ultimately the responsibility of
      individual clubs who must each deal with it in the light of local circumstances. W hile a few clubs are
      exemplary in their attitude to the problem others are laissez-faire and need persuasion to take a more active
      role in trying to control hooliganism in their own grounds. This laissez-faire attitude does not help the police
      in their attempts to deal with the matter.” (Page 56).

    The Lang Report
      2.23 Shortly thereafter, a Working Party und er the chairm anship o f Sir John Lang GCB and including a
    num ber o f distinguished members, was appointed by the then M inister with special responsibility for Sport
    to examine the problem s involved in football crowd behaviour to which attention had been called a few
    m onths previously by the H arrington Report. Sir John’s Report was presented on 21 N ovem ber 1969.

      2.24 By way o f introduction it said:

      “The Working Party was dealing with a subject which has been discussed almost ad nauseam during recent
      years. Not unexpectedly the W'orking Party has not found a single simple solution for a problem which is
      often due to a combination of fac to rs. . . ” (Page 3).

        2.25 The m em bers o f the Inquiry witnessed the dem onstration o f C C T V equipm ent and reported:

           . . the view was formed th a t closed circuit television could be of value in the general subject of crowd
        control and . . . would be an important factor in preventing misbehaviour by spectators at grounds. It was a
        refinement which most of the top class clubs could be expected eventually to have as a matter of course.”
        (Page 9).

      2.26 About alcohol the Report said:

      “There can be no doubt that consumption of alcohol is an important factor in crowd misbehaviour, both
      because it stimulates quarrelsomeness and because empty bottles are dangerous missiles. There would be no
      advantage in refusing licence facilities to football club grounds - this would merely stimulate spectators to
      bring their supplies from outside.” (Page 14).

    The W heatley Report
      2.27 On 4 February 1971 the R t H on Lord Wheatley was asked by the then Secretary o f State for the
    H om e D epartm ent and the then Secretary o f State for Scotland to make an independent appraisal o f the
    effectiveness o f existing arrangem ents for crowd safety at sports grounds in G reat Britain, and o f the
    im provements which could be brought about within the present fram ework o f the law, and to consider the
    nature o f any alterations in the law which appeared to be needed. This arose from the disaster at Ibrox Park
    where 66 spectators died.


                                                           100
  2.28 O n 16 M arch 1972 Lord Wheatley com pleted his Report and it was presented to Parliam ent and
published by H M SO as Cm nd. 4952.

  2.29 The Report contained a technical A ppendix. Following the Report, the Safety o f Sports G rounds Act
1975 was passed. A licensing system involving the issue o f a safety certificate for designated grounds was
introduced and supporting guidance (the G reen G uide) was published. In his R eport Lord Wheatley said:

  “ I recognise that a decision to introduce a licensing system for grounds along the lines I have recommended
  may cause anxiety to some football clubs and football administrators. As I see it, their misgivings are
  associated with a fear that such stringent conditions might be attached to the granting of a licence that
  many clubs may not be able to afford the cost and some may have to go out of business.” (Paragraph 66).

  2.30 “ M y answer to that is this. M y task was to consider the problem of crowd safety' at the grounds. Clubs
  which charge the public for admission have a duty to see that their grounds are reasonably safe for spectators.
  T hat is a primary consideration. It is accordingly necessary that some standards should be imposed and
  observed. This has been recognised by the football authorities themselves . . . I have canvassed all the
  alternatives that have been proposed or which I personally thought were reasonable to consider, and the one
  which I decided was best to meet the situation in the interest of the public is the licensing system by a local
  authority'. T here is nothing new in this proposal. It has been mooted for almost fifty years. It can come as no
  surprise to the football world, and in the light of happenings over the years the demand for an independent
  appraisal and determination of the safety of grounds becomes almost irresistible. I certainly cannot resist it.”
  (Paragraph 67).

  2.31 Lord W heatley ended his Report by saying:

  “ I trust that this Report may be of assistance to you in deciding what should be done to solve this
  important question of crowd safety in football grounds. One thing is certain. The public demand for
  something to be done has been growing over the years. I am sure I am reflecting public opinion when I say
  that something must be done now. The evidence certainly supports that view.”

The M cElhone Report
 2.32 In O ctober 1976 the then Secretary o f State for Scotland asked M r Frank M cElhone M P to chair a
Working G roup on Football Crowd Behaviour.

  “to consider the problems caused by some Scottish football supporters and to make recommendations to
  the Scottish Football Association and other organisations concerned.”

  A m ong the m em bership o f the Working G roup were representatives from the football authorities, from the
football clubs and the Strathclyde Police.

  2.33 In the introduction to the R eport2, M r M cElhone said:

  “T here is no simple solution to the problem; it is but one of the manifestations of anti-social behaviour
  besetting society in general today. We have however in our findings arrived at a number of conclusions and
  recommendations which we hope, given a commitment to implement them on the part of all those most
  closely concerned, will go some way towards reducing the problem of hooliganism at football matches and
  by so doing turn football grounds once again into places of entertainment where parents can take their
  children to enjoy, in relative comfort and safety', the pleasures of our national game.”

  2.34 The Report observed that:

  “A hooligan is a hooligan no matter where he operates and the fact that his behaviour is conspicuous at a
  football match has very often nothing to do with the game itself.” (Paragraph 4).

   M r M cElhone saw the problem as one o f trying to reduce, o r at least contain, the incidence o f hooliganism
at football m atches without restricting the pleasure o f the m ajority o f supporters.


: Report o f the W orking G ro u p on Football Crowd Behaviour: Scottish Education D e p a rtm en t/H M S O 1977.
   2.35 So far as drink was concerned, the Report recom m ended that it should be an offence for a spectator
to carry o r attem pt to carry alcohol into a football ground; th a t is should be an offence to be in possession of
alcohol within the ground o r to attem pt to gain adm ission while drunk. The Report recom m ended that more
people who were physically capable o f carrying out the duties o f enforcement would have to be recruited and
suggested that, in their recruitm ent o f stewards, clubs should look to their supporters’ clubs to assist in
providing the kind o f men required for the job. So far as tran sp o rt was concerned, the Report recom m ended
that it should be an offence for anyone to be in possession o f alcoholic liquor on a vehicle hired specifically
for the purpose o f carrying passengers bound for a football match; o r to allow any alcoholic liquor to be
carried on a public service vehicle being used for the purpose o f carrying passengers to football matches; o r to
allow the carriage o f any drunken person on such a vehicle b o u n d for a football match.

  2.36 So far as the separation o f supporters was concerned the Report recommended:

  “T hat in the interests of crowd control and safety, separation of rival supporters at turnstiles should be
  carried out if the police, in consultation with the club, consider such a step to be necessary; that for matches
  where larger than average attendances are expected, sufficient turnstiles should be opened timeously in order
  to achieve speedy admission.” (R ecom m endation 13).

  “ In order to protect players, match officials and the pitch, access to the playing area should be made as
  difficult as possible. To prevent an invasion of the playing area by spectators ... the erection of a physical
  barrier in the form of a fence not less than 1.8 metres in height with access points to allow the pitch to be used
  if necessary for the evacuation of spectators in an emergency.” (Paragraph 53).

  2.37 A further recom m endation was that:

  “the Courts should make full use of the higher fining powers under the Criminal Law Act 1977 in respect of
  common law offences which include malicious mischief, breach of the peace and assault, these being the most
  common offences associated with football hooliganism, and in respect of persistent offenders, should
  normally impose imprisonment without option.” (R ecom m endation 19).

  2.38 The Report recom m ended that:

  “The police should have statutory powers to search for any containers ... in the possession of any person
  entering or attempting to enter football grounds.” (R ecom m endation 24).

but went on to point out that the clubs m ust b ear their share o f the responsibility for the behaviour and
conduct o f their staff at all levels:

  2.39 A m ong other observations the Report says this:

  “ We recognise that many football grounds in Scotland are very old; some could even be described as primitive
  in that not only do they lack any kind of comfort for spectators but they also lack basic amenities including
  adequate toilet accommodation. T his primitive environment encourages some people to react in a primitive
  manner. Moreover there is a strong case for more seating accommodation. In our view it would go a
  considerable way towards reducing hooliganism; potential trouble spots could be more quickly recognised and
  identification of troublemakers by police would be made th at much easier.”

The Report therefore recommended:

  “that clubs should consider the provision of additional seating accommodation. In addition clubs must
  provide adequate toilet facilities for men and women and generally improve amenities for spectators.”
  (Paragraph 88).

  2.40 This Report also recom m ended that:

  “players should be encouraged by the clubs to extend their voluntary public relations work in the community
  including personal appearances at youth clubs etc and coaching sessions in schools with the objects of
  promoting the game and the concept of good sportsm anship.” (R ecom m endation 37).

CCTV was recom m ended and supporters’ clubs encouraged. T he Scottish Football Association was
recom m ended to take appropriately firm action against clubs.

Departm ent of the Environment Working Group
  2.41 The most recent G overnm ent publication on the subject o f football is the Report o f an Official
Working G roup on Football Spectator Violence set up by D epartm ent o f the E nvironm ent, which was
published by H M SO in 1984. The Working G roup was set up following incidents o f violence involving
British supporters at England’s soccer m atches in Luxembourg and France in Novem ber 1983 and February
1984 respectively. It dealt party with problem s arising out o f international football. •

  2.42 However, as regards dom estic football the Report said:

  “the Group reaffirmed the importance of consistent planning, preparation and co-ordination; of building on
  experience; and of the need to consider afresh all possible measures, including those previously thought to be
  impractical or unnecessary.” (Paragraph 5.1).

  “We recommend therefore th a t the FA reviews and better defines its powers and procedures and the
  responsibilities of the clubs. If their powers prove to be inadequate, the Association should consider
  enhancing them .”

The Report went on:

  “This would better equip the FA to implement some of the recommendations.” (Paragraph 5.5).

  2.43 T he Football Association had issued a “b lueprint” detailing the precautions which league clubs
should take against violence, which was circulated to clubs at the beginning o f the 1983-84 season. The
Working Party Report said that it:

  “ ... has not been rigorously adopted by all clubs. Since it represents the collective wisdom of football clubs,
  many of whom have successfully countered serious threats of violence, its implementation should have
  prevented some of the violence in grounds last season.” (Paragraph 5 .7).

  2.44 The Report observed that the enforcem ent by the Football Association o f its “blueprint” occurs after
the event when the deficiencies in a club’s planning has become apparent. The Report recom m ended that:

  “improved means should be found for ensuring that clubs adopt the provisions of the “blueprint” in a way
  appropriate to their own grounds and matches.” (Paragraph 5.7).

The Report went on to recom m end that each club should produce a detailed set o f plans to be subm itted to
the football authorities for endorsem ent. This would prevent some clubs from avoiding their responsibilities
and might ensure also a m ore co-operative and com m itted response.

   2.45 The Report recom m ended that m atches between high risk clubs should be program m ed so that the
risk or threat o f violence could be reduced. T he Report said:

  “ It is more likely to take place at the beginning and end of the season and at holiday periods, particularly at
  seaside fixtures when other groups of young people sometimes also clash with football supporters.”
  (Paragraph 5.13).

  2.46 The Report went on to recom m end the introduction o f club m em bership, the introduction o f CCTV
and closer links with the community. It did not recom m end that alcohol should be bann ed in grounds and
concluded that in the absence o f clear evidence that the introduction o f legislation along the lines o f the
Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 would reduce violence at English soccer matches, it could not
recom m end such action. Furtherm ore, said the Report:

  “legislation of this kind would be unwelcome to many; the majority of football clubs are untroubled by
  violence and would unnecessarily be penalised financially and the vast majority of non-violent spectators
  would sufferfor the actions of the few.” (Paragraph 5 .34):

T he W orking G roup did not recom m end additional measures for banning alcohol on trains o r on football
coaches.
Conclusion
  2.47     A study o f all these reports (and there are num erous reports and discussion papers by other bodies)
shows that the following are measures which have been frequently recommended:

  1.   Closed Circuit Television
  2.   M em bership Cards
  3.   Segregation
  4.   M ore seating at football grounds
  5.   Encouragement o f supporters’ clubs
  6.   A ban on alcohol
  7.   Involvement o f the clubs with the com m unity
  8.   Heavier penalties

I too shall argue for these and related measures. It is to be hoped they will be more vigorously pursued by the
appropriate bodies than in the past.

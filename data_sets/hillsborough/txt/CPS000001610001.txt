Dear Sirs

ADLINGTON -V- DUCKENFIELD AND MURRAY

We acknowledge your letter of 6 January by fax. We note that you have effectively
copied the letters written on a Round Robin basis. On that basis would you please let
us have a copy of the letter of 5 January referred to in the penultimate paragraph of your
letter to Ann Adlington of 6 January.

We also refer to our telephone conversation with Mr Croston in the late afternoon of 7
January. You told us that the first sentence of your letter of 6 January meant that you
were considering whether the Crown Prosecution would actually give reasons not to
intervene in this private Prosecution. There is no dispute that Mr Croston told the writer
on the telephone on 21 December that a draft reply already existed and that it would be
with us no later than close of business on 24 December. That was recorded in our letter
of 23 December, There has never been until this moment, a suggestion that a reply with
reasons was not going to be provided.

We are therefore bewildered by this first intimation that you are now considering
whether you will give reasons themselves. We gave certain indications to the Court and
to HFSG as to the time within which we expected to be able to lodge an application for
Judicial Review which was against the assurance that we would have been provided with
the reasons by 24 December. The matters set out above both impact on our ability to
proceed with the application for Judicial Review and the proposed timetable of the
Magistrates’ Court. We reserve the right to draw the sequence of this correspondence
for the attention of the High Court and if necessary to the Stipendiary Magistrate.

                  On Saturday 15 April       1989 (1504S9), I wen^'to the F o o tb al 1 Match at

                  Hillsborough.        I am a Liverpool suppos/ter.      I did not go with an

                  a £6 standing ticket for Leppings Ln

                  I travelled from home with Inger SHAH/*and her son,'                     We went to

                  Kings Cross Station and met Mar ion Mfr^ABE and Philip C^ffiDMAN.

                  We all travelled to Sheffield on the train together.

                  We arrived in Sheffield at 11.30 h o u r s , we waited for about 30 minutes

                  for some f t r iends who were coming from Lincoln,        one of them, Steve

notice any Police about,         although there might have been,                 I was not

really looking.

When we got to the ground we waited around.                    Some of them went            in

quite soon but I was waiting for Steve to come with my ticket.                                I was

at the ground at about         12 y20 hours    <1220) and waited for about an hour

for Steve to arrive,          ffinen he came I then waited for a bit for another

friend, _______________________________________               to arrive.        All the others

 had gone in.        I then decided to go into the ground and wait for him

in the r e .     I went to the turnstiles to go in,               it was about      13.20

hours , the re we re no queues .       I just Wentzs'! raight             in.   The r e were

Police Of f i cers outside the turnstiles^and inside.                      I was sear ched by

the ones       inside.   There were a few stewards about.                  I waited about for

10 minutes for                   He came with two other peopl e, one who I know

           and another      person/i did not k n o w .          I had already gone down

the tunnel and into Pen vf before they arrived.

We all stood together and we stood right by the back wall about a yard

or two from the t u n n e 1 ent ran ee .      We were all         in the re together at

<about 1.30pm (1330).         I had spoken to Inqer StfAH and Marion H e C A B E ,

shortly before this t h p ^ w e r e    stood a gainst the side fence between

Pens 3 and 2 in P e j / 3 ,    about a yard or two back from the f ront f e n c e .

It would be about        13.20 hours approx. when I last spoke to them and

moved back to where I wanted to s t a n d .           I ,didi not see them again after

that.

The pen gradually filled up, where I was standing                         it became full but

no worse than crowds I have been in before.

When the players came on the pitch at about                   14.55 h ours I could see

the Pen was too full but I did not know at that time that there was

any problems.
                                                                   /
After the game had started there was a corner^/tiown at our end and I

saw the Liverpool goalkeeper          looking at the /6row^l.              I knew that the

Pen was overcrowded.       I thought that whatever the problem was           it could

be rectified.

The game was stopped.       I presumed that it had been stopped for the

crowd to be moved and that the game would continue after a while.

I could hear people above me in the stands shouting.                 A little while

later I saw an ambulance       come on to the pitch.           i then realised

something serious had happened.

There had been Police Officers standing on\th»^front fence for people

%o move    back.   As I was at the back I could not go any further back,

I was helping young lads to climb up to the stands above me.                 They

were trying to get away from where they were being crushed.                 I did

this until about 15.20 hrs.         At the same time I cseisld see people

climbing over the front fence onto the pitch,

At about    15.10 hrs - 15.15 hrs./I saw people being carried across the

pitch on advertising h o a r d i n g .     It was then I realised that people

had been injured.

At about    15.25 hrs the pen was quite empty.            I could see            who was

one of the lads that had come to the match with Steve OATES.                 I walked

down the terracing /and onto the pitch,             through the gate,            was

upset but he was yfot injured.           I then went to look for all the others.

 I found Steve                           was the other lad that came with Steve.

 Steve had hurt^ hi^N'fcrSfck but           tra.s alright.     I carried on looking

for the others.      I found               again,    he had left the terrace before

I did.     I also found

I. eventually left the ground with                       ,eve and

           and I caught the bus to the Stati/on.             Steve and      went to

the hospital because we thought that I^fger had been injured.

I came back with               on th&, travfi to London.         It was not until the

next day that I found out that IrS^er had died at the match.                I found

out that Marion had died later that day.

         I think that the Police should have opened the gaite                the pitch

         much e a r l ie r.   There should have been more Stewards directing fans

         around to the outside pens.        The tunnel should have been closed when

         the pen was full. The public address system was awful,           I could not

         understand what was being said.

         I think that the Liverpool       supportery^shouId have been given the Kop

         end.    T here should be gaps    in th>//fences separating the p e n s ,

         especially at the bottom of W i e m .

         It seemed to take a long frame before any medical staff were on hand.,

                                     NOTES ON CLAUSES



PART I          FOOTBALL MATCHES IN ENGLAND AND WALES




Introduction to Part I


Part I     of the Bill provides a statutory framework for a national
membership scheme for spectators at designated                                  football matches
in England and Wales and for the licensing of grounds                                     on which
such    matches      may    be    played.     It       provides         for    the   Secretary       of
State     to    appoint     a     body   to    draw      up    the       national      membership
scheme,       for the scheme to be approved by the Secretary of State
and for Parliament to confirm his approval.                               Commencement orders
are required to bring Part I of the Bill into effect;                                   the first
of     these    to   be     subject      to    a       negative         resolution        statutory
instrument - before the FMA is appointed to prepare a scheme.


The effect of this Part would be that                          spectators would only be
admitted        to   those        football      matches            in     England      and        Wales
designated by the Secretary of State,                        if they are members of the
national       membership         scheme,     exempted        by    the       Bill   itself,         or
specifically         allowed       for   by    the       scheme;         and    that   designated
matches        should      only     be   played         on    grounds          licensed      by     the
Secretary of State.              It would be an offence                  for a member of the
public to attend or to attempt to attend a designated match other
than as provided for by the scheme; and for a designated match to
be     held    on    an    unlicensed         ground.        There        are    provisions         for
disqualification from membership of the scheme of those convicted
of relevant offences (as defined in the schedule to the Bill).




                                                   1
CLAUSE 1 : PRELIMINARY


This    Clause        determines             the    scope      of    Part     I   of    the   Bill       and
defines    certain          terms        used      in    it.   The    Clause      provides        for    the
Secretary of State to designate, by Order, those football matches
to     which        the    national           membership            scheme    and      the    licensing
provisions will apply.


Subsection (1) limits the application of this Part of the Bill to
association          football           (soccer)         matches     in England         and Wales,       as
designated under the following subsections.


Subsections (2) and (3), together with subsection (9) provide for
the    Secretary           of    State       to    designate         football     matches         for    the
purposes of the Bill, either by reference to a description of the
match or of the place where it is to be played. Designation would
be by Order,          subject to the negative resolution procedure.                                    It is
the Government's intention to propose that all matches involving
Football       League           clubs    and       the    English     national         team   should      be
designated. The Secretary of State for Wales is consulting on the
designation of matches in Wales.


It     should       be     noted        that       the    effect      of     designation          is    that
spectators           may    only        be     admitted        to     the     match      concerned        in
accordance with the national membership scheme.                                      The scheme may,
however,        allow       for     the      admission         of    non-members         to   specified
matches        in    specified           circumstances          (see        Clause     5).    A    further
condition of admitting spectators to a designated match is that
the premises on which the match is to be played must be licensed
(under Clauses 8 to 11 of the Bill).


Subsection          (4) defines the national                    football membership                scheme,
by reference to Clause 4 of the Bill.




                                                          2
Subsection (5) defines an "authorised spectator" as one who is a
member of the scheme or is authorised by the scheme to attend. It
exempts from the scheme those who attend matches principally in
order to provide services or to report on it, eg club employees,
caterers, policemen,              ambulancemen,         journalists, cameramen.


Subsection           (6)    defines        a     licence        to        admit       spectators       to
designated matches (see Clauses 8 to 11).


Subsection          (7)     defines       the    period       relevant           to    a    designated
football          match,    for     the   purposes       of     establishing               whether    the
offence of "unauthorised attendance" created by Clause 2 has been
committed.         The period begins 2 hours before the match starts,                                  or
is due       to    start,    or when          spectators      are     first       admitted      to the
ground      (whichever        is the earliest)            and ends one hour after the
end    of    the     match.       The     definition       of    a        relevant         period    also
extends to include the period when a match was expected to take
place at a certain time but was postponed or cancelled at short
notice,      for example as a result of bad weather after spectators
have begun to enter the ground.


Subsection (8) defines the person responsible for the management
of the ground or the organisation of the match,                                   for the purposes
of the licensing provisions of the Bill.                              The responsible person
will    normally,          though       not     invariably,          be    the    host       club.    The
persons       responsible         for     managing      eg      Wembley        Stadium,        will    be
included.


Subsection          (10)    makes    clear       that   nothing           in   the    Bill    prevents
clubs       (or    others    responsible          for   grounds           on   which       matches    are
played)       from     exercising         their    common       law       right       (as    owners    or
occupiers of the grounds) to exclude people whom they do not wish
to admit.

CLAUSE   2   :   OFFENCES    RELATED     TO     UNAUTHORISED      ATTENDANCE    AT
DESIGNATED MATCHES


This   Clause:   creates    the offence of attending            or attempting    to
attend   a designated      football    match,    except    as   a member   of   the
scheme or in accordance with the scheme;              sets out the penalties
to which an offender may be liable on conviction;                   and provides
for arrest without a warrant.


Subsection (1) makes it an offence for an unauthorised spectator
(as defined in Clause 1(5))       to enter or to attempt to enter,              or
to remain in, a ground during the period relevant to a designated
match.


Subsection   (2) provides for the offence to be a summary one                   (ie
triable in a magistrate's        court),      subject to a maximum penalty of
one    month's   imprisonment     or    a     fine   not   exceeding   level      3
(currently Â£400) or both.        The maximum amount of fines is            fixed by
Orders under section 143         of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980 and
section 37(2) of the Criminal Justice Act 1982.


Subsection (3) provides for a police officer to arrest a suspect
without a warrant obtained in advance.

CLAUSE 3 : THE FOOTBALL MEMBERSHIP AUTHORITY


This   Clause provides               for the Secretary of State to designate                        a
body corporate,            to be known as the Football Membership Authority
(FMA),       to   run         the   national         membership        scheme     and   for      this
designation to be withdrawn at his initiative or theirs.                                    The FMA
is    required          to make      an   annual      report     of    its   functions      to   the
Secretary of State,                 who is in turn required to place a copy of
this before Parliament. The Clause makes clear that the Secretary
of State may designate                    as   the   FMA a body established             for this
purpose      by     the       Football     Association      and       Football     League     - the
Government has said that it hopes that the football                                  authorities
will   form the FMA and they have confirmed that                                they wish to do
so.


Subsection 1 provides that the national membership scheme will be
administered by a body corporate designated by the Secretary of
State and called the Football Membership Authority.


Subsection        2 allows          the Secretary of State to designate as the
FMA    any    body corporate              formed     for   this       purpose,    including      one
formed by the Football Association and Football League.


Subsection          3    allows      the       Secretary    of    State      to    withdraw      his
designation of a body either at his own instance or at that of
the body concerned.


Subsections 4 and 5 require the Secretary of State when making or
withdrawing his designation to specify a date on which the body
designated        shall        either      assume     or   divest      its   functions      as    the
FMA.    This date must be 1 June except at the time of the initial
designation or if the body has failed or is unable to discharge
its duties. The intention is to ensure that there is enough time
for a new body to be appointed and to prepare itself to run the
scheme       from       the    beginning        of   the   football       season    following       1
June; the football season usually begins in August.




                                                      5
Subsections 6 and 7 require the FMA to make annual reports to the
Secretary of State, who in turn is required to lay a copy of the
Report before each House of Parliament.


Subsection 8 stipulates that the national membership scheme shall
cease to have effect on the withdrawal by the Secretary of State
of his designation of a body as the FMA. The property,                         rights arid
liabilities         of the body under the scheme may be transferred by
the   Secretary       of   State   by    order    to    the     successor   FMA   on   such
terms and conditions as he may determine. The new body designated
as    the     FMA    may   therefore      take     over       the   records,      computer
technology,         machinery      and    contractual           arrangements      of   its
predecessor - without having to start from scratch.


Subsection 9 provides that the Secretary of S t a t e 's power to make
an    order     transferring       a     body's        assets     and   liabilities      is
exercisable by statutory instrument.

CLAUSE     4    : NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP                           SCHEME         : APPROVAL,         MODIFICATION
ETC


This    Clause           provides             for    the    Football           Membership          Authority           to
draw up a draft scheme,                            to submit it to the Secretary of State
for approval and to agree it with him. They should also agree the
date on which                  the   scheme         is     to       take effect           and    any    subsequent
modifications.                 At    every         stage,       there must           be    agreement         between
the Secretary of State and the FMA. The scheme as first approved,
any modifications made to it and any replacement scheme are to be
laid before              Parliament.               The Secretary of              State's         approval         of   a
scheme         or        replacement                scheme          is     exercisable            by     statutory
instrument           subject             to    the       negative          resolution           procedure.         The
Clause provides that before exercising any of its functions under
this    Clause           the     FMA      shall      consult             the   Football         Association and
Football League (assuming that they have not formed the FMA).


Subsections               (1)       to    (3)       provide          for       the    Football          Membership
Authority           to         prepare         a    draft           scheme      and       submit       it    to    the
Secretary of State and for him to approve it by order either as
submitted or with any agreed changes. The scheme as submitted and
approved must fulfill the requirements of Clause 5(2) and be laid
by the Secretary of State before each House of Parliament.                                                         The
FMA    shall        consult          the       Football         Association           and       Football      League
before exercising any of its functions under this Clause.


Subsection               (4)    provides            for     the          Secretary        of     State      and    the
Football        Membership                Authority          to      agree      the       date    on     which     the
approved scheme will come into force.


Subsections (5) to (7) allow the administrator and the Secretary
of     State        to    agree          to modify          the      scheme      or   to        replace      it with
another one,              with effect               from an agreed date.                   The modifications
or new scheme must fulfill the requirements of Clause 5(2) and be
laid     before           Parliament.               Where       a        replacement           scheme       has   been
agreed the Secretary of State must confirm his agreement to it by
ord e r.




                                                                7
Subsection (8) provides that all orders made by the Secretary of
State under this Clause are exercisable by statutory instrument
subject to the negative resolution procedure.




                                8
CLAUSE 5 : NATIONAL MEMBERSHIP SCHEME - CONTENTS AND PENALTIES


This Clause provides for the framework of the national membership
scheme.     It   lists        certain       requirements           which     the       scheme         must
fulfill and other matters which it may cover (if the Secretary of
State and the FMA a g r e e ). The scheme must provide for temporary
membership arrangements and for the exemption of disabled people
and   accompanied        children,          subject       to    rules      laid       down       in       the
scheme. The Clause provides for the circumstances in which people
may   be   disqualified          from      the    scheme       and    their      right          to    make
representations          against           such        decisions.          It     ensures             that
information       supplied       by       members       or     potential        members          of       the
scheme     is    subject       to     the     protection           provided           by    the       Data
Protection Act.         It makes it an offence knowingly to make a false
or misleading application for membership.


Subsection (1) is introductory.


Subsection       (2)    spells      out    the    requirements         which       the national
membership scheme must fulfill and which will be for the Football
Membership Authority or the clubs, or both, to carry out. It does
not detail how the requirements are to be met.                                  The    scheme must
provide for:



           (a)   security        measures         which      the     administrator,              ie       the
           Football Membership Authority, and the clubs would take to
           ensure      that    authorised         spectators         only       are    admitted            to
           designated matches;


           (b)   temporary membership of the scheme,                            particularly              for
           guests of football clubs;


           (c)   disabled        people      and       children      under       the       age       of    10
           accompanied         by     an         authorised          spectator             to     attend
           designated matches without being members of the scheme -in
           such circumstances and subject to such conditions                                      as are
           specified in the scheme;



                                                   9
(d) means of preventing people who have been banned from
gaining membership;


(e)     rules        and     criteria       for        disqualification                from
membership      at    the    discretion      of      the        Football      Membership
Authority. Disqualification is limited to a maximum period
of two years and the FMA is obliged to inform any persons
disqualified         from    the   scheme       of    the        grounds       for    their
disqualification.


(f)     financial       penalties       which        the    Football          Membership
Authority       would      apply   in    relation          to    clubs       (and    others
responsible for matches)                if they fail to carry out their
duties under the scheme;


(g) procedures for the Football Membership Authority,                                   the
clubs     and    other       agencies      to     follow             in    dealing     with
applications for membership;


(h)     the     requirements        which       the         Football          Membership
Authority will          impose     to ensure         that       the machinery used
and other measures taken,               limit admission and remaining in
the ground to authorised spectators;


(i)   a central       register of members              to be established and
maintained;


(j ) regulations about the form and content of membership
cards;


(k) a procedure allowing representations                              to be made,       and
considered by independent review,                     from decisions taken by
the     FMA     concerning         the     refusal              or        withdrawal     of
membership.




                                    10
Subsection (3) lists those provisions which the scheme may make,
if   the      Secretary              of    State     and    the     administrator           (Football
Membership Authority) so agree:



           (a)     for         the    Football      Membership          Authority      to    delegate
           responsibilities under the scheme to others (primarily the
           c l u b s );


           (b)     for         a    charge     to   be    made    for     membership        cards      (or
           different charges in different cases);


           (c)     for         arrangements         for    admitting       non-members           of    the
           scheme to matches,                  in accordance with rules               laid down in
           the scheme.



Subsection 4 allows the FMA to make provision in the scheme for
circumstances which might differ from those which usually apply
at League grounds.                   This will ensure inter alia,                 that the scheme
can be adapted to cover matches played at Wembley stadium.


Subsection (5) provides for information supplied under the scheme
to be subject to the protection of the Data Protection Act                                             (by
removing       the        exemption        which    the    Data     Protection        Act    gives      to
information provided by virtue of an Act of Parliament).


Subsection         (6)         disapplies       sections     28(1)        and   (2)   of     the      Data
Protection Act 1984 to the personal information held by the FMA
under the membership scheme.                        This ensures that this              information
is subject to the right of access provided by the 1984 Act.


Subsections          (7) and          (8) make it an offence for an applicant for
membership knowingly to make a false or misleading statement or
make use of a false or misleading document in support of his or
her application. The offence is to be a summary one, subject to a
maximum      fine         at       level   3   (currently        Â£400).    (See   note      on   Clause
2 (2 )).




                                                     11
CLAUSE 6 : PHASED APPLICATION OF SCHEME


This Clause requires the Secretary of State to have regard to the
desirability   of    a phased   introduction        of    the   scheme.   For    this
purpose the FMA is       charged with considering the possibility                of a
phased application       and can make recommendations to the Secretary
of State which he is bound to consider.


Subsection (1) requires the Secretary of State,                 when designating
matches   to   which the   scheme        will       apply,      to consider       the
desirability of applying the scheme in phases.


Subsection     (2)   provides    that        the    FMA    shall   consider       the
possibility of a phased application and allows the Authority to
make   recommendations     on   this    to    the   Secretary      of   State.    The
Secretary of State is bound under this subsection to have regard
to any recommendations so made.




                                         12
CLAUSE 7 : DISQUALIFICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP OF THE SCHEME


This Clause provides for the circumstances in which people are or
may be refused membership of the scheme and in which membership
must or may be withdrawn from them.                          Anyone who is subject to an
exclusion order under the Public Order Act                               1986 is disqualified
from membership of the scheme. So are those convicted of relevant
offences as defined in the Schedule to the Bill.                                  The period for
disqualification          from       membership          following         conviction            for    an
offence is five years where a sentence of immediate imprisonment
is   imposed,      or     two    years      in    other       cases.       In    the       case    of     a
conviction for a relevant offence,                       the officers of the court are
required to notify the Football Membership Authority,                                      the police
and the person concerned.


Subsection        (1)     provides        for     the        disqualification              of     people
subject     to    exclusion       orders         under    the      Public       Order      Act     1986.
Exclusion        orders     were      established             to    enable       the       courts        to
prohibit     convicted          football        hooligans          from    attending            football
matches.     The need       for them        is     superseded         by this         Bill      and     the
relevant     provisions         of    the      Public        Order       Act    are    repealed          by
Clause     24,    when    Clause      2   of      the    Bill      comes       into    force.          This
subsection ensures those people who,                          before then,            are or become
subject to exclusion orders cannot join or remain in the scheme
(and will        thus    be prevented           from attending            designated            football
matches,    as they were by the exclusion order).


Subsection       (2) provides         for the mandatory disqualification                               from
membership of the scheme of people convicted of relevant offences
defined in subsection (5) and the Schedule.


Subsection        (3)    establishes        that       the    period      of    disqualification
following        conviction       shall     be     five       years      where    a     sentence         of
immediate        imprisonment        is     imposed       and      two    years       in    any    other
case.    The date from which the period of disqualification begins
is to be determined under the scheme.




                                                  13
Subsection       (4) provides that disqualification has the effect of
preventing       someone        from joining             the   scheme or of             requiring          the
withdrawal of their existing membership.


Subsection       (5)     introduces          the    list of       relevant offences                     in the
Schedule.        In     some    cases        the     offences          listed         are     defined       as
relevant only if the court declares them to be relevant (see note
on subsection (9)).


Subsection        (6)       extends         the    meaning        of        "designated            football
matches"    in the Schedule so as to include international matches
designated under Part II of the Bill.


Subsection (7) provides for the court to certify that an offence
is a relevant one (unless the offence is one created by the Bill
itself     and    defined        in    the        Schedule       as    relevant)             and    for    the
officers    of        the    court     to    give     notification               to    : the       Football
Membership Authority, the police and the person convicted.


Subsection       (8) establishes that someone served with a probation
order,     following           conviction          for    a    relevant           offence          shall    be
disqualified           from     membership           (for        two        years      by      virtue       of
subsection       (6)) notwithstanding the provisions                              of section 13 of
the Powers of Criminal Courts Act 1973.


Subsection        (9)       defines        certain       terms    used       in       this    Clause.       In
particular it provides for offences committed en route to or from
matches,     as       set    out      in    the    Schedule           to    be    capable          of    being
relevant     if the Court             is     satisfied that                the particular           offence
related to football matches.




                                                     14
CLAUSE 8 : OFFENCE OF ADMITTING SPECTATORS TO UNLICENSED PREMISES


This Clause makes               it an offence for a club,                         or anyone else,               to
admit      spectators          to    any       premises       during        a    designated          football
match,      unless          those   premises          are    licensed           for the purpose.            The
offence          may    be    triable      in    either        a    magistrate's          court       or    The
Crown Court; in the latter case the maximum penalty may be a fine
or imprisonment of up to two years.


Subsection (1) establishes the offence of admitting spectators to
a ground,         or other premises,               or allowing spectators to remain on
the      premises,            during       a     designated           match unless             the    person
responsible for the ground,                      or the match,             has a licence to admit
spectators. The responsible person will normally be the host club
but      would         also    include          the     management          of Wembley         stadium          or
anyone       else       hosting        a       designated          match.        (See    Clause        1    for
definitions            of     "responsible         person"          and    "period       relevant          to    a
m a t c h " ).


Subsection (2) allows someone charged with this offence to prove,
in his own defence, that:



            - spectators were admitted without his consent; and


             - that he did his                 best to ensure that the offence was not
            committed.



Subsection (3) establishes the penalties for the offence:



             a.    if       tried   in     a    magistrates          court,       a     fine    up    to    the
             "statutory maximum"                 (defined by section 74 of the Criminal
             Justice Act            1982       as the       sum    fixed by        Section      32    of the
             Magistrates'           Courts        Act       1980.    The        statutory      maximum          is
             currently Â£2,000 but can be increased by Order under the
             1980 Act)



                                                        15
      b.     if   tried   in   the   Crown      Court,    an   unlimited   fine   or
       imprisonment of up to two years or both.



This potentially heavy penalty reflects the need to deter clubs,
or others,    from   attempting      to   ignore    the    licensing    provisions,
and thus the national membership               scheme,    altogether,   by holding
designated matches on unlicensed premises.

CLAUSE 9 : LICENCES TO ADMIT SPECTATORS : GENERAL


This Clause makes general provision for the granting of licences
to admit spectators to designated football matches.                                       It covers      :
charging for licences;                the scope of licences                  (ie one match,         some
or all matches);        a right of inspection of the licensed premises;
the   procedure       which       the      licensing         authority        must    follow      if    it
wishes to vary a licence;                  and the conditions which the authority
may attach to a licence.                   It makes it an offence for a club,                          or
anyone else responsible for a match, to contravene the conditions
of a licence.


Subsection      (1)    provides            for    the       licensing        authority       to   grant
licences for the admission of spectators to a designated football
match.


Subsection (2) allow the authority to determine the form in which
application      for        a    licence         is    to    be   made       and     to    charge      for
applications.         The       fee   is    determined         by      the   Secretary       of   State
whether or not he is also the licensing authority.


Subsection      (3)     allows          for      licences         to    cover      all     designated
matches, a specified class of matches or individual matches.


Subsection (4) provides for the licence to be in writing and to
be    subject     to    such          terms       and       conditions        as     the    authority
considers appropriate.


Subsection (5) makes it a condition of any licence that a person
authorised      by     the        authority           (or    by     the      Football      Membership
Authority       or     the       Secretary            of    State       -    see     definition         in
subsection      (13))       shall be able to inspect the premises on which
matches are to be played,                   make inquiries and see and take copies
of relevant records.              The licensing authority will need to employ
a small inspectorate for this purpose.




                                                      17
Subsection     (6)    allows      the authority to specify the period of a
licence.


Subsections     (7)    and      (8)    provide          for    the    authority        to     vary    the
terms    and   conditions        of     a    licence          provided      that   it        gives    the
licence-holder         notice          of its      intention           to    do    so        and       an
opportunity to make representations within 21 days of giving the
notice.


Subsection      (9)    spells         out some of         the    requirements           which         the
licensing      authority        will        expect       applicants         for    a    licence        to
satisfy:



          a)    that the        club        (or    other        responsible        person)            has
          installed      adequate           machinery           and    established            adequate
          procedures       to    ensure       that       only    members      of       the    national
          membership         scheme         (or    others        authorised            by     it)     are
          admitted to matches;


          b) that the club is carrying out the duties set upon it by
          the Football Membership Authority under the scheme;


          c)    that    the club's           equipment,          procedures            and     other
          arrangements are such that may be reasonably required in
          order to reduce the risk of offences at matches;


          d)   that    the      club    has       met    other        requirements           which    the
           Secretary of State may notify to the licensing authority.




This is not an exclusive list.


Subsection      (10.) makes it an offence to contravene the condition
of a licence.


Subsection      (11)    allows         someone          charged       with    this          offence    to
prove,     in his own defence, that:




                                                   18
        -spectators were admitted without his consent; and


        - that he did his best to ensure that the offence was not
        committed.



Subsection (12) makes the offence triable in a magistrates court,
subject to a fine up to the maximum of level 5 (currently Â£2,000
- see note on Clause 2(2)).


Subsection (13) defines certain of the terms used in this Clause
and   provides   for   the   licence   fee   to   cover   the   costs   of   the
Secretary of State and the licensing authority in administering
and enforcing Part I of the Bill.

CLAUSE      10    :    LICENCES           TO    ADMIT          SPECTATORS          :     REVOCATION             AND
SUSPENSION


This Clause provides for the circumstances in which the licensing
authority may           suspend         or     revoke a licence to                  admit         spectators;
for   the     authority            to    give       the     holder         an    opportunity          to      make
representations              before      the     licence         is    withdrawn,             except       in    an
emergency;        and for the previous holder to apply for the licence
to be restored.


Subsection        (1)        empowers         the     licensing            authority         by    notice        in
writing      to    suspend          a   licence        for      such       period       as    it    considers
necessary,        or to revoke it altogether.


Subsections           (2 )    and       (3)    provide         that        the    authority         may       only
suspend      or       revoke       a    licence           if   it     is    satisfied             that     it    is
necessary to do so bearing                       in mind the requirements                          set out       in
Clause 8(9) above and such other considerations as the Secretary
of    State       determines            to     be     relevant.            Such     a    decision          would
normally be taken on the advice of the inspectorate employed by
the authority.


Subsection         (4)       requires          the    authority            to     give       notice      of     its
intention to suspend or revoke a licence and to allow the licence
holder      21    days        to    make       representations              before       the       licence       is
withdrawn.


 Subsection (5) provides for the licensing authority to withdraw a
 licence in an emergency,                     without giving notice,                     but requires the
 authority to give its reasons for doing so as soon as possible.


 Subsection        (6)       makes      clear        that      a licence          has    no    effect         while
 suspended,        ie a club would not be able to admit spectators to a
 designated match while its licence was suspended (though it would
 be able to hold the match without spectators).




                                                          20
Subsection   (7)   provides   for   someone   whose   licence   has   been
suspended to apply to the authority for it to be restored and for
the authority to do so if it considers it appropriate.




                                    21
CLAUSE 11 : THE LICENSING AUTHORITY


This    Clause      provides          for    the    Secretary         of     State      to    be   the
licensing    authority          or     for him       to    appoint     another         body   as   the
authority;    and        for the procedures by which                    such an         appointment
may be made or terminated.


Subsection (1) provides for the Secretary of State to take on the
functions     of        the    licensing          authority      or    for       him    to    appoint
someone else to do so. The remainder of this Clause provides for
the possibility that someone other than the Secretary of State is
to take on the role of licensing authority.


Subsections       (2)     and    (3)    provide         for the Secretary of State and
the body appointed by him to agree the terms of the appointment;
for the Secretary of              State       to terminate an              appointment,        having
given    notice;         for    him     to    give        directions        to    the    appointed
authority and for it to comply with such directions;                                   and for the
authority to provide the Secretary of State with such documents
and     information           about    its        operations      as       he    may     reasonably
require.


Subsection        (4)    provides       that,      if     an authority's          appointment       is
terminated,       it shall        let the Secretary of                 State have copies            of
all     licences        granted       and    of    all     its   records          concerning       the
granting     of    licences;          and    any other       relevant        information which
the Secretary of State may require.

                                                INTRODUCTORY


PART II - FOOTBALL MATCHES OUTSIDE ENGLAND AND WALES


Introduction to Part II


Part II of the Bill empowers the courts to impose reporting
restrictions on people convicted of relevant offences in this
country or abroad at times when certain matches are to take place
outside England and Wales.   It provides for the Secretary of
State to designate an agency or agencies to administer the
orders.


The effect of this Part is to enable courts to restrict the
travel to designated football matches abroad of those convicted
of relevant offences in cases where it would help to prevent or
reduce violence or disorder at those matches.   It would be an
offence not to comply with such an order.

CLAUSE 12 - SCOPE AND INTERPRETATION OF PART II


Clause 12 determines the scope of Part II of the Bill and defines
certain terms used in it.        The clause provides for the Secretary
of State to designate, by Order,        football matches and countries
outside England and Wales to which the provisions would apply;
and to designate reporting agencies.


Subsection   fl) applies this Part of the Bill to football matches
outside England and Wales, as designated under the following
subsections.


Subsection   (2 )   defines the term 'designated football m a t c h 1, ie
matches outside England and Wales which someone can be prevented
from attending by a restriction order.         Designation is by Order
made by the Secretary of State.


Subsection (3) provides that orders in subsection (2) are subject
to the negative resolution procedure.


Subsection (4^ defines a restriction order by reference to
clauses 13 and 20 which establish the circumstances in which such
an order might be made.


Subsection   (5) defines the term 'relevant offence'        (ie an offence
in respect of which a restriction order may be made under clause
13, and to which offences outside England and Wales must
correspond when a restriction order is made under clause 20).
This subsection should be read in conjunction with subsection (6)
and the Schedule.


Subsection (6) determines the way 'relevant offence'          is
interpreted in subsection (5).        By applying the Schedule to Part
II in the same way as it applies to Part I (see also clause
7(6)), the offences which allow a restriction order to be made
cover certain offences at, or on a journey to or from, designated
matches in England or Wales; or going to or from designated
â¢
    matches elsewhere.       Note that 'designated football m a t c h 1 in
    subsection (6) and the Schedule concerns the definition of
    matches which may lead to a restriction order, whereas the same
    term in subsection (2), and Part II generally,         defines matches
    which a person is prevented from attending if he is subject to a
    restriction order.


    Subsection       (7^ provides for the Secretary of State to designate
    by Order a reporting agency or agencies.         He may designate
    different agencies for different areas.


    Subsection (8) differentiates between those designated football
    matches for which reporting is obligatory for all those subject
    to a restriction order, and those matches for which it is at the
    discretion of the reporting agency in accordance with clause
    1 7 ( 7 ) (b).


    Subsection (9) defines certain terms used in Part II.
                                                                      Clause 13



CLAUSE 13 - RESTRICTION ORDERS


Clause 13 empowers the court to make restriction orders and
establishes the circumstances under which an order might be made.
It requires the court to explain the terms of the order to the
offender and to notify him where and when to report initially.


Subsection (1) empowers the court to make a restriction order in
relation to a person convicted of a relevant offence.                 (See
clause 12 (5)).


Subsection    (2 )    limits the court to making such orders only when
satisfied that it would help to prevent violence or disorder at
or in connection with designated football matches.             (See
clause 12(2)).


Subsections    f3^ & (4^ limit the court to making such orders
following sentencing or the making of a probation order
(notwithstanding the provisions of the Powers of Criminal Courts
Act 1983).


Subsections    (5 )    and   (6 )   provide that the order must specify the
designated reporting agency and the particular place at which the
offender should initially report and that the court must explain
the terms of the order to the offender.


Subsection (7) provides for a right of appeal to the Court of
Appeal against a restriction order, where the court which imposed
it is the Crown Court.              There also exists a right of appeal from
the magistrates'        court to the Crown Court under Section 108 of
the   Magistrates'       Courts' Act 1980.

CLAUSE 14 - EFFECT OF RESTRICTION ORDER


Clause 14 sets out the effect of a restriction order and creates
the offence of failure to comply with the duty to report.


Subsection   fl) specifies that, subject to subsection   (3 )   and
clause 15 (application to terminate restriction order), a
restriction order shall run for 5 years from the date it is made
where the offender receives a sentence of immediate custody or of
detention in a young offenders institution, and otherwise for 2
years.   In either case the period runs from the date of the
making of the order.


Subsection (2) establishes the duty to report initially to the
agency specified by the court within 5 days of the making of the
order, and thereafter as required by the agency under the terms
of clause 17.


Subsection (3) provides that, where a custodial sentence has been
imposed or is being served, the offender has a duty to report
initially to the agency specified by the court within 5 days of
his date of discharge.


Subsection (4) creates the offence of failing, without reasonable
excuse, to report as required by the order.


Subsection (5) provides for the offence to be a summary one (ie
triable only in a magistrates'   court), and that the maximum
penalty shall be one month's imprisonment or a level 3 fine
(currently Â£400) or both.
                                                        Clause 15


CLAUSE 15 - APPLICATION TO TERMINATE A RESTRICTION ORDER


clause 15 sets out the procedure for a person subject to a
restriction order to make application to the court to have it
terminated.


Subsection Cl) provides for       an application to the court to have
the order set aside once it       has been in force for one year.   The
application should be made to the court which originally made the
order (or a court acting for the same petty session area, as
provided for in subsection (5)).


Subsection    (2 )   empowers the court to terminate the order or
refuse the application having regard to the person's character,
his conduct since the order was made, the nature of the offence
which led to the restriction order and any other circumstances of
the case.


Subsection (3) precludes an unsuccessful applicant from making
another application for a further six months.


Subsection f4) empowers the       court to order the applicant to pay
all or part of the costs of       the application.


Subsection (6) disapplies from restriction orders the general
power to suspend or rescind orders provided in the Magistrates'
Courts' Act 1980.
                                                              Clause 16


CLAUSE 16 - INFORMATION


Clause 16 sets out the procedures to be followed by the court.


Subsection (1) directs the court on making a restriction order to
give a copy to the person subject to the order; and to send one
to the specified reporting agency, to the chief officer of police
for the area covering the place at which the person has to report
initially and, when a custodial sentence is to be served, to the
governor of the prison (or equivalent).


Subsection   (2 )   similarly concerns the distribution of any
terminating order made under clause 15, in the same way as for
the restriction order.


Subsection   (3 )   requires the governor of the prison (or
equivalent) to notify the specified reporting agency of the
discharge of any person subject to a restriction order where more
than 5 days of the order are left to run.


The responsibility for the service of documents lies with the
clerk of the court (in the case of a magistrate's court) and
subsection   f4) applies the terms of section 141 of the
Magistrates'   Courts' Act 1980 to this clause.

CLAUSE 17 - REPORTING AGENCIES'           FUNCTIONS


Clause 17 sets out the functions of the reporting agency.


Subsection    fl) is introductory.


Subsections    ( 2 ).   (3) and (4) require the specified reporting
agency to register the person subject to the order when he
initially reports to them and thereafter to inform him, by notice
in writing,   of such requirements as appear to the agency to be
necessary or expedient to give effect to the order.           Provision is
made for the transfer,          on application, to a more conveniently
located agency where the person will be required to re-register.


Subsections 5 and 6         provide for temporary transfer to another
agency, and requires the original agency to have regard to any
guidance issued by the Secretary of State before giving agreement
to such an arrangement.


Subsection 7 fa) requires the agency to advise every person
registered with it, by notice in writing, when and where he needs
to report on the occasion of matches which attract an obligatory
reporting requirement.


Subsections 7 (b).       (8 )   and (9) establish the procedure for
matches which do not attract an obligatory reporting requirement.
The agency cannot require a person to report unless it is
satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to impose the
requirement to reduce the likelihood of violence or disorder at
the match in question.           Before making a decision the agency must
consult the appropriate chief officer of police and have regard
to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State.            If it is
decided to impose a reporting requirement, the person subject to
the order must be given notice in writing of when and where he
should report.
Subsection (10) creates the subsidiary offence of failing without
reasonable excuse to comply with any requirement imposed by the
agency, to give effect to a restriction order.     Under subsection
(10)(a) the offence is a summary one, with a maximum penalty of a
level 2 fine (currently Â£100).


Subsection   (11) provides for the offence to be a summary one (ie
triable only in a magistrates'    court), and that the maximum
penalty shall be a level 2 fine.

CLAUSE 18 - EXEMPTIONS FROM RESTRICTION ORDERS


Clause 18 sets out the procedure for the person subject to a
restriction order to apply for exemption from the requirement to
report on the occasion of a particular designated football match.
It also creates an offence of giving false information to obtain
an exemption and gives a right of appeal against a refusal to
grant an exemption.


Subsection    (1) provides for application to be made to the agency
for exemption from the duty to report on the occasion of a match.


Subsection    (2 )   enables the agency to exempt someone from the
requirement to report provided the agency is satisfied that this
is justified by special circumstances,        and that by virtue of
these the person would not attend the match.


Subsection (3) requires the agency to have regard for any
guidance issued by the Secretary of State under Clause 19.


Subsection 4 suspends the duty of the agency (under section 17(7)
to require those subject to an order to report for the duration
of any exemption.


Subsection    (5) provides a right of appeal to a magistrates' court
against the refusal of an agency to grant an exemption.


Subsections    (6) and   (1 )   empower the court to make such order as
it sees fit and also to order the appellant to pay all or part of
the costs of the appeal.


Subsection (8) creates an offence of knowingly giving false or
misleading information or documentation when applying for an
exemption.


Subsection (9) provides for the offence to be a summary one and
for a maximum penalty of a level 3 fine (currently Â£400).
                                                             Clause 19


CLAUSE 19 -    FUNCTIONS OF AGENCIES: SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS


Clause 19 enables the Secretary of State to issue guidance for
the purposes of the exercise of the functions of the reporting
agency and, by Order, to make regulations about the giving of
notices by the agency when imposing reporting requirements.


Subsections    m      and   (2 )   empower the Secretary of State to issue
such guidance and to publish it under arrangements he considers
appropriate.


Subsections    (3).    (4) and (5) enable the Secretary of State to
make regulations about the giving of notices by the agency to
impose reporting requirements.             The agency must comply with the
regulations.       These regulations, which could disapply the
provisions of Clause 23, would be made by Order,            subject to the
negative resolution procedure.


Subsections    (6) and (7) establishes that any notice about
reporting requirements served in accordance with any regulations
made by Order of the Secretary of State or in accordance with
Clause 23 shall be deemed to have been received.             To establish
otherwise the person subject to the order is required to prove
not only that he did not receive the notice but also that he had
no reasonable cause to be aware that he would be required to
report.


Subsection (8) is a money provision enabling the Secretary of
State to finance agencies.

                                                         Clause 20


CLAUSE 20 - OFFENCES COMMITTED OUTSIDE ENGLAND AND WALES


Clause 20 enables the courts to impose restriction orders on
those convicted of corresponding offences outside England and
Wales.   The offences in question, specified by Order in Council,
will correspond to those offences in England and Wales which may
result in a restriction order following conviction here.          The
Clause also sets out the procedure to apply for and make a
restriction order in respect of convictions outside England and
Wales.


Subsection    Cl) empowers Her Majesty, by Order in Council, to
specify offences outside England and Wales which appear to
correspond with those offences listed in the Schedule, that is
offences here which trigger the power to make restriction orders
(see notes on clause 12(6)).        Any such Order will be subject to
the negative resolution procedure,        in accordance with subsection
1121.

Subsections    (2 \   and (3) empower a justice of the peace, upon an
information being laid that a local resident has been convicted
of a corresponding offence, to issue a summons or, if the
information is in writing and substantiated by oath,        issue a
warrant for his arrest.


Subsections    (4).     (5) and (6) empower the court to make a
restriction order in relation to a person ordinarily resident in
England and Wales who has been convicted (with no appeal
outstanding)    of a corresponding offence, provided that it is
satisfied that such an order would help to prevent violence or
disorder at or in connection with designated football matches.
The court may remand the person on bail        (though not custody)     and
deal with him generally in the same way as a summary trial of an
information.


Subsection    (7 )    provides for a right of appeal to the Crown Court.
Subsection    (8) applies the relevant sections of Part II relating
to restriction orders made on the basis of a conviction in
England and Wales, to restriction orders made on the basis of a
corresponding conviction abroad.


Subsections    (9) and   (10) provide for the Order in Council to
specify the authority in each country which will be responsible
for certifying the information required and the form of such
certification.     It also allows for that certification to be
considered as admissible evidence by the courts in England and
Wales.
PART III           GENERAL


This Part of the Bill contains general provisions providing                                     for
the    procedures          for    declarations       of   relevance         by    the     courts,
offences by bodies               corporate,    the    service    of documents             and   the
commencement and extent provisions of the Bill.



CLAUSE        21    :     FURTHER     PROVISION      ABOUT,     AND     APPEALS          AGAINST,
DECLARATIONS OF RELEVANCE


This    Clause       deals    with    the   procedures      to be      followed          when   the
prosecution seeks a declaration from the court that an offence is
relevant       to    football       matches.   Among the offences                listed    in the
schedule to the Bill, those committed en route to or from a match
are only       relevant       for the purposes of Clauses                   7 and    12 of      the
Bill if the court declares them to be relevant.


Subsection (1) requires the prosecution to give the defendant at
least     5    days       notice     before    the     trial    that    it        will     seek    a
declaration of relevance.


Subsection          (2)    allows    a   person      against   whom     a    declaration          of
relevance has been made to appeal against the declaration.


Subsection (3) provides that a restriction imposed under Part II
will be quashed if an appeal against a declaration of relevance
is successful.



CLAUSE 22 : OFFENCES BY BODIES CORPORATE


This     is    a    standard       provision    whose     purpose      is    to    ensure       that
directors,          members and responsible employees of a corporate body
(like a limited company) which commits an offence under the Bill
may be held personally to account for such an offence,                                   if it was
committed with             their consent or connivance.               Thus       if a football
club,     or       other     responsible       person,    commits       an       offence     under

CLAUSE 23 : SERVICE OF DOCUMENTS


This     is    a    standard       provision            concerned       with        the    service        of
documents required or authorised by the Bill.



CLAUSE        24   : CITATION,           COMMENCEMENT,            CONSEQUENTIAL            REPEAL       AND
EXTENT


This     Clause       provides          for    the       citation    of       the    Act;        for     the
commencement of its provisions by commencement order                                        (the first
such order to be subject to a negative resolution SI);                                           for the
repeal    of       the    provisions          of   the    Public    Order      Act        1986   dealing
with exclusion orders;                  and    for the limitation of                  its extent to
England and Wales.


Subsection (1) cites the title of the Act.


Subsections (2) to (4) provide for the provisions of the Bill to
be brought into force by commencement orders,                                  which may appoint
different          days    for    different          provisions.        The    first        such    order
will    be subject          to a statutory resolution SI,                      which will              allow
Parliament          to    debate    the       principle      of     the    scheme         after     Royal
Assent        (and after         Lord    Justice Taylor           has     reported)         before the
FMA is appointed to draw up the scheme. The Clauses which make it
an     offence        for       spectators         or     clubs     to     fail       to     meet        the
requirements of the scheme (Clauses 2 and 8) will not be brought
into effect until the scheme itself is implemented. Part II will
be     brought        into       force    when        arrangements         for       the     reporting
agencies and associated matters are complete.


Subsection          (5) provides for the repeal of those sections of the
Public        Order       Act    1986    which       established         exclusion         orders.        As
noted under Clause                6 above,         these provisions            are    superseded by
this Bill and will cease to have effect when the offence created



                                                     38
by Clause 2 comes into force.        The general repeal of sections 30
to 37 of the 1986 Act will not,       however,    prevent someone subject
to an exclusion order at the time of the repeal           from exercising
his   right   under   section   33   to   apply   for   his    order   to   be
terminated.


Subsection    (6)   limits the extension of the Bill          to England and
Wales.


Subsection (7) was introduced by the Privilege Amendment on Third
Reading in the House of Lords and will be removed.

                                                INTRODUCTORY


PART II - FOOTBALL MATCHES OUTSIDE ENGLAND AND WALES


Introduction to Part II


Part II of the Bill empowers the courts to impose reporting
restrictions on people convicted of relevant offences in this
country or abroad at times when certain matches are to take place
outside England and Wales.   It provides for the Secretary of
State to designate an agency or agencies to administer the
orders.


The effect of this Part is to enable courts to restrict the
travel to designated football matches abroad of those convicted
of relevant offences in cases where it would help to prevent or
reduce violence or disorder at those matches.    It would be an
offence not to comply with such an order.

CLAUSE 12 - SCOPE AND INTERPRETATION OF PART II


Clause 12 determines the scope of Part II of the Bill and defines
certain terms used in it.        The clause provides for the Secretary
of State to designate, by Order,        football matches and countries
outside England and Wales to which the provisions would apply;
and to designate reporting agencies.


Subsection Cl) applies this Part of the Bill to football matches
outside England and Wales, as designated under the following
subsections.


Subsection   (2 )     defines the term 'designated football match',   ie
matches outside England and Wales which someone can be prevented
from attending by a restriction order.         Designation is by Order
made by the Secretary of State.


Subsection f3) provides that orders in subsection (2) are subject
to the negative resolution procedure.


Subsection     (4 )   defines a restriction order by reference to
clauses 13 and 20 which establish the circumstances in which such
an order might be made.


Subsection C5) defines the term 'relevant offence'        (ie an offence
in respect of which a restriction order may be made under clause
13, and to which offences outside England and Wales must
correspond when a restriction order is made under clause 20).
This subsection should be read in conjunction with subsection (6)
and the Schedule.


Subsection (6) determines the way 'relevant offence*        is
interpreted in subsection (5).         By applying the Schedule to Part
II in the same way as it applies to Part I (see also clause
7(6)), the offences which allow a restriction order to be made
cover certain offences at, or on a journey to or from, designated
matches in England or Wales; or going to or from designated
matches elsewhere.   Note that   'designated football m a t c h 1 in
subsection   (6) and the Schedule concerns the definition of
matches which may lead to a restriction order, whereas the same
term in subsection   (2), and Part II generally, defines matches
which a person is prevented from attending if he is subject to a
restriction order.


Subsection   f7) provides for the Secretary of State to designate
by Order a reporting agency or agencies.      He may designate
different agencies for different areas.


Subsection   f8) differentiates betwefen those designated football
matches for which reporting is obligatory for all those subject
to a restriction order,   and those matches for which it is at the
discretion of the reporting agency in accordance with clause
17(7)(b).


Subsection   (9) defines certain terms used in Part II.
                                                                Clause 13



CLAUSE 13 - RESTRICTION ORDERS


Clause 13 empowers the court to make restriction orders and
establishes the circumstances under which an order might be made.
It requires the court to explain the terms of the order to the
offender and to notify him where and when to report initially.


Subsection    (1 )   empowers the court to make a restriction order in
relation to a person convicted of a relevant offence.               (See
clause 12(5)).


Subsection    (2 )   limits the court to making such orders only when
satisfied that it would help to prevent violence or disorder at
or in connection with designated football matches.           (See
clause 12(2)).


Subsections     f3) &    (4 )   limit the court to making such orders
following sentencing or the making of a probation order
(notwithstanding the provisions of the Powers of Criminal Courts
Act 1983).


Subsections (5) and (6) provide that the order must specify the
designated reporting agency and the particular place at which the
offender should initially report and that the court must explain
the terms of the order to the offender.


Subsection    (7 \   provides for a right of appeal to the Court of
Appeal against a restriction order, where the court which imposed
it is the Crown Court.           There also exists a right of appeal from
the magistrates*        court to the Crown Court under Section 108 of
the   Magistrates* Courts* Act 1980.
                                                              Clause 14




CLAUSE 14 - EFFECT OF RESTRICTION ORDER


Clause 14 sets out the effect of a restriction order and creates
the offence of failure to comply with the duty to report.


Subsection   fl) specifies that, subject to subsection    m     and
clause 15 (application to terminate restriction order), a
restriction order shall run for 5 years from the date i t is made
where the offender receives a sentence of immediate custody or of
detention in a young offenders institution, and otherwise for 2
years.   In either case the period runs from the date of the
making of the order.


Subsection   (2 )   establishes the duty to report initially to the
agency specified by the court within 5 days of the making of the
order, and thereafter as required by the agency under the terms
of clause 17.


Subsection   (3) provides that, where a custodial sentence has been
imposed or is being served, the offender has a duty to report
initially to the agency specified by the court within 5 days of
his date of discharge.


Subsection (4) creates the offence of failing, without reasonable
excuse, to report as required by the order.


Subsection f5) provides for the offence to be a summary one (ie
triable only in a magistrates*      court), and that the maximum
penalty shall be one month's imprisonment or a level 3 fine
 (currently Â£400) or both.
                                                       Clause 15


CLAUSE 15 - APPLICATION TO TERMINATE A RESTRICTION ORDER


Clause 15 sets out the procedure for a person subject to a
restriction order to make application to the court to have it
terminated.


Subsection    fl) provides for an application to the court to have
the order set aside once it has been in force for one year.         The
application should be made to the court which originally made the
order (or a court acting for the same petty session area, as
provided for in subsection (5)).


Subsection    (2 )   empowers the court to terminate the order or
refuse the application having regard to the person's character,
his conduct since the order was made, the nature of the offence
which led to the restriction order and any other circumstances of
the case.


Subsection           precludes an unsuccessful applicant from making
another application for a further six months.


Subsection (4) empowers the court to order the applicant to pay
all or part of the costs of the application.


Subsection (6) disapplies from restriction orders the general
power to suspend or rescind orders provided in the Magistrates'
Courts' Act 1980.
                                                              Clause 16


CLAUSE 16 - INFORMATION


Clause 16 sets out the procedures to be followed by the court.


Subsection fl) directs the court on making a restriction order to
give a copy to the person subject to the order; and to send one
to the specified reporting agency, to the chief officer of police
for the area covering the place at which the person has to report
initially and, when a custodial sentence is to be served, to the
governor of the prison      (or equivalent).


Subsection   (2 )   similarly concerns the distribution of any
terminating order made under clause 15, in the same way as for
the restriction order.


Subsection   (3) requires the governor of the prison    (or
equivalent) to notify the specified reporting agency of the
discharge of any person subject to a restriction order where more
than 5 days of the order are left to run.


The responsibility for the service of documents lies with the
clerk of the court (in the case of a magistrate's court)         and
subsection f4) applies the terms of section 141 of the
Magistrates' Courts' Act 1980 to this clause.
                                                             Clause 17


CLAUSE 17 - REPORTING AGENCIES'            FUNCTIONS


Clause 17 sets out the functions of the reporting agency.


subsection    (1) is introductory.


Subsections    (2 ).   (3 )   and   (4) require the specified reporting
agency to register the person subject to the order when he
initially reports to them and thereafter to inform him, by notice
in writing, of such requirements as appear to the agency to be
necessary or expedient to give effect to the order.             Provision is
made for the transfer,          on application, to a more conveniently
located agency where the person will be required to re-register.


Subsections 5 and 6           provide for temporary transfer to another
agency, and requires the original agency to have regard to any
guidance issued by the Secretary of State before giving agreement
to such an arrangement.


Subsection 7(a) requires the agency to advise every person
registered with it, by notice in writing, when and where he needs
to report on the occasion of matches which attract an obligatory
reporting requirement.


Subsections 7(b).        (8) and (9) establish the procedure for
matches which do not attract an obligatory reporting requirement.
The agency cannot require a person to report unless it is
satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to impose the
requirement to reduce the likelihood of violence or disorder at
the match in question.              Before making a decision the agency must
consult the appropriate chief officer of police and have regard
to any guidance issued by the Secretary of State.              If it is
decided to impose a reporting requirement, the person subject to
the order must be given notice in writing of when and where he
should report.
Subsection   (10) creates the subsidiary offence of failing without
reasonable excuse to comply with any requirement imposed by the
agency, to give effect to a restriction order.    Under subsection
(10)(a) the offence is a summary one, with a maximum penalty of a
level 2 fine (currently Â£100).


Subsection   fll) provides for the offence to be a summary one (ie
triable only in a magistratesâ court), and that the maximum
penalty shall be a level .2 fine.
                                                           Clause 18


CLAUSE 18 - EXEMPTIONS FROM RESTRICTION ORDERS


clause 18 sets out the procedure for the person subject to a
restriction order to apply for exemption from the requirement to
report on the occasion of a particular designated football match.
It also creates an offence of giving false information to obtain
an exemption and gives a right of appeal against a refusal to
grant an exemption.


Subsection   m      provides for application to be made to the agency
for exemption from the duty to report on the occasion of a match.


Subsection   (2 )    enables the agency to exempt someone from the
requirement to report provided the agency is satisfied that this
is justified by special circumstances,      and that by virtue of
these the person would not attend the match.


Subsection    C3) requires the agency to have regard for any
guidance issued by the Secretary of State under Clause 19.


Subsection 4 suspends the duty of the agency      (under section 17(7)
to require those subject to an order to report for the duration
of any exemption.


subsection (5^ provides a right of appeal to a magistrates'         court
against the refusal of an agency to grant an exemption.


Subsections (6) and (7) empower the court to make such order as
it sees fit and also to order the appellant to pay all or part of
the costs of the appeal.


Subsection    (8) creates an offence of knowingly giving false or
misleading    information or documentation when applying for an
exemption.


Subsection (9) provides for the offence to be a summary one and

                                                          Clause 19


CLAUSE 19 -    FUNCTIONS OF AGENCIES:       SUPPLEMENTARY PROVISIONS


clause 19 enables the Secretary of State to issue guidance for
the purposes of the exercise of the functions of the reporting
agency and, by Order, to make regulations about the giving of
notices by the agency when imposing reporting requirements.


Subsections    fn   and   (2 )   empower the Secretary of State to issue
such guidance and to publish it under arrangements he considers
appropriate.


Subsections    f3).        and        enable the Secretary of State to
make regulations about the giving of notices by the agency to
impose reporting requirements.           The agency must comply with the
regulations.    These regulations, which could disapply the
provisions of Clause 23, would be made by Order,          subject to the
negative resolution procedure.


Subsections    (6) and (7^ establishes that any notice about
reporting requirements served in accordance with any regulations
made by Order of the Secretary of State or in accordance with
Clause 23 shall be deemed to have been received.           To establish
otherwise the person subject to the order is required to prove
not only that he did not receive the notice but also that he had
no reasonable cause to be aware that he would be required to
report.


Subsection C8) is a money provision enabling the Secretary of
State to finance agencies.
                                                        Clause 20


CLAUSE 20 - OFFENCES COMMITTED OUTSIDE ENGLAND AND WALES


clause 20 enables the courts to impose restriction orders on
those convicted of corresponding offences outside England and
Wales.   The offences in question,      specified by Order in Council,
will correspond to those offences in England and Wales which may
result in a restriction order following conviction here.          The
Clause also sets out the procedure to apply for and make a
restriction order in respect of convictions outside England and
Wales.


Subsection    m      empowers Her Majesty, by Order in Council,   to
specify offences outside England and Wales which appear to
correspond with those offences listed in the Schedule, that is
offences here which trigger the power to make restriction orders
(see notes on clause 12(6)).        Any such Order will be subject to
the negative resolution procedure,       in accordance with subsection
1121.

Subsections (2) and (3) empower a justice of the peace, upon an
information being laid that a local resident has been convicted
of a corresponding offence, to issue a summons or, if the
information is in writing and substantiated by oath,       issue a
warrant for his arrest.


Subsections m        . (5) and f6V empower the court to make a
restriction order in relation to a person ordinarily resident in
England and Wales who has been convicted (with no appeal
 outstanding) of a corresponding offence, provided that it is
 satisfied that such an order would help to prevent violence or
 disorder at or in connection with designated football matches.
 The court may remand the person on bail       (though not custody) and
 deal with him generally in the same way as a summary trial of an
 information.


 Subsection   (1 )   provides for a right of appeal to the Crown Court.
Subsection    (8 )   applies the relevant sections of Part II relating
to restriction orders made on the basis of a conviction in
England and Wales,       to restriction orders made on the basis of a

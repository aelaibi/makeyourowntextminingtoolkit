LUNCH/DINNER WITH SECRETARY OF FOOTBALL LEAGUE


Th£ Secretary of State has seen your submission of 12 March and
thinks he should accept the invitation but for drinks or lunch
rather than dinner.

He is not in a hurry to agree a date but I will let you know as
as we do.

LUNCH/DINNER WITH SECRETARY OF FOOTBALL LEAGUE

You asked for advice on an invitation from Jim Lester MP for the
Secretary of State to have lunch or dinner with Arthur Sandford,
the new Chief Executive of the Football League.
The Secretary of State will recall that Mr Lester spoke and voted
against the Government throughout the passage of the Football
Spectators Act, including the Committee Stage.
I am inclined to advise against acceptance unless the Secretary
of State feels that, in spite of the above, he does not wish to
risk offending Mr Lester.
As the Secretary of State knows, the football authorities asked
to meet the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State to discuss
action to be taken following the Taylor Report including what the
Government's attitude will be towards planning issues. The
Secretary of State has agreed that the meeting should be with the
Home Secretary, with Mr Moynihan in attendance to deal with
planning questions.
                              )

Inevitably, since the direct Government responsibility for the
implementation of the Taylor Report rests with the Home
Secretary, any discussion with the Secretary of State will focus
almost entirely on planning issues. 1/ suggest, therefore, that
if the Secretary of State is content, you should tell Mr Lester
that the Secretary of State would prefer to pass this invitation
to Mr Moynihan, who can discuss both football and planning
issues.                                    V-

     Dear Sir

                                                                 THE HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

   - ^  we are instructed by The Football Supporters' Association and
   will be attending the preliminary hearing of the Inquiry in
    Sheffield on Friday 28th April.                                                               it has been suggested to us by a
    member of the Inquiry staff that we might like to make written
                   support Of the application we are i n t e n d i ^ t T m a k e
    for representation at the Inquiry.


                    The Football Supporters' Association was set up in August
    ^               Allowing on the disaster at the Heysel Stadium i n ^ u ^ I s * .
   The aims of the Organisation are to obtain representation for
   football supporters amongst the game's ruling bodies with a view
   to obtaining advance and ongoing consultation on matters directly
   involved with football supporters.                                                                     The matter encompassed by our
   clients are ironically and tragically those which will involve the
   Inquiry, such as crowd control, policing and ticket allocation.
  The ld^tifcy_pard issue has been of particular interest to us in
  recent months. This would now seem to be of vital importance
  given the tragic events at Hillsborough.


                  The Association is organised both on a national and regional                                                                                      -
 basis.                      Nationally it is run by an Executive Committee of officers
 headed by Chairperson, Rogan Taylor. It is run on a regional basis
 by a series of branches and committees around the country.                                                                                             The
 Organisation has branches all around the country including South

           Public Inquiry


Nottingham area.                  There are a total of 17 branches.    The
Association is funded almost entirely out of membership fees, the
current minimum membership fee being £2.00 per member.                       That fee
is effectively used up by the service given by the Organisation to
its members. Small donations have been received from time to time
from football bodies such as the Football Trust and the PFA.


           The Organisation is run entirely by its members on a
voluntary basis and it has no full time employees.                    Since 1985
almost 8,OOOfootball supporters have joined and since the
introduction of a group membership scheme last year, many
thousands of other supports have become affiliated.                   Again
ironically, and as the tribunal will know, the Organisation was
launched on Merseyside.


           So far as we understand the terms of reference of the
Inquiry, these are threefold and can be considered to be the
following:-


1.        To investigate the background to the tragedy at Hillsborough
          which must include an investigation into the manner in which
           football is administered and operates in this country.


2.        To investigate the actual events at Hillsborough on 15th
          April 1989 and determine the causative factors involved in
          the deaths and injuries.


3.        To make recommendations for the future administration of the
          national game, to ensure that tragedies such as this never
          occur again.



          Our interests clearly coincide with that of the Inquiry.                 All
of our involvement is concerend with safety, crowd control, and
administration at football grounds.                   The terms of reference
referred to above indicate an Inquiry which could not, in our
view, ever be complete and satisfactory without representation
from the consumers.

 To    The Secretary to the                No    3           Date   2 7-Apr-8 9
       Public Inquiry


       Our clients are in the perfect position to be able to assist
his Lordship in explaining the effects of the manner in which
football has been administered from the consumer's point of view
in the years leading up to this disaster. They will be able to
give evidence as to the negotiations that have ensued between them
and the football authorities and produce documentation which, will
assist his Lordship.           They will be able to produce details of the
recommendations our clients have made to the football authorities.


       Since October last year, the Football Supporters' Association
has met with the Football Association on two occasions and has,
since January of this year, sat on the "strategic committee"
discussing the identity card issue.             This committee comprises
members from the House of Commons All Party Football Committee,
the Football Association, The Football League and Wembley Stadium
Limited and is chaired by Dennis Howell.


        In circumstances where many of their members were actually
present at Hillsborough, they will also be in a position to
provide his Lordship with Statements and, if necessary, oral
evidence from witnesses present at the disaster.


       Most importantly, they will also be in a position to put
forward their own recommendations to the Inquiry as to what form
his Lordship's recommendations to the government and the football
authorities should take for the running of the game in the future,
because we feel it is essential that the views of the supporters
be expressed and considered by your Lordship.


        To our mind, our clients are likely to be the only entirely
independent organisation who will wish to attend the Inquiry.
Whilst we are sure that all parties will wish to assist his
Lordship in the formation of his views, it is inevitable that the
other parties present will have a position which they will, in
some way, wish to defend or prosecute for aims other than the good
of football generally.           The families and their lawyers, whether
they are represented individually or collectively, will inevitably
wish to view the Inquiry in the context of the inevitable legal

proceedings against several parties involved.                On the other hand,
all of the authorities and organisations involved with the
administration of that particular match and of football generally
will wish to in someway justify their actions and protect their
position.         They may owe obligations to insurance companies in this
regard.


       Our clients, on the contrary, have no position to defend or
prosecute and can be seen as entirely independent.                It is for that
reason that both we and our clients feel that they require
independent legal representation at the Inquiry.


       To put their case properly and effectively, they must be
independent of the various Organisations involved and from the
representatives of the families of the bereaved and the injured.


       The problem with which our clients are faced is that they
simply jdo^not have^any funds to meet the costs of preparing
evidence which we feel may be crucial to his Lordship's Inquiry.
The evidence which will be gathered from the many branches of our
client Organisation will inevitably need sifting and arranging
into a logical order for presentation to the Inquiry.                  This would
involve the collation of substantial documentation and
investigation.                 In addition, we anticipate that his Lordship may
require oral evidence from several members of our client
Organisation.             That will require the preparation of proofs of
evidence and the inevitable taking of Statements.               Our clients
simply do not have the resources to undertake those tasks
themselves nor do they have the financial backing to instruct
solicitors to undertake that task.


       In addition to preparation for the Inquiry, our clients will
inevitably need representation by way of Counsel both to put our
clients' evidence to the Inquiry properly and to cross-examine the
various witnesses which will be called on behalf of the football
authorities.            For those reasons we would submit an application
that our clients' costs and disbursements”*in preparing for and
attending the InquTfy~be”paid out of public funds, as we see- -that

the alternative might be that our clients' evidence will either be
lost altogether or will be prepared in a manner which is simply
not sufficient to put the position fully and fairly to his
Lordship.


      As we said at the outset we are attending the hearing on
Friday with Counsel, but if there is any further documentation we
can provide in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact us.


                               Yours faithfully,

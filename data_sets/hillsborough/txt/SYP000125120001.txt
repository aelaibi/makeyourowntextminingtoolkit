 LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT OR OF YOUR OWN ACCORD?

 AFTER THE LOUDSPEAKER ANNOUNCEMENT THAT GAVE DETAILS OF THE DEATHS AND ASKED

Q18

 NO.

 053

 D ^ / O U HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS HANDLED,

 AFTER THE HATCH WAS STOPPED?           ^                       .

 THERE WERE A NUMBER OF POLICEMANy^TANDING AROUND APPARENTLY NOT KNOWING WHAT

 TO DO, WHILST PEOPLE WERE LYINff AROUND INJURED.         THE CORDON ON THE HALF WAY

 L INE LOOKED LIKE A WASTE Off j^NPOWER .

 THERE WAS NO APPEAL FOR MEDICAL HELP OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER.            I AM A QUALIFIED

 SWIMMING INSTRUCTOR AND I AM FAMILIAR WITH RESUSCITATION TECHNIQUES.                    I

 COULD HAVE ASSISTED HAD I KNOWN THERE WAS A NEED. THERE WAS A LACK OF

 MEDICAL EQUIPMENT.    I ONLY SAW ONE STR E T C H E R .

 QS4

 i ' W here anything that you wish to add which you feel       is   vital    to   this

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THERE WAS NO GUIDANCE FOR SUPPORTERS WHO HAD COME THROUGH THE TURNSTILES AT

 LEPPINGS LANE AND WERE LOOKING FOR THEIR STANDING POSITIONS.               THE TUNNEL

 APPEARED TO BE THE ONLY ENTRANCE.          THE POLICE WERE SLIGHTLY AT FAULT OVER

 THIS BUT MOSTLY I WOULD BLAME THE LACK OF STEWARDS IN THE AREA.

 I COULD SEE NO NEED FOR THE LATERAL FENCES WHICH RUN DOWN THE TERRACE.

 THESE PREVENTED FANS FROM SPREADING O U T .

 ALL POLICE PLANS AND GROUND OFFICIALS APPROACHES TO THE GAME WERE BASED ON

 PREVENTING HOOLIGANISM.     THERE WAS NO CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR SUCH A DISASTER.

 THE POLICE WERE VERY SLOW TO RjSfiPOND.      THE FRONT FENCING SHOULD HAVE BEEN

 RIPPED DOWN      WELL BEFORE THJ*/ FIRE SERVICE TURNED UP.   THERE WAS     A WASTE OF

 MANPOWER      IN SO MUCH THAT   SEVERAL POLICE WERE PUT INFRONT OF THE       NORTH STAND

 WHEN THEY COULD HAVE BEEN HELPING THE INJURED.

 G54

 IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH TO ADD WHICH YOU FEEL IS VITAL TO THIS

JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 THE FA SHOULD HAVE BEEN AWARE OF THE AVERAGE HOME GATES OF BOTH LIVERPOOL AND,.

FOREST AND FOR THIS REASON, THE FA SHOULD HAVE ALLOCATED THE TICKETS

 ACCORDINGLY AND AT LEAST HAVE HELD THE GAME AT OLD TRAFFORD WHICK'COULD HAVE

ACCOMODATED THE RESPECTIVE AMOUNT OF SUPPORTERS.              I WOULD BfcfAME THE FA FOR NOT

      VING ENOUGH THOUGHT TO THE F I X T U R E , AND A SEVERE LACiT OF PLANNING BY THE FA,

 I FEEL IT WAS WRONG TO PUT AN INEXPERIENCED S E N I O i V P O L I C E OFFICER   IN OVERALL

CHARGE OF THE GAME.

 DO YOU HAVE A N Y X ^ E W S OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE

 I    THOUGHT THE POLICE WERE SR^GW TO RESPOND TO THE DISASTER.    I WAS STANDING BY

 THE CONTROL BOX AND I COULD SEiiNliOU^ POLICE OFFICERS IIMSIDE, LOOKING AT THE

 MONITOR AT WHAT WAS GOING ON.      I ALSO SAW SOMEONE COME TO THE WINDOW AND LOOK

 OUT, SURVEYING THE TERRACING.      PEOPLE IN THE CROWD AROUND ME WERE POINTING TO

        AREA BEHIND THE GOAL AND GESTURING AND CALLING FOR THE POLICEMEN TO DO

 SOMETHING.     I KNEW THAT IT W A S N ’T CROWD DISORDER AND PEOPLE WERE IN DIFFICULTY,

 DUE TO THE CRUSHING AND T H A T ’S WHY THEY WERE TRYING TO GET OUT.    I THOUGHT THE

POLICE TOOK ABOUT FIVE MINUTES,       FOR THE OFFICERS IN FRONT OF THE TERRACE

FENCING TO RESPOND.      THEY WERE THEN HELPING PEOPLE OUT OF THESE PENS.

 ALSO THERE WAS COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES AND THE SUPPORTERS

 TELLING WHAT WAS HAPPENING.      ABOUT 30 MINUTES ELAPSED BEFORE ANY PUBLIC

 ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE.

 THERE D I D N ’T APPEAR TO BE ANY ORGANISATION TO THE RESPONSE TO THE DISASTER.

 PEOPLE WERE USING THEIR OWN INITIATIVE RATHER THAN SOMEONE GIVING ORDERS,

 I ALSO SAW ABOUT 70 POLICE OFFICERS LINE UP ACROSS THE PITCH ON THE HALFWAY

 LINE.    I UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WAS DONE, BUT I MENTION THIS TO MAKE THE POINT

 THAT THESE OFFICERS WERE PRIOR TO THE MATCH STARTING TO CONTROL THE CROWD IN

 YES,   i. THINK THE FACT, THAT INTIALLY PEOPLE WERE 8E1NG PUSHED BACK INTO THE

 DO YOU HAVE ANY VIEWS OR OBSERVATIONS ON THE WAY THE INCIDENT WAS H A N D L E D ,

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?
  ^                                        C v r   A-t
 I W A S DISORGANISED, A LOT OF POLICE OFFICERS WERE JUST STANDING A R O U N D , AND

 I FEEL THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN USING THEIR QUALIFICATION IN FIRST AID.                 THEY

 SEEMED TO BE LETTING THE FANS TAKE OVER THE RESPONSIBILITY OF RESCUING

 PEOPLE.    NO ONE WAS     GIVING INSTRUCTIONS ORO R D E R S , I ONLY POLICE OFFICERS

 ACTING ON THEIR OWN       IN ITATIVE AND GETTING STUCK IN.

 QS4

 IS 1HERE ANY IHiNG THAf YOU WISH        10 ADD WHICH YOU F EfcL iS VI SAL 1C) iHiS

 JUDICIAL INQUIRY?

 MY INITIAL REACTION AFTER THE MATCH, WAS TO BLAME THE OFFICER FOR OPENING

 T^pGATE,     AND LETTING THE CROWDS IN.       BUT NOW EVERYTHING HAS CALMED DOWN,

 I FEEL THE START OF THE GAME SHOULD HAVE BEEN DELAYED TO ALLOW THE CROWDS TO

 ENTER THE GROUND IN       A ORDERLY FASHION.

                       THIRTEENTH DAY'S PROCEEDINGS

                           FRIDAY, 2ND JUNE, 1989

                              (MORNING SESSION)


                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Mr. Hytner, the arrangements for
          today, as everybody will have noticed the Milk Race is
          being prepared for outside.  I understand that by some time
          after 1 o'clock we might have a great deal of noise.   What
          I propose is that we sit until the noise becomes intolerable
          or half-past-1, whichever is the soonest, and after that we
          will rise for today.

                 MR. HYTNER: And if you sir see Counsel or Solicitors
          disappearing from 12.30 onwards, it is because they h&ve come
          by car; their cars are trapped at 1 o'clock and we are
          leaving in order to avoid the trap.

                LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Well I would not imagine that
          they were going out to compete. (Laughter)

                MR. HYTNER:   Not at some of our ages anyway.

                Sir, can I just say this:  I indicated yesterday I
          just had one question for Mr. McKay.  I have since ascertained
          from Mr. Collins that he does not propose to call, unless
          absolutely necessary, any further witnesses in relation to
          what happened in the mortuary and I have therefore indicated
          to Mr. Collins, and I think Mr. McKay is awaye of this, that
          I therefore propose to put just a few questions to Mr. McKay
          in relation to those matters.

                 LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, certainly.


                        PET. SUPT. GRAHAM McKAY Recalled

                          Cross-Examined by MR. HYTNER:

        Q. Mr. McKay, can I just ask you one question about events
           outside the ground.  Your suggestion or your theory that
           some of the crowd were trying to unseat a mounted Officer.
           Do you recall that? - A. Yes, that is true.

        Q. What you saw of course was equally consistent with the crowd
           round the horse being crushed from the rear and being crushed
           into the horse? - A. No, that is not what I saw at all.
           That sort of situation existed throughout.  That sort of
           situation was inevitable under those circumstances and
           in fact I recall at least two people who complained of
           having been trodden on by the horse.

        Q. I am sorry? - A. Trodden on by horses.  The mounted Officers
           were completely engulfed in the crowd.  I am talking about
           what I perceive to be a deliberate attempt to grab hold of
           the rider and take him from the horse and the horse dancing
                                  G. MCKAY


about in fright, whether in fright having been caused by the
rider I know not.  It was just an incident amongst many.

That was just one incident among the whole? - A. One incident
amongst many.
That is very fair because other incidents clearly were happening
where as you say the horses were engulfed by the crowd, they
were inoperative in a sense where they were because they were
the victims of crushing as were the crowd there? - A. Are
you asking me if they were inoperative?

Yes.  Not "inoperative" that sounds pejorative, inoperable.
There was very little a mounted Policeman could do once he
had been engulfed by the crowd? - A. I think that is in
some respects fair comment.  More and more mounted Police^
Officers were called in an effort to deal with the situation.
The crowd had become such, and I mentioned yesterday that
this crowd consisted of mostly people,law abiding people who
wanted to get into the ground, but they were bound together
with a common objective.  They had come all the way from
various parts of the country, mainly from Liverpool, and they
wanted to get into the ground, all of them.

You are not surprised by that, are you? - A. Oh no, but what
I am saying is this:  the crowd there had become so huge,
became so unmanageable, that question of dispersal or as ng
them to wait became more and more, it became more and more
apparent that this was not going to work.  There was °nly
one place that that crowd had got to go and that was inside
the ground and as 3 o'clock neared they became more and more
impatient, frustrated, nasty and angry and a sizeable minority
were determined to go into that ground at any cost.

I don't want to continue this line of cross-examination
because you very fairly said at the outset of your evidence
that you are not an expert on crowd control, but you are
a Crimes Officer? - A. That is true, but I do pride myself
as having a modicum of conunonsense.

I was just about to say, what I am about to put to you is
commonsense, that ** you have a mass of people with forward
impetus, it is useless if pressure has grown to a particular
degree, to ask people at the front to move back because
they can't.  The only way you can relieve pressure is from
the rear forwards, you relieve the pressure from the rear
and so get the pressure off from the crowd at the front?
- A. That is one way of removing pressure.   Another way
was of course the way that was adopted and tried and
unfortunately failed.   That was by sectioning off the
crowd by closing those perimeter gates whereby some, all
of the pressure hopefully then was taken by those gates
relieving the pressure on the people crushed in towards
the turnstiles.   If that situation could have been maintained
for several minutes then pressure at the turnstiles would
undoubtedly have eased as people managed to get through

                                                    G. McKAY


               turnstiles and hopefully the flow of people through those
               main gates could have been monitored.  It did not work.
               I saw the gates burst open.

          Q. Yes, you are quite right.   One of the problems and it is
             commonsense, indeed it is one of the things that we say
             should have been done earlier, but one of the problems
             once the crowd had grown to the extent of 6 to 8,000 was
             that closing the perimeter gates merely pushed back the
             area of potential crushing and there might then have been
             crushing injuries against the perimeter gates? - A. There
             might have been.  There might well have been.  However, I
             think the area of crushing at the turnstiles from A-G
             was much smaller and much more concentrated than on those
             perimeter gates where it could be spread out over a much
             broader front and of course you had effectively cut the
             crowd in half.

          Q. I am grateful to you, Mr. McKay.  I now go on to the scenes
             in the mortuary, and I do understand, of course, that you
             were not in overall charge but since you are the only Officer
             going to give evidence on these matters, I am going to
              put some questions to you.

                       The first thing I ought to say is that the bereaved
                will be very grateful to you for your frankness yesterday
                in openly saying that there was indeed chaos in the mortuary
                and that means that I don't have to put other questions to
                you about that? - A. Can I qualify that? There was initially
                "chaos" is perhaps too strong a word.   I w o u l d not put chaos,
                but there was little degree of organisation ^nit^ “ y as
                events unfolded.   There was no time to plan for          event.
                It occurred.   We had gone to police a football match on a
                wonderful sunny day and all of a sudden this tragedy had
                occurred and instantly bodies started arriving at the gym­
                nasium.   To transform that area into a mortuary; to take
                care of all the administration, the vital administration,
                 it could not be dealt with on an ad hoc basis.

          Q. Could I just say this, Mr. McKay.   There are contingency
             plans for all sorts of things at football matches but I
             don't expect that there was a contingency plan for dealing
             with nearly 100 dead bodies? - A. This situation would come
             into the category of major incident and of course there is
             an overall major incident scheme, not a plan, a scheme,
             which lays down advice and guidelines but starts off by
             saying because the nature of such an incident can never
             be foreseen, then you cannot lay down strict guidelines
             you have to rely on initiative ....

           Q.          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  And improvisation? - A. And
                 improvisation, exactly sir.

           0           MR. HYTNER:  In any event, Mr. McKay, this part of
                 the inquiry is not the time for dealing with the possibility
                 of better contingency plans and so forth.  I merely wanted
                 to ascertain from you what you have just said?

                                       G. McKAY


           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I think, Mr. Hytner, as you were
     anxious that there should be accuracy yesterday I am also
     anxious we should not make any errors about this.

           My note, not the exact words, was that what the
     witness said yesterday was when you asked about the situation
     in the mortuary:  "I don't think we could have improved on
     what we did but it may have seemed chaotic."  So I think
     that puts just a very slightly different complexion on it.

Q.         MR. HYTNER:  Can I just ask you to deal with one or
     two of the specific complaints that I am asked to raise with
     you.

           The first is that one couple who lost their son sometime
     after midnight were still being asked to identify him.   They
     could not at first and they were later told:   "Well this must
     be your son because there is a ticket in his pocket with
     his name and address on it." When asked why they had not
     been told by telephone before they arrived in Hillsborough
     that their son was dead, they were told it was not procedure.
     Can you comment on that at all. Was it in fact as it were
     against procedure to inform people by telephone that their
     loved one had been identified as dead? - A. Well yes.   Let
     me put that into perspective.   There you have a situation
     where a man or someone, a body, has in his possession a name
     and address.  That does not necessarily mean that that is
     that person.  How wrong it would be to tell someone by tele­
     phone that their son was dead and for them to arrive and
     look at that person and say:   "That is not my son."

Q. That is your answer and it will be conveyed to the bereaved.

           The next complaint comes from more than one person and
     is very distressing and I don't propose to identify the
     bereaved in open Tribunal, but more than one of the bereaved
     has doubted that the deceased was dead at the time of supposed
     certification of death because of the state of the body when
     they saw it.

           Can I ask you this:  how soon were doctors summoned
     from the crowd to the mortuary? - A. Doctors were not
     summoned from the crowd to the mortuary to my knowledge.
     They appeared like angels.  They arrived.  I can remember
     two initially and then others.

           If I could set the scene in that mortuary.  I
     recognised, I believed I was the Senior Officer there.   I
     was certainly the Senior Detective there and I recognised
     also that my business there at that instance was to do with
     the dead bodies, nothing to do with the live bodies.   I
     recognised the difficulties that were going to be presented,
     the problems that we were going to have in terms of making
     sure that people who were classified as dead were in fact
     dead; making sure that they were properly identified; making
                                  G. McKAY


sure that their belongings were not mixed up and a host of
other problems. The scene in the gymnasium when bodies
started arriving, Police Officers shocked, white, sweating,
carrying bodies in, carrying people in on boards, on stretchers,
and arriving in such numbers.  I spoke to the Officers who
brought the first body in.  I knew that one of the Officers
had to stay with that body for questions of identification
and hopefully to prove where that body had come from.   I
was not to know at that time that that body may have been
moved several times before that Officer brought it in, but
in any event my initial reaction to it was to make sure that
there was a Police Officer with every body.  I was in civilian
clothes and as a body was brought in I grabbed a Police Officer
and said:  "I am Detective Superintendent McKay.   This body
is yours.  You are responsible throughout for that body.    Do
not leave it. Do not allow anyone else to interfere with
that body or his possessions.  Do you understand?"   By the
time I had said that other bodies were being placed down
and if you weren't smart enough they were going.   They were
very difficult to describe and I find that in describing it
 I sometimes become distressed and forgive me if I do.

    follow?            A.    Yes.

Q    Can I just ask you this, from w ha t you h a ve said.                            Was
     it ve r y w a r m i n s i d e the g y m a n s i u m ?      A.      Yes, it was.

Q.   Is there, from your own e x p e r i e n c e as a P o l i c e O f f i c e r ,
     e v e r y p o s s i b i l i t y that b o d i e s w h i c h were, in fact, dead
     would have their t e m p e r at ur es a rt if ici al ly raised because
     of the heat in the g y m n a s i u m ?                A.      I w o u l d h av e t h o u g h t

Q    M a i n t a i n e d , I am so rr y .        Maintained.             A.      I would have

      for l on g e r , yes.

Q.   That is right.             So can you g i v e s o m e r e a s s u r a n c e to t h o s e
     b e r e a v e d wh o felt t h at the b o d i e s w e r e w a r m t ha t that
     w a r m t h was not due to r e c e n t d e a t h but due to the t e m p e r a t u r e
     in the g y m n a s i u m ?     A.      Yes.      The p r i o r i t y was to m a k e

Q.   1 do not want to stop you* Hr. McKay, but what I am
     seeking is this:   that at about 20-past two, when the
     crowd was exactly as you. had expected, with the odd person
     who had been drinking, the odd incident - nothing unusual
     at all - at that stage it was apparent they were not
     coping efficiently with the crowd and the crowd was
     growing? - A.   io, you are putting words into my mouth.
     Let lie describe the scene to you. at 20-past t w o . At
     20-past two it was completely different to at any time
     during the previous year.

Q. H r . McKay, may I just remind you of the comments in your
   statement?    Page 5, sir.  You used this sentence to
   describe the crowd and the scene as you arrived at the
   Leppings Lane end some time after quarter-past two.    You
   say:

           "It was apparent the turnstiles were not coping
           efficiently with the crowd, which was swelling by the
           minute.“

     Then you go on to say:

           "Throughout the next 30 minutes or so I remained"?

     A. Yes.

Q. The point I am trying to establish is this:  that, for
   reasons that we may discover later, at a time when no one
   could be accused of arriving too late, the crowd was
   growing because the turnstiles were working inefficiently?
       A           .4   rt               4-          1 tss. as          srs, 4-

           - it was my perception t L _ -------             ... .
     working efficiently because of the pressure upon them.     I




     was that the
     pressure upon them and because^there was not room to


Q.         HI. JACKSON:   Mr. McKay, we are going to hear from
     Officers who were stopping and searching and we may have
     to consider the flows through for that reason, but that is
     at a later stage.   The final matter I want to ask then is
     this:   when you saw Gate C eventually opened, it was at a
                                                                     G. McKAY



tine, was it not, when there was no pressure at all being
put upon it by the fans? - A. Yes.

Bid you., therefore, feel some surprise when you heard
later that the gate had been forced? - A. Yes, until
yesterday I was not convinced that that gate had been
forced.

Again, if it is only yesterday, we do not need to pursue
it,   I a* just content to hear your evidence that at the
tine the gate was opened, no crowd was near it? - A. It
was not under pressure.-  There were plenty of people
there.   Can 1 say that 1 Has not at the gate continually.

     LQSB JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Just give me a moment, will
you?  Are you. drawing my attention, on page 8, to
somewhere where the witness says that he thought the gate
had been forced?

     11. JACKSON:     ' No, quite the reverse, sir. I asked
him, first of a l l , would he confirm that at the time the
gate was opened he could say that it was not under
pressure.  Then I asked him did he, therefore, feel some
surprise if he heard later the gate had been forced.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYL01:   I think you put it as when he
heard later.  That is what I am looking at.

     MR. JACKSON:   It now appears that the when was
yesterday and, therefore, I did not pursue it.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:      Yes,       thank you.

     Ml.    JACKSON:   I remind you of your statement,                Mr.
McKay.     It says:

     "I should say at this point that these gates had

     recognised that there was no probabi lity of enter-'--
 ■   through that g a t e . “

It rather,                                                        aple we
                                                                         that
it be opened because of their                                       q u a 1 i fy
that?

but certainly most of my time was spent in that area,
exactly because it was not under pressure.      I had no
desire, in c i v i 1ian clothes, to be mixed in with that
throng.  When the gate was finally opened, there was no

             mad rush down there initially.  There was just a trickle
             of people for the first 30 or 40 seconds.  That trickle of
             people increased as people realised that there was going
             to be entry from that gate and people were brought under
             the barrier from where the pressure was greatest on the
             turnstiles and fed through that gate.

        Q. When you say "brought", by the Police? - A. Yes,
           encouraged to come that way, to relieve that pressure.

        Q. Can I assist by asking you to confirm the impression you
           want to create is that there was never any perception -
           perhaps it is an unfortunate phrase at this Tribunal - you
           never had the feeling that there was a deliberate attempt
           to force that gate? - A. Can I take the impression I want
           to create?  I do not like that.   I am here to tell the
           truth, good or bad.  Most of the time at that gate, I did
           not see that gate under any severe pressure.   I saw it
           opened several times to allow injured people in.   There
           was a child carried in there.   There was one of these men
           who had been trodden on by a horse.   There was someone
           else who looked to be on the point of collapse.   That
           would not have been possible if that gate had been under
           the sort of pressure as Gate 2 had been continually under,
           but there were a lot of people standing round and I
           wondered at the time whether they were frightened to join
           that severe crush - and that would be understandable -
           whether they were waiting for people, or whether, in fact,
           they were opportunists, but the gate itself was not under
           pressure, in my sight.

                  ME. MAXWELL:   No questions, thank you.

        Q.        MR. KALLIPETIS:    Mr. McKay, can you help me, please,
             about two matters.   You were in the gymnasium area after
             the match had started, I think.   Is that right? You had
             walked along the front of the pitch by the Kop end? - A.
             That is correct, yes.

        Q. And you saw an ambulance there, just parked to the
           right-hand side, under the Kop Stand, did you? - A. I do
           not know.  It does not ring a bell, I am sorry.  It might
           well have been.  I am not saying it was not.

        Q. I understand, Mr. McKay.  At some stage you introduced
           Deputy Chief Ambulance Officer Hobkins to Mr. Addis? - A.
           That is right.

        Q. I think that was sometime about four o ’clock. Would that
           be about right? - A. i would have thought so, yes.

        Q. And, prior to that, you had contacted Mr. Addis yourself
                                                                                                                     G.        McKAY   ;



   at about 3.15? - ft. Yes.

Q. That was from the Police room underneath the North Stand?
   - A. Yes.

Q. Did M r . Addis say anything to you during that telephone
   call, that he was looking for an Ambulance Officer or
   senior Ambulance Officer? - A. lo, we had not reached that
   stage.    le did not know shat had happened.  The
   information that I had got Has from a Detective Sergeant
   who was returning from the area of the fence.

Q. That is Mr. Linley? - A. Sergeant Linley, and he called
   out to me - I was going over to the fence - he called out
   to me, "There is about 20 dead in t h e r e . " I was very
   reluctant to believe that.  I had hoped it was an
   exaggeration and certainly when I spoke to Mr. Addis I did
   not tell him that there were 20 dead.       I said that there
   were casualties and there might Hell be deaths.       I do not
   remember the question of ambulances being discussed
   between myself and Mr. Addis and certainly I would have
   expected that side of the operation to be undertaken by

                                                    G .'McKAY


Q. I understand, Mr. McKay.  When you spoke to Mr, Addis he was
   then in the Police control box, was he? - A. Oh, no, Mr. Addis
   was at Police Headquarters I n town.

G. In town? - A. Oh, yes,

Q. To assist with the anxieties that relatives may have, Mr.
   McKay, can you help me with this, too.  In addition to there
   being a medical team in the gymnasium who were staking sure
   those who ware classified as dead were dead, prior to them
   being brought into the gymnasium I think all the casualties
   were assessed outside in the assembly area where the vehicles
   were parked and the ambulances were then taking casualties to
   the hospital.  Can you assist on that? - A, I an afraid I
   can't.  Initially people were also being brought into the
   gymnasium and were being directed to the far end of the


G. Thank y o u , Mr. McK a y .

                     Cross-Examined by MR. WOODWARD:

Q.    Mr. McKay, in relation to the events afterwards, if 1 may deal
      with that shortly.  Is your evidence this, that when
      matters were arranged in the gymnasium then, in effect the
      presumption was that people were alive and the endeavour
      was strenuously to ensure that was the .case? - A. I am not
      sure I understand th at.

Q.    Mr. Hytner asked you about a priority.    You follow? - A ,   Yes,

G. And you spoke of individuals who were notwithstanding your
   observation of the plight of the victim that their efforts and
   endeavours were to achieve life or not to give up? - A. Y e s .

Q.     And is that the picture one should have, that it was not a
       picture of giving up on the individuals that had been brought
       in but the endeavour was-despite all odds to strive for life?
       - A. Y e s . I am not sure whether this is the place to relate
       this story, but it perhaps demonstrates somewhat. There was a
       Police Officer w h o .brought in a 12 year old b o y , made   •••
       strenuous efforts to revive that chi ld, wouldn"t
       leave the child, kept going back to him, hour after
       ho u r , trying to revive that child,, and finally..had to ..
       be taken away from that child.     That perhaps
       illustrates the concern that was felt in relation to
     . all of those victims.

Q.    Is that typical of the endeavours and attitudes? - A . That is
      perhaps not typical» but it certainly demonstrates the
      atmosphere that was in there, y e s . No-one gave up on anyone.

G.    I think you said in relation to deceased, you ensured that an
      Officer had the responsibility for and was with the body? - A .
      Yes.

G. May I ask you n o w , and turn the clock back a little, please,

         to 1988.  You have told the Inquiry I think you are not an
         expert in crowd control? - A. True.

    Q. So you can only talk of your experience and what you observed?
       - A . Yes.

    Q.   But in 1988 the Police operation that you observed at Leppings
         Lane, did it appear to you to be well organised? - A. Yes.     It
         was a good event.  It was a very successful operation.     There
         was just one incident of wounding.  There were comparatively
         few arrests.  The crowd were well behaved, and it was in a way
         a rehearsal for this year's Semi-Final.  This ye a r ’s Semi-
         Final should have been so much better.

    Q. Did there appear to you in 1988 to be any deficiencies in
       the planning or the execution of the Police work at the
       Leppings Lane end? - A. None.   If there had been obviously
       that would have been taken care of this time.   No-one likes
       trouble.  No-one likes disorder.

    Q.    Would it be right in the period following 1988 in the year
         that then went you had the opportunity and people had the
         opportunity to speak to you and to discuss the policing and
         what had happened at the Semi-Final? - A. Yes.      I don't want
         to be accused of being facetious, but perhaps it is pertinent
         that prior to this dreadful tragedy no-one, fans, press and if
         I may say s o , lawyers, no-one cam to us and sa i d , ''You have
         got this wrong.    This is how it should be next time", but of
         course there have been plenty of such remarks since.

    Q. You were, I think, involved, and this was only touched upon in
       your evidence yesterday, in the advanced preparation and the
       giving of advice to people who might be intending to come? -
       A. That is true.

    Q. You were involved, were you in communications with the radio?
       - A. I took part in a radio 'phone-in programme about noon on
       the Friday with Radio Merseyside.  The main thrust of that
       conversation with the presenter of the programme was in
       relation to pickpockets and vehicle thefts, but
       certainly I emphasised that people who had not got
       tickets should not come.

    Q. Was that not the only theme but a fairly constant theme of the
       communications? - A. Yes.

    Q.   And advance advice that was being given to those who might      be
         thinking of coming to the game? - A.  Yes.

    Q.   Not to come unless they had tickets. To stay away, in   other
         words? - A . Y e s .

    Q. I think the same was done for Notts Forest? - A. Oh, yes, I
       spoke to Nottingham Radio.

    Q. May I come now to what you saw at the Leppings Lane end.  Of
       course, you did not spend all your time at that point? - A.
                          16



                                                 G. McKAY


  No.

Q. You had to concern yourself with the Forest end as well? - A.
   No, that is not quite accurate.  I had intended spending all
   of my time at that point with a pickpocket squad.   We were
   determined to catch some pickpockets, and that was the
   obvious place to catch them.  There was another such squad
   at the Nottingham Forest end, but I having been at Leppings
   Lane the year before I determined that is where I was going
   to be this year.  When the crowd started swelling in such
   numbers and all the Police Officers on foot were engulfed in
   the crowd, I walked down to the other barrier where there
   was a serial, and I saw Sergeant Hodgett there, and I asked
   him to post an Officer in view of us on gate C in order that
   he could respond with Officers on foot should the need
   arise.  At that stage I was becoming concerned.   As the
   minutes wore on it became apparent that Officers on foot
   were going to be no use at all, if the situation got worse.

Q. You have spoken of going down the side road.  That was down
   the side road by the Don you went, was it? - A. Yes, this
   service road, which was maintained as a sterile area.

Q. In your account of the openings of gate C - it has been called
   gate C;  you may not have known of that;  that is the side
   gate by the River Don - you spoke of it being opened on a
   number of occasions to allow injured people in, people to
   go in and out, but only individuals or one or two? - A.
   Yes.

Q. And then you speak of an opening shortly before 3 o'clock? -
   A . Yes.

Q. When a number of people went through.  Did you see another
   opening when a number of individuals went through? - A. No.

Q. You did not observe an opening of gate C on which occasion a
   number of fans went through? - A. No.

Q. Apart from the ones you described? - A. No.

Q. The crowd that was at the Leppings Lane turnstiles, of
   course, extended out to the perimeter gate and was being
   joined by people coming over the bridge and from
   Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, it extended out of my sight.  I
   am not sure how far it went.

Q. You have spoken of Police Officers being there.  Were Police
   Officers directing their attention only to people at thefront?
   - A. I can't say.  The crowd was so dense it wasdifficult  to
   see anywhere except in the area where you were.

Q. Did you hear messages coming over the Tannoy, the loudspeaker
   system, from Mr. Ryan? - A. Yes.

Q. At what stage did you hear that? Do you remember? - A. I
   heard it on more than one occasion, and I can't honestly
1




                                 17



                                                        G. McKAY


         remember at what stage.  Certainly the messages became more
         and more urgent as time progressed, and he was still
         broadcasting until shortly before the gates were opened,
         exhorting people not to push.

    Q. These were messages coming over the public address system? -
       A . Yes.

    Q. How do you know it was Mr. Ryan? - A. He used to work for me
       at one time.

    Q.   You recognised his voice, did you? - A. Yes.

    Q.   And those were a number of messages and exhortations.   What
         was the message? - A. I can't remember the exact words.

    Q.   The drift of it? - A. The drift of it was, "Please don't push.
         Stop pushing.   People are being injured at the front.  Plenty
         of room inside.   You will all get in eventually".

    Q. Did you observe those messages having any effect? - A. They
       d i d n ’t have any effect. No noticeable effect that I could see
       at that end of the crowd.

    Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    The trouble is, I suppose, when
         you have a great crush of people, a lot of people, whether it
         is outside the turnstiles or in the pen, to say, "Move back"
         or "Don't push", it is very difficult to expect them to react
         to that, is not it? If you have got a company of soldiers on
         a parade ground you can say, "One step backwards, march” , and
         they will all do it together, but if you have got people
         really touching each other all the way and jostling, it is
         very difficult to see how they are going to react and go
         backwards, is not it? - A. The remarks I presume were
         addressed at the people who were in fact pushing.   There were
         people pushing.  The remarks were addressed to the people
         pushing, telling them to stop pushing.

    Q. When you say "pushing", what were they doing? Trying to
       squeeze themselves through the crowd to get further up or
       what? - A. There were plenty of queue jumpers, people fighting
       their way through and fighting under the barrier into the area
       near the turnstiles, plenty of those, but the main thrust of
       the pressure was coming through those big gates. I can only
       presume, because I didn't see it, I can only presume the
       crowd outside there were pushing to get in, were impatient
       to get in and were pushing.

    Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   The purpose of the message was to reach
         which people? - A. The people who were pushing.

    Q.   The ones at the back? - A. Yes.

    Q.   Where it starts? - A. That is right.

    Q. Obviously it is common sense that the individuals at the front
       are powerless unless the pressure is relieved.  - A. It was to
                             18



                                                     G. McKAY


     help the people at the front that the message was given out.

Q. So did you observe any relief come to those at the front? - A.
   None.

Q.    Did you perceive any letting off by those at     the back? - A. I
     did not perceive any, no.

Q. Apart from the Tannoy messages did you observe, for example,
   amongst Officers Mr. Purdy? - A. yes.

Q.   What did you see Mr. Purdy trying to do tocause  those at
     the front to be relieved by those further back giving off?
     - A. Mr. Purdy at one stage stood precariously balanced on
     the barrier with his back to the wall shouting to to the
     people towards the back of the crowd to stop pushing.

Q. Did that appear to bring any relief? - A. It did not.        It did
   not bring any.

Q. Are you aware of the Police Land Rover coming along? - A. Not
   at all.

Q. Did you observe any of the mounted Officers in their elevated
   position trying to secure those who were pushing that
   they should desist and give over? - A. It was difficult for me
   to see the mounted Officers and what they were actually doing
   once they had gone into the crowd and were engulfed in the
   crowd.  Certainly a number of them were in the area of the
   gates, the perimeter gates, what I refer to as the wrought
   iron gates.   But I can't comment as to what they were
   actually doing.




                             /Q. My Lord, Lord Justice Taylor.
                                     G. McKAY



Q. My Lord, Lord Justice Taylor has asked you about not simply
   the people at the back pushing but others coming in and
   thrusting themselves into that press.  Do you follow? — A.
   Yes.

Q. What were peopl* doing? How were they coming in? What was
   their manner to get into the crowd already embarrassed?
   - A. Pushing through; ducking under and thrusting themselves
   in.

Q. Did there appear to you to be any reason why they should
   not have observed and heeded these messages? - A. I could
   hear what was being said at the front.  I can't comment
   as to whether they could hear at the back, I am sorry.

Q. Are you saying that notwithstanding the obvious press
   of people at the turnstiles there was still fans coming
   in and thrusting themselves into that throng? - A. Yes.

Q. There seems in your evidence to be a description of a
   singular determination by a sizeable number of people?
   - a . There was, but that makes it sound as though they
   were acting in league with each other.   I don?t think that
   was the case.   There was a determination, a desperation
   to get into the ground by a sizeable number of people who
   were going to get in at any cost.

Q. At any cost? - A. That is what it appeared to be to me.

Q. I am not sure that you gave evidence about it yesterday,
   but is it right that apart from this behaviour, this
   selfishness, this pushing, the crowd was also, or there
   were individuals in the crowd, who were throwing things?
   - A. There were one or two missiles thrown.  By and large
   I would have thought it would be very difficult for anyone
   actually in the press to get their arm up and throw an
   object but there were missiles thrown.  The one that
   stands out in my memory is the one I described yesterday,
   my Lord, with this can with drink spilling from it which
   struck a mounted Police Officer.

Q. Was there surging from the back? - A. Constantly.

Q. There may be a difference between people coming along and
   finding that those who are ahead of them had to stop and
   coming up close behind them.  Do you follow? - A. Yes.

Q. Perhaps getting more close than for comfort? - A. Yes.

Q. Did you see that happening? - A. No, I was not in a position
   to see people arriving.

 Q. But apart from that, those who might be getting closer than
    they would want to, did you observe surging, some pressing,
                                  G. McKAY


Some deliberate or positive pressing on? - A. Yes, there was,
but I think you have to understand that there really was not
any room for any more surging in that area behind the barrier.
They were crammed in like sardines.

But in the area from outside the barrier? - A. They were
surging there.

So even outside the Leppings Lane gates there were people
who were surging in? - A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLORs  I think you said a moment ago
you were not in a position to see people arriving when
Mr. Woodward was asking you about how they were behaving
at the back.  What you were seeing when you described this
thrusting and pushing was fairly well up the throng, was
it? - A. In the area of the gates.

What I am wondering about is this;   you have said a determination
to get in at any cost.   May it have been that the people at
the comparatively short distance back that you could see, not
being able to see right to the back, were themselves so
squashed that they were becoming panicky and desperate because
of that? - A. Yes.When I spoke of these people who    were
determined to get in at any cost, I am talking about the
peoples who forced their way forward, went under the barrier,
climbed over the gates and climbed on to the walls in numbers,
those types of people.

     MR. WOODWARD: You mentioned the   gates. Could you see
the blue gates? - A.    Yes, I could see the top, part of them,
yes.
You could see people in that vicinity although not necessarily
the whole of them? - A. Yes.

Was there surging at the gates and beyond the gates? - A. Yes,
at one stage I walked into that area and got into the crowd,
frightened myself and came straight back out again and I
had to fight my way out of it.

Did you see those gates closed at some point? - A. Yes, they
were.
And did you see how they came to be opened again? - A. They
were forced open by the pressure of people on the outside.

Did you see the line of horses across? - A. I could see
horses in that vicinity.

 Was that at the time when the gates were forced open again?
 - A. Yes.
 So despite the closing of the gates, despite the presence
 of the horses and despite the obvious throng ahead of
 them, people forced those gates open? - A. The gates were
 forced open by pressure from people outside. I think it
                                       G. McKAY



  might well be that the gates were forced open by pressure
  from people who could not even see the gates.  I am not
  suggesting that the people who were directly at the gates
  were responsible for forcing those gates.

Q. They might have found themselves in the same position as
   those who were up by the turnstiles? - A. Exactly.

        MR. WOODWARD:     Thank you sir.


                   Re-Examined by MR. COLLINS:

Q. Mr. McKay just I think one matter arising out of this scene
   that you have described.

         Was it your impression that the determination to get
   in at any cost increased as kick-off drew near? - A. Yes.

Q. So would you link it with the imminence of the kick-off?
   - A. Yes.  The determination to get in, the impatience to
   get in.

Q. Indeed. - A. The frustration of not being able to get in.
   I am sure that most of those people there had tickets.

Q. You said that at the beginning of your evidence. - A. Imagine
   having travelled all the way from Liverpool and getting
   caught up in a crush like that having expected to be able
   to walk into the ground and finding this.  Yes, I can under­
   stand that frustration on the part of the large majority
   of the people there.

Q. Did the possibility of persuading someone to think in terms
   of postponing kick-off cross your mind at any stage? - A.
   No, I would not have attempted to persuade anyone.

Q. It was not I know your function at all? - A. Just as I
   would not try and persuade a mechanic how to repair my
   car. There were Officers in charge of policing arrangements,
   public order arrangements who had see service during the
   miners' strike for instance; had certainly attended at
   football matches week in week out.  I was a comparative
   newcomer.  I don't attend football matches and it might
   well have been that my perception at that time was completely
   wrong but nevertheless I was frightened and to me it appeared
   to be that the only course of action was to open those gates.

         MR. COLLINS:    Yes, I am obliged.


                        Bv LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Q. Just one question, Mr. McKay on what you were just asked
   about the possibility of postponing kick-off.
                                       G. McKAY


           I notice that you say in your statement that you heard
     a roar from the crowd inside the ground and assumed that the
     players were out or that the match had commenced.   You went
     on:  "This surprised me having thought that the game was
     going to be delayed".   What led you to think that? - A.
     I had radio communications on Channel 19 which was devoted
     to Detectives.  Channel 25 was devoted to uniformed Officers.
     I was in the vicinity of uniformed Officers and could hear
     occasionally messages on their radio.   I heard a uniformed
     Officer, not a radio message, say that the kick-off was going
     to be delayed and assumed from that that he had heard a
     message over the radio.   Certainly I did not hear such a
     message and I presumed that no such message was ever sent,
     but I had thought at that time that the kick-off was going
     to be delayed.

Q. The uniformed Officer that you heard say that, was he saying
   it to the crowd or was he saying it to you or was he just
   saying it to a colleague or what? - A. He was saying it to
   a colleague in conversation yes, at this light portable
   barrier.  I was standing there.  There were five or six
   Police Officers at that barrier.

Q. That is the barrier that was shutting off the road to the
   South Stand, is it? - A. That is right.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Yes, thank you very much.


                  INSPECTOR PAUL HAND-DAVIS Called
                      Examined by MR. PHILLIPS:

Q.   Are you Paul Hand-Davis? - A. I am sir.

Q.   And    Inspector of the South Yorkshire Police in   charge of
     the mounted section which is based I think at Cudworth at
     Barnsley? - A. Yes, we have two stables, one at Sheffield
     and one at Barnsley.

Q.   You were in charge of the mounted operation on the day of
     this match on the 15th of April, were you not? - A. I was
     sir, yes.

Q. You had some considerable experience of mounted Police work.
   Is that right? - A. Yes.  I joined the mounted Police in
   1978 in my former Force, the West Yorkshire Police.  I was
   promoted four years later to Bradford.  I was present at
   the Bradford City fire.  I have policed in every County in
   Yorkshire; at every ground in Yorkshire; and both of the
   football grounds in Derbyshire.  I police every Saturday
   of every football season of grounds up and down the County
   and I have done so over the last eleven years.

Q. When did you become in charge of the mounted section at
   Sheffield? - A. 1986, October.
                                  P. HAND-DAVIS


So you had previous experience of the semi-final in 1988
and you say all other football matches during the season?
- A. Yes, I have policed both semi-finals at Hillsborough.

In the period when you were policing as a mounted Commander
over the last few years, have you noticed any change, any
tendency of fans to come later? - A. Yes, the last couple
of years there has been a tendency for people to come much
later to grounds, yes.

In 1988 when the same event occurred between the same two
teams did you have any problem with late-comers coming to
the ground? - A. No and likewise the 1987 final, my plans
were drawn up for our mutual aid horses, our assistants
from other Forces to have a meal at the quarter-to stage,
quarter-to-3 in the 1988 final and quarter-to-12 my Lord
for the 1981 final which was a 12 noon kick-off.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: When you said you had been at
both semi-finals, you meant both semi-finals 1987 and 1988
before this one, did you? - A. Yes, my Lord.  This was my
third.

      MR. PHILLIPS:  You say you had included plans for
taking meals at quarter-to-3 or a quarter-to-12 in the
case of 1987, on what basis? Was that because you expected
not to be required from that point onwards? - A. I knew
we would not be required from that point onwards, sir,
because of previous experience, not only mine at the previous
two semi-finals but all my Officers' experience.  I mean you
must bear in mind that I draw up on the experience of my
Officers junior in rank to me and that is normal for a semi­
final that by quarter-to-3 we can stand down and go back
to base.

When you were considering your plans and movements for the
1989 semi-final did you include that kind of provision
or did you see any reason to alter it? - A. I had notified
the catering people that we were going to be coming back,
some of our people, not all of thein, but about a dozen
Officers would be coming back for a meal at quarter-to.
That is what I was anticipating.

So you were expecting the same sort of thing this year as
well? - A. Yes.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Just help a moment.  I quite
understand that may be you are going to tell- us you didn't
expect the numbers you got this time, but you say that by
2.45 you can normally stand down all the mounted Officers?
- A. No sir, I did say that a dozen,.provision had been
made for our foreign Force colleagues who were assisting
us, that something like a dozen of them would be stood
down on my notification.   That of course would be based
upon what was happening at the time, but I was certainly
                                  P. HAND-DAVIS


expecting that by quarter-to-3, as in previous years, many
previous occasions at the Hillsborough semi-final, we could
start to stand down our mounted m m by that time.  Certainly
this year at quarter-to*?3 on Penistone Road things were
in that sort of a state.

                                               P. HAND-DAVIS



Were more people coming along as this progressed? - A.
Yes, it just continued all the time, the pushing and
shoving.

How long did this go on for before you took some further
steps? - A. Well, I stayed there all the time and I
thought I could perhaps be of assistance in terms of the
crushing, and I am sure that the two Officers who were
behind me - I was at the front of them.  I probably was
near the perimeter gates.  I certainly ended up there.   I
know that they were behind me and the three of us were
working together in this attempt.

Can you tell us how your horse was coping with this
situation? - A. The horse initially,  as      he always is - it
is not my horse, by the way.  I jump on anything that is
available, but he is a good horse, Hussar, the one I chose
for the day, a big, powerful horse, a marvellous crowd
control horse, and he was clearly in a situation in the A
to G compound that he had never faced before.

What was happening to him? - A. I think I described it as
the crowd wrapping themselves around me and around the
horse like cellophane or cling film.  I have never
experienced that before.

Was it able to move or to keep its footing?    - A. No,
eventually the animal becomes immobile.   He   cannot move a
leg or a muscle.  I could not believe it.

You have never been in that situation with it before? - A.
I have been in an awful lot of crowd control situations,
my Lord, but I have never been in one like that.

You say in your statement that he was lifted by the crowd.
Is that, in fact, right? - A. I have heard it said that
this could be done in a crowd control situation.  I have
never experienced it until then, but I now know that that
is correct.  One hears it from old-time mounted men, but I
now know that it is possible.

This horse of yours....

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  Sorry, I would like to
understand what exactly happens or happened.? - A.  The
horse literally started to sway and you could tell his
feet were not on the ground, my Lord.  The crush was such
that he was lifted, certainly at the front end that I
felt.

What I am not following is was this a group of people
deliberately trying to lift him or people just pressed in
so close that they involuntarily lifted him or what? - A.
Oh, yes, it is involuntary, my Lord.
                                               P. HAND-DAVIS




It was involuntary? - A, Oh, yes,   it is the throng that
lifts him,

     MB. PHILLIPS:   And I think your horse weighs what -
half a ton? - A. That is a conservative estimate.
Anything between a half and three-quarters.  I have not
weighed him for some time, but we do weigh them.

Well now, when this happened, you got moved, I think, did
not you, from the original position you had been in? - A.
I said I was working near to the perimeter gates and the
stanchion I talk about in my statement, being pressed up
against a stanchion on the left, must be that perimeter
gate.

You were pressed against a stanchion and trapped, I think.
That was the expression you use.  Is that right? - A. Yes,
I could not move a leg or a muscle myself.

What was your great concern at that time? - A. I was very
concerned that the horse, who is only an animal, after
all, was going to react.  Now, had he kicked, reared,
moved, jumped, there was going to be some dreadful crowd
scenes in there, some injuries.  The situation was
definitely getting untenable in that pen and, because my
pleas, and Mr. Stanbridge’s and Mr. Grunnell’s, had been
unheeded - and we had tried for a long time, sir - 10 or
15 minutes, I am sure - I decided the only thing to do was
to now come out and try and work this crowd from behind,
from the rear.

We heard from Superintendent Murray that at some stage,
and I think it would be about this stage, that you made a
request to Ground Control for further mounted Officers.
Is that right? - A. Yes, I was not aware of the time, but
I think it is 1440, something like that.

Yes, that is right.

     LOBD JUSTICE TAYLOB:   1440 that you tried to come
out? - A. No, 1440 I asked for assistance, my Lord.

     MB. PHILLIPS:   And that was assistance which came to
you from Sergeant Sorsby, who had been at the South Stand
car park end? - A. The initial assistance came from the
South Stand car park horses that we have spoken about -
the four initially - and eventually most of the Penistone
Boad horses came up, but at a much later stage.

Were you conscious of those other horses and riders coming
to your aid? - A. No, the 1440 request for assistance was
a general request for assistance - foot and mounted - and
I got involved in other things and I never really saw the
                                              P. HAND-DAVIS



assistance arrive.

Now, you say then that you decided to come out of the pen
and see if you could do something else.  What was your
object in coming out? - A. As stated, sir, that all our
desperate attempts in the A to G pen had failed and, as
has already been stated, the thing to do was to come and
work them from behind and, at least, stop any more
pressure into that enclosure or pen.

What about the two Liverpool Officers, Hr. Stanbridge and
Mr. Grunnell? Did they follow suit? - A. I do not think
they came out immediately, but possibly a couple of
minutes later they came and joined me at the rear of the
pen.

And did you, at this stage, see one of your own Officers,
Constable Scott? - A. He was in that vicinity at that
time.

And what did you try to do then? - A. Initially on coming
out of the pen, we tried a sideways-on maneouvre to stop
any more people coming in, but the crowd was spilling all
around us and Mr. Marshall’s grains of sand is quite
graphic.   It was like that.  You know, people were all
around you.   It was a hopeless attempt to try and stop it
in that respect.

What about the gates? We know there are these wrought
iron gates on the outside of the enclosure before the
turnstile, the perimeter gates? - A. That is why we
decided upon that tactic, that the gates were there.  They
were a barrier to use - a good barrier - and that was the
next attempt to try and hold the line there.

Did you get any of those gates closed? - A. Yes, we
succeeded twice.  On two occasions.

Let us look at the first occasion first, can we? Will
you please look at the model? Which of the gates did you
manage to close? - A. As far as I am aware, it is the
on e ....

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   It is a bit difficult to point
to them on the model, is it? You had better look at the
photographs of West Midlands 1? - A. The Usher has got it,
my Lord.

Has he? - A. Yes, that is the one we succeeded in closing.
(The Usher pointed on the model.)

The one closest the dividing wall?   Is that it?

     Ml. PHILLIPS:   Look at West Midlands 1 photographs,
                                              P. HAND-DAVIS



will you, please? There is a bundle there.   Photograph 3
shows, I think, nearly all the gates.  Well, 3 and 4
together show the gates.  Can you point out which of those
gates it was? - A. Which picture, sir? No. 3?

3 and 4 show you the range of gates right the way across?
- A. Yes, turn to picture 4 and we succeeded in shutting,
as far as I am aware, the No Through load sign, the gates
on the left and right of that.

The gates to the left and to the right? - A. As far as I
am aware.

     L01D JUSTICE TAYL01:    Well,is that all the gates
then to the right of the dividing  fence? - A. I
deliberately left out the third option on the extreme
right because I am not sure, my Lord.   It would have been
desirable obviously to shut that, but I am not sure.   Our
efforts were certainly on the two gates I have described.

     Ml. PHILLIPS:    Both are double gates, in fact, are
they? You shut both halves of the double gates? - A.
Yes, as far as I am aware.

But you are not sure aboutthe one nearest   to the river,
the very far right-hand side? - A. No.

Now, what happened when, on the first occasion, you got
those gates closed? - A. They were forced open almost
within a minute or two.

Was there any time for the closure of those gates to have
had any effect on the crowd on the inside of them? - A.
No.

What sort of mood was the crowd in at this time, at this
stage? - A. I hesitate to say aggressive.   That is unfair.
They were not aggressive.  We had just shifted up a place
from the carnival atmosphere to a desperate attempt to get
into the ground, but not an ugly mood.   An unco-operative
mood.

Unco-operative? - A. Extremely unco-operative.

When you had had the gates closed, where had the horses
been? - A. It is difficult to remember, but I now know,
and I think on the photographs it shows it, they were on
both sides of the gates.

Now, you made a second attempt to close these gates.   is
that right? - A. Yes.

     L01D JUSTICE TAYL01:   Sorry, when you say both
sides, do you mean laterally or horse inside, horse
                                               P. HAND-DAVIS



outside? - A. There was a horse on the road side and on
the enclosed side, as far I am aware.  There is one
instance where a mounted man has his hand on the gate. It
is not me.  I do not know which one it was.   He has
actually got his hand on the gate holding it.

     MR. PHILLIPS:    Yes.   Holding it closed? - A. Yes,
indeed.

In Composite Album 1, Inspector, you will find some
pictures towards the end.  MWL10.   That is later on,   in
fact, at 1453? - A. Sorry, what number, sir?

MWL10/29A and following, we see some pictures very much
later on, with Officers on this side of the gate - do you
see - and the gates appearing to be closed, as far as one
can tell? - A. The Officer immediately in front is a
Nottingham Officer - a Nottingham Sergeant - so that means
that some of the Penistone Road detail had come up to
assist us.

They have come up from the rear at that time? - A. It
looks to me, sir, as you say, that some of the gates are,
in fact, shut at that time.

And the very next picture shows clearly the gates open.
That is 30A? - A. I can only see to the left of the
picture where the gate would be open.

Well, there we are. So you tried again to get them closed
and how many horses did you use on this second occasion to
close the gates? - A. No idea.

Did you get them closed for any appreciable length of time
on the second occasion? - A. No, it is the same again.
They are forced open more or less as soon as we have
closed them.  At one time, whether it is the first or th<e
second occasion, there is quite a bulky Sergeant - I hope
he will not mind me saying that - swinging on it as it is
forced open in his desperate attempt to assist us.   I do
not know if that is the first or the second time.

Did you get yourself and other Officers into a line in
front of the gates, on the road side of the gates? - A.
That is our last attempt to hold back the crowd.

Perhaps you   can tell us about that, if you will.  Can you
give us any   idea what sort of time this would have been? -
A.  I think   it must be at about 1450 when that is
attempted.    I cannot be precise.   I am sorry.

Had you, at that stage, been aware of Gate C being opened?
- A. No, I am not aware of that at that time.
                                               P. HAND-DAVIS



 When you got your horses into a line on the third attempt,
 as you put it, did you get the gates closed behind you? -
 A.  I think Officers were attempting that and I think the
 photos actually show that.  I was not aware.
 Communications were practically impossible.   My own
 Sergeant was shouting at me from five yards away and I
 would not hear him.  Remember all the communications
 difficulties that were spoken about.  We obviously wear
 crash helmets, which adds to our problems.   So I was
 desperately trying to form this line-up from the sweet
 shop to the bridge.  That was difficult to accomplish and
 I really was not looking too much towards the gates at
 that time, but I think mounted Officers were trying to
 shut those at the same time again and it may well be this
 detail that has come up from Penistone Road.

 You were then attempting to form a complete line from one
 side to the other.  How far did you succeed in that? - A.
 That started to work and I was pleased with it.

Did it, in fact, have any effect on the crowds on the
turnstile side of the perimeter fence? - A. Not
appreciably, but I was looking left and right and I was
happy that we had started to produce something that was
working and that there seemed to be some small thing
occurring.  Nothing great, but it was succeeding.

 Did you notice any reduction in the amount of people on
 the ground side of the perimeter fence? - A. I did say a
 small, appreciable amount, but not a great amount.

How long did you hold this position for? - A. That again
lasts for about two or three minutes and by this time we
have about 5 or 600 on our left still coming towards the
ground and we had them contained.

 ''And then what happened to bring that to an end? - A. An
  amazing scene, sir, one I have never experienced, where
  fans start throwing themselves under the bellies of the
  horses in a desperate attempt to get to the other side of
  us.   I have never seen that before.  I remember a man
  stepping back as if he was diving into a swimming pool and
  throwing himself under a horse in front of me.   Now, that
  is an extremely dangerous thing to do.    People were
  forcing themselves between the horses, hitting the horses,
  grabbing the reins.   You see, the weak point is always the
  back of the horse in front of you when you are at the head
  of the horse and there is a small gap that a person can
  duck under.   They were using that as the weak point to get
  through there as well, but this diving under bellies, I
^.have never seen that before.

iWhat sort of state were these people in? - A. I think you
l e a n imagine, sir, they were in a pretty desperate state.
                                               P. HAND-DAVIS




       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You took it to be desperation
  to get in rather than malice or drink or what? - A. I
4 think malice can be discounted, sir, but I think that
\drink and desperation must certainly be a fact.

      HR. PHILLIPS:   Did you become aware of the landrover
 with Constable Buxton in it? - A. Yes, he appears at about
 the time that we were trying this tactic at about the same
 point.  He is not far from me.

 So, while you are holding back the people at the gate, he
 is there with the landrover? - A. That is correct, sir.

 And did you hear any announcements from the landrover? -
 A.  Yes, this was the first communication that I really
 picked up because of the difficulties with the crowd
 noise, the helmet I was wearing and the communication
 difficulties, but I could hear him saying over the
 landrover, "Liverpool fans, stop pushing," and repeating
pthat all the time. "Liverpool fans, stop pushing."

 The announcement had no effect then? - A. No, it was
 similar to our earlier pleas.  They were ignoring it.

 Were there still people coming up the lane? - A. Yes, the
 photos show it clearly and the video shows it clearly.  My
 perceptions on the day were clearly that people were still
 coming in droves.

 Had you expected them to be coming at that particular
 time? We are now at 10-to three, are not we? - A. Not if
 I was planning to give people a meal at quarter-to three,
 sir, no.

 Did you notice anything particular about somebody over at
 Gate A by the corner of the sweet shop? - A. Yes, a
 supporter comes up to me and says that there is an injured
 woman at Gate A.

 What did you do about it? - A. I wanted to do something
 about it, but there was no way I could have got to her.      I
 knew instantly that there was no way I could get to her.

 What was the next thing that happened, so far as you are
 aware? - A. Almost instantly after that supporter speaking
 to me, I see a rush towards Gate C and the gate - I think
 Gate A opens more or less at that time.  I do not see much
 of Gate C because I am out near the sweet shop and my
 perception of the gate opening was at Gate A and seeing
 hordes of people running through Gate A.

 But that came, I think, after the opening of Gate C from
 the evidence we have heard.  It seems that Gate C opened

   once at 2.48, then opened again at 2.52 and stayed open
   and it was after that that Gate A opened? - A. Yes, th^t
   really coincides with what I was doing.  I was out at the
   sweet shop side, at the concourse, working there, facing
   towards the sweet shop.

Q. So you were not aware of the influx of fans through Gate
   C? - A. No, sir.

Q. With the opening of Gate A, did the crowds disappear
   fairly swiftly? - A. Yes.

Q. After gate A had opened and people had gone through it, were
   there then still people coming along leppings Lane? - A. Oh,
   yes, even when the gates were shut again after the people had
   gone in, there were still a lot of people outside Leppings
   Lane.  They were still coming.

Q. When you say they were shut again, how long was gate A open
   for? - A. I c a n ’t remember, sir.

Q. Have you any perception or idea of when it was open? -A. i
   would only be guessing.

Q.    Did you see it being closed again? - A. No, I can't remember.

Q.    I think you then in fact went into the ground and up to the
      control room, did you not? - A. I did,sir, yes.

Q.     What were you wearing when you went up to the control room? -
      A. My boots and breeches, anorak and my crash helmet.

Q. What colour was that anorak? - A. Black.

Q.         LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   About what time are we talking
      about now, do you know? - A. I would think it is just after 3,
      sir, perhaps 5-past, or perhaps earlier.  I don't remember
      looking at a watch.

Q. The game was in progress, was it, when you got up there? - A.
   I can't remember, my Lord.  I really don't.

Cl          MR. PHILLIPS:    Now, you have already explained what you
       saw and what you experienced at that time was something you
       had never experienced before? - A. I have been in some bad
       situations in crowds in line with my experience, but as far as
       at a turnstile with football fans I have never seen anything
     , like that before in my life.

Q. Had you noticed any difference in the state or condition of
   the people who came from the previous year? - A. I cover that
   by saying they were different in that there had been a lot
   more drinking than is usual at football.       I think the Control
   of Alcohol Act has had a good effect up to a point and you
   don't see an awful lot of drinking at football matches
   nowadays, but on this occasion that was the unusual part about
   i t , people had had a lot of dri n k , in my perception.

Q. Was that true at half-past-2, or was that only true later on
   as we get closer to 3 o ’clock? - A. It was true at 11.30, sir.
   They were drinking at 11.30 up on Halifax Road.

Q. I am talking about the state of the crowd that you saw outside
   the turnstiles. - A. Yes, it was a different sort of a crowd
   to what is normally at a football match.

                        Cross-Examined bv MR. HYTNER:

    Q.   Mr. Hand-Davis, when you arrived at the ground it was about
         2.20, was it, down Leppings Lane? - A. No, sir, I said 2.08.

    Q. I am so sorry.    You arrived in   Leppings Lane as early as 2.08?
       - A. Yes, sir.

    Q.   What time did you reach the turnstiles? - A. I could see the
         turnstiles at 2.08 because I am stood by the sweet  shop. You
         can actually see me in the photograph.

    Q.    Did you know that the ground Commander outside Leppings Lane
         was Mr. Marshall? - A. Yes, I did, sir.

    Q. What information was given to you by Mr. Marshall or
       anybody else about the situation on the ground when you
       arrived? - A. I d i d n ’t see Mir. Marshall immediately on
       arrival.  None.

    Q. At any time between 2.08 and 3 o'clock, that is after all this
       incident dissipated, did you ever receive any information
       from Mr. Marshall or Police control about the situation on
       the ground in Leppings Lane and at the turnstiles? - A. No,
       sir, but I think that would have been difficult for me to
       hear anything because I did say I had difficulties with the
       communications anyway, and I had a helmet on.

    Q.    Are there any arrangements made in the planning of crowd
         control for any co-ordination or communication between
         yourself and the ground Commander or Police control? - A. Yes,
         it would be normal practice for me to communicate anything on
         the ground that I could see.    Mounted men have a good
         viewpoint. The control room don't, and whenever I can pass on
         useful information I do to control.

    G. I am thinking the other way, actually, Mr. Hand-Davis.  What
       arrangements are made for you to receive the necessary
       information to enable you to make a proper evaluation of the
       situation so that you can take the right action? - A. I had my
       radio, sir.  That is about all there is there for me.

    Q. And did you receive no information over the radio as to what
       actions were being taken by Mr. Marshall or others? - A. No,
       sir.

    Q. Were you aware, for example, that at 2.17, which is very
       nearly three-quarters-of-an-hour before the kick-off, Mr.
       Marshall had regarded the situation as such that it was
       necessary to close Leppings Lane? - A. He was referring, I
       think, to traffic flow and smooth passageway for foot
       passengers.  It was more I think with regard to traffic. It
       usually is, traffic movement.

    Q. Is that because you have heard his evidence or have seen
       statements from him since? - A. No, sir, I didn't hear all of
       his evidence and I have not read his statement, but we would

                                                   P. HAND-DAVIS


       normally close Leppings Lane because of traffic flow.

    Q. Were you aware that at 2.15, three-quarters-of-an-hour before
       the kick-off, it was the estimate of the ground Commander that
       between a quarter and a third of the entire capacity of the
       North and West Stands and terraces was in Leppings Lane? - A.
       No, sir.

    Q. And that there were very many thousands still to come? - A.
       No, I was not aware of that.

    Q. That information would have been crucial to you in determining
       how best to use your horses, would not it? - A. I could
       certainly have used the information, yes, sir.  I d o n ’t
       quite know what I would have done, b u t ....

    Q. Can I take you through it. Once your horses are enveloped by
       a crowd like cellophane, as you very graphically put it,
       your horses become worse than useless. You are unable to
       control the crowd and indeed the crowd are a danger to you
       and your horses are a danger to the crowd in the immediate
       vicinity? - A. It is very rare for the crowd to become a
       danger to us, and it is very rare for me to find a horse to
       be useless.

    Q. Yes, I know, but once the crowd envelopes you like cellophane
       that situation has been reached, has not it? - A. Yes, it was
       a new experience for me.

    Q. So it is crucial both from the point of view of your own
       safety and crucial from the point of view of crowd control
       that the area which may be very unusual in football grounds,
       of course, the very restricted area between the perimeter
       gates and the turnstiles should never become jammed with
       people - that is the first question.  Do you agree with that?
       - A. I don't agree it is a restricted area, particularly.

    Q. What, the area between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles
       not restricted? - A. I have never seen any problems there in
       the past.

    Q. Whether it is restricted or not it is crucial for crowd
       control that it does not become a mass jammed with people? -
       A. Correct, sir.

    Q. And secondly, from the point of view of your own safety and
       operative ability, it is essential that your horses should not
       be trapped in that area if it does become jammed with people?
       - A . Y e s , indeed.

    Q. If you look in fact at photograph 29 A. -A. Is that album
       1, sir?

    Q. Yes, composite album 1.  I have tried to count the horses that
       I can see.  I have got to 11.   Mr. Collins says he can see
       12. - A. I can see 13, sir.
4                               44



                                                      P. HAND-DAVIS


    Q. They are all in the area either behind the turnstile.     The
       Sergeant I think is behind the turnstile area in the South
       Road, and so is an Officer in front of him.     The others are
       all in the immediate vicinity either of the turnstile area or
       outside the perimeter gates? - A. Those are reinforcements,
       sir.     That is the Penistone Road detail that has come up.   You
       c a n ’t see me.  As Mr. McKay says, he lost sight of us, and you
       have lost sight of me in that photo.

    Q. Yes, that may be.  The fact is that by 2.52, just before the
       gates were opened, the bulk of the mounted Police had somehow
       found their way towards the turnstile area? - A. Yes.

    Q. If you look back at photograph 23A, which is 2.27, there you
       see one Officer at least on horseback as it were patrolling
       and controlling a crocodile down the pavement? - A. Yes.  He
       is quite a way back from the ground there.

    Q. Yes, that is right. - A. But he is doing what you say - by my
       interpretation.

    Q. Had you been told, had you been given the information that I
       have just passed on to you, namely that by 2.20 the crowd in
       Leppings Lane was in the perception of Mr. Marshall so great
       that the traffic had to be stopped coming through, and that
       that crowd numbered some 6,000 to 8,000, would you not have
       considered it advisable to control the further flow of people
       into the turnstile area to prevent it becoming jammed? - A. We
       did attempt that, sir.

    Q.   How did you attempt it? - A. By the means described.

    Q.   What you have described is what you tried to do when there was
         already a press within the turnstile area.   Do you accept that
         once there is a milling throng within the turnstile area and
         outside the perimeter gates, whether it is a mass or whether
         it has not yet just quite become a mass, it is essential to
         stop further people joining it at the rear? - A. I do, and
         that is what all our efforts were directed towards. '

    Q. How many Officers were patrolling up and down Leppings Lane
       cutting off the flow of fans between 2.30 and 2.45? - A. None.

    Q. None? - A. We were all the turnstiles or at the turnstile
       entrance there trying to stop them going into the pens. I am
       sorry, I have forgotten the two Policemen who were dealing
       with a public order incident up at the Catch Bar traffic
       lights.

    Q. Well, they d o n ’t count. Did it not occur to you at the time
       that your horses might be in the wrong place? - A. No, sir.

    Q. If they were down at the turnstiles, firstly by being within
       the pens they were being rendered ineffective, and secondly
       there was no sufficient attempt to stop further fans coming
       in down Leppings Lane and across the bridge and joining the
       crowd at the back and increasing crowd pressure? - A. That
       would have been a huge operation, sir.
                                   P. HAND-DAVIS



However huge the operation, it was a more effective use of
what resources you had to prevent further pressure on the
crowd rather than getting entangled with the crowd itself?
- a . n o , I would have needed vast amounts of men to do what
you suggest.

It was your impression afterwards that a lot of this trouble
had been caused by late arrival of fans? - A. It was not
caused by the Police, sir, and the turnstile operators.

That is a somewhat defensive answer.  It was your impression
afterwards that the trouble had been caused by late arrival
of Liverpool fans.  Is that right? - A. There must be a time
that the turnstiles and the Police reach breaking point and
we reached breaking point from half-past-2 onwards.

I wonder if you could answer my question, Mr. Hand-Davis,
it is a simple one.  It was your impression afterwards that
the trouble had been caused by late arrival of the Liverpool
fans? - A. Yes sir.

And that impression, you now appreciate, was wrong? - A.
No sir.

Do you regard 2.15, three-quarters-of-an-hour before kick-
off as late arrival? - A. No.

Are you now aware that there was an estimate by the Ground
Commander of 6,000 to 8,000 people in Leppings Lane at about
2.15? - A. Sorry, which Ground Commander do you refer to?

Mr. Marshall? - A. I think he is a bit top side there. I
would say it is 5,000.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I was going to ask you, you were
in an elevated position and probably could form your own
view about numbers about that time? - A. Yes, various
estimates have been said from 3,000 to 8,000. I say 5,000.

      MR. HYTNER;  We have all accepted that it would be
quite wrong and unfair to keep Mr. Marshall to the actual
spectator that he estimated.   5,000 people arriving
three-quarters-of-an-hour before the kick-off is hardly
late arrival, is it? - A. No sir.   I put 3,000 through
ten turnstiles at nighttime when they have been paying
in 25 minutes at Bramall Lane.

Mr. Hand-Davis, if the situation had reached a stage by
2.30ish where it would have entailed vast Police resources
to prevent the pedestrians coming down Leppings Lane from
each direction from joining the milling throng outside
the turnstiles and you were on horseback and in charge
of the horses, did you tell anybody that?   Did you inform
or advise or warn anybody that the situation was becoming
                                  P. HAND-DAVIS



beyond the control of the mounted Police? - A. At 14.40
I made a call for assistance and I was aware that my Sergeant
was using his radio at 13.45.  I did not know what he was
saying but I could see him actually pressing the switch on
his radio, so he also was passing messages to control.

But calling assistance is one thing.  Warning your superiors
that the situation was getting beyond the control of the
Police is another.  At what stage do you say, what time do
you say the crowd was such that the Police could not get
control of it? - A. It must be from the period 2.35 to 2.50.

Well at 2.35 did you or anybody to your knowledge advise
Police control that there was a situation in Leppings Lane
which was beyond the control of the Police were there? - A.
I know I didn't sir.

Do you appreciate, Mr. Hand-Davis, that if you have a crowd
pressing forward, the very worst thing to do to relieve
pressure is to tell those at the front to push back since
that will simply increase the combined pressure between
those at the front and those at the back who are pushing
forward? - A. I am not aware of anybody doing that.

Do you accept that it would be wrong to tell those at the
front to push back? - A. It seems ridiculous.

The way to relieve pressure is to get those at the back
to move back and then move your operation forward so that
more and more people are moved back.  That is right,
isn't it? - A. Exactly what we were trying sir from 2.35.

It was too late by then, wasn't it? - A. Indeed.

When you talk of people pushing at the front do you accept
this:   that in addition to those, and there undoubtedly
were some and it is no part of my brief to say there were
none, apart from those who were through impatience trying
to push their way through the crowd, that many others were
 pushing because they were being pushed from the back?
- a . That is the unfortunate thing about football that one
gets caught up in a situation in this pushing and shoving
where one can't do anything to control it.

That is very fair, and those at the back may be putting
pressure on those at the front simply by being there and
moving forward? - A. Oh no, it was pushing, not moving
forward.

You mean everybody at the perimeter at the back you could
see were deliberately pushing? - A. I could see pushing
from front to rear that is not necessarily confined at the
back.

And nothing was being done at that stage to try and contain
                                  P. HAND-DAVIS


the further crowds coming in at the rear which increased
the pressure at the front? - A. Well I am sorry, sir, I
told you that is exactly what I was doing.

What you were trying to do, as I understand it with your
horses, was concentrating on the area by the perimeter gates.
Is that right? - A. Yes, all our efforts from 2.35 were to
try and stop these pens filling.

But you see if that is what you were concentrating on there
was pressure building up behind the crowd who fronted the
perimeter gates and they themselves, those people who you
were cutting off would themselves be under pressure and
growing pressure.  That is right, isn't it? - A. From
their own fans, yes.

And nobody informed you at any stage of the numbers who would
still, who were still expected to arrive at the ground? -
A. No sir, I don't know how they would necessarily estimate
that.

Well that is simple, isn't it. You are a mounted Police
Officer.  Sometimes mounted Police Officers are within
grounds.  If you have two areas of the ground with a total
capacity of 24,000 and they are absolutely empty you know
that 24,000 are expected? - A. Indeed sir, yes.

And if they are half full you know that 12,000 are expected?
- A. That becomes more difficult.

More difficult but it is still an estimate? - A. Indeed.

And nobody let you know how many more were still expected?
- A. They may have been trying to, sir, but I did not get
many communications.

No co-ordination between yourself and Mr. Marshall? - A. That
would be difficult.

Really? - A. Mr. Marshall was just caught up in the crowd.

I am talking about before the emergency arose, Mr. Hand-Davis
Once the emergency arose it was difficult for everybody.
You see what I have to put to you is this: before you and
your men were caught up in this trap within the area outside
the turnstiles both the mounted and foot Police in Leppings
Lane had lost control of the crowd and permitted it to fill
the pen between the turnstile area and the perimeter fence?
- A. Yes, our best efforts were thwarted.


               Cross-Examined by MR. JACKSON:

Mr. Hand-Davis, you said normally that you close Leppings
Lane because of the traffic? - A. That is to my knowledge.
It is not something I am party to, but as far as I am aware .
                                   P. HAND-DAVIS


First of all have you any knowledge of Leppings Lane ever
being closed for any reason before? - A. I can't recall at
the moment sir, no.

The next matter I want to ask you ....   A. It is not some­
thing we do on a normal match day, put it that way.

Now we have heard it has never been closed before.  I wondered
how you came to say "normally we close it for a particular
reason"*  That is why I asked the question.

      May I move on.   You have told us that   itis common
knowledge that people in the last couple of years arrive
later at football matches? - A. It is starting to become so
sir, yes.

What alterations to the plans were made between 1987 and 1989
to cover the well known fact that people arrive later? -
A. I would not say it is "well known".

You knew it? - A. It was a perception I was gradually becoming
aware over the years, yes.

Now may I ask you about what is becoming a very unfortunate
position, the view that fans have that they are herded, I
am not sure they have ever complained before about being
scooped up? - A. We call it sweeping sir.

You see the position:  if I were to buy a ticket on a special
train, once I got to the other end Iwould hot have any
right to go where I wanted.   I would be taken by the Police.
I would not be allowed to go where I wanted and be put in
the ground at the behest of the Police Officers? - A. Sorry
sir, could you repeat that, I did not quite understand that
question?

Yes.  Is it the position that if I bought a ticket on a
special train to go to a football match, when I arrived at
the Station I would be taken, whether I wanted to or not
at that time, at a speed decided by the Police Officers?
not allowed to go anywhere I wanted and taken to the ground
and put in by the Police Officers? - A. We encourage people
to go into the ground, yes sir.

That is not an answer to my question and you know it is
not an answer.  If you don't want to answer it please say
so? - A. That is quite correct what you assumed sir.

Is there any surprise   amongst the Police Force that people
now no longer want to   go by special train? - A. I think
that people avoid the   public transport routes because of
the drinking problems   sir.

Officer may I move now to the words that you said before
"scoop people up".  You call it officially sweeping? -
A. Yes, scoop was not my word but sweep is.
                                    P. HAND-DAVIS



       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: I would like to understand the
scope of this before you move on» the question you have just
asked.

      If I was in Mr. Jackson's position with a ticket on a
special train and I choose when I get to Sheffield to want
to go and buy something in a shop on the way, would I have
difficulty in detaching myself from the crocodile? - A. My
Lord, I don't think you can have it both ways.  If we want
to get people into the ground ....

No,   I would just like you to answer my question and there
may   be good reasons for it. - A. The reason is that we have
got   a train with 500 on and it must be encouraged to go into
the   ground.

Well the answer is then that I would have to go in without
my purchase, would I? - A. We don't stop anybody going to
the shops but if we see them going to the shops we encourage
them once they have come out to continue on their journey.
It is virtually impossible to do it anyway to stop them
breaking away.  There are 500 on the train and there is only
about eight mounted men escorting them.

If one were to try and peel off, at any rate an attempt would
be made by an Officer to say:  "Don't go over there, you stay
with this lot". - A. We certainly would not want them to
go down the Penistone Road towards the Nottingham fans, so
there is that degree of control and I don't see why we should
apologise for that. We have to get them into the ground.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am just trying to understand
the position and that is the position.

      MR. JACKSON:  Let me make it quite clear Officer on
behalf of the football supporters of this country, they
don't want to have to escape from the crocodile.  They want
to go where they can do and ought to be allowed to do?

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  I am sorry, Mr. Jackson, that
is not a question.  That may be a matter for a final submission.

        MR. JACKSON:   I am obliged to you sir.

The note I made, and I will be corrected no doubt later,
was that you scoop people up but I will accept the word sweep?
- a . Sweep is in the Public Order Manual, sir. It is an
accepted practice for mounted Police.

If your crocodile is travelling towards the ground at about
5-past-2 and I happened to have arrived in the area at
quarter-to and was walking towards the ground, is there a
probability I would be swept up and put into the same con­
tingent that have to be put into the ground? - A. There
is too much emotive use of the word "swept".  Encouraged
to go towards the ground.  It must be policy that we encourage
                                  P. HAND-DAVIS


people to go in early otherwise the scenes that we all know
tragically occur, so if people are there we try to get them
into the ground.

Do you meet resistance? - A. People don't like it, no sir.

So you deliberately adopt and continue a policy that you
know people don't like? - A. Our policy is always firm and
fair, but I put it to you again, sir, how can we possibly
allow people to stand about in Leppings Lane, we must
encourage them towards the ground.

Now may I ask you the final matter about the relationship
between you and the people you are expecting to enjoy the
day.  You use the word "constantly being pestered" by
people asking you which area they should go. Do I understand
from that that once again if I was arriving in Leppings Lane
and falsely assume that Section B would be after Section A
and ask an Officer:  "Where is Section B?" you would consider
that to be pestering? - A. No, I am a human being like every­
body else and when somebody comes up in the right manner he
gets treated in the same way.  The pestering remark was
referring to that drunken element that were coming up in an
aggressive manner.

Do you think perhaps there is room for improvement on both
sides between those who are being escorted to the ground
and those who are doing the escorting? - A. No, the 400
that went down from the Station went down amicably with
banter.  That is the sort of way I do my policing and if
people respond to it everything is fine.

      MR. JACKSON:   Thank you for your help.


             Cross-Examined by MR. KALLIPETIS:

Mr. Hand-Davis of course your position is impossible, isn't
it. The powers that be decide that there should be football
specials and you are deputed to bring those people from
the trains into the ground and you can't do anything else,
can you? * A. It would seem ridiculous nt>t to encourage them
towards the ground sir, yes.

Of course it defeats the object, doesn't it? - A. We must
get them to the ground.

Can you help me please Mr. Hand-Davis about page 7 of your
statement.  You will see half-way down you say:  "Shortly
afterwards I dismounted and ran inside the ground to the
Police Control."  Do you see that? - A. Yes sir.

This is after the crowd had gone in when the gates had been
opened.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

And after the match had started? - A. I said I was not sure.

                                            P. HAND-DAVIS


     Q. When you ran up the steps what was the purpose of you going
        to Police Control at that stage? - A. I knew there had been
        an influx into the ground.  My perception was that Gate A
        towards the North Stand, I knew that was seating and I was
        worried about disorder, pitch invasion.

     Q. How did you know there had been an influx into the ground.
        Do you mean from your observation? - A. I could see that
        Gate A opened and that huge numbers went through Gate A.

     Q. I just want   to be certain we are talking about the same
        thing.  You   don't mean the influx on to the pitch from
        the pens? -   A. No, when I arrived on the steps I started
        to see them   climbing over.

     Q. Did you have a personal radio on your lapel? - A. Yes, I


     Q. And am I right that that would receive any messages being
        broadcasted by other Officers using the Police radios? -
        A. Yes.

     Q. And obviously although you have a helmet on, the reason
        that you wear the radio on your lapel is to both give and
        receive messages? - A. That is possible, yes sir.

     Q. Well it is the reason you wear it there, isn't it? - A. It
        is not easy on a horse and it is not easy in a difficult
        situation that I have just described to hear the messages
        that were coming over.  In fact it was impossible sir.

     Q. We are talking of the situation now when the gates had been
        opened and the crowd outside have all gone into the ground
        so things must be considerably easier? - A. Yes I say in
        my statement that things dissipated and cleared straightaway,
        more or less.

     Q. Did you hear the message over your radio referring to a
        pitch invasion? - A. No.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   You see, at the extreme, some
     people might think that they are going to be shut out
     altogether? - A. Yes, my Lord.

Q.        HR. GLASGOW:   The very last point, Hr. Hand-Davis:
     at the time when you saw Gate A opened, which you can take
     from us was a very few minutes before three o ’clock, at
     probably 2.58 - when you saw Gate A open, where were you?
     - A. As I said, sir, very near to the sweet shop.    I had
     just been trying this line of horse tactic.

Q. Out on the corner? - A. Yes, very near to the sweet shop,
   facing towards Gate A.

Q. So with a view, if you had wanted a view, down Leppings
   Lane or up, whichever way you want to call it, but along
   Leppings Lane as well? - A. No, I am facing the sweet
   shop, as I say.  I have got a good view all round, of
   course.

Q. Were people still arriving?   I do not mean caught in the
   jam outside the turnstiles, which, of course, we know was
   the case, but were they still arriving along Leppings Lane
   at that time? - A. Yes, and the video shows that quite
   graphically.  In huge numbers.

Q. I am sorry? - A. I think the video shows that at three
   o ’clock even, that people are coming in quite significant
   amounts along that.

Q. You had the impression yourself of a large number of
   people still arriving at the ground, as distinct from
   being caught up outside the ground, at the time when you
   saw Gate A being opened? - A. No, not necessarily.   Since
   seeing the video, I can see a lot of people still coming
   down at 10-to three and up to three o ’clock.

          HR. GLASGOW:   Thank you very much.

          LOKD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Just before you sit down, Hr.
     Glasgow, recalling something from a number of days ago,
     Hr.  Finisterre, I think it was, the gentleman whose foot
     was stood o n ....

          HR. GLASGOW:   Absolutely right.

          LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    ....had a ticket and there
     was some query about the marking on it, which was going to
     be checked.  I do not know whether that has been done.

          HR. GLASGOW:   Well, what we have done - I wonder if
     I could show you a complete one, sir, because I was hoping
     to do it through this Officer, but it seemed that it was
     probably difficult.
                                               P. HAND-DAVIS




     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   I am not asking you to do it
now, but if you want to do it through your own
witnesses....

     HR. GLASGOW:   If it is helpful to show you now,
since you have raised it, sir, we can do it:

Officer, perhaps I could ask you if you could help my Lord
about this.  Have you ever inspected the tickets closely
enough to be able to see what relationship there is
between a gate marking and a stand position? - A. No, sir.
There are so many people that come up to us with
requests.

Well, I will not press it because my Lord can see that is
a West Stand ticket? - A. If I could just finish my
answer, Hr. Glasgow?

I apologise? - A.  It is that our general rule is to point
them in the general direction.  To get caught up in
individual turnstiles - you are being asked constantly by
people.  It is quite understandable, and we assist them as
much as we possibly can.

     HR. GLASGOW:     Hy Lord, the difficulty was that Hr.
Finisterre believed that he had a ticket for the West
Stand, as that is, but with a B where there ought to have
been a C.   Hy learned friend Hr. Collins was kind enough
to try and check that and, indeed, we sent for the
original, but, unhapppily the original of his ticket and
the only part that anybody could trace was the large
section, the square section, and not, of course, the
counterfoil.   It is not until one can marry the two halves
that one can check, but our understanding, and our
evidence will be, that if the West Stand, which, as you
see, is that computer printed writing, appears, then it is
automatic and beyond human control that the C must also
appear.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    The C only appears on the stub
and not on the main part.   I follow.

     HR. GLASGOW:   Hy Lord, it is our firm belief that
that must have been a misunderstanding, although obviously
an honest one, by Hr. Finisterre.

     HR. COLLINS:   It is possible that he was Gangway B,
is it, and he mistook the gangway letter for the turnstile
letter because I note on them the one is above the other.

     HR. GLASGOW:   Of course, that is possible, sir, but
I think the point that we were both seeking to clarify was
that we believe that it ought to be a mechanical
                                                  P. HAND-DAVIS



impossibility for the West Stand not to marry up with C on
the same line because they are both printed at the same
t ime.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Thank you.

     HR. COLLINS:   Actually, sir, that is the remains of
Hr. Finisterre’s ticket, which, as you see, is only the
large bit, so it does not help.   (Produced. )

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       His gangway was Z, in fact.

     HR. COLLINS:     Then it cannot be that, unless he has
misread Z as B.

     HR. GLASGOW:    It was a valiant attempt!   Thank you,
Hr. Hand-Davis.   Thank you for trying to help on that.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     One other thing - sorry, Hr.
Glasgow - before you go, because it sweeps up, if I may
use that word, the same area.   Have we any evidence
anywhere of forgeries?

     HR.   GLASGOW:   We have   no evidence.

     HR. COLLINS:   Sir,there is in Police    statements, if
I can help, that I have read some evidence of someone
coming and complaining or showing a Police Officer a
photostat and saying he had paid 20 quid for a photostat.
Now, that is the only evidence that I have seen which, I
suppose, could be arguably said to relate to forgeries. In
fact, it sounds as if some idiot paid £20 for a photostat
and then complained when   he was not let in, but that is as
far as we have been able   to find so far.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:       Yes, thank you.

     HR. WOODWARD:   Sir, if I can help a little on that
question that you raised, sir? As my learned friend does
indicate, there were one or two individuals who came to
the Police complaining that they had been overcharged for
photocopied tickets and there is no more evidence that we
have, but, sir, the investigation has not been in our
hands.

     LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:        Quite.

             Cross-examined by HR. WOODWARD:

     HR. WOODWARD:   Hr. Hand-Davis, may I ask you a
little bit about your experience of policing events? That
has been over a number of years with a number or different
horses? - A. Oh, yes, sir.

                Q. Were you involved, for example,   in the troubles over the
                   miners’ strike? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q.   Does your range of experience,accordingly, go to    some
                     rather grave crowd situations? - A. Oh, yes, sir.

                Q.   Had you ever experienced anything like, in a sporting
                     context, in a festival, carnival atmosphere, that which
                     you found in 1989 at the Leppings Lane? - A. No, sir.

                Q. That was quite without your experience.   When you arrived
                   in 1989 at the Leppings Lane end, you came down with the
                   supporters from the train? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q.   Getting to the ground at about eight minutes past two,
                     something like that? - A.I now know  that, sir, yes.

                Q.   We know from      what Hr. Harshall has said    that therecame a
                     time when he wanted Leppings Lane closed, and that is
                     timed, according to a log, at 2.17? - A. Yes.

                Q. So far as you were concerned, at that time, you were
                   already at the Leppings Lane entrance? - A. Yes, sir.

                Q. Did anything appear to you to necessitate that Leppings
                   Lane should be closed? - A. No, but Hr. Harshall had been
                   travelling perhaps up and down Leppings Lane.  I was there
                   and in position.

                Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:   Did you hear that message? -
                     A. No, sir.

                Q. So you did not know he had asked for it to be shut off? -
                   A. No, sir.

                Q. At 2.17, what was the radio problem? Was it terribly
                   noisy then already? - A. No, sir.  What I mean is I do not
                   recall the message.  It is quite likely that I did hear
                   it, but I do not recall it.

                Q.        HR. WOODWARD:   In fact, Hr. Hand-Davis, do you
                     recall any particular radio message that day? - A. Hr.
                     Harshall talked about milestone messages that would bring
                     it back to you and the one I do remember is the one at the
                     station, when they talk about the Claywheels coach park
                     being shut, but after that I do not recall other messages,
                     no, sir.

                Q. But that is before you came down to Leppings Lane? - A.
                   Yes.

                Q. Nothing is now fixed in your mind concerning any radio
                   message at all? - A. There is an awful lot of traffic on
                   the radio and you tend to tune in to that part which
                         63


                                                   P. HAND-DAVIS



   applies to you.  I hope that is not confusing for other
   people, but your ears seem to prick up when it concerns
   you and you switch off a little bit when it does not.

Q. You are not saying that your radio was not working? You
   are saying that there is nothing now that fixed itself in
   your mind to enable you now to recall it? - A. No, sir.

Q. Although you may have heard an awful lot? - A. Yes.

Q. You brought the supporters down using the Police horses
   and you have described their behaviour.  They seem to have
   been a good and friendly crowd? - A. A good bunch.

Q. Over what sort of lenth of Leppings Lane does a bunch like
   that extend? - A. We come down Halifax Road and we turn
   right at the Leppings Lane roundabout, my Lord, and we
   immediately put them on to the left-hand carriageway as
   you go towards the ground.  A normal train-load of 500
   would stretch about a third of the way down.

Q. So if we had 1,500 or so people coming down in that kind
   of crocodile, that would occupy just about Leppings Lane,
   would it? - A. I would think certainly 2,000 would get all
   the way to Leppings Lane, sir, to the turnstiles, yes.

                                                            P. HAND-DAVIS


       Q. It was put to you by Mr. Jackson that the fans may not like to
          be encouraged along.  You have to make a choice, I suppose? -
          A. Yes, sir, and we do it in a firm and fair way, but as I
          said, we must encourage them towards the ground.  We have no
          other choice.

       Q. At the end of the day does it depend upon the co-operation of
          the fans? - A. All our deployments for the whole of the
          afternoon depend upon the co-operation of the fans.

       Q. It seems at Leppings Lane you adopted a series of strategies?
          - A. Yes, sir.

       Q. And the first one was to take the horse into the crowd? - A.
          To go into what I considered was the worst enclosure, the A-G,
          and try to do something, yes.

       Q. When you took your horse into that crowd, when you did that,
          did you have an expectation that it would be successful? - A.
          Yes, because in all my experience people respect the Police
          horses.  They know that we are always there and they listen to
          our advice.

       Q. It may be suggested that to have considered that, to have
          attempted it, was just forlorn and pointless. - A. Oh, no,
          three of us were very, very experienced Police Officers,
          mounted Police Officers.  One of the Officers has 31
          years' mounted Police service.  The three horses were
          excellent Police horses.  The expectation must have been
          that we were going to succeed.

       Q.   Was there anything about the crowd at that time that caused
            you to have any doubts about that manoeuvre being appropriate?
            - A. No, I expected we were going to be successful.

       Q.   And did it work? - A. No, sir, it was futile.

       Q.   And the reason for that was what? - A. We could    not get their
            co-operation.

       Q. You then tried another tactic, making the line across? - A.
          Yes, with my own horse sideways on.

       Q. Perhaps you could deal with this, although you may not have
          been present when the witness gave evidence about it.  There
          was a suggestion of horses charging, I think that was his
          word, across and through.  Did anything like that happen? - A.
          No, sir, the crowd was much too compact for that.

       Q. When you made the line through, the second stratagem that
          you adopted, did you have any reason to expect that would
          not succeed? - A. No, as I say, the perimeter fence
          affords a good barrier, and that seemed a worth while
          tactic.  It seemed the right thing to do.

       Q. Are these orthodox tactics you were following as far as you
          were concerned? - A. No, sir, not really, because there were
                            65


                                                 P. HAND-DAVIS


     things I did on the day.  I had not ever envisaged having to
     do a thing like that at Leppings Lane.

Q. The gates were closed according to your recollection on two
   occasions? - A. Yes, sir.

Q. I am not sure whether you can help us.  Mr. Glasgow has
   referred you to the photographs, photograph 6. Could you look
   at photographs 5 and 4, please, in the West Midlands small
   bundle? - A. Yes, I have got them.

Q. In photograph 4 one can see the little bit of railing that
   runs alongside the River Don bank away from the camera, and
   then joins the Leppings Lane blue gates that run across? - A.
   Yes, sir.

Q. The first set of gates working from the right looking at the
   picture, effectively gives access directly down to the side
   road? - A. Yes, traffic normally passes through there.

Q.   And then     we come tothe gates towards the centre of    the
     picture, two sets of gates, that lead to turnstiles A-G? - A.
     yes, sir.

Q. Are you able to help in relation to the gate on the right, do
   you recall seeing that closed, or do you recall seeing it
   open.  Are you able to help? - A. I know we went to the gates
   to close them, and I assume I am on the left of the "No
   Through Road" sign.  I am sure we must have been trying to
   shut the other one.   It would seem senseless not to shut that.

Q.   Yes, but the one to the far right that leads down to where
     that van is parked? - A. Yes.  I did say I was not sure about
     that.

Q. You are not sure whether that was opened or closed.

          MR. WOODWARD:   Sir, if I may interject, when one looks
     at the video it is difficult to discern, but it would seem for
     a substantial part of the time that was in fact closed, if
     one looks carefully.

           LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  As the Officer said, there would
     not be a lot of point even in closing two if you had that
     open.

Q.        MR. WOODWARD:     When you came to the gates to cause them
     to be closed, were you able to look out on to Leppings Lane? -
     A. Yes, I had a good view.

Q.   And could you see how far the people went, extended into
     Leppings Lane? - A. Yes, I think we certainly had got a full
     concourse ar ea .

Q. Yes, but from your position at the gates could you see how far
   they went, whether they went out on to the carriageway? - A. I
   could not perhaps see quite to that extent, but I knew we had
                              66


                                                  P. HAND-DAVIS


     a lot of people there.

Q.   What was the purpose of closing the gates there? -   A. This
     attempt to relieve this pressing on the A-G compound.

Q.   Were people still coming along at the back joining the crowd
     beyond the gates on the Leppings Lane side? - A. I am sorry?

Q.   Did you see people coming along to join those that you were
     effectively barring by closing the gates? - A. Yes, people
     were coming down all the time and joining the throng.

Q. At any stage did you see any response to your requests or the
   requests of your other Officers for people to hold back? - A.
   No, they were completely ignored.

Q. The suggestion has been made that there should have been some
   endeavour at a point remote from the turnstiles to stop people
   coming in, to form queues up Leppings Lane and over the
   bridge. - A. Yes.

Q. Are you able with your experience to help us about that as to
   whether or not that would be feasible or how problematical
   that would be? - A. It would take huge amounts of manpower.
   We have already agreed that 2,000 people would stretch from
   the roundabout to the turnstiles.

Q.   And if they were intent and minded as there were elements in
     this crowd in 1989 to come on, are you able to indicate to the
     Inquiry how those people might have effectively been dealt
     with? - A. It was a residential area, a shopping area.   It
     would have taken vast amounts of manpower.  It does not seem
     to be a feasible proposition to queue that far back.   It is
     beyond my experience of a football ground that that can be
     achieved.

Q. What is the relevance of the fact it is in a residential or a
   shopping area? - A. Well, that residents can be troubled by
   fans in the way that this Inquiry knows only too well,
   troubled.

Q. The manpower, the manning of it would be no in your view
   practicable? - A. If I could help the Inquiry, my Lord, I have
   made a calculation.  The number of horses that stretch across
   from the sweet shop to the bridge at the final attempt to hold
   back the crowd was about 10 horses.  That line of 10 horses
   from the blue perimeter gates we see on photo 4 only reached
   the sweet shop.  20 horses would get to the first junction,
   Vere Road, 20 horses in a line.

Q.        LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:    I think the question may be that
     before the mood of the fans who had massed there had become,
     as you say, difficult, if they had been coming down the lane
     as we see on one of these photographs with Officers keeping
     them to the pavement, on South Yorkshire 1, photograph
     MLW.10/20A for example.   It is composite 1. - A. Yes.

               Q. MLW.10/20A, that seems to show a crocodile or queue or
                  movement, whatever you call it, down the pavement, being kept
                  off the road by intermittent Police Officers, one horse only
                  we can see there, and other foot Officers? Right? - A. There
                  is actually another one up past the traffic lights.

               Q. Yes, I cain just see the back end of him.  I think what the
                  suggestion may be is that not having a horse end to end as it
                  were all the way up to the roundabout but before the mood gets
                  difficult, if perhaps by shutting half the gates at the
                  perimeter and filtering people in so they could queue without
                  getting too crushed inside the area in front of the
                  turnstiles, the queue could reasonably patiently be persuaded
                  to come down in order before they got to the desperate stage?
                  - A. The trouble, my Lord, with queueing is the spillage
                  element, that people won't stay in the queue.   They try and
                  push in.   We are not taking account of the other side of the
                  road where there are huge volumes of fans coming on the other
                  side of that carriageway, the number that is coming down from
                  Catch Bar Lane traffic lights.

               Q. Well, they do it at Wimbledon. - A. For the tennis?

               Q. A different lot? - A. I think we have already accepted that a
                  football queue is vastly different to any other queue that we
                  see in society.

               Q. Yes.    Very well.

               Q.        MR. WOODWARD:   I think what you are saying is as a
                    matter of experience, although in a room like this we can come
                    up with ideas, whether it is semaphore or whatever, the
                    practicality of it is against it? - A. Yes, from my
                    experience.

               Q. It would be hopeless? - A. Yes.

               Q. And would it necessarily ensure that thronging and pressing
                  and pushing does not occur? - A. No, sir.

               Q. Would it necessarily ensure that the determined and the
                  selfish did not spoil it for the others? - A. It would not,
                  sir, no.

               Q. And how would you police the selfish and the determined if
                  they happened to be interspersed and strung out along Leppings
                  Lane? - A. it would take vast amounts of manpower.

               Q. They individually would have to be dealt with? - A. I can
                  envisage the manpower we would need.

               Q. I think Mr. Jackson has indicated that people wished to go
                  about their own way and don't want to be told what to do? - A.
                  That is always the problem, that there are always in the
                  crowds reasonable people, people that are walking down
                  Leppings Lane who are not going to the football match.   They
                  would all be caught up in this queue, and there could be
                                              P. HAND-DAVIS


ladies with pushchairs, blind people.   It is a problem, it
really is.

                Re-Examined bv MR. COLLINS:

You paint a depressing picture, Mr. Hand-Davis, because what
really you are saying, I think, is that it is unpoliceable? -
A. What I am saying, sir, is that people must come in
reasonable time, and with our best efforts and those of the
ground we will get them in.

What in fact caused the trouble as I understand it - correct
me if i am wrong - is that a large amount of people arriving
at a particular moment which happened to be just before half­
past-2 on this occasion? - A. I think after.

All right.  I think you have agreed that by 2.30, 2.35 at the
latest, the situation was such outside the turnstiles as to
amount to a chaotic crowd? - A . Y e s , a desperate crowd.

A desperate crowd.  Which suggests that it was because people
had arrived at or before half-past-2 in rather unexpectedly
large numbers? - A. We certainly did not expect late arrival
on that scale.




                              /Q.   You keep on saying
                                  P. HAND-DAVIS


You keep on saying "late arrival".   Half-past-2 is not with
respect late, is it? - A. I think it is. As a youngster
at Tottenham on the terraces in the '60s if I was not in
the ground by 1.30 I did not get in.

So what you are effectively saying is if people don't arrive
before half-past-2 you can't expect the Police to cope. Is
that what you are really saying? - A. I am saying there is
only so much in the ground that the Police can cope with.
What if all 24,000 turn up at 2.30?

Precisely, but however much you try to encourage people to
arrive early you have got to contemplate, surely, that people
might not arrive in very good time particularly if there is
not any entertainment when they get into the ground? - A.
Well we had encouraged them to come early and entertainment
would not be in my field.   It is a good suggestion by the
way sir, the entertainment.

No one seems to have foreseen, this is the problem, that there
would be a large number of people arriving at any particular
moment? - A. We were anticipating peoplet from 11.30 onwards
and we got them from that time but we did not anticipate
such huge amounts so late.

Can I just ask one matter.  You say that your first reaction
was to try to get into the crowd with two other experienced
Officers to break it up? - A. To bring some sense of normality
to their queueing.  I believe that those two were already in.

That I can understand if you have a crowd which is static
in the sense that it is not being added to, but that surely
is not necessarily going to work unless you also ensure, or
try to ensure, that that crowd is not added to? - A. We
we werking with them and pleading with them to stop pushing.
If they had responded and stopped pouring into that end we
would have been successful.

But those coming in at the back, and those as you put it
"pouring" into the pen, would not probably;be aware of your
presence until they were already in the crowd, would they?
- A. Oh I think the BBC video shows graphically the mounted
men desperately pleading with hands up.  If they could not
see us I am sure they must have been aware.

All I am wondering is this, as to whether you should not
at the same time have tried to take some steps by calling
for reinforcements or whatever to place some controls and
stop people actually joining the crowd that already existed
at the turnstiles? - A. It would have been virtually
impossible to do that sir.

Did you think of doing it at your initial stage? - A. No,
I had 11 horses and we were desperately trying to hold
back the crush into those pens.

The only other thing I would like to ask you is this: when
you were round Gate 0/ this is when you h a d gone round to
your position in case there was a pitch invasion, you were
asked some questions by Mr. Kallipetis and since he appears
for the Ambulance Service I shall ask directly:   did you
at any stage obstruct the arrival of any ambulances? - A.
No sir, we are not fools.  If we had been in the way of
them we would have got out of the way.  I quickly realised
that we were going to be in the way and as I say we cleared
off.

By the time you cleared off had any ambulances arrived as
far as you can recall? - A . Yes, I watched an ambulance
going on the pitch and I think one coming off.

Yes, on to the pitch but I mean from Penistone Road into the
ground? - A. I don't recall a lot of ambulances coming in
at that time.

Anyway you did not obstruct them? - A. No sir.

      MR. COLLINS:    Thank you.


                     By LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:

Can you just tell me a little bit more about the technique
that you normally employ in using your horses. Am I right
in thinking that you rely to a large extent on people not
wanting to get t©o close to them? ~ A. Indeed, you are using
the passive force of the animal.  It is a very gentle animal
is a horse but its size makes people respect him.

So people who are in control of their movements, I don't
mean by that drunk or otherwise, but people who are free to
come close to the horse or not, will normally give it a
reasonable berth.  Is that right? - A. Yes, we can work
crowds because of that.

And that is the way you rely on working them? - A. Yes,
indeed.

So if you get people wrapping themselves round the horses
like clingfilm, is it reasonable to assume that is because
they can't help it? ~ A. Partly, but I think they had no
fear.  The people that were pressed all around me weren't
in any fear of being up against the horse and I could not
understand it. Nobody in that crowd seemed to be conscious
of us or worried about u s .

Just one other thing.  You did mention somebody, an individual,
taking a dive under a horse, you put it as if he was entering
a swimming pool.  Is that right? - A. Yes.

What I want to know, was he a one-off or were there a number.

What was happening? - A. There were dozens that were doing
that.  I am sorry that I described only one, there were
dozens, y e s .

I am wondering how in that sort of crush they could take a
run at it? - A. I think that with one or two individuals it
worked and others were copying them, but when I say "dozens"
there were others at the same time forcing their way between
the weak point which is the horse's head where there is that
bit of a gap.

And your view was that they were doing that deliberately to
try and get in rather than because they were trying to escape
from intolerable pressure? - A. The ones on my left were
under no pressure.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:     Thank you.

      MR. GLASGOW:  Sir, I can help you on the question of
forgeries again. All the ticket stubs, that is all that were
legitimately used were examined by the Club Staff before being
handed to West Midlands Police for that purpose and one forgery
was found.

      LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR:  So it does not look as though
we are dealing with a large force of people in possession of
forged tickets?

      MR. GLASGOW:   No sir.

       LORD JUSTICE TAYLOR: Very well.  I think a curious
silence seems to have fallen outside.  I hope it is not
ominous but we are very close to the time I suggested so
I think we will break off now and sit again on Monday at
10.30.

        (The Inquiry was adjourned until 10.30 a . m .
                on Monday, 5th June, 1989)

remaind er of the            serial         were    s e a t e d in the        rear.

We    p a trolled L a n g s e t t R o a d      to the K e l v i n F lats          travelling          from

Hillsborough Corner                r e t urned the same             route,      turned       left onto Holme

Lane    to the on e wa y sy s t e m and t hen back a l o n g H o l m e Lan e                          to Langsett

Road.

It was a p p a r e n t     that there was a . l a r g e               number of both Liv e r p o o l           and

Notts.     Fo r e s t s u p p o r t e r s    in the area.             T h e y were     in high spirits             but

p r e s e n t e d no probl e m s at this stage.

I n oted the f o l l o w i n g        public        houses      in the        course of our          patrols -

1.     F r e e m asons,    W a l k l e y Lane.         S poke     to the       landlord,       Mr.    Rugh.        He

was    only a l l o w i n g Liv e r p o o l        supporters         into his        pub,    he t o g ether w i t h

4 or 5 d o o r m e n w ere         remaining         on the       door at all          times.        T here was         no

trouble a n d he was a d v i s e d             re d r i n k e r s     standing        outside.

2.     Que e n s Ground,        L a n g s e t t Road.         At approx.         1pm    (1300)       I entered

these     premises.          The    pub was a b s o l u t e l y full            of both L i v e r p o o l     and

Notts.      Forest     supporters.             Most w ere         in high spirits             but there was             no

trouble.        I estimate          the      pub c o n t a i n e d approx.        E50    people.

I also      gave    passing a t t e n t i o n to Geo r g e             IV,     Langsett Road,          B u r goyne

A rm s an d Masons.           T here w ere          no s u p p o r t e r s    outside    these       premises.

A general       patrol       of the a r e a was made                but no      public       order    situations

were    encountered.

At approx.         1.15pm      (1315)        my transit was            d i r e c t e d to an    incident at

the Royal Hotel,            P e n i s t o n e Road,       opposite           the Dog Stadium.

The L a n d l o r d had a s k e d the Police                to help him          clear the        pub because

some damage        had been         caused         inside.

Other     officers w e r e         present a n d there were approx.                      100 fans       outside

a n d the same nu m b e r          inside.         T here was         no violence a l t h o u g h most             of

the fans       seemed      in very high spirits a n d some were                          drunk.        I am

unable     to say w h i c h fans were                there      but    I got the        i m p r e s s i o n that

they were Notts.            Forest          supporters.

The fans w ere m o v e d a l o n g a n d the                pub emptied.           On the        pavement

o uts i d e were a       large       number      of bottles a n d glasses,                m a n y of w h i c h

debris,     w h i c h t h e y b e g a n todo wh i l s t          I was    there.        We      then      resumed

patrol.

At approx.         2.15pm       (1415)     I was        d i r e c t e d to assiift other o f f icers at

the Horse a n d J o c k e y P u b l i c H ouse              on Wad s ley yllane.          I there          spoke to

Sgt.    Miller a n d       it was       d e c i d e d to    close     tj*§ pub.

Outside      the     pub w ere ap p r o x i m a t e l y ^ 25jP/ L.iverpool           fans.        Most a p p e a r e d

The     fans were       in good humour a n d no a n i m o s i t y was                  d i r e c t e d at the

Police.          W i t h Sgt.    Miller      I    went       into the pub,        e x p l a i n e d my

intentions         to the M a n a g e r who was             in full agreement.

The juke box was              t u r n e d off an d       I i n f ormed thm fans           in the         pub that

they had 10 m i n u t e s           in w h i c h to fin i s h tlhey t         drinks.           The    pub

W a d s l e y Lane    to the P o l i c e Room.              I do not know details                 of either

At approx.         2.50pm       (1450)     we    resumed       patrol      but due to very heavy

 the traffic and fans.                     At this time,              radio       traffic was very busy.                            I

 Sgt,    I think Sgt.             Higgins        of F C&V,          request a further                  gate     to be

 opened.        This      request was also                 granted.

 We then made            our w a y to L e p p i n g s Lane an d my offic e r s were d e ­

 bussed.        There were           ha r d l y any Po l i c e          in this         locat i o n a nd some fans

 had s t a r t e d to       leave the           ground.

 I saw several            casualties            being g i v e n First Aid on the                       left side of

 the d r i v e w a y a nd approx.               SO dead        people      on the        right        hand side of th

 driveway.          It was at this                point that          I reali s e d the e n o r m i t y of the

 problem but d i d n ’t know what                      had     caused       it.     A line of o f f icers were

 d ep l o y e d to s t a n d as a barrier or shield                          in front of the dead.                          I

 de p l o y e d my o f f i c e r s       to a l l o w acc e s s       for the a mb u l a n c e s a n d fire

 tender w h i c h were            now arriving.

 The d e p a r t i n g    fans were            growing       in numbers and many s l o w e d a n d spoke

 hat r e d to the Police.                  T hey     called us m u r d e r i n g          bastards a n d blamed

 us for the deaths.                  M a n y had to be             r e s t r a i n e d by Police an d their

 friends      from a t t a c k i n g P o licemen.                  However        some of the fans were

 blaming      their       own supporters.

 Because      of the        ha t r e d    I felt an d the             build up of fans w h i c h were

 cong r e g a t i n g    on L e p p i n g s Lane,          I r e q u e s t e d further a s s i s t a n c e             to

 control a n d disp o s e            the       crowd.        At this time            I was      unaware of the

 events      inside       the     ground.

              I retur ned to L e p p i n g s           Lane    to try a n d      locate the       rest of my serial.

              O n my     return      I saw that          barriers a n d a g reen sheet had                been erected

              in front of the dead.

              The      public order        s i t u a t i o n had become         calmer artd I req u e s t e d further

              dtities.       My T r a n s i t a n d serial         were     d ep l o y e d and we a t t e n d e d a few

              minor      public o r d e r      situations         but    the sheer volume           of traffic and

              p edestr ians       i m p e d e d our mobility.

              We     r e m ained on patrol             until 9pm      (2100)     w h e n we were a l l o w e d a meal

              an d e ve n t u a l l y were      s tood down at           10pm    (2200).

              M y feelings wh i l s t          deal i n g wit h the s i t u a t i o n at the           rear of Leppings

              Lane,     were one         of a nger       towards      the    fans who were a c c u s i n g me of

              being a m u r d e r i n g      bastard,         after     they had been r esponsible               for

              killing      their        own fans and also one of f r u s t r a t i o n at being unable to

              co m m u n i c a t e w i t h m a t c h    control    due      to h eavy air traffic.

              Although       I saw two C h i e f          Inspectors an d Supt.             Marshall      - who a p p e a r e d

              to me to be          in shock - their was                 no one      in command to direct           officers

              a nd     it fell    upon m y s e l f a n d other Sgts.                to take    control      of the

              situation.           It    r e q u i r e d a Senior O f f i c e r at the scene to take overall

              command.

              It w a s n ’t until a b o u t 7 . 3 0 p m         (1930)       that    I d is c o v e r e d the   large

              n umber of dead a nd up until                    that time        thought     the only      casualties

              i n v o l v e d were      those at L e p pings Lane             entrance.

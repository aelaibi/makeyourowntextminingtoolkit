               up at       about       1.30pm           ( 1 330).            No       police      came      on    the     coach.             We    made        our

               w a y along.            I didn't              see       any     police          directing          us    to     the      ground.              We

               walked along                the A61           to    the       island and             then     r i gh t     into       Leppings             Ln.

               On    route,          I saw a n u m b e r               of P o l i c e        stopping        people          g o i ng    down          the     side

               roads.           We w e r e       not     approached                   and    searched        for w e a p o n s          or    dr in k .        I

               saw    no o t h e r         fans        being       approached.                 Just    before          the     ground,            on the

               left    of L e p p i n g s         Ln,        there          are       some     shops     with a         chip       shop.          We

               stopped          and    bought           some       chips.               We a t e      them       outs-i-46! a n d        then,walked^

               the    remaining             distance              to    the       ground.           We a r r i v e d      at    the^>-perim e t e r

               ga t e s a tT~abcuyt. 2. pm               ( 1400) . I s a w a                   couple       of    police        on      horseback              and

               a    couple       more       on foot.               We       went       through        the    gates        and      in b e t w e e n          the

               area    of       the    gates           and     the      turnstiles.               I was      st opp ed and              searched             for

               weapons          by a       policewoman.                     There       were      a few      policemen             around          her.

               They    didn't          look at           my       ticket.              The     a re a was        comparatively                free        of

               people       and       they       had     no       trouble             going      through         the    tunstiles.                 I went

               through          the    terrace           turnstiles                   and    ha nde d my         ticket        in.       I saw          no

               stewarding             at    all.         There          wa s      a    programme         seller         by a wall             on m y         left.

               I bought          a    programme              and       there          was    a steady        flow       of     people         going          into

               the    tunnel.              I saw        no     police          or      stewarding           between          the     turnstiles                and

               the    tunnel.          I h av e         not       been       to       this     ground       before        but      as    I went

               through          the    turnstiles                 the       only       obvious        way    o nt o     the     terracing               is

               th r o u g h a tunnel              which           is    immediately               in f r o n t      of you.             At    this        time          I

               was    not       aware           you     could          go    to       the    left     and    r i ght      onto       the      terracing.

               I saw       no    police          o k    stewards             at       the    entrance        to     the      tunnel.              We    had

               free    access          d o w n the           t u n n e l.         As    we     were    entering           the      ground          I saw           no

               gates       open and             thel^e w as            no    one       climbing        over       fences        etc      to       get     into

               the    ground.              As    you     ccHne out             of      the     tunnel       there       are     railings               I went

               to    the    right          of    the     railings.                    The    time     now w a s a b o u t          2.15pm          (1415).

eS U X V p L s - a g a i n s t     a    crush             barrier.             I decided              to    go    under          the    barrier         and       in the

                  people         a r o u n d me            were         screaming           at       the    police          to    o p e n the      gat e s.            The

                  police         were        telling              people        to m o v e           back    but       of    course         it was

                  impossible.                    I no w         found myself                at       the    front       of P e n 3 a n d           it was

                  getting          really             crushed.                The    time        now w o u l d         be a b o u t        3—4pm       (1300)—

                  (-1600).             I wa s         trapped            for    about           2 or 3 m i n u t e s .             People         were       being

                  lifted         out        on    the          sides       fences          to    the       less    packed area.                   I saw       nq

                  gates       or       perimeter                fencing         being           moved       at    the       fr o nt .       I saw       no    barrier

                  breaking             and       I saw          no      one a r o u n d         me    who    were       in the          process         of    dying.

                  separated             from my                two      mates       during           the    crushing             but    almost         immediately

                  having         got        into P e n            2 they were               behind          me.        We    waited         in the       Pen

                  watching             what       was          happening            but     it w a s        impossible             for      us    to    do

                 anything.                  I saw a             number         of    people           l ying      on the          pitch      either          dead       or

                  oik    fans          went       up       to     the     Notts\Forest                 end.        I became             aware      of a       line       of

                  general          picture                I got         was    that        some       Police       were          helping         but    others

                 w e r e n ' t.         A    lot          of    people         were        in s h o c k      and       perhaps          didn't         realise          the

                  true       gravity             of       the     situation.                I saw a          policeman without                     his       tunic

             the      tragedy          the    fans       were      not       disorderly           or   fighting          just    high

             greater.             I feel          that    s om e      of     the    police        hanging         around       should     have

             assisted            their        colleagues.             I saw        no    point      in the        line    of    police       across

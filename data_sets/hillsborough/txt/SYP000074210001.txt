At    ')/1.30afn (1130)         that     d W , myself and other                 serial      Four Officers,

made     our way to the               rear of NLhe S o u t h S t a n d where myself and another

officer were           d ep u t e d    to ma n the       players        entrance.          The other        officers

time     there were         few s u p po rt er s at          the     ground as the          turnstiles were

not     due to be opened until                  12 noon       (1200).



On    the opening         of gates           there was       then a steady            stream of        people

arriving,        m a in ly f a m i l i e s w ith young             child r e n who were           extremely

The     team    coaches were            due    to arrive at a p p r o x i m a t e l y           1330 - 1400 and

so b e f or eh an d quite a large                crowd of s u p p o r t e r s        g a t hered a r o u n d      the

players        entrance       to get         a glimpse at their              heroes.        A l t h o u g h the    crowd

was     sizeable       they were at this               time       no trouble and were              in a happy

was     some    pushing,        but     this    swell       was    natural      and was         controlled

adequately          by a Po l i c e      ho^^e        that a s s i s t e d    our serial         in that way.

On the teams           leaving         the    coaches,       m any    fans    now di s p e r s e d and went

 nurNtjer of Liv e r p o o l          sop porters who had                  eluded       the officers at        the     gate

 Although           the    fans we re mi :ing, at this                    point    there was       no      oau

 no scuffles              that    I. saw    in this area.                During    this     time   I was       in

 c ompany w ith anot h e r Serial                   Four      officer,        stood one either            side       of the

 players        entrance          door.      During       this      time    there was a small             crowd who

 remaine d t h r o u g h o u t who           the m a j o r i t y were L i v e r p u d l i a n s        - I. knew this

 because        of their          scarves     and also by the acce n t s                   from their      idle

 banter.            It was       obvious     that       Ihey were          wait i n g    for    the players

 to    come     out       to them.         Apparently         it    is     common       practice for players and

 executives           or team       r ep re s e n t a t i v e s    to deposit       tickets at          the door

 with     the d o o r m a n / s t e w a r d who hand them over                    to fans who          produced

 evidence           that    they were         the    person the           sender        had w r i t t e n on the

 envelope.                If proof was g iven usually orally,                       the envelopes          were

 h anded over.              Many    people who           claimed         tickets    this way were          family and

 close      relatives            of the     players and d i g n i t a r i e s           that    had entered

 earlier,           but some were           jsut    casual a c q u a i n t a n c e s .         Indeed some

 Li v e r p o o l   fans t ried m o r e X h a n          once       in vain to          receive    tickets,

 w het h e r    to keep for t herns e I v e V o r to sell                     to other         fans.     The    players

 of both teams made                 their way to vi^e tunnel / playe rs entrance and                                 X saw

 some Liverpool              and. N o t t i n g h a m   p l a y e r \ hanqj out         some tickets       to fans

 w h o m they         knew by their first                names       or   tTrey knew        casually and give out

 tickets.             I must       stress that          the   numbers        of tickets were            unknown, all

I know       is that     same       people were           given by the        p l a y e r ’s tickets whilst                   I

As one w o u ld       imagine at a semi-final                     the    crowds at        this time were

considerable,           howe v e r    most were           jovial a n d good humoured,                 some

o b v i ou sl y had been d r i nking              but were        no trouble.            It was     seen that

ma ny Liv e r p o o l    fans were ma k i n g             their way from my              left    towards          the

L ep p i n g s Lane     end.        Man y were        stood      in groups     of four          to six,

apparently        going       nowhere.           M a ny   remained       beside     the     players       entrance

awaiting       last min u t e        hands       out ~ I know this            because        they were

c o nt in u a l l y asking myself            if there were              any spare        tickets a v a i l a b l e           or

had been d e po si te d at            the door and had not been                      claimed.          I did not

hand     over any of            the u n cl ai me d tickets,             neither      did the g e n t l e m a n          who

was    the    steward      that      day.        The      time w o u l d be around 14fiQ same                day.



The    crowds a r o u nd the          turns t i l e s were         now very heavy a l t h o u g h            there

was    no trouble w ha ts o e v e r wit h the N o t t i n g h a m Forest                     suppo r t e r s who

were     piling    into the S o u t h Stand.                    It was    evident        that    there was          still

a   large amount         of fans,       I cannot           say what       team's      supporters          were

ma k i n g   their way beh i n d       the S ou t h S ta n d towards               the     L e p p i n g s Lane         end.



A                               5     a steward,           name    unknown,        told me that           there         was

trouble an d bad           crushing         at the L e p p i n g s Lane        end and that a gate had

s o m e h o w -436en opened and         that        the Liv e r p o o l     fans were surging               inwards,

the o f f i cers      ws< b    unable       to    cope.         This was     backed up at that               time by

a   large     number     of    pottre       horses        being m o v e d    from Pen i s t o n e Road to the

public       order      s i tu at io n on-going.             It was    naturally           impossible         for me

at a gl impse           to believe a n y t h in g           otherwise,        as    I was      totally unaware

what     had just h a p p en»rL m-jjrui% es earlier at L e p pings Lane.                               I reported

the /South S tand and onto L e p p i n g s Lane.                       as     the s eriousness            of the

a b u s e d me for       not    doing    enough and for my              colleagues       for    not being

able    to    prevent      the    loss    of     life    that had t aken         place.        For m a n y of

them had heard that               people were           dead by       listening    to their        local

radi o s t at io n or          pocket wirelesses.



The a m b ul an ce s were a r r i v i n g         in great       numbers and so we             c o ntinued to

clear a path thro u g h the               crowd foT\access.                  Twice more       1 peered

stating       that      it was always          the L i v erpool        who    caused the       problems        etc.

Although        Peelings were           running        high,    I did not       feel    t h r e a t e n e d by the

crowd at        this     point.      I could see from my                position       behind     the gates at

the P e n i s t on e R oad that          officers were           struggling       to    contain fans who

because       they were         leaving were           blocking       the    path of the Services

V ehicles,       so    I made my wa y and a t t e m p t e d to assist                  them    if I could.

The m a j o r i t y of the        people who were              there    in that area behind the

S p i on K o p and S ou th S ta nd were Forest                   s u pporters and were            not    causing

real     problems        just weight       of numbers.             There were,         however,      clashes of

trouble       m a i nl y due     to mo b i l e    hot dog sellers a t t e m p t i n g          to set up shop

to the       homeward      bound     fans.        No    trouble       is w o r t h y of note as         they made

their wa y home - I was                 in no m ood to arrest,                there was       too m uch to do

etc.

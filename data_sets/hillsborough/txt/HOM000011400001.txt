 Mr Bolton



 HILLSBOROUGH AND THE SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS



 Mr Patten has seen your submission of 21 August in his
 capacity as Duty Minister, and agrees that we should not
 write.

 Mr Haslam made the additional point in support of your advice
 that, in view of the Marchioness disaster^it was a
 particularly bad time to be entering into correspondence of
 this kind.

Dear

Thank you for your recent letter to Mr Moynihan which has been
passed to this department in view of our responsibilities for
the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.  I apologise for the delay
in replying to you.

You express your concern that the recommendations contained in
the Final Report of Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry into the
Hillsborough Stadium disaster should not be applied to sports
other than football and in particular Speedway.

The Report states that "crowd problems are directly related to
the nature of the event and the numbers attending it."   In
circulating the Report to local authorities the Home Office
advised that it would be consistent with the Report's findings
for local authorities to take proper account of these factors
when applying the recommendations to individual grounds.

                                                           Yours sincerely




                                                           MR S BILBE

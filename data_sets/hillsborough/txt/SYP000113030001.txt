At     10am      on 2 2 M a r c h         1989        I attended            a meeting             at H a m m e r t o n R o a d

Police         Station,            chaired        by C h i e f       Superintendent                  Mole     and w h i c h was

attended          by all           interested              parties,         who     had      been      invited.           I rec al l

that      at     the m e e t i n g        it w a s         mentioned           that Liverp oo l              were     unhappy           with

th e    allocation             of       tickets        and     being        given       t he L e p p i n g s       Lane     end and

B r i t i s h Rail         to a l t e r        these        arrangements             as w e l l        in o r d e r     t ha t

early       indications                 were     that       many more            Nottingham            fans     would       be

travelling            by      special          t ra i n ,    than Liverpool.

As a      result         of    this,       I later           d i s c ussed with Chief                   Superintendent

By     1340 hours          there        had      been     problems             at    the V i c t o r i a a n d R o y a l ,

public        houses       and       t he R o y a l     had,        in fact,             closed.

At about           1350 hours           I was       joined          in the          control          room      by C h i e f

Superintendent                 Duckenfield.               I informed                him    that       there were                 no    real

problems           apparent,          apart       from       the     usual,          with       this       type        of     ©v ent .         We

then went           together          onto       the T r a c k ,         with       the     intention             of     seeing          the

referee.            I identified              the      referee           who    was       on the         pi tc h,        talking with

other        peole an d we            waited about                5 minutes              for    him      to    leave          the      field

and     then       followed          him     to the       referee's             room.           With       th e     linesmen,             he

was     informed          that       in g e n e r a l ,      th e    field          of    play was            his

responsibility,                 but we        reserved            the     right          at a n y t i m e         to     come         o nt o

t he    field       if    circumstances                merited           this .          He w a s     informed              of    the

emergency           evacuation             procedure          aind the          coded message                  and       also

i n f o r m e d of       the    procedure           for      stopping           th e      match       by w a y         of     the      south

stand        linesman.           He w a s        informed           that       there would               be a f u r t h e r            brief

after        the    event.

At     about       1405    hours        I returned            to     the       control          r o om a n d        saw       that ACC

(Ops)        Mr.    Jackson,          was     in a t t e n d a n c e .          Mr.       Duckenfield appraised                            him

of     the    current          situation.

At about           1415    hours,          looking a r o u n d            the       stadium,          I noticed               that       the

Ko p was       filling          up n i c e l y .        It w a s         difficult             to a s s e s s       the       south

stand,        but    this also             appeared          to     be    filling.              My    impression was                     t ha t

th e    north       stand       was     probably          not a q u a r t e r             full       and      the      same       with         the

west     stand and             the    Leppings          Lane        terraces.

At     1417 hours a m e s s a g e was                   received           from S u p e rintendent                       Marshall,

asking        fo r L e p p i n g s      Lane      to    be    closed           to    traffic.              From        the C C T V

pictures           there       did    not     seem      to    be a        particular              problem,             b ut      the

serial        id en t i f i e d at         the    roundabout              e n d of L e p p i n g s            Lane       (S30)         was

contacted and asked                     to    close       that       end.           We were          unable         to      contact            the

serial       at     the    Catchbar              Lane       end     (S26)         and     either S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshall          or     Inspector           Sykes          were       told       this        and       requested          to d e p l o y a n

officer        to       close     t hi s     end.

At    about       1422      hours       a message                was    received              from Su p e r i n t e n d e n t

Marshall          that L e p p i n g s           Lane       had     not    yet      been           closed and             traffic         was

still       corning t h r o u g h .              Further          messages          were           sent as ki ng           for     th e     r oa d

to    be    closed.            Superintendent                    Marshall          then ask ed                for Mr.         Middleton

of S h e f f i e l d      Transport              to    be      informed           in o r d e r          t ha t    he    could make

arrangements              for     bus       routes          to    be a l t e r e d        to       c a t er      for    the      closure.

This       was arranged.

At about          1430 hours            the       north stand a p p e a r e d                      to    be a b o u t      half      full.

The    west       stand was            filling,             as    were     the       centre             pens a n d        th e    north

west       terrace.            There        were       l ar g e     clear         sections              in the         pen,      under      the

control        box       and    the     pe n on the               north       side        of       the     double         railings.

There       was     a    large        crowd       outside           the    Leppings                Lane       turnstiles,            but     I

was    convinced            that       the       turnstiles             could        cope          with       these       numbers         and

remarked          to C h i e f        Superintendent                   Duckenfield,                 t h at       there     was     a good

crowd       outside,           b ut    we    still          had     half      an     hour          to k i c k         of f a n d we w o u l d

get    them       in by        three        o ’clock.             About       this        time,          Chief S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

Duckenfeidl              a s k e d me       to    remind          him     of w h a t          we    had deci de d about

delaying          the     kick-off.               I informed              him      that        we       had a g r e e d       that    if

there      was      an    identifiable                 problem,           s u c h as a s e r i o u s                  accident       on     the

motorway,           or    bad weat he r               o v er     the P e n n i n e s ,         which          prevented           people

arriving          on     t ime,       that       we    would        delay —          but       if       it w a s       merely      t ha t

people       had a r r i v e d         in time,             but     decided          to       go    elsewhere,              rather        than

the    g r o u n d a n d a r r i v e d at              the       l a st m i n u t e ,         t h e n we w o u l d         no t    normally

delay       it.

By    1435 hours            the       control          room was           busy.           A    number            of    reports       had     been

received,           including a              possible             public          order        problem            in the M i d d l e w o o d

Liverpool             supporters,              who     found       their       way       onto    t he Kop.             A    report        had

been    received             of a        ’tout*        selling          Hop    tickets          at    the L e p p i n g s         Lane

radio and             he w a s     arrested.                Superintendent                Greenwood             was    asked        to

consider          a    contingency              for      other         Liverpool          supporters             on    the Kop,           in

view    of    thi s,         as    the K o p w a s           becoming          f ull.      A unit          at R a w s o n S p r i n g

carry       out       a breath           test.        The    crowd a r o u n d           the    turnstiles             in L e p p i n g s

At about          1440 hours              a    request was              received          from       the M o u n t e d          Inspector

deployed          from       the     gymnasium              to    the    Leppings          Lane       e n d of        the       ground,

to a s s i s t .           Messages           were     being       received          from       the L e p p i n g s         Lane       end

to    use    the       tannoy        system           to a s k p e o p l e      outside          the       turnstiles             to     stop

pushing       as       people       were        going        to    be    injured.              Police Constable                   Ryan

immediately                started        to    p as s      these me ss ages              over       the    public          address

system.           I instructed                 him     to    keep       talking          and    passing          on    the m e s s a g e .

At about          1442 hours,                 someone        was       trying       to    pass       a message             to    c o nt rol ,

which was             unreadable              and Police           Sergeant          Goddard          replied          that       the

message       was          unreadable.                A further          message          was    then       received             that     our

understand.                Police         Constable              Ry a n was     requested             to    raise          the

’N o r m a n C o l l i e r ’ t y p e        fault        of m e s s a g e s        breaking        up.            The    base

gained       the       impression           that        he    disconnected             this m ic ro p h o n e                and

substituted a telephone                          hand-set            type    microphone            for        it.

reply was          grossly           distorted and                 unreadable.              Police           Sergeant           Goddard

tried a second                time        and    th e    result        was     the     same.            He    put       the     handset

on the       desk and          looked           exasperated.                I said         to    the     communications

officer       "we m u s t          have     communications                  - at      least       give        us    talk-through

received          and Superintendent                     Marshall           was     calling.             I had my             own

tw o   or    three       occasions,              but     he w a s      not     receiving.                Superintendent

Marshall          was    still        requesting              that     tannoy messages                   be       passed about

pushing       and       crushing           in L e p p i n g s        Lane    and asked            for        th e a s s i s t a n c e         of

Police       Sergeant          Goddard           tried        to     contact        Police        Constable              Buxton and

Police       Constable             Bichard was               asking        Operations            Room        to    send a traffic

By about          14 45 h o u r s         I could        see       from     t he    CCTV        that     th e      crowd        outside

the L e p p i n g s      Lane        turnstiles              was     now    compacting            and        there       appeared             to

the C CT V        I could          see    that      the m o u n t e d          officers           were      being        jostled and

appeared          to      be w o r k i n g    singly and wree                   totally           surrounded             by    peo p l e .

Within a          very       short       space      of    time,          the    crowd          outside       Leppings              Lane

seemed        to h a v e         changed      from a        large         c r o w d of         people       to a        compacted

mass.         Superintendent                 Marshall          passed another                   radio message,                 asking

for    th e      gates       at    Leppings         Lane       end       to    be o p e n e d      saying         that        if we

didn't        open        th em,    people w o u l d           be    crushed.              At     t h is    ti me,       I could           see

that     people           were     climbing         over       th6       turnstiles             and    there          seemed        to     be

very     little           movement        through         the A to G t u r n s t i l e s .                   Inspector

Police        Constable            Ryan      informed me t ha t                 Inspector             Sewell          h a d 8 or          10

serials          from       'D'    D i v i s i o n at     the       gymnasium.                 I immediately                asked         him

to    despatch 5 sergeants                        and 50 men             to    th e    Leppings            Lane       end and         keep

the    rest       on      standby.           I was       attempting             at     this       st age ,       to     rais Mr.

Locke       on    the       steward's         r a di o    to    inform          him that           there         were       problems

at    th e L e p p i n g s        Lane    end      turnstiles,                but     received         no    reply.

At    about       1447       hours       a further          request            was     received            from

Superintendent                   Marshall,         to    open       the       gates       and     this was            followed            by

Police        Constable            Bichard,         telling          me       that     the      'gate's          gone '       or

'gate's          burst'.           I looked at            the C C T V a n d            saw      that       'C'    gate was            open

a n d all        who      were     immediately            outside             this     gate       - about         o ne      hundred -

gain ed access.                   A mounted         officer          recovered             th e    situation and                   th e

gate     was      closed.           This      was       followed          by a        further message                   from

Superintendent                   Marshall,        asking        fo r      the       gates       to be       opened,           followed

almost        immediately             by a f u r t h e r        message             saying,        "Open         t he    gat e s ,        Open

the    gates".             I turned          to C h i e f      Superintendent                   Duckenfield,                who was

standing          on      th e    raised area and               sa id,         "Mr.       Duckenfield,                are     we    going

to    open       those       gates?"         He    replied,          "Open          the    gates."           Police           Sergeant

Goddard          then      sent     out      a message          to       serials          at    Leppings          Lane        end     to

At about            1449 hours           on the C C T V           I saw        * C ’ gate         opened.         I was      unable

to    see      'A*     or    ’B ’ ga te s.            I saw a m o u n t e d             officer        controlling           the

a    heavy      flow        then went           into     the a r e a          behind       th e W e s t       Stand.

At about            1450 hours,            an    urgent          request          was     then     received           from a unit

behind         ’A*     gate ,       which       is the       exit       gate       fo r    th e    north       stand      (S2Q

Police Sergeant                    Higgins?)          for    that       gate       to     be    opened,        followed

immediately               by a      request          from    the       same       officer,         "The       gate     is g o i n g     to

Superintendent                   Duckenfield           immediately authorised                          th e    gate     to   be

opened and Police                    Sergeant          Goddard          sent       out     the     ra d i o m e s s a g e     to    t h at

At about            1452 hours           th e w e s t       stand appeared                 full.         The     centre       two

pens     of     th e      terrace        appeared           to    be a l m o s t        full,      but     there was          still

some     room at            th e    front       of    the    two w i n g          p e ns a n d     in th e       northern

corner         of    the     north west              standing          a r e a.

At about            1458 hours           I became           aware        of    something           happening           behind       the

west     stand         g oal.        I was       unable          to    see what           it w a s     but     the P o l i c e

Constable            was     opening          either        gates       3 or 4 or              both an d a        handful          of

people         were       coming        out     onto     the      track        and walking             calmly and            slowly

towards         gate        1.      They      then a p p e a r e d        to      stand        rather a i m l e s s l y       on t h e

allow       these         people        in.      Chief       Inspector             McRobbie          was      present        in the

control         room        in     civilian          clothing          and went           down     onto       th t r a c k    to

At about            1459 hours           I became           aware       of     people          climbing        from     the west,

By    about       1500 hours mo r e                 people were                now     being        helped       from         the     gates

was      still     unaware            of    th e    problem,            but     considered             t h at    there may               be

some      pushing         and     crushing            n e a r to        th e    wall       and      t h at    people          in tha t

At    about       1501      hours,          the C h i e f         Superintendent                 asked        for

Superintendent                 Greendwood             to go        to L e p p i n g s       Lane       end an d         find        out

what      was     happening.                More      people           were     now      being       helped         onto       the       track

through          the     gates        and     some were            climbing            over      the     perimeter             fencing

onto      the     track.

By about          1503      hours          more and more                people         wree      now spi ll in g              onto       the

track       and were           standing            on the         grass        behind        the     touchline.                Some were

coming       over        the    fence.             People         were     still         climbing            from      t he    terrace,

Greenwood,             standing            head and          shoulders            above        the     people          at     the     b a ck

of    the    goal,        gesticulating,                    by w a v i n g      his      a r ms .      The m e s s a g e          that        he

was      gesticulating,                clearly           conferred             to m e      that      he w a n t e d         the     game       to

be    stopped and more                     and more          people        were        now spilling              onto         the     grass

and      over     t he    touch-line               o nt o    the       field      of     play.         I heard Police

Sergeant          Goddard         say       "Stop        the      game,        stop      the     game,"          I looked

towards          the     tunnel        and     saw       no m o v e m e n t .          I hastily             grab be d my           hat a n d

c oa t    and Chief            Superintendent                    Duckenfield             said,       "Yes,       stop         i t."       I

went      down     from        th e    control           room      onto        th e    track        and approached                  the

linesman.                He w a s      running           down      towards            the L e p p i n g s       Lane        end,      a n d as

He    ran s t r a i g h t       past        and     obviously             had     not      h e a r d me a n d w a s            intent          on

his      duties.          As    I turned            to      follow        him,        I saw S u p e r i n t e n d e n t

On    returning           to     the     control          room,      at     about        1505 hours              I c o u l d se e

that    more     and mOre               people were               spilling         onto     the .pitch. an d w e r e                 now

At about        1506        hours,        Police          Constable             Ry a n was       passing             messages        over

the    public        address            system and            people        on     the     field        of      play were          just

milling        around.            Some        were       lying      down and         it w a s         becoming           apparent

that    there wer e              some      injuries.               Superintendent                Duckenfield                a ske d me

to go     down       onto        th e    field and            try an d          clear      the     people            f r o m the     g oa l

area    towards           th e w i n g s .          As    I left       th e       control        room,          I was       aware     of

Police      Constable             Bichard           requesting             an ambulance               to     stand       by.

On arrival           on     the     f ie l d ,      at a b o u t     1507         hours,        I sa w       that       people

appeared        shocked and                dazed - some              were         lying     on the           gr ou nd an d were

obviously        injured.                As    I approached                th e    goa l    I could             not    see     the

gates     onto       t he      track      as       these      were     surrounded               by p o l i c e        officers,         but

I could        see    that        people           were apparently                 jammed        hard a g ain st             th e w i r e

fence and        their           faces were              starting          to     discolour.               I was       aware       t hat

we    had a serious               problem and               that     many         people m a y          be      injured.           I was

not    in p o s s e s s i o n      of a        radio a n d          realised         that        one       or    t wo a m b u l a n c e s

would     be    insufficient.                      I approached             two     police         constables,               neither

of whom        had    radios            and    then       saw a      sergeant            and     took        his      radio     from

him.      I could           now    se e       that       s o me    officers         were        giving          mouth       to m o u t h

resuscitation               to    people           lying      on    t he    grass        and     th at       officers          and

spectators           wre       trying         to    get     people         over     t he    fence          but w i t h       little

At    about      15 0 8 tiours           I called             control       and was             acknowledged.                    I asked

fo r a      " fl e e t    of a m b u l a n c e s '         as m a n y      people          appeared          to       be    injured.               I

requested           continuous               tannoy messages                   to    the L e p p i n g s         Lane       end     to as k

people       to m o v e       ba ck.          I may also             have       requested             cutting          equipment           for

the    fences.           With       other          officers,             I attempted             to    c l ea r       othar       people

from     the     field',         who     appeared             to    be    just       standing          around and getting

in th e w a y       of      injured           pe op le.            Some    of       these       people were                in a n

agitated         s ta t e .

At    1510 hours            there        was       s t il l    no a p p a r e n t         movement          at    the       back     of    the

centre       pens a n d          people were               s t ill       spilling          onto       the    pit c h .           I made a

that     many       police         officers           were         engaged          in the       rescue          operation along

the    fen c e .

At    about      1514       hours,           I made        my way         to    the       rear    of Lep pings               Lane

terraces         and      i nt o    th e      central          tunnel.              The    tunnel       was       almost          clear,

with about           50     persons           in     it.           I saw an          Inspector          and with             him and

other       officers,            moved        people          out    of    th e      tunnel       and       on    to       the

concourse           at    the      re ar      of     the      sta nd .

At a b o u t     1522 hours              I made         my way           back       to    the    pitch.           Spectators              were

encroaching              up to      t he      half-way             line,       some       in a n g r y a n d          threatening

mood,       saying        it w a s       a    "shitty          ground*          and       gesticulating                with       their

arms     towards          Forest         supporters.                 A man attempted                   to    c l i m b on         t o p of

the    goalposts            at     the       Leppings          Lane       end,       but    before          he    could          stand        on

top    of    th e    posts         he w a s        pulled          down    by       police       officers.                 This     invoked

adverse        reaction            from       the     crowd.             This       ma n was      very drunk                but     I

instructed           officers            no t      to a r r e s t        him and          he w a s     allowed             to go.         I

saw    that      serials           were       deployed along                   the       track    at     the      north          stand and

being     used         to     carry         injured       people       away        and       police       officers        were

At     about       1523       hours,         I was      contacted            by a       senior         fire s e rv ic e        officer

and asked           if      I could m a intain a                   clear      gangway          in the         south     stand        for

the     removal          of      casualties.              This       was     arranged          with       two    or    three

police        officers            and       the    h e l p of m e m b e r s        of    the       public       in t h a t     area,

At     about       1533       hours         I returned          to    ground        control            and appraised            the

At     about      1345 hours             I spoke          with a       senior         fire        officer,          who    requested

that     all      ambulances             f r o m the        South      stand/Leppings                   Lane     si de,     be

stage,       as    if     they       left        the    ground,        they would                seriously          hamper       the

rescue       operation             by b l o c k i n g      the     lines        of    communication                 between       the

Chief       Superintendent                  Nesbit        requested         that          dog    handlers           be d e p l o y e d

                                at*


                  endent of the South Yorkshire Police, stationed

 t Hammerton Rc ad Police Station and sub-divisional commander

of the FI sub-division, which includes Sheffield Wednesday

Football grounc    at Hillsborough.    I was posted to this sub­

division on 14    larch 1988.   Since then I have regularly

carried out duties in connection with football matches at

Hillsborough, including the 1988 FA Cup semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest.       On all these occasions I

have worked from the environment of the ground control room.

I have 23 years police experience and have worked regularly

at football matches as a constable at Huddersfield Town, as

a sergeant at Barnsley and as a Chief Inspector at Barnsley.

I have worked occasionally as a sergeant at Hillsborough,

Rotherham and Doncaster.



On or about 20 March 1989, I was informed by Chief

Superintendent Mole that the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between

Liverpool and Nottingham Forest would be played at

Hillsborough on either the 15 or 16 April 1989.           I was later

informed that this match would be played on Saturday 15

April 1989, with the traditional 3 pm kick-off. At 3 pm that

day, I met with Chief Superintendent Mole and Inspector

Sewell and as this was a repeat of the same fixture the

previous year, which had passed without serious incident, w#

decided to base the order on the previous year's event.
                                                           2

The order was to be prepared by Chief Inspector Beal and

Inspector Sewell.   I was asked by Chief Superintendent Mole

to aim for a manpower reduction on 1988/ of 10% in the

interest of most effective and efficient utilisation of

resources as it was to my knowledge that the previous year,

spme officers had been under employed.   I communicated    this

to the planning team, with the suggestion that this could be

achieved in the main, by reducing the public order serials

from one sergeant and 10 constables to one sergeant and

eight constables.   As a result of the previous year's

experience there were a number of areas where I considered

arrangements could be improved.   Some were to be included in

the operational order and others by contingency or

instruction.   The following were to be included in the

order; reinforcement of ’flash-point' at Leppings Lane

roundabout at junction with Penistone Road with 4 serials, 4

horses, 4 dogs and 2 vans; reinforcement of the track to

prevent a pitch invasion as occurred the previous year by

introducing a further 4 serials at the end of the game; west

stand serial to be particular vigilant in preventing

climbing into that stand from the terraces below; any

Liverpool supporters on the Kop to be contained in the

segregated area on the Kop especially identified and

cordonned for this purpose; buses to be parked immediately

outside the ground at Leppings Lane end and Penistone Road

end to hold 5 serials each during the match of officers who

were previously on stand-by at Claywheels Lane and too

far away to be deployed quickly; three prisoner vans to be

available to respond to requests for transport for prisoners

arrested outside the ground and avoid having to utilise
                                                                3
 mobile serials for this purpose; all officers to be provided

 with at least one hot meal; call-signs for Chief Inspectors

 and above to be by way of their names to avoid confusion.

 By instruction; one officer to be identified to deal with      ’

 any VIP's to avoid others being taken away from recognised

 roles; the CCTV link utilised the previous year from Wadsley

 Bridge station to be cancelled as this took up considerable

 radio space when being set up and the monitor took up

 valuable space in the control room; a communications officer

 to be available at the ground to deal with any communication

 problems.   By negotiation; buses for transport of Kop and

 south stand supporters to be positioned nearer to city to

 assist Segregation.   By arrangement with the club; signs to

 the ground to be provided and erected by the AA.   By

 contingency; any excesses of private vehicles for Liverpool

supporters to be directed to the Wisewood/Winn Gardens area;

if large numbers of supporters without tickets, mobile

serials to attempt to locate and remove to, Nottingham

Forest supporters to Hillsborough Park, Liverpool supporters

to Cole Road.



At 10 am on 22 March 1989 I attended a meeting at Haxnmerton

Road Police Station, chaired by Chief Superintendent Mole

and which was attended by all interested parties, who had

been invited.   I recall that at the meeting it was mentioned

that Liverpool were unhappy with the allocation of tickets

and being given the Leppings Lane end and north stand.

There was a strong representation from officials of British

Rail to alter these arrangements as well in order that

Nottingham Forest fans could use Wadsley Bridge railway
                                                                4

station as early indications were that many more Nottingham

fans would be travelling by special train, than Liverpool.

As a result of this, X later discussed with Chief

Superintendent Mole, whether we could re-appraise the

allocation of the ground.     We discussed and agreed that in

view of it meaning all supporters would have to cross and

that as it was an exact replica of the previous year's

fixture and fairly fresh in travelling supporters' minds and

they would no doubt park and resort to the same areas as

last year, that the probability of public order situations

arising in many areas would be too high and it was not

possible to re-arrange accommodation in the ground.



On 29 March 1989 with Chief Inspector Beal and Inspector

Sewell, I attended a meeting with Chief Superintendent Ducken­

field, when we discussed the draft operational order and

current state of planning and decided to go ahead with the

order with some minor amendments.



At 12.30 pm on 5 April 1989, I visited Sheffield Wednesday

football ground with Inspector Sewell and saw the Force

catering officer, regarding the siting of a mobile canteen

and prison buses.



At 2.30 pm on 10 April 1989, I attended a meeting at

Hammerton Road Police Station, chaired b y Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield and attended by the Sector

Superintendents and officers from 'D',Division, Operations

and Traffic and British Transport Police and discussed

arrangements for the event.

                                                                          5

        At 2 pm on 12 April 1989, I was present when Chief

        Superintendent Duckenfield gave a press conference in the

        conference room at Haxnmerton Road Police Station.



        At 10.30 am on 13 April 1989 with Inspector Sewell, I

        attended Sheffield Wednesday Football Club and met with the

        club Secretary, Mr Graham Mackerell and discussed

        arrangements for the event.      At the conclusion of this

        meeting with Inspector Sewell, I made a full inspection of

        the ground.



        At 9.15 am on Friday 14 April 1989, I travelled to

        Hillsborough and at 10 am officers of the rank of Inspector

        and above, were briefed by Chief Superintendent Duckenfield.

        I then gave a full briefing from my briefing notes, followed

        by a briefing by Inspector Sewell.       The sector

        Superintendents then took officers under their command to

        different parts of the ground to brief them on their

        specific responsibilities..     The briefing by Mr Duckenfield,

        myself and Inspector Sewell, lasted for approximately 45

        minutes.   On return to Hammerton Road Police Station, I

        discussed with Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, cutting

        down my input on briefing, as we could not hold officers'

        attention for so long.     I would merely confine my briefing

        to the important aspects and let sector Superintendents and

        Inspectors, cover all other aspects.           This was agreed.



                                               jaanr

        Hammerton Road Police Station and c a r r i e d o u t genera
duties.    Checked the incident that had been created on

Command and Control and found that it had been closed.

Incident re—opened with instructions that all matters in

relation to the semi-final should be entered on it.     The

only other information available at this time, was that

there was a large amount of rubble in Parkside Road area

from excavations and this was to be cleared before 10 am.



At 0915 hours I went to Hillsborough, arriving at about 0930

hours.



At 0945 hours I was checking that everything OK for briefing

and arranging at request of one of thesector Superintendents

for copies of the public house check—list to be obtained for

distribution to all serial sergeants and Inspectors on duty

outside the ground.



At 1000 hours the briefing of all officers commenced on

time.     Chief Superintendent Duckenfield opening brief,

followed by    myself as per my briefing notes.   Followed by

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth on Crime Intelligence,

followed by Inspector Sewell on administrative matters in

relation to issue of radios and meals.     This briefing took

approximately 20 minutes.     After the briefing I spoke to the

mobile camera crew and informed them that they had a 'roving

commission' before the match.     During the match they were to

take up a position in front of the north stand, close to the

Kop end and maintain a low profile, only filming any

incidents that were of note and where video evidence would
                                      s
be beneficial.
                                                               7

At about 1035 hours, I took up position in ground control.

Police Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan and Police

Constable Bichard already on duty in control room.   Informed

them that Police Sergeant Goddard would be responsible for

radio reception and transmission, Police Constable Ryan for

the public address system and the telephones and Police

Constable Bichard for the CCTV operation and operation of

the VHP pack-set to Force Operations Room, channel 1.

Besides being responsible for overall command of the control

room, I would attempt to keep my own personal log of events.

(A log had never been kept in previous years, due to the

limited space in the control room and there being

insufficient room for a log writer.   My experience from the

previous semi-final was that at de-brief it was difficult to

remember all events of significance and this log would serve

as a memory-jogger).   At this time, a civilian member of the

communications department was in the control room.   I

informed him that he was welcome to stay for the time being

in case we had any commupication problems, but that he would

have to leave and base himself in the gymnasium once the

Chief Superintendent took up his positions in control, due

to limited space.   At this time serials were taking their

      in the north stand and had been instructed to be

               their points by 11.15 am.
            the Nottingham Forest sector additional radios had been

            requested in order that officers, who would not normally be

            issued with radios, could be left in the proximity of these

            pubs and havi         ^Jditional communication.

            were no real problems apparenf7’"*aft§irt from the usual, with

            this type of event.         We then went together onto the Track,

            with the intention of seeing the referee.          I identified the

            referee who was on the pitch, talking with other people and

            we waited about 5 minutes for          him to leave the field and

            then followed him to the referee's room.          With .the lines­

            men, he was informed that in general, the field of play was

            his responsibility, but we^-reserved the right at any time to

            come onto the field if circumstances merited this.             He was

            informed of the emergency evacuation procedure and the coded

            message and also informed of the procedure for stopping the

            match by way of the south stand lines-man.             He was informed

            that there would be a further brief after the event.



            At about 1405 hours I returned to the control room and saw
                         it ACC (Ops) Mr Jackson, was in attendance.                Mr

                      Due          I appraised him of the current situation,

         and the north west terrace.    There were large clear sections

         in the pen, under the control box and the pen on the north

         side of the double railings.    There was a large crowd

         outside the Leppings Lane turnstiles, but I was convinced

         that the turnstiles could cope with these numbers and

         remarked to Chief Superintendent Duckenfield, that there was

         a aood crowd outside, but we still had half an hour to kick

         off and we would get them in by three o'clock.       About this

         time, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield asked me to remind

         him of what we had decided about delaying the kick-off.       I

         informed him that we had agreed that if there was an

         identifiable problem, such as a serious accident on the

         motorway, or bad weather over the Pennines, which prevented

         people arriving on time, that we would delay - but if it was

         merely that people had arrived in time, but decided to go

         elsewhere, rather than the ground and arrived at the last

         mrttute, then we would not normally delay it,

           the Leppings Lane end to use the tannoy system to ask

           people outside the turnstiles to stop pushing as people were

           going to be injured.        Police Constable Ryan immediately

           started to pass these messages over the public address

           system.     :I instructed him to keep talking and passing on the

           mess age.

        the gymnasium.     Before he could make the call the

        communications officer appeared in the control room and said

        that he had realised we were having radio problems and an

        officer had brought him to the control room.          He described

        the fault as the    'Norman Collier' type fault of messages

        breaking up.     The base stations are situated under the

        control room desk and he set to work on them.          We were

        operating from a 'tulip' type microphone and I gained the

        impression that he disconnected this microphone and

        substituted a telephone hand-set type microphone for it.



        Radio messages were coming in and the telephone microphone

        was handed to Police Sergeant Goddard.        He passed out a

        radio message and the reply was grossly distorted and

        unreadable.    Police Sergeant Goddard tried a second time and

        the result was the same.      He put the handset on the desk and

        looked exasperated.     I said to the communications officer.

        appeared to stand rathe^N^imlessly on the track and the

        police woman standing at gate 1, who was only a few yards

        away, was totally unaware of their presence.                              There was room

        at the front of this pen and it seemed obvious to open this

        gate and allow these people in.        Chief Inspector McRobbie

        was present in the control room in civilian clothing and

        went down onto the track to assist her and draw her

        attention to what was happening.



        At about 14>a hours I became aware o T ^ o p l e climbing from
                                                                                               -'v.

By about 1500 hours more people were now being helped from

the gates at 3 and 4, onto the track.                 No radio traffic was

being received and I was still unaware of the problem, but

considered that there may be some pushing and crushing near

to the wall and that people in that location were being

taken out for re-location in the two wing pens.

                 and Chief Superintendent Duckenfield said,

                     went down from the control room onto the

                  led the linesman.       He was running down

took hold of his arm        said,    "Stop the game."     He ran

Straight past and obviously'Na              rd    me and was intent

on his duties.   As I turned t              im, I saw

Superintendent Greenwood runn               ^ pitch and stopping

the game.   I then returned immediately to        tfi   control room.



 n returning to the 'qontroiv room, at about 1505 houi

could see that more and ntbaie ^ o p l e were spilling onto the
                                    v.


pitch and were now scattering o>e^t;he field, towards t h ^

edge of the penalty area.     I was unawSs^e                          \

messages being received and of what the prob^em was, but

some people were sitting on the field.



At about 1506 hours, Police Constable Ryan was passing

messages over the public address system and people on the

field of play were just milling around.          Some were lying...

down and it was becoming apparent that there were some

injuries.   Superintendent Duckenfield asked me to go down

onto the field and try and clear people from the goal area

towards the wings.     As I left the control room, I was aware

of Police Constable Bichard requesting an ambulance to stand

by.



On arrival on the field, at about 1507 hours, I saw that

people appeared shocked and dazed - some were lying on the
ground and were obviously injured.       As I approached the goal

I could not see the gates onto the track as these were

surrounded by police officers, but I could see that people

were apparently jammed hard against the wire fence and their

faces were starting to discolour.       I was aware that we had a

serious problem and that many people may be injured.         I was

not in possession of a radio and realised that one or two

ambulances would be insufficient.       I approached two police

constables, neither of whom had radios and then saw a

sergeant and took his radio from him.        I could now see that

some officers were giving mouth to mouth resuscitation to

people lying on the grass and that officers and spectators

were trying to get people over the fence but with little

success.     There was no apparent movement at the rear of the

two centre pens and these people in this area seemed to be

merely^s^anding and looking out onto the field



^j^giout. 1508 hours lygalled control and was acknowledged.

 "asked tdY   a   \ 'fleet of ambulancesi as many people appeared

to be injured.       I requested conxsisnuous tannoy messages to

the Leppings Lane, end to ask p e o p l e \ o move back.   I may

also have requested cutting equipment f o ^ t h e fences.      With

other officers,      I attempted to clear other people from the

field, who appeared to be just standing around and getting

in the way of injured people.       Some of these people were in

an agitated state.



At 1510 hours there was still no apparent movement at the

back of the centre pens and people were still spilling onto

the pitch.     I made a further radio request for tannoy
                                                          19


messages for people at Leppings Lane terraces to move back.

There was still no movement and I could see that many police

officers were engaged in the rescue operation along the fence.



At about 1514 hours, I made my way to the rear of Leppings

Lane terraces and into the central tunnel.     The tunnel was

almost clear, with about 50 persons in i t .   I saw an Inspector

and with him and other officers, moved people out of the

tunnel and on to the concourse at the rear of the stand.



At about 1522 hours I made my way back to the pitch.

Spectators were encroaching up to the half-way line, some

in angry and threatening mood, saying it was a 'shitty ground'

and gesticulating with their arms towards Forest supporters.

A man attempted to climb on top of the goalposts at the

Leppings Lane end, but before he could stand on top of the

posts he was pulled down by police officers.     This invoked

adverse reaction from the crowd.    This man was very drunk

but I instructed officers not to arrest him and he was

allowed to go. I saw that serials were deployed along the

track at the north stand and to a lesser degree along the

Kop, but not along the south stand. I took one serial from

the north stand^^olic^>$>ergeaRt Dys«m) and asked them to

re-deploy on th^^oujt'k-^tanas6j^ie /N^eaV to the half-way

line to prevent supporters encroaching over the half-way

line and causing problems which would hinder the rescue

operation.     A full scale rescue operation was being

carried out.     Advertising hoardings were being used to carry

injured people away and police officers were still giving

             were being carried towards the gymnasium exit and some

             towards the players' tunnel by Liverpool supporters and

             police officers.



             At about 1525 hours, I was contacted by a senior fire

              service officer and asked if I could maintain a clear

            ^ gangway in "the south stand for the removal of casualties.

              This was arranged with two or three police officers and the

              help of members of the public in that area, who offered

              assistance.



              At about 15 30 I spoke to Superintendent Chapman on the

              pitch, who said he would look after the Kop end and the

              officers deployed there and then spoke to Inspector Wallace,

              who said he would look after the north stand and officers

              deployed in that area.



    X;^ ^ ^ A t a ^ q u t   15 35 ^ ^ 5 ^ 1   returifecK^o grmKitt^qontrol and

                     i           >Chief Superintendent of the sitbatiori as best

              I could.       1^told_him that there were many injuries and

              possibly some fatalities.           At this time there was an

              ambulance on the perimeter track and there were still

              hundreds of people on the Leppings Lane half of the field.

              I saw that some police officers were beginning to deploy

              towards the halfway line.           A number of ambulances had taken

              up position in the road from the south stand towards

              Leppings Lane.        Police control contained the Chief

              Superintendent and ACC (Operations).            The Chief

              Superintendent left control followed by ACC to visit
                                                               21

Directors and appraise them of the situation.    The control

room was arranging for off-duty police constables to attend

at Hammerton Road Police Station and Casualty Bureau staff

at the ground to attend Ecclesfield.    Assistance was offered

to me by officers of Humberside mounted department, who had

been at the Barnsley football match and I accepted this and

asked them to attend the ground.



At about 1545 hours I spoke with a senior fire officer, who

requested that all ambulances from the south stand/Leppings

Lane side, be transferred to the Penistone Road end - this

was arranged.   About this time, a cordon was being arranged

across the pitch at the halfway line.



A short time later, ground control was visited by Mr Brian

Clough and Mr Kenny Dalgliesh.   Chief Superintendent

Duckenfield spoke to them and advised them that the game

would be abandoned and they may tell the players but he did

not wish to tell the supporters at this stage, as if they

left the ground, they would seriously hamper the rescue

operation by blocking the lines of communication between the

around and the hospitals.   Both agreed to this course of

action and Mr Dalgliesh spoke to the Liverpool fans by the

public address system and asked them to keep calm and this

was well-received.


                  ISI^s b 1 1
Chief SuperintendentA requested that dog handlers be deployed

and this was arranged and they were asked to go to the

Penistone Road end of the ground for deployment.
About 1610 hours a,message was received from ACC

(Operations) Mr Jackson that people in the stadium could be

told that the e/ent was to be abandoned.      Messages were




sympathy and underH^ndijig_-**ith-



I passed . . . a full public address message inf

stadium that the event had been atjandoned and requested that

thev retained their tickets and inforlagd them that there had

 een a serious^^Tnci<3ent with many casualties and requested

             xHffiain in tHeTr~pj-a^es. for a _s    while, until

we were sure that all the injured had been

hospital.   This message was repeated twice



This was well-received and it was not until about ten

minutes later that people, started to leave the stadium.      The

stadium slowly empited.     About 1630 hours the Chief

Constable contacted ground control and       was appraised of the

situation by ACC   (Operations) Mr Jackson.



Ground Control was visited at different times to my

knowledge by Mr Mackrell, the Club Secretary, the Deputy

Chief Constable of Merseyside, Senior Fire Officers, the

Production Manager of the BBC team, who offered to put out

the Casualty Enquiry Bureau number.



As the crowd dispersed, reports of fighting were received at
                                                              23

several locations, including Wadsley Lane, Parkside Road and

'Bassetts' public house on Cowper Avenue and Penistone Road

and mobile serials were dispatched to deal with each

problem.



Liaison was maintained with the Coroner and the Coroner's

Officer.    Initially, authority was given to call out the

firm of Kenyons to deal with the deceased, but this was

later amended to indicate that no bodies should be moved

until they had been photographed and identified at the ground

and then this was to be carried out by the ambulance

service.    All messages were relayed to the gymnasium.



The two centre pens of the Leppings Lane terraces were

searched by a team of Criminal Investigation Department

officers under the control of Detective Sergeant Lindley.

The terraces were later searched on a second occasion by

officers of 'D' Division support group whom I had deployed to

contain this area.    After, the second search the area was

'taped o f f '.



About 6.30 pm units were deployed to assist in the area of

the Northern General Hospital after reports had been

received that large numbers of Liverpool supporters were

gathering and problems were feared.    At about 8 pm officers

on reserve duty at Hammerton Road were detailed to contain

the gymnasium after reports that members of the press were

causing problems and trying to gain access to this area.



About 9 pm I took up duties in the temporary mortuary,
                                                            24

counselling officers and liaising with welfare and clerical

workers.



About 10.40 pm I visited Niagara Sports club, where I had

been informed a large number of officers had been taken

suffering from shock, associated with the incident and

assisted in a counselling role.



About 11.30 pm I returned to Hanunerton Road Police Station

to check that arrangements had been made for visits by VIP's

who were schedueled to visit later that day and continued:1

to counsel officers   on duty at that station.



At 0100 hours I retired from duty.

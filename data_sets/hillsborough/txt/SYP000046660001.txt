   Dear Sir

   On 1st April 1990 I was appointed to take over the Hillsborough Disaster
   Inquiry following the appointment of Mr G Diear to the post of Her Majesty’s
   Inspector of Constabulary. Mr Mervyn Jones, Assistant Chief Constable, is
   overseeing the Coronal aspects on behalf of the Coroner Dr Stefan Popper
   ahd I shall take charge of the Criminal Investigation and matters relating
   to complaints against the Police.

   I now enclose for your information copies of the video and photographic
   material you requested when you met Detective Chief Superintendent Foster
   at Furnival House.

   We are now in a position to commence the interviews of your client at your
   earliest convenience. To assist this if you contact Detective Chief
   Superintendent Foster direct on              the necessary arrangements can
   be made.

                mat c h .

                We left the Pomona        blic House at about       1.30 pm (1330 hrs) and caught

                a number 83 bus to the Middlewood Rd,           from where we walked to the

                Ground.     Traffic was heavy as you would expect on a Cup semi-final

                day;   in fact as we neared the Ground in Middlewood Rd, we decided to

                get off the bus and walk because it would be quicker.

                We would have got off the bus at about 2.10-2.15 pm (1410-1415 hrs)                     in

                the vicinity of a park about half a mile from the Ground.                  There were

                some fans about but not that many, and from their accents and scarves

                I would say the fans were a mix of Nottingham Forest fans and

                Liverpool   fans.     It appeared to me that the pubs in the area were

                 cl/VT
to be Liverpool fans, but there was no drunkenness and no disorderly

behaviour;    everybody just appeared to be in high spirits,                 looking

forward to the match.           There were quite a few Policemen about but they

did not appear to have anything to deal with.

It being about S . 15 pm (1415 hrs), we thought it would be pointless to

go to the Ground early,          so we headed along Middlewood            Rd past Leppings

Ln junction and on to a          Pakistani   run corner shop/off          licence about a

quarter of a mile along Middlewood Rd.              As we neared the off licence,

which I have used before on match days,             I noticed that the area was

now more of Liverpool fans.           It was as if coaches dropped off fans in

the area and they were making their way to the Ground on foot.                      Again

a small    percentage were drinking from cans but none were drunk.                     I

cannot remember seeing any Police            in the vicinity of the off licence.

As we walked past the Leppings Ln junction,              I remember two separate

Liverpool    supporters asked if any of us had spare tickets.

I went    into the off licence which was not full and purchased a couple

of cans of lager, which          I drank on the way back down to the Ground.

My friends also bought a couple of cans.

We walked down Middlewood Rd, Catch Bar Ln and into Leppings Ln.

There was still a number of fans going that way with us which would

not be unusual.        It appeared to me that there was less Police               in the

roads im med ia tel y\around the Ground than last year.                 As I came down

the hill to Leppings^Wi entrance,            the area o \ t h e       entrance was just a

m a ^ \ of people.     It was    clear toNjje the Police nad no control as there

well.     Three were about the sides and one was just moving backwards

and forwards in the middle of all the fans.               As I neared the gates            I

was aware the Policemen on the horses were telling fans to queue up

and others to get back.           It was my opinion they were making matters

                    worse because people were having to push into others to avoid the

                    horses.        I would say there must have been about 2,000 people                      in the

                    vicinity of the turnstiles.                        I noticed that unlike   last year there was

                    no steward control               on t>s$ gates into the turnstile area.              At last

                    year's semi-final,               stewards      checked your tickets almost on the road

                    outside the entrance and you were only allowed into the turnstile area

                        if you        a ticket.           I must have reached the entrance to the

                    turnstiles aifaut 2.30-2.35                   pm (1430-1435 hrs);     by this stage     I could

                    not see anybody drinking from cans and we had discarded our cans                               on

                        the road on       the way down.          There were a     few foot Police    in the

                    vicinity of           the entrance,         but they were      not directing fans about and

                    did nothing           to try and stop the obvious crush that was occurring by

                    the turnsti1e s .

                        I was aware of a           lot of movement of fans along the side of the                 River

                    Don towards what              I took to be an entry point.           I could    not see where

                        it was at first,          but I went under a crush barrier and around to where

                    blue Gate C was open slightly.                       A few people were getting through but

                        it appeared the Police were trying to close the gate.                       My friend,

                    pushed away by a Police Officer and the gates were                         closed.     The

Policemen on the gates were on the Ground side of the doors.

As this happened,   a Policeman on a horse came into the gate area and

tried to push us all from outside the gate back into the area of

Gate B on the other side of the crush barrier.             In my opinion,    that

only made matters worse because it meant we were really crushed.                As

the horse was manoeuvring,    the Policeman was shouting,         "Get back".         I

had to duck to avoid the horse's head and I saw the rear of the horse

swing   into         , hitting his shoulder and knocking him about.

I was pushed back    into the Gate B area and was aware of a few more

Police on foot and on horses who were now in the vicinity of the gate.

The turnstiles were still    closed.     It would have been about two

minutes from the closing of the gate to it being opened again.                This

time I was one of the first throuqh.         There was ---------^

    door but they were doing nothing to direct fans, and everyone was

just heading towards the tunnel       because you could see the pitch.           I

know the Ground,    but to a person who does not know the Ground,            there

were'-op signs or Police/stewards directing fans about to the sides of

the standi

Together with            I headed straight for the toilet to the left of

the tunnel as you go towards    it.    When I came out the few people who

were corning through theNjlue Gate C had turned into a stream,              and we

were both guided down into^^t^ie^^nne 1 by other fans.x^By now                  and

        who had waited by the toilets,     joined us.       The     ?1 was full

but movement was slowly being made towards the terraces.            I saw no

Police and no stewards.     It was not uncomfortable         in the tunnel    but

you did not have much leeway.     As I reached the terraces         I went to the

    I held ckpto             and managed to get behind a crush barrier near the

    divider fe\:e      about halfway down the terrace.           I was aware my brother

            md         tad not managed to get behind a fence and they seemed to

    be swept      away from me in the direction of the divider fence between

    Pens 2 and 3.

                 and myself were pushed against a crush barrier about 6 feet

    away from the pitch perimeter fence.            I realised my position was not

    the best      in view of the crush barrier being         inflexible and managed to

    ease around the barrier to the pitch side of it.                 The pressure was no

    easier and I was being crushed with my back against the barrier.                         I

    was unable to view the perimeter fence now for the heads around me.                          I

    could not move my arms and I was having difficulty breathing.                       I would

    have been stood unable r i move for about ten minutes.

    I remember a body was passea over my h e a d ; I could not move my arms to

    help,    but I ducked down as much as I could move my head.                    I could not

    say anything to describe the body.            The pressure eased slightly and I

    saw gaps appt^ring      in front.    As they appeared I saw onto the pitch
                                                                      c fV T   -
    briefly;      the playgrs were off the pitch.         Fans were trying to climb

    over .the perimeter fence onto the pitch but w^re apparently being

    pushed^babfc^ down by Police.       I looked towards th^yfront of the pen and

    realised why the gaps h a d ^ p e a r e d ;   there w e r e ^ o p l e    lying on the

    that so I turned away.        I could not describe the bodies.                 I tried to

    look about for my brother,       but could not see him.            I remember seeing

    one man right by us.       His   legs were trapped by a crush barrier and

    people.       He was sort of sitting on the barrier,           going paler and paler.

    His   legs must have been released because I saw him seconds                    later,

    climbing over people's heads to the perimeter fence;                    he had no shoes

    on.     I could describe him as a white male, aged 20 years, 6*0,                   slim

               I saw a lot of people had started to leave,                         so                  and me made our

              way towards the tuhiiel which we could see was the best way out.                                     There

               distressed.         About 4.45 pm <1645 hrs),            I left the Ground area

               completely to go to where we originally said we would meet after the

               game.     I was relieved when on the way to the meeting point                               I found my

               brother safe and was told all our friends except                                                 were

               accounted for.

               We returned to the Polytechnic w a lking;                  it took us until 6.45 pm

               <1845 hrs).         When we got there,       I learned                       was also safe.

               I was never asked for my ticket              <ticket No. LL3 125) and still have                          it

               fully intact and could produce it to an enquiry                               <Marked        )

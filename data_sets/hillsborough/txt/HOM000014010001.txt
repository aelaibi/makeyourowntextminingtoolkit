Mr C


                    HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY



    The Home Secretary was approached by Mr Anthony Beaumont-
Dark, MP yesterday evening concerning the burden falling on the
West Midlands Police from their investigation into the
Hillsborough Disaster. He said that in addition to the direct
costs of the investigation falling to West Midlands, there would
be a need for officers engaged on normal duties to work a good
deal more overtime in order to police the county effectively
while their colleagues were engaged on the Inquiry. He was
anxious that West Midlands should be reimbursed for the
additional costs they would incur.

2. The Home Secretary undertook to write to Anthony Beaumont-
Dark as quickly as possible about the position, and would be
grateful for a draft letter. The Home Secretary commented to me
that you will no doubt be taking the position reached over the
Guildford Inquiry fully into account in framing your
recommendations.

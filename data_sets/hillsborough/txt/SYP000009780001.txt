A c c o r d i n g l y any L iv er po ol                  fans         on    the    Hop       should          be    sent     to     that

a r ea ,        I wa s       told        that      under         no    circumstances                   would Liverpool                 fans      be

escorted             from     the K o p          to     either         the       west       or N o r t h      stand.

Explaining                this      to     the     fans       at      the       gate    kept          me    quite    busy.            I wa s

amazed          at     their        attitude            w h i c h was           abusive          insulting          and

aggressive,.                 Even        though         the      tickets          quite          plainly          stated        that    it wa s

there        wa s      not    sufficient                room       for      transfers             etc.        Usually           this

A   couple           of     the     more        'r e a s o n a b l e ’ L i v e r p o o l          supporters             explained           to me

that       they        felt       they were             always         cheated          on       the       ticket    allocations               so

them         in the          press       wit h ,     to my       knowledge,             no    denials         from       them       I for

At      tne       actual       time       of    the       incident       it was          very        f r u s t r a t l n g , nobody

seemed            to    know what           was      happening          or w h a t       they were            supposed          to     do.

is      so    obvious          once       a disaster             like    this       ha d      occurred            that    the

vacuation               is    only       the    start       of    the    problem and                 that     the    serials

really            do    need a disaster                   role    allocated             to    them.

j ~ a n e At          Hi 1 1 s b o r o u g h     there         is a     policy        of w o r k i n g          the     same       area        or

duty    at      each match.                  1 have        worked        the       Leppings           Lane        turnstiles              up       to

going      on     the       Crime       and     vandal          unit,       during         those        3 years            I spent

match      duties           as    a    reserve          s e ri a l    and     ha d    to b e c o m e           familiar           w i t h the

areas      of     the       ground.

Over    the       last S y e a r s             I think          I've     worked           every       major          match,        since

April      1 9 88       .[ have        been      in OLD.             During        this        time     my m a t c h        duties         vary

d e tw & e n    I n e S o u t ft s t a n d a n d t h e H e r x m e t e r t r a c k .

At   the       en d    of     the      day     I think          the    thing         that       upsets          me    is the

hypocracy             behind          it all.           No t    just     by    the        pr ess      who       one     minute          are

calling         for      these         football          hooligans            to     be    caged,          segregated              etc,

then    the       next w ax i ng             lyrical           about     the       feelings           of    being          on     the

stand with             such a          good      bunch         of    lads.           B u t the       TV,        other       Police

forces,         c hu r c h e s ,       etc.,      all      joined        in a f t e r a w h i l e .                  I started             to

wonder       whether             we'd    ever       had        such    problems            as    the       R e d Arm y ,          the    Inter

City    firm and              all      the     rest.           Above     all       that        though       is the          blindness

by   the     Liverpool                people      themselves,                 I wonder           why       no     one      has     asked

w'fty ciid the           Liverpool             fans      keeping         pushing           forward?               What      made        t h e m?

iftey w e r e n ' t         running          from       fire,        explosion,            not       even       b e in g    chased         by

police.          So      just         what     di d m o t i v a t e      them        to    charge          th rough an             open

themselves             down a          12-13      foot         wide    tunnel.             Finally          to       pressure           the

              map.      I took         up          that          position after                   briefing            etc.      Only     deviation

              was    tha t a b o u t           1.30pm             (1330)         at    the        direction            of P o l i c e    Sergeant

              Chapman,          I went             to       the    gymnasium              for     a m e al,           following         which    I

              returned          to m y         point.

              4.      During          the          briefing              I had        been        told         that    a   large    number       of

              Liverpool          f ans         h ad         purchased            tickets           for         the S p i o n Hop,       which        was

              intended          to    be       only          for       Notts         Forest        fans.             It was     estimated        that

              over    1,000 L i v e rp o o l                     f ans      had Kop        tickets              and    some     problems        were       to   be

             a n t i c i pa t e d .
I was      told        t h at    under         no       c i r curnstances             would Liverpool                   fans     be

escorted          from      the K o p          to       either         the W e s t         or N o r t h S t a n d .

Explaining             this      to     the        f ans      at     the      g ate       kept me       quite        busy.           I was

a m a z e d at     their         attitude               w hich was abusive,                      insulting           and    aggressive.

Even      though        the      tickets            quite          plainly           stated        t hat     it w a s      for a N o t t s

Forest       supporters               area         the L i v e r p o o l           fans     had     bought          them.        I explained

about      it b e i n g         all     ticket           match         etc,        and     t hat    there        wa s     not    sufficient

r oom     for     transfer             etc.         Usually            t his       explanation             was met         with       i n sul ts,

threats,          spitting            etc.

A   couple        of    the m o r e           'reasonable*                 Liverpool             supporters             explained            to me

t hat     they     felt         they were               always         cheated            on the     ticket          allocations              so

they      (the     rest         of    the      fans) ,         this        pair       were       from Manchester,                    j ust

bought      tickets             for a n y w h e r e           in the          ground.            Then      once      inside          asked     for

a transfer.              Usually              t his      happened,              if    it d i d n ’t t h e n          they'd agitate

against         whoever's             stand         they       were        on u n til        the P o l i c e         had    to m o v e        them

for     fear      of    causing            trouble.

Whilst      there        was         space         to m o v e        on    the K o p a           large      number         of L i v e r p o o l

fans      did     get    to      the a l l o c a t e d a r ea.                     Bu t    once     the     Kop      had    filled

several         came     back         to      the       gate       complaining              they'd         been      picked          on.      Once

more      I told        them         t ha t    there          wa s    to      be     no    transfers.               This    was met           with      1

abuse,      insults             and     threats.               Some        started          spitting          towards           me,    as

u s ual    these        were         the      o nes      at    the        back       of    the     group and            whilst        s ome    of

it di d     come        through            the      fe nce,          most       of    it    fell     on     their         own    "mates"           in

front.          I merely             moved away               from        the      gate.

About      10 m i n u t e s          p r ior       to    kick-off             I remember            looking          towards          the     West

S tand and         remarking               to a         passing           Chief       Inspector            (Mr G r e e n w o o d       I think)

who'd      stopped         to a s k           if    there were                any     problems,            t ha t    there       were        more

Liverpool          f ans        on    the K o p          than        o ve r     there       (the W e s t         Stand)         as    there

was     sti l l    large         expanses               of    empty        st and,         compared         to      the    Kop and

S outh Stand which were                            jammed          full.

The    game       started,          following              a    couple        of m i n o r           squabbles          b e h i n d me           on

the    Kop,       I'd    started             to w o n d e r      if    perhaps             we'd       have       been       better          off

escorting          the L i v e r p o o l           fans        off    the K o p a f t e r             all,       as    there       seemed             to

be    so m u c h    space          on    the W e s t           and N ort h Stands.                        I didn't          have       a    radio

so    I was       unaware          that        t h e y w e r e all          outside.

5.      Perhaps          10-15 minutes                    into        the   game           something happened                     on the

pitch which             started a             fight        j ust      b e h i n d me.

Gate    6    is a d j a c e n t         to     the a c c e s s        r oad      to       the       pitch and a number                      of

officers          had    gathered              the re.          I    called         to      t h e m a n d we          went    onto          the

Kop,    as we       did       so    the       fighting           stopped,             so       rat h e r     than      provoke             further

confrontation              we w e n t         back        onto       the    track.              Whilst        I was         closing          the

gate     I was      approached                by     two L i v e r p o o l         fans         who want ed            out.        I       told

them    t h e r e wa s        no    chance           of    getting          onto          the N o r t h S t a n d ,          but       if    they

wanted       I could          let       them       out     of    the       ground.              After        a few      seconds

discussion          they        said         they w a n t e d         out     so      I        let t h e m    onto      the       track          and

started       to    guide          them        up    the a c c e s s        road.               As I d i d       so    I looked

towards       the W e s t          Stand and              saw a       lar g e      crowd            had    gathered          at    the       back

of    the    goal       and     t hat        fans     were       running           across            the     pitch      over       the       track

and    up    into       the N o r t h S t a n d .               As    we    left          the       pitch a rea         one       of       the

youths       said       to me       t hat       he    f elt      sorry        for         us    because          'they're          fucking

mad,    t h e r e ’s g o i n g          to    be     s om e     right       trouble".                 Little          did    I know          how

right       he was.

I let       the    two     lads         out     through          g ate      '0*     and         onto       Penistone          R o ad.            As

I returned          I saw          that a           number       of m o u n t e d           a n d dog        handlers         were

gathering          at    the       h e a d of        the       access       road.

I went       down       o nto      the P e r i m e t e r         track,          looking             towards          the W e s t          Stand.

I saw what          appeared             to     be a m a j o r         pitch          invasion             with       lots    of       p eo p l e

running,          pushing          etc.         The       Police       Officers                at    t hat    end      certainly

seemed       to    be    overwhelmed                 and       I realised what                      all    the    dogs,       etc,          had

been    gathered           for.          Around           the    edge       of     the         pitch were             erected a
continuous              row of w o o d e n a d v e r t i s i n g            boards           about       2' 6"       (two     f o ot        six

i nc hes)         high.         These         boards       are    nailed        together            and     then        their       support

arms       ar e    pegged          to    the    floor       with     f oot      long         staples.            Effectively

putting a 2'6"                  (two      f oot      six    i nches)        high         barrier         between         the

perimeter              track       and    the     pitch.

I f elt       that       if the          horses       and    dogs        were       called         onto     the       pitch        to       deal

with       the     crowd        these         advertising          boards           would        present         a    problem.               So

together           with a          couple       of    stewards           and    s ome        British Transport                     Police

(no    i dea w h e r e          they      had     come      from)        I started            to    t ake      the      boards          down.

We'd       cleared a            gap about            30-40       f eet    wide       when        the     St.     John's

Ambulance              came     down      the     ramp a nd        onto        the       pitch.

Gradually a              number          of    injured       people         were         assisted         towards            my    position,

down       the a d v e r t i s e m e n t s        for      makeshift           stretchers.                At     t his       time       I

c o u l d n ’t h ear          the       Tannoy       system       because           of    the      noise       from      the Kop.

I assisted              several          injured        people       to     the      gymnasium            some        just        in shock,

others        more       seriously             i n jured .

One    male who              was    on a n a m b u l a n c e       trol l e y was            having         difficulty

breathing,              a female          Special          Constable           was       attending          him,       together              we

took       him     to    the       gym,       where     we m a d e       h i m as        comfortable             as    possible              in

to    be a D o c t o r          wh o     took     o ve r    the    care        of    the     man.         The        Doctor       asked           us

where       the m e d i c a l           supplies        were.        At     that         t ime     no    one     person           seemed          to

be    in    charge.             I told         the D o c t o r     t h at      the St        J o h n ’s A m b u l a n c e          had       gone

with       some      girls          who    said        they were            nurses.            I noticed           that        there         was

also       a number            of    f ire      officers            using       resuscitation                equipment             on    injured

Together with other Officers I travelled to Hillsborough Football. Ground for

the ’■■re match brief inn and on conclusion of the briefi’iT I went to my allocated

position at the junction of                                              Halifax head \-ith l.'aLlsend Load.                                                      The duties of

our ceriel that date were to meet mini bus and van traffic arriving from

Liverpool and position them in                                                 .a1legend Load.                          Tickets '-’ere tc be checked and

f.s the vehicles began to arrive all accepted the instructions they were given v/it

regard to parking although there ware occasions when sorrse said they wished to get

closer to the ground.                                          However,           as I have said all accepted instructions and the

r.ood amongst them was one of high spirits and good humour.                                                                                                 It --as apparent at

During the course of our duties at that location Doth the vehicle ard foot traffi

travelling toward the ground was very heavy and again,                                                                                          large aaounts                  of canned

beer' were being consumed although at that time the mood was nore jovial than

drunken.                          On a number of occasions we were approached by Liverpool supporters

travelling from the direction of the ground asking for directions to any Public

Louses in the area which may bo oren.                                                              The Pailway .dote!                                    at the         function of

Pali.fax Load with ,;allsend Load was in fact open for easiness at that tin? but

the licensee had the good sense to close the front doers                                                                                                 of the         premises and

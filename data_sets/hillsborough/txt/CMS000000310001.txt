Thank you for sending me your draft note to PS/Mr Atkins.

X am generally content with the line you propose? it is premature
for the league to be contemplating asking the Government, for more
cash# when clubs are clearly at a    very early stage in their
thinking about    how to raise extra money themselves. I suggest,
however, that it might be helpful to rephrase          paragraph 8
slightly.   In place of the first two sentences, would something
along the following lines do?

       ’’The £100 million over 5 years from the cut in pool betting
      duty is pretty generous, and the Chancellor made it clear in
      'hie Budget statement that he would review the position after
      5 years»     But Treasury Ministers always recognised that
      Football would also have to find a considerable amount of
      cash from      its own resource ♦Any representations  from the
      League asking for more money would, of course# be considered
      by the Treasury in the normal wayj but it seems a bit
      premature to be thinking in these terms. What is needed is
      for the League and clubs to look positively over the coming
      months at ways of raising the extra finance they need".

I should be grateful if you would add my name to the copy list.

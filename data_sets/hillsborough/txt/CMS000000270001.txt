Thank you for your letter of 29 June about the League's seminar
on Taylor implementation to be held in Birmingham on 2 August.

I have arranged for Des Coles from the Department's Planning and
Development Control Directorate to attend the seminar to talk on
planning matters relating to the development and redevelopment of
football grounds.   Des intends to talk to you about arrangements
for the day.   His telephone number is              [  Tony Baden
from this division will also be attending the seminar.

You also asked about a possible speaker on Government and EC
grants.    I understand that Anne Mulcahy from the Department's
Inner Cities Directorate has spoken to Chris Whalley about this.
There is a wide range of grant programmes, operated by different
Government Departments, which meet specific objectives and have
their own criteria     against which individual    proposals  are
considered.  For example, under the Action for Cities initiative,
there are several programmes, some of which are D o E 's reÂ­
sponsibility and others which fall to other Departments.     I am
not sure whether you have already seen the attached booklet
-People in Cities - but this sets out what those programmes cover
and gives a useful table and contact points at the end.

If you felt that it would be helpful to have someone present from
the Action for Cities side, Mr Ash in our Inner Cities Policy
Unit would be available, his telephone number is
However, I have been asked to stress that each Action for Cities
programme has its own rules and criteria and, while our Inner
Cities people would be happy to point people in the right
direction for more information about these, given the wide range
of the subject, they could not give definite answers on whether
grant-aid might be available in any particular case.


Yours sincerely

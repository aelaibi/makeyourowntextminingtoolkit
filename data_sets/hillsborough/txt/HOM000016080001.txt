            Dear Mr Edey

            I refer to your recent correspondence to the Chief Constable of South
            Yorkshire Police, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Right
            Honourable Lord Justice Taylor. The correspondence has been passed to
            me by Mr P Wright, Chief Constable, South Yorkshire Police.

            I am responsible, on behalf of Mr G Dear, Chief Constable of West
            Midlands Police, for the conduct of the investigation into the events at
            Hillsborough on 15 April 1989- My responsibilities are not only to
            service the needs of Lord Justice Taylor's Judicial Inquiry, but also to
            provide the necessary facts for the Coronerâ€™s Inquests into the 95 who
            died, which at this time are scheduled to commence early next year.
            Consequently the enquiries we are undertaking are most thorough. If,
            during the course of assembling the evidence, allegations of criminal
            offences arise then these will be dealt with via normal procedures.
            However, at this stage, there is still a lot to be done before we are in
            a position to consider the issues you raise.

            I am grateful for your letter and I have noted your concern.

            I have passed a copy of the letter to the Director of Public Prosecutions
            for his information.

            Yours sincerely

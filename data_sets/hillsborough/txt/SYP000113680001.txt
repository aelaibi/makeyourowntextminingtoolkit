            I am       a Detective              Sergean                                     Xoxk&i3-Lr_e__H.al| ce          presently

            stationed             at    Police         Head

            On    or     about         5th     April,        1989,       I was       asked       if    I would       perform       duty   in

            uniform          on       Saturday,         15th       April,       1989,       to       cover    the    semi-final

            football             match       between         Liverpool          Football             Club    and    Nottingham       Forest

            Football             Club.         I was        informed       that       insufficient             uniform       officers       had

            volunteered                for     this     duty.           I agreed       to    work,

            At    8.00       a.m.       Saturday,            15th       April,       1989,       I    commenced       duty    in

            uniform.              A    briefing         took       place       at    the    West       Bar    gymnasium       and    I,

            together             with       other      officers,          commenced          our       designated          duties    at   t he

            Midland          Railway           Station.            The    task       was    to       segregate       the    rival

            supporters                arriving         at    the    station          and    to       transfer       these    supporters

            to    waiting P S V s .                 Myself         and    my    serial,          number       14    consisting       of

            another          Police          Sergeant         and       seven       officers,          together       with    other

            similar          serials,           were        allocated          the    Liverpool             supporters.

            The       P S V ’s        were     loaded        with       fans    and    then          officers       accompanied       the

            vehicle          to       the    football         ground.           These       officers          were    then    to    return

            with       t h e ' P S V ’s a n d       continue            until       such    time       that    all    the    supporters

            had       been       cleared        from        the    station.

At    2.20    p.m.       there           was       no    further             inforfation. that                      any      other

supporters          were        expected                to    arrive          by       train.           It     was      then       that

Inspector          De'wes,          the       officer          in       charge,             stood       down        the      remaining

serials, at         the       railway              station.              X 7 together                  with       members          of    my

of    day,    obviously                 attempting             to       gain       entry.              I could          see     densely

populated          circles              of    supporters                trying             to    obtain        tickets          from      ticket

touts.        I was        sat          on    the       lower       deck          of       the    PSV       and     the      window       was

banged       at    the     side          of    me       and    a    group          of       between          twenty          and     thirty

supporters          were        asking             if    we,       the       passengers                on    the       PSV,     had      any

tickets.           Once       they           saw    the       Police          uniforms             they        dispersed.

The    PSV    travelled                 very       slowly          along          Leppings             Lane       through          the

enormous          deluge        of       people.              I would             estimate             that-      there       were       about

3,000       people       pushing              and              -                                               Closest          to      the

     trance.The          PSV        eventual                                                                      stone       Road       where       we

alighted          from     the          vehicle                                                                > our      way      into       the

gymnasium           awaiting                 furth                                                             1 immediately              told       by

Inspector          Sewell           that       we       could       be       K-an.n re d          to    attend          the     Leppings            Lane

end    of    the    ground.

About       3.05    p„rn.       myself             and       the    ser                     re    told       to     attend         inside          the

ground       at    the     Leppings                Lane       end..          We    made          our    way       to    the     playing            area

and    could       see     the          match       in       progress.                 I    looked          towards          the     Leppings

Lane    end       and    could           see       supporters                milling             around        on      the    side       of    the

playing       area.           I then           started             to    run       to       what       I thought             was     crowd

disorder.
At    this     time      I saw       Superintendent                      Greenwood             run    onto          the       playing           area

and    approach          the       referee.              I went          immediately             to       the       rear        of       the    goal

area    at     the      Leppings          Lane       end       and       looked          at    the    crowd.                 I then           saw

with    horror          and       disbelief          th^t          the       first       three       or    four          rows        of

supporters           within         my    view       were          dead.        They          were    still             in    a,ti u p r i g h t         '

position        packed            into    each       other,             some    beyond          the       first          few       row;s w e r e

dying     as    pressure            from       the       people          behind          continued.                 All       the        dead

were     purple         in    colour          and    some          had       bulging          eyes.        There             was     a

considerable             amount          of    vomit.              I    could       see       that    some          people           had

attempted         to     protect          the       persons             in    front       as    their          arms-were                 wrapped

around        them      and       crushed          into    the          chest       of    the    person             protected.                  Some

were     so    small         that    you       could       only          see    their          heads.

I shouted         to     Superintendent                   Greenwood             that          there       were          thirty           or    Forty

dead     within         my    view       and       that    we          must    get       the    crowd          to       retreat

backwards        and         obtained          immediate                medical          help,       especially                 oxygen,

lir G r e e n w o o d    commenced             to    use       his       personal             radio       and       I    immediately

mounted        hoardings            and       screamed             at    supporters             to    move          backwards                 waving

my    arms     in a      similar          gesture.                 I    could       see       space       at    the          rear        of    the

terrace        and      the       tunnel       exit       from          the    terrace          just       to       my       right

appeared        clear.             However,          other             supporters             were    still             running           through

the    tunnel        and      pushing          into       the          rear    of    the       crowd.           I saw           other

officers        also         on    the    advertising                   hoardings             shouting          and          gesturing              at

myself.         Some         of    the    crowd          did       not       seem    to       care    what          was       happening              as

they     were     spitting           at       us    as    we       waved       them       to    go    back.

At    this     time      I saw       to       my    left       a       young    boy       of    between             eleven           and

fifteen        years         old,    about          three          rows       from       the    front.              He       was     still

alive     and     had        his    fingers          on    the          steel       mesh.        He       was       turning              purple

and    looking          directly          into       my    eyes.              I was       totally          helpless                and        could

not    reach      the        boy.        I jumped          down          from       my    position             and       attempted              to

push     my    hands         through          the    metal             fence    in       an    attempt          to       pull        him

spiked       fence          in    front, o f         me.           Together           with       other               officers,                  I was

obliged       to       help       this       and     other          supporters              who               were       attempting                   the

same    escape          route.              Several          supporters               were       removed                   in    this          way,            some

received          injuries             on    the     spiked.railings                    and           others               ripped         clothing.

At    the    first          opportunity               I looked            for     the       boy               but    could        not           identify

him    in    the       mass       of       bodies       at     my    feet.            I think                  at    this        time           the

advertising             hoarding             broke,          making         the       task       to            remove           supporters                     more

difficult.                                                     -

I turned          and       saw       Mr    Greenwood              beckon        to    me .           He        said          that     he           could

not    be    heard          on    the       radio       and        I attempted              to        use           mine        with      similar

result.           No    medical             team     or      oxygen         had       arrived                  in    the        area      and             I

could       see    several             officers           removing           supporters                        over       the     perimeter

fence.        I had          seen          officers          to     my    left        attempting                     to       open     the            steel

escape       gate       to       my    left       and     by       this     time       I think                  it       was     open          and

persons       were          being          removed.            Mr    Greenwood              asked               me       to     obtain              an

ambulance.              I    ran       the      length         of    the     field          to        the           entrance           way            between

the    North       Stand          and       the    Spion           Kop,     where        I knew                 from          previous

experience             that       an       ambulance           would        be    positioned.

Officers          at    that          end    of     the      ground         did       not     realise                    the     enormity                     of

the    situation             and       I shouted             to     an    unknown           Inspector                     that       there                was           a

desperate          need          for       manpower          at     the     other       end.                   My    main        concern                  was

the    ambulance             and       I eventually                 persuaded           an       ambulance                      driver              to        drive

his    vehicle          down          the    narrow          entrance            way    and           onto           the        side      of          the

playing       area.              An    advertising                 hoarding           had     first                 to    be     broken              down

before       the          vehicle          could          be. d i r e c t e d      towards          the       Leppings                Lane       end.

Once    the          ambulance             reached           the       area,       I    left       the       two    ambulancemen                      to

get    on    with          their          jobs       of    tending           to    the       injured.              I again                ran    to       the

perimeter             fence- a s           su,ppoHers              wire          still       swinging          On       the          fence       in an

attempt          to; r e m # ^ e          thtfmselves             from       the       terraces.             I assisted                   supporters

but    could          see       that       there          were     no       officers          in    the       rear          pulling             people

backwards             where          they       should         be.          I spoke          to    Mr    Greenwood                   who    stated

that    he       could          not       heard       by     radio.              Almost       immediately                   I saw          officers

climbing             over       the       dividing           fence          to    the       left    and       run       into          the

terrace.              I    continued             my       task     of       removing          supporters                over          the

perimeter             fence. ' I saw                  officers              with       tears       running          down             their       face

working          with          strength          that        I d i d n ’t         think       was       possible.                    Some       were

physically                lifting          people          from        inside          the    terrace          over             the       dividing

fence       to       the       left.        Others           were          inside       the       terrace          extracating                   people

and    passing             them       to    officers              inside          the       gate.        Supporters                   were       still

trampling             on       the    dead       and       injured           and       jumping          onto       the          perimeter

fence.           I    continued             to       drag      these         people          over       the    to p.

A    supporter             then       pulled          me     from          behind       and       pointed          to       a       man    who    was

laid    on       the       floor          obviously            distressed               and       shocked          and          screaming             for

his    s on.          I went          to    the       man     who          was    in    a    very       high       state             of    hysteria

and    was       immediately                joined           by    a       woman       who    said       she       was          a    nurse.           I

attempted             to       give       him    words        of       comfort          about       his       son       and          left       him

with    the          nurse.

I assisted                in    removing             several           persons          from       the       terrace,                some

obviously             dead.           Together             with        a   man     who       said       he    was       a       doctor,          I gave

heart    massage                to    a    man       whilst        the       doctor          gave    mouth-to-mouth

resuscitation.                       After       a    short        time          the    doctor          said       he       was       dead and

moved    to       a    further             supporter              being          cared       for    by       Police             Officers.

At    this       time          I saw       Chief       Superintendent                       Nesbit       working                frantically

with    officers.                    Mr    Nesbit          was     grey          and    sweat       was       pouring                from    him.

Almost       immediately                   a    loud       cry       went       up    and    some       Liverpool             supporters

on    the    pitch          began          to    charge             towards          the    Nottingham             Forest          supporters

at    the    other          end.           I grabbed                two    supporters             who    were          about       to       run

with    the       crowd.              One       of    them          turned       and       punched       me       in    the    upper

body.        I held          him       and       could          see       there       w e r e ’ teari        in    his       eyes.           He       was'

not    violent          any       longer             and       was       calmed       by    his    friend.              They       both

walked       away       from          the       pitch.

Mr    Nesbit          then       shouted             at    me       to    use    my    radio.           It    was       impossible                to

speak       to    Ground          Control.                 I    changed          my. r a d i o     to    channel             29,       the    one

used    in' t h e       morning                whilst          in    ’D 1"      Division.            I pa ssedu^S‘ m e s s a g e                  from

I saw       the       Fire       Service             were       in       attendance          and     oxygen            was    being          used

where       possible.                 Makeshift                stretchers             had    been       made       from       the

advertising             hoardings                ahd       supporters                and    Police       Officers             were          placing

persons          on    these          and       moving          them       to    the       other     end      of       the    ground

through          the    cordon             of    Police             Officers.

Several          of    the       supporters                on       the    pitch       who    had,       with          assistance,

clambered             over       the       perimeter                fence       had    been       drinking             heavily          and

smelled          strongly             of       intoxicants.                    I saw       some    of    these          supporters

spitting          and       kicking             officers             who       were    in    the     process            Of    attempting

resuscitation.                    Several             approached                me    in    anger       and       called       me       a

murderer.              I attempted                   to    calm          them    down.

The    announcement                   was       then       made          that    the       match    was       to       be    abandoned.                    A

             from    my    serial,          Police       Constable            2611     Parkin      and    Police          Constable

             2174    Cutler,          who    were       making          their    way     towards        the    gate       area     of      the

             fence.        I did       not    see       these          officers      from,my       serial       until          much     later

             that    night.           I did       not    see       any    other      officers          from    my    serial        that

             day,    although          I did       contact             Inspector       Dewes      by    radio       later       that       night.

             I saw    at    this       most       unforgettable               incident        several         officers,          most        of

             highest       degree       of    professionalism.                    Ones       I knew      were       Police       Constable

         I am a Detective Sergeant in the South Yorkshire Police presently stationed

         at Police Headquarters.

         On or about                              the 5 April                              1989,              I was asked                              if I would perform duty in

        uniform on Saturday                                                 15                   April 1989 to cover the semi final footballmatch

         between Liverpool Football Club and Nottingham Forest Football Club.                                                                                                                                             I was

         informed that insufficient uniform officers had volunteered for this duty.

         I agreed to work.

         At         8.00              am,          Saturday                      15 April                      1989,               I       commenced                      duty             in uniform.                                 A

         The task was to segregate the rival supporters arriving at the Station and

         to         transfer                     these                supporters                         to waiting PSV’s.                                            Myself and my serial,

        supporters.

        The PSV ’s were loaded with fans and then officers accompanied the vehicle

        to the football ground.                These officers were then to ireturn with the PSV's

        and continue until such time that all the supporters had been cleared from

         the station.

        At 2.20 pm there was no further information that any other supporters were

         expected to arrive by train.               It was then that Inspector Dewes, the officer

         in charge,            stood down the remaining serials at the railway station.                             I,

         together with members of my serial, boarded a PSV to travel to the football

         ground to continue our designated duties.

         About 2.50 pm the PSV was travelling along Leppings Lane and I commented to

         an officer on the vehicle                that in my experience as a policeman and as a

         previous regular supporter of Sheffield Wednesday, that I had never seen as

         many people outside the ground at that time of day, obviously attempting to

         gain entry.             I could see densely populated circles of supporters trying to

         obtain tickets from ticket touts.                     I was sat on the lower deck of the PSV

         and the window was banged at the side of me and a group of between twenty

         and thirty supporters were asking if we, the passengers on the PSV, had any

         tickets.            Once they saw the Police uniforms they dispersed.

         The      PSV    travelled      very    slowly   along       Leppings        Lane     through    the   enormous

         deluge         of    people.     I would estimate           that     there were           about 3,000 people

         pushing and milling around the area closest to the entrance.

         The PSV eventually made its way onto Penistone Road where we alighted from

          the     vehicle        and about     3.00 pm made        our way          into    the gymnasium awaiting

          further instructions.              We were immediately told by Inspector Sewell that we

          could be required to attend the Leppings Lane end of the ground.

Continuation of statement of            PAUL NORTON



About 3-05 pm, myself and the serial were told to attend inside the ground

at the Leppings Lane end.                We made our way to the playing area and could

 see      the match in progress.              I looked         towards         the Leppings Lane end and

could see supporters milling around on the side of the playing area.                                        I

 then started to run to what I thought was crowd disorder.

At this time I saw Superintendent Greenwood run onto the playing area and

 approach the referee.               I went immediately to the rear of the goal area at

 the Leppings Lane end and looked at the crowd.                                I then saw with horror and

 disbelief that the first three or four rows of supporters within my view

 were dead.         They were still in an upright position packed into each other,

 some      beyond    the   first      few rows      were       dying      as    pressure   from   the   people

 behind continued.             All the dead were purple in colour and some had bulging

 eyes.        There was a considerable amount of vomit.                              I could see that some

 people       had attempted        to protect the persons in front as their arms were

 wrapped       around them and crushed               into        the chest of the person            protected.

 Some were so small that you could only                          see their heads.

 I shouted to Superintendent Greenwood                          that there were thirty        or forty dead

 within my view and             that we must          get        the crowd to retreatbackwards and

 obtain immediate medical help, especially oxygen.                                   Mr Greenwood commenced

 to use his personal radio and I immediately mounted advertising hoardings

 and screamed at supporters to move backwards waving my arms in a similar

 gesture.         I could see space at the rear of the terrace and the tunnel exit

 from       the    terrace     just    to     my    right        appeared        clear.     However,     other

 supporters were still running through the tunnel and pushing into the rear

 of     the   crowd.       I   saw    other    officers         also      on   the    advertising    hoardings

 shouting and gesturing as myself.

Some      of   the crowd did not          seem    to care what was happening as they were

spitting at us as we waved them to go back.

At     this time I saw to my left a young                         boy of between eleven               and fifteen

 years old about three rows from the front.                              He was still alive           and had his

 fingers on the steel mesh.               He was turning purple and looking directly into

 my eyes.         I was totally helpless and could not reach the boy.                                   I jumped

 down     from my position          and attempted           to push my hands              through      the metal

 fence in an attempt to pull him clear.                           It    was futile. I spoke to           him and

 told him to hang on and held his hands.

 Then     complete    panic    seemed      to break         out        and instead of going backwards,

 youths were rushing forward treading on the dead and dying and swinging on

 the      perimeter    fence    attempting         to       get    out       of   the    terrace.       One   such

 supporter stood on the boy and was swinging on the spiked fence in front of

 me.       Together with other officers,                I was obliged to help this and other

 supporters who were attempting the same escape route.                                    Several supporters

 were removed in this way, some received injuries on the spiked railings and

 others ripped clothing.

 At the first opportunity I looked for the boy but could not identify him in

 the      mass    of bodies    at    my   feet.         I    think       at   this      time   the    advertising

 hoarding broke making the task to remove supporters more difficult.

 I turned and saw Mr Greenwood beckon to me.                                He said that he could not be

 heard on the radio and I attempted to use mine with similar result.                                            No

 medical         team or oxygen      had arrived            in the area and I could see several

 officers removing supporters over the perimeter fence.                                   I had seen officers

 to my left attempting to open the steel escape gate to my left and by this

  time     I think it was       open and persons were                       being removed.           Mr Greenwood

asked me                     to obtain an ambulance.                                                         I ran the length of the field to the

entrance way between the North Stand and the Spion Kop where I knew from

previous experience that an ambulance would be positioned.

Officers                    at         that end of                               the ground did not                                       realise                 the enormity of the

 situation and I shouted to an unknown Inspector that there was a desperate

 need for manpower at the other end.                                                                             My main concern was the ambulance and

 I eventually persuaded an ambulance driver to drive his vehicle down the

 narrow entrance way and onto the side of the playing area.                                                                                                                        An advertising

 hoarding had first to be broken down before the vehicle could be directed

 towards the Leppings Lane end.                                                                       Once the ambulance reached the area I left

 the two ambulancemen to get on with their jobs of tending to the injured.

 I again ran to the perimeter fence as supporters were still swinging on the

 fence              in         an attempt                           to remove                         themselves                    from the                    terrace.                      I assisted

 supporters                         over but                       could                see           that         there             were            no        officers                  in        the          rear

 pulling people backwards where they should be.                                                                                                I spoke to Mr Greenwood who

 stated                 that             he         could               not           be          heard by radio.                                   Almost               immediately I saw

 officers                     climbing                      over             the dividing fence                                       to        the left and run                                    into           the

 terrace.                         I continued my                                     task of removing supporters over the perimeter

 fence.                     I saw officers with                                                  tears running down                                    their              face working with

 strength that I didn't                                                      think was possible.                                           Some were physically lifting

 people from inside the terrace over the dividing fence to the left.                                                                                                                                      Others
                                                                                                ten
 were             inside                 the terrace                             extraditing people                                     and passing                          them to officers

 inside the gate.                                          Supporters were still trampling on the dead and injured

 and jumping onto                                         the perimeter                               fence.                 I continued to drag these people

 over the top.

 A supporter then pulled me from behined and pointed to a man who was laid

 on the floor obviously distressed and shocked and screaming for his son.                                                                                                                                                   I

went      to   the   man   who   was        in    a    very     high         state     of    hysteria    and   was

immediately joined by a woman who said she was a nurse.                                         I attempted to

give him words of comfort about his son and left him with the nurse.

 I assisted       in removing     several persons                from        the   terrace,     some obviously

 dead.     Together with a man who said he was a doctor I gave heart massage to

 a man whilst the doctor gave                    mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.                    After a short

 time     the doctor said he was                 dead and moved to a further                    supporter being

 cared for by police officers.

 At    this    time I saw Chief Superintendent Nesbit                              working    frantically with

 officers.        Mr Nesbit      was    grey          and   sweat     was     pouring        from him.     Almost

 immediately a loud cry went up and some Liverpool supporters on the pitch

 began to charge towards the Nottingham Forest supporters at the other end.

 I grabbed two supporters who were about to run with the crowd.                                     One of them

 turned and punched me in the upper body.                             I held him and            could see there

 were tears in his eyes.               He        was not violent             any longer and was calmed by

 his friend.         They both walked away from the pitch.

 Mr Nesbit then shouted to me to use my radio.                                 It was impossible to speak

 to ground control.          I changed my radio to channel 29, the one used in the

 morning whilst in 'Dl' Division.                      I passed a message from Mr Nesbit that he

 required dogs and officers onto the pitch in front of the Nottingham Forest

 fans who were taunting the Liverpool supporters.                                  Mr Nesbit took immediate

 control and arranged a line of officers across the pitch.                                      Chief Inspector

 Beal also assisted.             I saw Detective Inspector Meek around this time and

 could see he was attempting to form a line of officers across the pitch.

 By these very positive and quick actions, a possible catastrophic public

 disorder situation was averted.

I saw the fire service were in attendance and oxygen was being used where

 possible.           Make    shift    stretchers        had     been        made     from       the   advertising

 hoardings and supporters and police officers were placing persons on these

 and moving them to the other end of the ground through the cordon of police

 officers.

 Several of the supporters on the pitch who had, with assistance, clambered

 over the perimeter fence had been drinking heavily and smelled strongly of

 intoxicants.          I saw some of these supporters spitting and kicking officers

 who were in the process of attempting resuscitation.                                    Several approached me

 in anger and called me a murderer.                    I attempted to calm them down.

 The announcement was then made that the match was to be abandoned.                                         A short

 time later Mr Nesbit directed part of the line of officers on the pitch to

 form     a     cordon    across     Penistone     Road       in    order      that       the    ambulances    with

 casualties          could   obtain     a   clear      escape        route         and    to    segregate     rival

 supporters.          Chief Inspector Beal, Detective Inspector Meek and myself went

 with these officers and formed the cordon as requested.

 Initially when I arrived at the Leppings Lane end I saw two officers from

 my serial, Police Constable 2611 Parkin and Police Constable 2174 Cutler,

 who were making their way towards the gate area of the fence.                                          I did not

 see these officers from my serial until much later that night.                                         I did not

 see      any    other officers       from my      serial       that        day,    although I did contact

 Inspector Dewes by radio later that night.

 I saw at this most unforgettable incident several officers, most of whom

 were      unknown       to m e , working    with       total      commitment            and with the highest

  degree        of   professionalism.        Ones       I     knew     were        Police       Constable    Steven

  Fairclough and Police Constable John Friend.

                Initially            on     arrival          at       the    entranceway          betwejnf the            North        Stand     and

                the       Spion      Kop     I    could          see    an    ambulance          wflh     open      rear        doors     and    an

                officer          stood       inside.              I went       immediately             into     this      ambulance            and

                spoke       to      the     officer,             telling       hym     the      urgent      need      for       more    ambulances

                The       officer         spoke        on    a    hand       held    radio        bj/C     I   could      not      hear           the

                conversation.                    I again          told       him    that     artfbulances         were      a    priority        but

                he    continued             to    converse             on    the    radio.        I told        him      that     he    could        talk

                whilst         moving        and       that       he    would       see    more       clearly      the      extent        of    the

                situation            if     he    moved          the    ambulance          to     the o t h e r    end    of      the    ground.

                The    officer            continued              to    talk    but     made       no    e f f o r t to   move      towards           the

                driving          seat.

                I turned            and     saw    a    St.       Johns       Ambulance          with     an   officer           stood     at    t he

                side      of     the      driver's           door.           I moved       my    position         and    went      to    the     St.

                Johns      Ambulance.                  The       officer       quickly          got    into    the       driving        seat     and

                the    ambulance            made        its       way       towards       the    Leppings         Lane      end    of    the

                ground         as    previously              described.

Thank you for your letter of 23 November about the one the
Chairman of Southampton Football Club has sent to me concerning
meeting Lord Justice Taylor's recommendations and the possibility
of tax relief on the sale of certain assets.

As you will appreciate the question of tax relief is a matter for
Treasury Ministers and the enclosed copy of my reply to Mr Ashkam
sets out the position.

    Dear Mr Atkins

    The Chairman of Southampton Football Club, Mr Guy Askham, has sent me a copy
    of his letter to you of 16th November.  I have been a season ticket holder at
    Group**   °n      manY ySarS and 1   also a member    the All Party Football


    The case that Mr Askham makes regarding taxation relief is a strong one and I
    hope that you will feel able to support it. I am of course fully aware of
    the proposals in the Budget to assist with the financing of new stadia but
    there will be a very considerable shortfall between the proposed extra funds
    resulting from the Budget and the actual cost of creating the all-seater
    stadia resulting from the Taylor Report.

    Southampton have the chance to build a completely new stadium on a
    particularly good site but it will be difficult to make the financial sums
    work without the sort of taxation relief that is proposed in Mr Askham's
    letter.   t is of course only a deferment of the tax that is requested rather
    than complete relief.

    I do hope that you will feel able to put the proposal to the Treasury with
    your support.                                                       1

    Yours sincerely

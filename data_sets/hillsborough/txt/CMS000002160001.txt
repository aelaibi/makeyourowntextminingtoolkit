PERSONNEL OVERHEADS:   TRAVEL & SUBSISTENCE


The third quarter figure has been reduced from
£40,000 to 25,000 to reflect more accurately
the actual cost of the visits to Italy, France
and Holland and those made in the UK.

Travel and subsistence costs in respect of the
six member technical working group will fall
for payment in both the third and fourth
quarters.

                  April       1989      (1504 89 )     I was       off    duty and went            to    support       Liverpool           in

between 200-300 Liverpool                           fans.          We     stayed with            them and were                allowed

into      the       store     in s m a l l     numbers          to      buy     drinks                      and     I bought

to     the     ground.           The whole          crowd m oved              on w i t h o u t    any       problems          at all.

I remember            it w a s       the M e r s e y s i d e       Officer        who     actually          spoke        to    the

crowd.




We walked            to    the    g r o u n d a n d w h e n we            got    into L e p p i n g s       Ln     itself       it was

packed with               people       even    half       a mile          from    the     ground        itself.




Because         of    the     crowd my         friend asked a                   policeman         for       directions          to

t he     ground,          he w a s     manning       a    junction            either      two     or    three       ro ads      up

from      the       ground       off    Leppings          Ln.        He    then     directed           us    to    go    back       the

w a y we       had    come a n d        round       to the g p i o n H o p             end.       I didn't          think       that

was      r i g ht    but     followed         his    directions               and walked          b ac k     the w a y we           had

come      to    the S p i o n Hop.             This       was      about        2.20pm     (1420).

  We    then went             to    the S p i o n H o p          but    three       quarters          of       the w a y        r o u n d on

  blocked          by P o l i c e .        Because          of    the    t i me     I approached a                 police         officer

  there       were       n o ne     or    they were          blocked          from my         view        by the       crowd.




  Outside          the     ground my            friend       had       both    our       tickets          and    to    try and             stay

  together.              I had hold             of    his    jeans.           However,          the       pushing          of    the

  people       was       t h at     much    that        we w e r e      pushed apart                and    separated.                 O n c e we

  were       apart       I decided           to m a k e      for       the    turnstile             on m y      own.                       ha d

  got    in b e f o r e        me a n d     once        I reached            the    turnstile             he    handed my             ticket

  out    to me a n d           I wa s      allowed          in side.          I ha nd ed my           ticket          to    the

  turnstile           operator            and     retained         the       stub     of    the      ti c ke t .




  I had       difficulty             in f i n d i n g       the    entry       p o i nt     only      by the m i s d i r e c t i o n

of     th e    police          officer,             but    once       I got      back      into         Leppings          Ln,      I found

t he     turnstile             but       had       difficulties            getting         in b e c a u s e         of    the      sheer

number         of    p eople.             At       the    t im e     of m y    entry       I saw         no    gates         open       other

than      the       turnstiles.                    I did       not    see a n y      of    th e     gates          open.




As     I was        trying          to    get       to    the      turnstiles           Psaw        about          five      or    six

teenagers            climb over                a    concertina           ;^at§/i m m e d i a t e l y          to    the      left       of    the

turnstiles .                 After        the       first       f i ve   or    six w e n t         o v er     I saw a         number          of

others         climb         to     the    top       of    this       gate     but      then       drop       b a ck     into      the       crowd

outside         as       if t h e r e      was       someone          in a u t h o r i t y     on the          inside         telling

them      to     get      back.




Once                     and      I had        got       into      the   ground         I saw a          police          se rg ea nt and

f ou r    c o n s tables            immediately                behind      the    concertina                g a te w e r e        I had       seen

th e     teenagers             climb       over.           I approached                 the    sergeant             and      said

something            along          the    l i n es       of    "I a m a P o l i c e          Officer          from Merse ys ide ,

something            about          it or          get    something           done?".              At    this       time,         I was       with

              but    I did          not    produce             my wa rr an t      card        or    formally             identify

myself.             He    made       no    reply          to me a n d         by t h is       time       it w a s        close      to

kick      off       t im e     so    I left          it at         that.




Once      inside          the       ground          I saw       no    direction           signs         to m y      s e at    in the

North         stand and             had    difficulty                in f i n d i n g     it b e c a u s e         the    sections            of

 actually       saw      two      people        holding        tickets          which were           for       the     West

 Stand.        This      was a fter            the    i nc i dejBJ6"r i n pens         3 and 4 and              people         had

 started       to     come       out >^nto       th^pitch.              Everyone           started         to       discuss       what

 was    going       on a n d      thesV^wo            men     said     t h at    they      should         be    in t h o s e      pens

 and    showed        the      tickets         which were           complete           without       the       counterfoil

 being     removed.




(I    experienced           no    personal           crowd     crush w i t h i n          the      ground       only      that

 and    sat    n e ar    to      the     pitch.        I could         not      se e w h e t h e r       they were           directed

After      about        five mi n ut es          a Police           officer           ran on to the                p i t ch a n d

stopped         the     game.        P e o p le t h e n       began        to    climb       o ve r     the    front          fencing

onto      the      p i t c h at w i l l      and    I could also                 see      people        pulled          up    into       the

seating         area above.             At    no    po int         di d    I see a n y           gates       opened          to a l l o w

escape         from     the     pens.



Once      p l ay    had been         stopped        the N o t t i n g h a m F n r p « t. f an e               in t.hp fininn K o p

A   fan    then       ran o n t o      the    pitch and             then        ran

began      shouting           and   making         ' V ’ signs            with    tw

supporters.            Myself       and      other      fans        in the Njtfrth s t a n d                 began       lo s n o u t

detained           by P o l i c e    before        h«h-<fot back.




Another         older man           then     ran up to             the S p i o n K o p a n d            began       to w a v e          his

hands      at      the F o r r e s t    fans.         He w a s n ' t           taunting,          he wa s      signalling                for

Shortly         after       this     the     Police       formed c

particular            had a jumper            pulled          back        to    cov e r    his     face.           These        people

were      then     rolled         onto       the    pitch and          carriers           went    b ac k     for m o r e        people

or    bodies.




The      police       then     formed a            further       corldoTt      in    front       of    the N o r t h       stand

Around       the      same     time         a number       of    people        wearing          tracksuit           trousers         and

sweatshirts            came       from       the    direction          of    the     players          t u nn e l    and went         to

t he S p i o n K o p        end.        They       then     pulled       down more          hoarding           here a n d went

to    help      carry more           people         up f r o m L e p p i n g s       Ln.




A    number      of    people were              also       carried       up to       the    corner         in f r o n t     of me

bodily.          There       were       a    large     number       of      people        in this        corner          either

laid     out     behind        the      police        on the      pitch        or    sitting          with     their       heads      in

their      hands.




I did      not     see a n y       of       the P o l i c e     in the       cordon        in f r o n t      of     the N o r t h

I saw      one     person         on the        pitch about            a quarter           of    the     pitch          length away

from      the S p i o n K o p a b o u t            twenty       feet     from       the    hoardings           in f r o n t     of

th e N o r t h     st an d .       I distinctly               remember         this       because        lat er         on as    I

w il l    describe          an ambulance              drove      directly           past    us a n d a S a i n t           Johns

I am      not    sure       if t h i s       man    had been        carried          on a h o a r d i n g          or    by his

convulsions.

I was       very     c l ose      to    the     p i t c h so      I went      down    the a is l e ,      over       a small

five    f oo t     w al l     with      hoardings         on,      I walked         through       the    cordon without

being       c h a l l e n g e d at all          and    then went         to     the m a n     having      convulsions.




Almost       immediately               I was       joined       by a Sgaint J o h n ' s         Ambulance          man.      I

identified myself                  to       the S a i n t J o h n s     m a n as a n      off     duty P olice

Officer.           He    then said             to me    " You       do m o u t h     to m o u t h a n d       I'll    do    Keart

massage".           I then         took        his    pul s e     in his      neck.        I could       feel      a Syiight

pulse.        I then          commenced m o u t h            to   mouth       resuscitation             and    the/Saint

John's       man    s ta rt ed heart               massage.         I undid         two   buttons        on    y h e t o p of

the    man's       sh ir t.        If       I remember          rightly       the    bottom      of     the/shirt

appeared         ripped.




We    continued          to w o r k         on the m a n        but a f t e r    about       fivar m i n u t e s     he w e n t

mouth and          the      back       of    his     throat                      before/commencing                 mouth     to

After      a short        t i me     I undid              the    button       on hi s          trousers           and    ripped         open

the    sip.       I then        continued                 heart       massage.




Shortly afterwards                   an am bu la n ce             entered          the     ground.            It a p p e a r e d        to    be

a Health         Authority ambulance                        as    opposed          to S a i n t        Johns.           It    began      to

drive      towards        Leppings              Ln.        I then       told       the S a i n t        John's          man    to    try

and    stop      it.      He    tried           to    flag       it d o w n       but     it     continued          on as       if      it

had    been      ordered        not        to    stop       in the          top    corner         but    to go          to    the

Leppings         Ln    end.




The    Saint      J o h n ’s m a n         then       r e j o i n e d me a n d          continued            to    g iv e     mouth      to

Shortly        after      this       we w e r e           joined       by    one     of    the m e n         I described

earlier        in the        track         suit       trousers          and       I think         green       sweatshirt.                He

a s k e d me     if    I was        al l    right          and    knew what             I wa s        doing.




I said      " I 'm a n       off     duty         bobby,         I'm all          r i g ht " ,    with       that       he    left      as    if

to    go   somewhere           where        he       could       be    of m o r e       use w i t h      other          injured

persons.




Shortly after             t hi s man,             which must             have       been about            si;< m i n u t e s        since      I

had    changed         pl a c e s    with         the S a i n t        Johns       man,        a f e m a l e S^aint J o h n s

Ambulance         officer           came        over and          pushed\me             out      of    th*r w a y a n d        t oo k    o v er

trained        in F i r s t     Aid        t h a n me.




I then      stood       by     the     injured man                together           with        his    friend who             had      been

there      all    along,        telling              us    to k e e p       going       and      not    to    let       his    mate      die.

         Within         two m i n u t e s      of    this,      the S a i n t        Johns     Ambulance           man       told      the

         Saint        Johns       Ambulance          woman,       "He's      go n e" ,      and    stood        up,        I l o o k e d at

         the      m a n ’s f r i e n d w h o        was    standing         by his        head,      he w as       completely            grey.

After    the S a i n t       John's        man       had    said       the m a n w a s        dead       I'd s e e n       enough,

I felt       ill    and     had     to    get     out      of    the    ground.          I knew                      would       have

stayed where           he wa s       because          he k n o w s      no F i r s t     Aid.         I went         over       to/'Che

wall    where       I h ad     climbed          in.        As    I got       there      I saw a          ph o to^ra;

kneeling        down with an              orange        tabard         he w a s    taking          photographs             of    the

injured and           dying.




A    fan who was           already        on    the     pitch went            over      to    him and          said     "Fuc k

off,    you're        taking        pictures          of m y      injured mates".




The    phtographer           carried           on t a k i n g     pictures         so    the       fan    started          pushing

him.     The       photographer            s#ood        up a n d       the   fan     then      pushed          him    b a ck     to

t he w a l l    and    t r i e d V«r t a ke          the    camera       from      him.        Th e      camera       then       swung

and    smashed        into    the w a l l.            I then       climbed         o ve r     the w a ll        using       the

photographers              case     as    a step.           I then       rejoined




He    said     to me       " Come    on w e ' r e       going",         a n d we     both      then       left.        I cannot

say what        time       this     was.



Whilst       at H i l l s b o r o u g h    the       only       criminal       offences            were    of a m i n o r

public       order     nature        ie,       the    fans       climbing         over       the    gates       etc.        After

the    disaster        within        the       sta n d,     I saw a number               of    instances             s u c h as

the    photographer's               camera and             sausage       rolls       t h r o w n at       the       cordon       in

front    of     the N o r t h S t a n d         and     one      old m an who           threw a          cup of       t ea at an

officer        in the       c or don.




This    was      caused      purely        by a g i t a t i o n        amongst       the      crowd       by    the a p p a r e n t

callousness           of    the     photographer                and apparent            inactivity             of    the    police

with    regard        to    the     injured and             dying.

I witnessed          no   serious          offences.                                                                       _




There      were     a number         of    factors       w hich          I believe           contri|yuted                 to    the

number      of     deaths     and     injuries.                                                        /



Outside      the     g r o u nd    there      appeared            to    be a     lack/of              co-ordination

between      the m o u n t e d a n d         f o ot    police          officers/             The       approach            r o a ds    to

the    g ro und were        w el l    manned with Police                      officers               a t junctions              and

outside      pubs a n d       o#f     licences.              However,/l            made          a    comment         about        being

misdirected          by   the      police         officer         to a n o t h e r      officer             and      he    said       it

was    understandable              because        a    lot       of    t/ne o f f i c e r s          were    drafted            in f r o m

outside      stations         and     ha d    poor      local/knowledge                     of       the a r ea .          This       may

have    contributed           to     the     build      up o u t s i d e       the      ground which                  caused          the

initial      crush outside.                                  /




Inside      the     ground        once     the     disaster            had    occurred               there a p p e a r e d a           lack

of    co-ordination           between         sen io r       police          officers            and       l o wer    ranks        on the

being      despatched         to     deal/with          it.



From my      own     personal         experience             I and most            Police             officers            h a ve   only

basic      First     Aiacknowledge.                   When       I administered                  first       aid      to       the m a n     I

felt    totally       inadequate             on    reflection.                However            with       that      particular

assist      the     injured and            dying       I saw a number                  of    other          officers            who    did.

             Further          to m y      previous            statements          of 2 7 A p r i l            1989       ( 2 7 04 8 9 )    and    17

             August        1989         (170889),         I have          been asked             to       think about           a number          of       the

              points w h i c h are              raised         in the        statement            I made         nearly a fortnight

             after       the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a d i u m           disaster            on       15 A p r i l    1989       <150489).

             Before        clarifying            a number            of    these       points             I would        p o in t   out     that       I

              h av e    today        been      shown a number                of   p h o t o g r a p h s , plan s            and      documents             by

              Inspector            SAWERS       of W e s t      Midlands          Police          which         I have        viewed        to    refresh

             my memo r y .              It's   also       f ai r     to    say    that my             first      statement            ( 2 7 . 4. 8 9 )

              (270 4 8 9)         was    the    first         occasion         that        involvement             with       the     disaster             was

              se t     down       in a n y     detail,         in w r i t i n g ,      although              I did make             some    brief

              notes      myself          on S u n d a y       16 A p r i l     1989        (160489).              I retain           these       in m y

              possession and would                    say        that      they       do    no    relate          to m y      dealings           wi th any

              deceased            casualty       that         day.
I am a single m an and                      joined Merseyside                   Police        on 2 7 O c t o b e r          1987

<271087).            During          initial          training         at B r u c e    District          Training            Centre,

Warrington,             I received           basic         first       aid    instruction             in b o t h

theoretical            and       practical            application.              I obtained a             p a ss a n d w as

issued with an                identifying              c a rd    qualifying           me    for,      I think         2 or 3

years.         On     15 A p r i l      1 9 89    <150 4 8 9 )        I had     received         no     further         instruction

or     refresher         training           in b a s i c        first     aid.        However,          as a d i r e c t          re s u l t

of     the    situation           I found myself                 in on       the    d a y of     the     disaster            I

personally           f e lt      inadequately              equipped          in e i t h e r    theory         or

practise        of     first         aid.    I am absolute ly                 satisfied          that      the      first         aid

I rendered           in t e r m s       of m o u t h       to m o u t h      resuscitation and                 heart         massage

were     correct         and      t ha t    I could         have       done     no mor e ,       but     nevertheless,                  I

felt     I didn't           know      enough and            regretted           not    having         taken        t h at    aspect

of     initial       training           seriously           enough.

For     these       r ea s o n s ,    I applied            on m y      own    iniative         for      further         first          aid

training        in the           form      of a one w e e k            full     time       course       leading         to

q u a l i f i c a t i o n as a f i r s t          aid      public       order       trained        officer.             I undertook

t he    course        in J u n e      last       ye ar,     which means             I no w     h av e    a special               role

within        public        order       deployments              to    treat       casualties           either        of m e m b e r s

of     the    public        or    police         officers         as    injuries           occur.

As a     result        of     that      c ou r se ,     I feel         confident           and much        better           equipped

to deal        with      injured           people       whether         those       injuries          be m i n o r      or       life

threatening.                It a l s o      confirms            that    in fact,           my a c t io n s     were         r ig h t    on

the     da y a n d m y a t t e m p t s           at    resuscitation,               although          unsuccessful                were

properly        administered.

I will        n o w deal         with a number              of    specific          points       from my           original

statement           <27.4.89)           < 27 0 4 8 9 ) ,    using       the     page       numbers       of    t ha t       statement.

I understand             t h at      the    numbers         I will        use      in b r a c k e t s a r e        those         of    the

K e v i n Daniel            W I L L I A M S ’l y in g    A            length          of     the    pitch       from      the S p i o n

Kop.        I refer           to h i m     been     "on the           floor",             meaning        the    pitch surface,

and    "having          convulsions".                   I have        thought             about     this       carefully             today

and with          the a d d e d        benefit          of m y       training             I can say         t h at    this was             not a

process       that          lasted       for a n y       time.          It      c e r t a i n l y w a s n ’t a n y t h i n g          similar

to a n      epileptic             fit,     for    example.              It w a s a n          impression             t h at    I had

which       I originally               associated with                  the         lad




                                                    I will           correct          further         references              to                clS

they      occur        in m y      original         statement.

On    page    7     (42)        I describe          approaching                 the body.             He    w a s not c o n v u l s i n g

as    I did       so    (line        5).

I refer       to       feeling         for a      carotid            pulse          in the        neck and        said        originally

that      I thought             I could       detect          a slight              pulse     however          I now      feel        that      I

am able       to       correct         this.        I f e lt         for      the     pulse w ith my              first        two

fingers       of m y         left      hand,      I believe,               to       the     carotid artery              I cannot            say

absolutely             t h at     I felt      for       the     pulse         before         I started mouth                  to m o u t h      or

after,       nor       indeed whether               I did           both      simultaneously.                  Whilst          I would

now    have       much more            sk il l,     on the           day      I cannot            say w it h a bs ol ut e

certainty           that        I went,       accurately,               straight             to    the     carotid artery.

For    all    these           reasons,        I can          sa y    t ha t     I felt        for a        pulse      in the          region

of    the    carotid artery,                  but       1 may        have       also        touched        the a r e a        of     the

"Adams Apple"                or    felt     something               in the          ne ck    region which             1 originally

thought       was       a     pulse      but m a y       have        been mistaken.

I refer        to      the      face     going      "grey"           and      hi s    " f a ce w a s       withdrawn."                I

cannot       sa y      specifically              th at       t hi s w a s       a    change        from     normal        paller           to

the    sequence             of w h e n     I became           aware        of        it.

I refer        to a p p r o a c h i n g       the       lad a n d       having       the    impression          t h at      his       head

moved and associating                      t h is w i t h         his       being    sick.        I am    now a bs o l u t e l y

satisfied           t h at    he w a s     not      sick,         or    certainly          I did    not    see       vomitting               or

vo m i t .     Th e    movement          of    the       head,         if    thats    what     it was,         I would           sa y    its

best     d e s c r i b e d as a         'twitch5.

I refer        to     clearing          his m o u t h         before         resuscitation,          by    that          I mean         to

sa y   I checked             that    his a i r w a y w a s             clear     before      expressing             air     into        his

mouth.         There was a fluid                    of       some      description          but    I accept          readily            that

this     could have            been      spittle             or   p hl e gm .

I refer        to     the m a n      going         grey after               about    5 minutes       and a very

                                                                                     This was       again       not       vomit         but

its    true     to     say     I can       still         remember            it n o w as     it    caused       me       to h e a v e

and    feel     s ic k       myself.

1 r e f e r to p e r f o r m i n g m o u t h to m o u t h w h i l s t the St J o h n a m b u l a n c e m a n

did    heart        compression            for a b o u t          7 minutes.              Whilst    this       is    purely

recollection             I believe            it    to       reasonably accurate.

Having       changed          places with               the St J o h n s         Ambulance         man    I refer           to

feeling        what      I thought            was       an    unusual         ri b   cage a n d a b d o m e n .             A

photograph            I have        been      s h o w n at        p o st     mortem appears          to    suggest              this.

I refer        to     unzipping          the       lads       trousers          at   this    po i n t a n d     in m y          second

I have       been      shown        documents which                    purport       to    give    timings          of    the

2nd ambulance                (be i ng    the       1st S Y M A S a m b u l a n c e ).          I have      considered                 this

show     the    casualty            being      carried            on a       stretcher       at    15.32       (1532)           and

which        I understand would                    be    before         I saw and a s s i s t e d         to    resuscitate

h i m at     the S p i o n H o p         end       of    the      ground.        I cannot         reconcile          the        time

sequences            and    I am       s ti l l    sure    t ha t     I did       see a n a m b u l a n c e ,           distinguish

in m y     own m ind            that     it w a s    not       of St       Johns       but H e a l t h A u t h o r i t y        and

t h at    I told       the St J o h n s            man w ith me            to    stop       the a m b u l a n c e .       I have

considered            t h at     what     I referred            to m a y        have       been    this a mb u l a n c e

exiting         from       the    stadium          but    I d o n ’t t h i n k         it was.         My    recollection              is

still      that       it w a s      entering         the       stadium.          I re fer         to   being       joined       by a

w o m a n St J o h n s a m b u l a n c e           officer       who       p u s h e d me      out     of    the way.           I

recollected            t h is     to    have       been about             6 minutes          after       I had      changed

places         with    the m a l e        St J o h n s     officer.              That       makes      a to t al ,       from

recollection               of    13 m i n u t e s    joint       resuscitation with                      the St         Johns    mal e.

I would         standby          these       estimates          only       in a s m u c h as           I feel       we    attempted

resuscitation               for     between         10 a n d     15 m i n u t e s .

Within a further                  two m i n u t e s       of    b a t h St       Johns       people wo rk i ng            together,

the m a n       declared          "He's       gone" and          stood          up.        I referred         to a n d     re-affirm

t h at    he w a s     “completely                grey" and          there       is a b s o l u t e l y      no    doubt    in m y

mind,      both       now w it h        the       benefit       of    further          training,            and    t h e n at       that

moment         that    the y o u t h         I had       tried       to    save       was    dead,       certainly         dead and

beyond any            further          help.        I and       the St          Johns       personnel         would       not       h av e

stopped         if    there       had     been a n y       glimmer          of h o p e a t         all      - there       was       none.

I describe            the       body    of    the y o u t h      on P 8 & 9            (43 & 44)            and    believe          the

distinguishing                  features          I referred          to    12 m o n t h s        ago are         plain    to       see       on

photographs.

I have         seen    injuries           shown      on    photographs                of    the    n ec k    a r ea ,    however          I

did      not    see    them       or    notice       them       on    the       day.

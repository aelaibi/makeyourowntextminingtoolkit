RE: HILLSBOROUGH

1.     I acknowledge receipt of the papers which Paul sent last week received from the
       Home Office on Hillsborough.

2.    Prior to the meeting to be arranged between ourselves, Law Officers and Home
       Office, I should be grateful if a note could be prepared as to the present position and
       outstanding actions which the Director may need to consider in her own right. This
       should be prepared in sufficient time for us to consult the Director in advance if
       necessary.

3.    I assume that all necessary holding replies have now been sent to the various
       correspondents.

       Thanks.

Re: Hillsborough

Further to our recent telephone conversation.

I attach for your use a complete set of the papers (minus videos)
that have been forwarded by Paul Pugh from the Home Office.

These have been acknowledged and steps are being taken to arrange
the meeting that he refers to in the final paragraph of his
letter.

These papers will be brought to George Croston's attention,
though this might not be until shortly before your video link
conference, and to Peter's upon his return to the office.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can assist further.

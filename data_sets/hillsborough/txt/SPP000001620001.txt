FILE NOTE DATED 12 .10 .^ U'. -..15. p.m.       MR FRAZER RANG-

He wanted to know when I was having my Pre-inquest Review.

He was^obviously very anxious that we should have this as

soon as possible.
I explained that I was still worrying about the

technicalities about it but on the whole I felt that if I

was going to do it, it would be towards the end of October.

He said that that was O.K. though the sooner I did it the

better.
He then re-confirmed that they were getting instructions

direct from the Hillsborough Family Support Group and it

was therefore possible to communicate with people very

quickly.
He mentioned that there were one or two people who had some

small queries on the individual inquests and was I

proposing to deal with these and if so when.              I said I

hadn't really intended to do that but I would consider the

point.     He suggested that they would ask the families to

let him have in writing any points which they want to put

to me and it might be possible for them to put these to me

in writing.       If we could sort them out they could either be

dealt with by correspondence and/or perhaps in the

beginning before we got down to the generics proper.

I said that I thought that that was a good idea.

I then explained to him that I was not intending to go over

all the ground of the^rescue.              Mr. Frazer agreed with this.

He said he thought in his view probably 6 minutes past 3
                                      V.
              was the cut-off "point.         I said I felt that it might "be a

y/            few minutes beyond that but that was basically what I had

              in mind.     I. explained to him that although we had dealt

              with "the rescue" at the interin inquests, this was because

              I had felt that it was only fair that the familes should

              have some idea of the amount of effort and time that had

              been put into this and also that should they wish to have

              this explored at another place, they would at least know

              who the people were who were involved.                He acknowledged

              this as havinq been a good and proper thing to do.                   I asked

                                                     are being raised were

                                                     t think so.      He said as far
              as he could recollect they were relatively minor matters.

              He saic
                   .id having fixed the end point, could IC crive
                                                            give him an

                                how far back I was                   go.    I said that
              was a little bit more difficult, but I would

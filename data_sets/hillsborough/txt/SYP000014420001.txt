          Myself,            my wife an d          2 daughters                obtained             ou r      tickets         from An fi el d with

          the       2 girls          getting       standing             tickets          on    vouchers             from        their     Hop

          Season        Ticket.             My wife          was       allocated a             seat          tic k e t ,     and      I myself       was

          given a standing                   ticket         - by        the       allocation              based        on the M a i n         Stand

          Season Ticket                Serial          Number          allocation.

          We    travelled             together          in m y         car    to S h e f f i e l d m a k i n g             only       1 s t o p at       the

          Woodall            Services        j ust      after          Junction          30    on       the     Ml.        We    then     proceeded

          along        the      Ml    and    followed             the P o l i c e        signs          at    the      first       junction,

          asking         us     to    proceed          to    the       next.        We    encountered a                    long       tailback       (1 -

          2    miles         in n e a r s i d e    lane)          but    I continued                in the          centre         lane      towards

          the       front       of    the    que u e ,       where       I wa s       able         to     leave        the      motorway          down

          the       dual      carriageway              section          of    the     slip         road.          (Time a p p r o x i m a t e l y

          12.10pm).              We    then       foil o w e d         the    signed          route          to H i l l s b o r o u g h a n d w h e n

          we    got     to      the    Ground,          I travelled along                      the        A61    Penistone             Road       towards

          the       c it y    until     I was          able       to    turn       round and              return        to      the    car    park

          w h i c h was         being       provided          in the          corner          of    the       large        park       between       the

          A61       Penistone          Road and             the    A616 Parkside                   Road.          We    parked         the    car at

          approximately                12.45       pm a n d we           h a d the        picnic             l u n c h w h i c h we       had

          brought            with     us.

          At    about         1.40     pm we       left       the       car,       walked along                 Parkside           Road      to    the

          Leppings            Lane     end and          arranged             to    rendezvous                wit h my wife             outside       the

          small        tobacconists               to    the       left       of    the a p p r o a c h are a .                  In the       bridge

a p p r o a c h are a ,         I would          estimate          perhaps          6 -       10 P o l i c e      Officers          were

present           (no P o l i c e         horses)       and       it w a s all           fairly        calm w i t h       only        small

numbers           of    f ans    milling             around.

Between           the    car a n d a r r i v a l            at    the    turnstiles,               we w e r e      asked       by a b o u t

3    people        if we        had a ny         spare       tickets          - normal           for    such a          big    game.

Other        than       in the a p p r o a c h are a ,                 1 only       remember           seeing       Police

Officers           (2 or 3)           n ear      a    small      Police        kiosk          on P a r k s i d e    R o ad,         1 do

not     remember           seeing          ANY mounted             Police          at all.

At     about       1.33       pm,     my 2 daughters                   and    I went          through        the    turnstiles,

our     tickets          being        take n,         split       and    the       ' r etain '        section       returned.

Upon     entering             the     yard       beyond,          I remember             s m all      numbers       of    people

milling           around,          with     1 Policeman                near    our       turnstile           and    perhaps           1 - 2

more     in the y a r d              a r ea.         There       were    about          2 - 3      stewards         in the          general

area     plus          2 selling           programmes             to    the    left       of     the     tun n e l .

The     'standing"              sign       above       the       tunnel       was       the     only    guidance

visible           given       to     us a n d        there       was    no    indication              that     it w a s       not     the

only way           to    the       terraces.            liy d a u g h t e r s       proceeded           down       the    tunnel,            and

I bought           2    programmes              from    the       venders          to    the     left     of      the    tunnel.

I wanted           a    cup     of    coffee          and    observed          a    refreshment              kiosk       to    the     right

of     the    tunnel          -- I b e l i e v e       under       the       stairway           into     the      seating          a r ea.     I

queued        for       a few minutes                 and    purchased             my    cup     of    coffee .          It w a s      this

act     that       enabled           me    to    see    it w a s        possible          to     go a r o u n d     the       base     of

the W e s t        Stand        into       the       corner       Terraces          between           the W e s t       and South

Stands.            This       area was           sparsely          occupied with                 a wide        choice         of

positions,              I took        up a       position about                2nd       barrier        from       the    rear        in

front        of    the     floodlight                tower       and    to    the       left     of    the P o l i c e        box.

(See     exhibit          A).         I stood          in this          position          drinking           my    coff ee,         reading

t he    programme             and     listening             for T e a m       n ews      etc     on the        small      transistor

radio        I had       in m y       pocket .

A    little        before          the     kick-off,             (approximately                 14.50     pm),      I noticed
                                                                                                                               PAGE         3
                                                                                                                               D 892

there    were       large        numbers         of     people       in th e       centre        sections           (I    now

understand          these        to    be    known       as P e n s        Numbers       3 and       4).       F r o m my

position          on the      terrace,            I could          quite     clearly        see      the       dividingfence

and    could       see     several          people       crushed against                 t his    side      fence,            many

clearly       in s o m e      distress.                One    in p a r t i c u l a r ,    an     o l d man,         I believe

wearing       a    light       grey     coat       or     possibly          suit,    had       his    e ye s    closed.

People       were       being     pulled          from       the    rear     of    the    Pens       up    into      the       seating

the    dividing           fence       and    some       youths       were        scrambling          over      the       pitch       side

fence    but       were       being     repelled/arrested                    by P o l i c e      Officers           on    the

pitch.       A senior         Police         Officer          was    standing        on the          landing         of       the

Police       Box,       I would        estimate           s ome     10 f e e t     away     f r o m my         position and I

called       several          times     to       him    trying       to a t t r a c t     his     attention              to    the

crushing.            (I    believe          he    had     gold      braid        on the     peak      of    his      c ap a n d was

wearing       a    light       coloured           anorak).           He     i g n o r e d me     completely              and

continued          to     observe       the       scene       for    s ome       minutes       until       he w a l k e d          down

the    steps       and     round       the       segregation           barrier       underneath             the      South          Stand.

Referee       to    stop       the     game       some        few m i n u t e s     later ).

A   television            cameraman with                as h o u l d e r    held    video        camera         (I       think        the

one    shown       in E x h i b i t     ' A * 5 took          up     a similar           p o s i t i o n but a f t e r         many

shouts       from       the    crowd        (and       possibly        s ome      coin    throwing)            he    then          left

the    landing          and went        back       under       the S o u t h S t a n d .

Another       Police          Officer        who       1 believe           1 can    recognise             facially            (I

believe       to    have       had     black       braid       on the        peak    of     his      cap)      t ook      up a

similar       position           on    the       steps/landing.                  1 again       implored         him       several

times    that       people were              being       crushed           and    couldn't        he do s o m e t h i n g            to

help.        He    initially           i g n o r e d me a n d        then        after    s a y 3 or 4          calls          to    him,

Both myself             and     the     man      standing            on my        left     were       extremely          concerned

as    1 knew       this       was      roughly where                 my d a u g h t e r s      were     and      t his    man        said

he    had a son               in th e     same     section.                More      and      more     people      were       beginning

to    climb       out         of the      section              and       I became         increasingly            concerned            for my

daughters*          safety.

The    game       had    j ust      kicked         off     and a Police                  cordon       of 2 - 3 m e n           deep

were    put       in a n a r c        around        the        2    central        Pens        behind     the     goal     and        it

was    obvious          th at     their       purpose              was    to    prevent         anybody       climbing           o ve r

the    barrier.           It      is m y      belief           tha t      several         people       were actually                 held

back    a n d all        the      signs       were        t hat      the P o l i c e       Officers         had     been       given

instructions                  to c o n t a i n   the           people w i th in            the    P e n area.            Officers

along       the    fence          appeared         to          be    pushing         people       back,       whereas          their

colleagues          standing            in the         arc were            j ust       standing        watching,          many        with

their       arms     crossed.             I would          estimate             t his     took    p l ace     for      s ome     5          10

minutes,          bringing          the     time       to a p p r o x i m a t e l y        13.05 -        15.10.

It w a s     during       this         time      t h at    the O f f i c e r           in the     li ght      coloured anorak

ran    onto       the    pitch and            spoke        to the R e f e r e e ,              whereupon         the     gam e       wa s

stopped.           (I k n o w       thi s     to    be     15.06).

I also       noticed a            large       number           (100 -          150 a p p r o x i m a t e l y )    Police

Officers          emerged         from      the     opposite              corner         and    they     t ook    up     lines

across       the    pitch         at    the      ' c entre*          and along            the N o r t h     Stand.I           started

to m o v e    down       the      terraces          towards              the     s ide    fence       to try      to

find    my    daughters             and     to     render           what       assistance         I could.

As    I got       approximately               h al f      way       down,       I saw      the    l imp     form       of my

youngest          daughter          Victoria,             being          passed        over     the    barrier.           I

therefore          changed          direction             to       the    pitch access            gate      from my           section

(which was          manned          by a P o l i c e m a n )             and    pushed my way             onto      the       pitch.

1 came       upon my 2            daughters            Victoria            and Sarah,            l aid    on the p i t c h            just

at    the    touchline            slightly          to     the       r i ght      of     the    goal.       S a r a h was

receiving          assistance             from      1 man and              he,      myself       plus 2 o t h e r s           started

men    attended           to S a r a h      called        for        suction          (I h a v e        since       discovered              that

this    was       Dr C K F l e n l e y } ,            while     we     continued              to    resuscitate             my

daughters           I shouted my              daughters              names       into       their        ears       and     called          to

Police/Medics                several        times        for     suction          but       none was           available.               We

then     continued             taking       turns        at     mouth       to    mouth        resuscitation.                         One man

was    called away              to    help a friend and                     it    therefore              left m y s e l f         and 1

other     giving          mouth       to m o u t h       resuscitation                 on V i c t o r i a w i t h Dr F l e n l e y

and    a man       in a        chequered          shir t ,       (who w a s           apparently              an o f f - d u t y

Policeman          from        the    crowd)          rendering            assistance              to S a r a h .         There        was       no

medical       equipment              or a s s i s t a n c e      available             to     us    throughout              this       time.

We    continued           to    give       mouth       to m o u t h        resuscitation,                    taking       turns        for

some     10 m i n u t e s       or m o re ,       whereupon            the       first        ambulance             (the     one

trapped       behind           the    goal 5 t r i e d          to    get    past        us    catching my             t oes      as        I

This     ambulance             had     taken      up a        ridiculous              position with                 its m o v e m e n t

onto/off          the     ground          grossly        impaired.               Presumably              this       was     to    avoid

cutting       up the           playing        surface.

We    continued           to a t t e m p t       to    resuscitate               my    daughters              for     a few more

minutes       when a fireman                  c ame      over        carrying          an     oxygen          bottle        with       a f ace

mask    attached             (s m o k e - i n h a l a t i o n    device?)             but     this       was     no    good       as    we

could     not       get      th e    girls       to    breath         unaided and              the       pressure           in the

bottle/regulator                    was    insufficient               to    force       oxygen           into       their        lungs.

A    second ambulance                  came      o nto    the        pitch area a nd                stopped adjacent                     to

us.     We    agreed           to    put S a r a h       and Vict or ia               into     this          ambulance.               Two       of

us    put V i c t o r i a       into       the    second ambulance                     and were              about     to    turn

around       and     lift       Sarah       into       it,      when       a third          group        of    people        put       in a

man    who    ha d      to     go    onto     the      flo o r .       1 then was              faced with              the a w f u l

choice       of    leaving           Sarah,       who     I was        assured would                    be    placed        in the          next

The    ambulance          started           to m o v e a w a y         so     I rejoined Victoria                     and        along

oxygen         bottle     a n d we      continued            throughout                the     t ime    it    to ok      us      to    reach

the    Northern         General         Hospital.               The        ambulance          man was         of      the     opinion

he    f e lt    a faint       pulse         on a       couple         of    occasions             during      th is      journey.

V ic to r ia was        then      taken          straight         into        the C a s u a l t y       section          and       because

they     thought        there was             possibly          s ome       life,       received          immediate              medical

attention         from a team               of D o c t o r s      and Nurses                aided      by PC M c G u i n n e s s .               I

observed         for    s om e    2    or 3 m i n u t e s ,           whereupon             I was      asked       to    leave         the

area     a nd was       taken         into       a side       room.           Obviously            conditions            were

extremely         hectic         with       people        and     bodies          arriving          very      quickly.                The

Hospital        was     w ell     equip pe d and             I was          given       the       impression            t hat      all

possible         care w a s       being          taken with            people          who    were      believed            to     have a

cha n c e .

After     about        10 m i n u t e s ,        I was       informed            by PC       McGuinness            that       my

daughter        had     been      pronounced              dead.            I t h a n k e d PC M c G u i n n e s s           for       his

assistance          and      also      apologised            for       the       verbal       abuse       1 had         poured         upon

h i m as a       representative                  of    the P o l i c e        throughout            our      t im e     in the

ambulance         a n d at       the H o s p i t a l .          Once        I was       told       that      Victoria            was

dead,     I then went             around          the    Hospital             trying         to    locate Sar ah              on the

grounds         that    I had         been       told     she w o u l d          be    in a n a m b u l a n c e         following

closely        beh i n d .

After      some 30 mi n u t e s             of    futile        searching,              1 wa s      taken       to      the

Physiotherapy               Department              by a P s y c h i a t r i c         Nurse      (                           ) who

had     come     on d u t y       to     help with              the    problems.            I was        kept       in this

area     for     some       half        to    three        quarters           of a n     hour and           on a     couple         of

o c cas ions                                      tried     to       establish whether                 Sarah was             i n d e e d at

this     Hospital           or    not.            Eventually,            I was       taken       round        to    the      section        of

t he    Hospital         where          the       bodies        of    the     deceased          were     being       attended            to.

I gave        a description                  of S a r a h       to    the P o l i c e      Officers           on d u t y      and     it

appeared         that       they        had       'a y o u n g       un-identified              female''       who     could

possibly         h ave      been        the       Sarah.         A Police           Officer       went        into     the      room

and     brought        out a S w a t c h w a t c h w h i c h                  I. f elt     at    the     time w a s          the     same

as     that    of m y       daughter              Sarah.         After        about      10 or        15 m i n u t e s ,      I was

taken     across         to      th e    Hospital           Mortuary           to     i d e n t i f y wh o     I expected             to

be S a r a h .      It      is    now a m a t t e r             of    record        that    t his      w as    indeed V ict or ia

who     somehow        had       become           detached           from     her     label      when       I at      first

identified          her       on a d m i s s i o n         to    the H o s p i t a l .          Despite        the     unnecessary

distress         thi s      caused           to me       personally            I did       not    feel        bitter         towards

the     Hospital         as      I considered               they were            attempting            to     cope     with        the

extreme        pressure           tha t       was     put       upon     them.

Myself,                                      and    a Reverend              returned        to    the m a i n H o s p i t a l

building         and     I was          retained           for       perhaps        another       h alf a n         hour      or     so.

Throughout          th is        time,        I was        trying        to    establish          the       location          of    my

wife     and Sarah.               I explained again                      t hat      S a r a h ’s c o n d i t i o n w a s

obviously         serious          w h e n we were               on    the     pitch and          that        she was

supposedly          'in the             next       ambulance.’                I was      then     told        that     s ome

casualties         had        been       taken        to    the R o y a l        Hallamshire             Hospital            and    t hat

Sarah     could        be     there          (as     could my wife).

Communications                were       difficult              and    everybody,           both medical               and

administrative,                  were        at    full     s t r e t c h a n d all         telephone              l i nes    were

jammed.          I was        told       that       11     people were              d e a d at    the N o r t h e r n G e n e r a l

Hospital         and. t hat        no        other       females         were       th er e .     Further           discussions

arrival,          I gave       a full          description             to      the       staff       and    they        then

circulated          it    to     see      whether        Sarah         had        indeed        been admitted.                     I had       to

wait    in the          general          reception area                for        some     time,       attended              initially

point,       a man       in a s uit            stood     on a d e sk              and     called       for a t t e n t i o n .            He

read    out a        list      of     'patients*              who     ha d     been       taken       to     the N o r t h e r n

I made       formal       protests             to    both Hospital                and Police                Authorities             and

demanded          our    rights       to       see     our      child.           After       some       5 or       "iO m i n u t e s         we

were    advised          by the       Assistant              Matron         that     our      daughter's              b o d y was            no

taken    back       to    the H i l l s b o r o u g h           Ground.

I protested             strongly          at    this       callous          and     unnecessary               act,       especially

hospital          mortuary.           My       protestations                were      met     by       off-handedness                   by    the

Police       Officer        (who      claimed             it was       at     the C o r o n e r s           instruction)                and

sympathetically                by    the A s s i s t a n t        Matron           (who      had       tear       filled       eyes).

We    were    advised          that       there        were      'several           un-identified                  people          at    the

ground'       a n d we      should         return          there.

Nobody       advised       us       how many           casualties/bodies                     we       could       expect       to       find,

no    transport          was     offered and               we w e r e       left      to m a k e        our       own w a y        there.

                               drove       us       back     to Hi 1 l s b o r o u g h        in his          car,       whereupon                we

arrived       at    the     entrance            to     the G y m n a s i u m / T e m p o r a r y M o r t u a r y              at

approximately             22.00       hours.              We w e r e     refused          entrance            by a n       extremely

callous,          rude a n d        unbelievably                insensitive            Police           Officer          in    charge             on

regretfully,             I did       not       take       his    name.           He w a s     totally             callous          to m y

wife    and       I and     this      can       be     borne       out      by    the 2       independent

witnesses          aforesaid.              After          considerable              heated            argument        with         him,       I

compromised,             agreed       to       go    to    the     park a n d         collect           my    car,       whereupon                he

would    then allow              us a c c e s s        upon      our     return.The               4    of    us    plus       a Police

Constable          walked        b ack     along          Penistone           Road      to    the       corner        of      the       park

only    remaining           on      the    car       park.        We     then       drove         back       to    the     Ground

gates    and       parked        outside .Further                 remoristrations                     with aforesaid Police

he    upset     my wife          further          by    saying          we       had     no      rights        in the         matter,

that     the    girls         were     the       property          of       the       Coroner,          and would             have     to

undergo        a Post         Mortem.            His attitude                to       us,     and      handling          of    us,    was

unbelievably             callous.               I wish       to m a k e          a formal             complaint          about       this

Officer        when      he    can     be       identified.                 I gave          my    business           c ard     to a

Norwegian          Press       Photographer                 who    took          photographs              during         my

r e m o n s t r a t ions      with     the       Police       Officer.                Should          I receive          contact        from

him,     then      I will        make       these       available.                    The     best      that        the P o l i c e

Officer        could       do w a s        to    offer       for       us    to       sit     in a P o l i c e         van     for     30

minutes.           This       I refused           to    do a n d        said          t hat      I insisted            that     having

been     sent      there       by the H o s p i t a l ,            knowing             full       well        1 daughter         was        dead

and    suspecting             the     f ate      of    the    other,             I demanded             to     be a l l o w e d a c c e s s .

After     a few minutes,                   tw o C I D O f f i c e r s            ( a ged      in t h e i r      mid 30's         with         one

in a     brown       leather          jacket)          took       charge          of     the      situation and                g u i d e d my

wife,     myself         and     our       2 Social          Worker          colleagues                into     an a n t e r o o m .

This     Officer         is    to     be     commended            for       his       handling           of a n      extremely

difficult          situation.               He    did       explain          that        the      formalities             were       not

quite      completed and               he       did    so    in a s e n s i t i v e              and     caring        manner.

After     some       10 or       15 m i n u t e s       w a it,        we    were        shown         into     a    room at         the

side     of    the    gym na si um and                asked       to    view          some       81    Polaroid          photographs

which     were       pinned         to a b o a r d .          My wife             said        'Oh,      m y God,         how    can     there

be    so m a n y     dea d . *        He     replied         ' I ’m a f r a i d          that         t his    i s n ’t the       end       of

We    quickly        identified             the       photograph             of       our     youngest          daughter

Victoria,          but     initially were                   unable          to    see       t hat      of S a r a h .         Naturally,

that       they       be    brought           out    together.                 This      was     carried          out w i t h a

reasonable             degree          of     sensitivity                and    formal          identification,                 my w i f e

S a r a h ’s .

After       a few minutes                   to    say     our       farewells             to    our 2 d a u g h t e r s         we    were

ushered          to a s e r i e s           of    tables           set    up at           one end       of the          gymnasium,

Officers,             and       I was       asked        to    swear          out    a statement.                 We     also    took

receipt          of    the       personal           effects          of V i c t o r i a         which were              in a w h i t e

plastic          bag       from       the     Hospital.

At    the    s ame         time,       1 g ave       a description                   of a b r o w n        leather            jacket

some       10 -       13 m i n u t e s        delay,          (coinciding                with    the     time       I was       swearing

out    the       statement)              the      jacket           was    retrieved and                returned           to us.           Upon

examination                of    the     pockets,             all    of S a r a h ’s p e r s o n a l              effects,       money,

             9.    The    fences       were     such      they      prevented           escape      — even with           assistance

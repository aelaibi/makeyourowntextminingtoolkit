                       THE HILLSBOROUGH STADIUM DISASTER

               STATEMENT BY HONE SECRETARY: 17 APRIL 1989


 With     permission,          Mr   Speaker,      I    should     like     to moke      a
 Statement        about       the   disaster     at    the     Sheffield    Wednesday
 Football       Club ground at Hillsborough Stadium on Saturday.
 Everyone has          been    horrified by        this
                                        Incredible tragedy in
which 94 lost their lives and 174 were injured.


Shortly after the start of the match there was a surse of
spectators on the Leppings Lane terrace which crushed many at
the front against the perimeter fence.                         This accounted for
most of the deaths and injuries.


The match was due to start at 3 p.m.                      To help ensure orderly
access, the gates of the ground were opened at 12 noon.                                At
2.30 p.m. most of the Nottingham fans were in the ground, but
many of the Liverpool supporters were still arriving.                           It was
clear to the oolice officers In charas that                       there was ample
capacity still to be filled in some parts of the enclosure
allocated to Liverpool,


At about       2,45 p.m.        there was a large crowd              of Liverpool
supporters at the turnstiles in Leppings Lane behind the West
Stand.     There was difficulty in coping with the pressure on
the turnstiles and the police used loudhailers to urge the
crowd to be patient.

                                                  2.



At about 2.50 p.m. more Liverpool suooorters arrived and the
numbers         in          front    of     the     turnstiles       increased.          Some
supporters started to climb the walls and turnstiles                                        and
those at the front of the crowd outside the stadium were
under considerable pressure from those behind.


The senior police officer present considered that there was a
possible danger to the lives of the                         spectators at the front
of the crowd outside the stadium.                           In order to relieve the
pressure he arranged for an exit gate near the turnstiles to
be    opened           to    let a        section      of the crowd      through.           The
relationship of that action to the disaster on the terrace
shortly afterwards is clearly                           a central    auestion       to       be
investigated.


My Rt Hon friend the Prime Minister and I yesterday visited
the football ground and the two Sheffield hospitals which
received casualties.                  I would like to pay tribute to all
those      Involved           in the       rescue operations        at   the   ground/
including the many spectators who gave their help;                             and to
those Others,                including the hospital            staffs and voluntary
agencies who have since been working so hard                              treating the
injured and consoling the bereaved.                          We heard many accounts
of courage exerted on behalf of others.

                                                   3.



 I have asked for further factual reports from the oollce and
 other      services, the local authority and                                    the      Football
 Association.            Inquests will be held in due course.                            But over
 and      obove        this,     there     is     dearly need for a                     full       and
 independent inquiry to identify the causes of the disaster
 and to examine what needs to be done to prevent such an
 accident         happening        again.          I     have        therefore     asked Lori
 Justice Taylor to carry out an lnauiry, with                                    the following
 terms of reference;


           "To Inquire into the events at Sheffield
           Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989
           and to make recommendations about the needs
           of crowd             control     and        safety        at   sports
           events".


Mr     Brian Johnson,             the Chief Constable of Lancashire] has
agreed to osslst the lnauiry os on assessor)                              and arrangements
will be made as necessary for other qualified assessors to be
appointed and for the               inquiry to be provided with technical
advice and support.                 I am asking that the inquiry should
proceed with o n               oossible     soeed.            Lord    Justice    Taylor will
visit Sheffield tomorrow to begin his investigation.                                         I om
grateful to him for agreeing to undertake this task.

      Howeverj we need also to take a wider view,                                 The Government
      believes that the future of football In this country lies in
     a national membership scheme in designated grounds and now it
     seems also in providing all seated accommodation at major
     football         clubs,           This    would       involve the disappearance of
     terraces at those grounds.                      It might also involve amendments
     to    strengthen the Football                         Spectators      Bill    so    that        its
     provisions              for      the     licensing       of     grounds      matched           this
     concept.         We shall be considering these matters urgently. m4~^

     An appeal fund is being set up by the civic authorities of
     Liverppoi,         Nottingham and Sheffield. The Government will be
     contributing £500,000 immediately towards this fund.


     This was a devastating tragedy,                           Our deep sympathy goes to
     the families of those who died, to those recovering# and to
     those still fighting for life and health,                              We owe a         duty    to
     these passionate supporters of football to examine urgently
     and thoroughly the causes and background, and to do all in
     OUr DOWer-       to Drevent            Such a thing happening again.                    We have
     to set our sights high and find a better way for British

 With   permission,      Mr    Speaker,   I    should    like        to    make      a
 statement   a b o u t « the   terrible   accident      at     the        Sheffield
 Wednesday Football Club ground at Hillsborough on Saturday.
 The whole nation has been horrified and astonished by this
 appalling tragedy in which J > 8 # 1 ^ 1 o s t their lives and [£<^]
 were injured.     I know the whole House will wish to Join me in
  expressing our deepest sympathy for the families and friends
  of the dead and for the many injured,           Lj&rie]      of whom remain
  critically ill.                                       /k .


( My Rt Hon friend the Prime Minister and I visited Sheffield
  yestrerday, when we met many of those involved in the tragedy.
  The Chief Constable of South Yorkshire told us that shortly
  after the start of the match there was a surge of spectators
  on the Leppings Lane terrace which crushed many at the front
  against the safety barrier.         This accounted for most of the
  fatalities and injuries.


  The match was due to start at 3 p.m.           To help ensure orderly
  access, the gates of the ground were opened at 12 noon.                           At
  2.30 p.m. most of the Nottingham fans were in the ground, but
 many of the Liverpool supporters were still arriving.                       It was
  clear to the police officers in charge that there was ample
  capacity still to be filled in the parts of the enclosure
  allocated to Liverpool.
At     about       2.45 p.m.          there was a large crowd                        of Liverpool
supporters at.the turnstiles in Leppings Lane behind the West
Stand.         There was difficulty in coping with the pressure on
the turnstiles afid the police used loudhailers to urge the
c r o w d to b e p a t i e n t .

At about 2.50 P.m. more Liverpool supporters arrived and the
 numbers in front of the turnstiles increased to some three to
 four thousand.                Some supporters started to climb the walls
 and turnstiles and those at the front of the crowd were under
 considerable pressure from those behind.                                  The police officers
 present, mounted and on foot, were unable                                       to relieve this
 pressure.

     The    senior        officer,       present        considered           that      there       was      a
     p o s s i b l e d a n g e r to the lives of the s p e c t a t o r s at the f r o n t
     of the c r ow d, and in o r d e r to r e l i e v e the p r e s s u r e a r r a n g e d

I would     like to pay tribute to all those involved in the
subsequent     rescue operations           at the ground,         including   the
many spectators who gave their help;                       and to those others,
including the vofuntary agencies who have since been working
so hard treating the injured and consoling the bereaved.


I have asked for further factual reports from the police and
other     services,        the     local       authority    and   the   Football
Association.      Inquests will be held in due course.                  But over
and above this, there is a need for a full and independent
inquiry to identify the causes of the disaster and to examine
what needs to be done to prevent such an accident happening
again. I have therefore asked Lord Justice Taylor to carry
out an inquiry, with the following terms of reference:


        "To    inquire      into     the events at Sheffield

        control       at    sports     events,      including     any
        necessary     changes              in      the      relevant

     FOOTBALL SPECTATORS BILL



  A - General Note


               o                   the Vootboll Spectators Bill deals specifically
 with        excluding         football hooligans fro, grounds.    ,t has
 always been the case that new admission procedures repaired
 when the national football membership scheme comes into force
 will hove to aualify for a safety certificate in the normal
 way.         Safety          must     always     be      paramount,        but     excluding
 troublemakers must in principle be a contribution to safety.

B - Will the scheme cause crowd problems?


 It is clearly necessary to design and implement the system of
membership           checking, such           that     disorder      does     not     result.
This will be a major consideration for the Government,                                     the
Police         and      the          football        authorities.           Saturday       has
demonstrated           only      too     tragically        that     there     is     alreadya
problem        about      last       minute     crowds      at    matches.          Po-tential
suppliers of membership and eqiupment have said that it is
possible for cards to be checked in no extra time than it
now takes for people to pass through the turnstiles.


If     the    co mp u t e r     equipment       shoul d     fail,    the     sch e m e   will

C - Where next for the Bill?


The   Bill    is     an   enabling    framework.         The   Government      has
already      given    a    full   commitment       not    to       implement   the
membership     scheme within         that framework       until      arrangements
have satisfactorily been worked out.                 That commitment still
stands and obviously now embraces the lessons to be learned
from these tragic events.


D - Popplewell

Popplewell Inquiry in 1986 that consideration should be given

Clearly the police operation in and around the stadium will
form an important part of the Inquiry I have announced today,
and will be fully ‘investigated.



IF PRESSED:   Any formal complaint by a member of the public

     Should this season's FA C u d competition be abandoned?

     These are matters for the Football Association.


     What Here the first aid arrangements at the match?

     As is normal practice at Football League and FA Cup match'esT
     the St John s ambulance were in attendance.    Iam sure this
     is something the Inquiry will wish to examine.


     How were the tickets to the match allocated?

    This is will be investigated during the Inquiry.




    Background

     The Football Association allocated 27,783         tickets  to
     Nottingham Forest Football Club and 23,542 to Liverpool. .The
     discrepancy is a reflection of the fact that ticket
     allocations are determined by crowd segregation arrangements
     at the ground. In this case the police advised, for traffic
     flow reasons outside the ground,         that the Liverpool
^   ^supporters should be accommodated in the Leppings Lane end of
          sround.  The same arrangement was made when the same
     teams met in last season's FA Cup semi final.

The Home Office/Scottish Office "Guide to Sofety at Sports
 Grounds"
   (JUIIU O is
            AO intended to Provide advice to both ground
   ,erators and "certificating" local authorities on spectator
 OP<
 safety.



  Status of the Guide

   The Guide is a voluntary code but may b e c a l l e d up in terms
   and conditions in safety certificates.



    Adequacy of the Guide

    The      Guide       was      revised         in October        1986   in   the   light   of
     recommendations from the Popplewell Inquiry.



      Any additional studies on adequacy of crush barriers?


      Home Office engineers have attended tests on crush barriers
      with engineers carrying out the test procedures advocated in
       the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.                              There have been no
        indications that the procedures recommended in the Guide were

        inadequate.
Railways



Only 1,000 of the Liverpool spectators came to Sheffield by
train, arriving in good time.   (The train was due at 2.10
D.n. and in fact arrived at 1.55 p.m., over an hour before
the kick-off).
O P E R A T I O N OF T H E SA FE T Y OF S P O R T S G R O U N D S ACT 1975


The main mechanism for acieving safety is by "designation" by
Order by the Secretary of State requiring a sports ground to
applyto the local authority for a safety certificate.

 Issue of the Safety Certificate

 The issue of the safety certificate is the responsibility of
 the local authority, who is under a duty to issue one.

 Contents of a safety certificate

 A safety certificate will contain terms and conditions
 “necessary or expedient" to secure "reasonable" safety. For
 example, it includes conditions on authorised numbers of
 spectators to a ground, or any part of a ground;        the
 exits/entrances to the ground; size, location, strength of
  the crush barriers.


   Effects of the PoDDlewell Inquiry on the 1975 Act

   The 1975 Act was amended as from 1 January 1988 by Part II of
   the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 which
   reflected HMG's response to the Popplewell Inquiry.

   Effects of changes on Hillsborough

    The main effect is that from 1 January 1988 there is a duty
    on the local authority to arrange for an annual inspection of
    the ground. Inspections are carried out in accordance with
    guidelines from the Home Office. These are in addition to
    any   test/inspection   requirements  set   by   the   safety
    certificate.

Grounds"       is    intended       to    provide       advice         to   both   ground
operators and "certificating" local authorities on spectator
safety.



Status of the Guide


The Guide is a voluntary code but may be.called up in terms
and conditions in Safety certificates.



Adequacy of the Guide


The    Guide     was     revised       in October            1986    in the    light of
recommendations from the Popplewell Inquiry.



Any additional studies on adequacy of crush barriers?


Home Office engineers have attended tests on crush barriers
with engineers carrying out the test procedures advocated in
the Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds.                              There have been no
indications that the procedures recommended in the Guide were
inadequate.

Only 1*000 of the Liverpool spectators came to Sheffield by
train, arriving in good time.   (The train was due at 2.10
p.n. and in fact arrived at 1.55 p.m., over an hour before
the kick-off).
    P E R A T I O N OF T H E S A F E T Y OF S P O R T S G R O U N D S A C T 1975


The main mechanism for acieving safety is by "designation" by
Order by the Secretary of State requiring a sports ground to
applyto the local authority for a safety certificate.

Issue of the Safety Certificate

The issue of the safety certificate is the responsibility of
the local authority, who is under a duty to issue one.

Contents of a safety certificate

A  safety certificate will contain terms and conditions
 necessary or expedient" to secure "reasonable" safety. For
example, it includes conditions on authorised numbers of
spectators to a ground, or any part of a ground;         the
exits/entrances to the ground;  size, location, strength of
the crush barriers.


Effects of the Popplewell Inquiry on the 1975 Act

The 1975 Act was amended as from 1 January 1988 by Part II of
the Fire Safety and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987 which
reflected HMG's response to the Popplewell Inquiry.

The main effect is that from 1 January 1988 there is a duty
on the local authority to arrange for an annual inspection of
the ground. Inspections are carried out in accordance with
guidelines from the Home Office. These are in addition to
any   test/inspection  requirements   set by     the   safety
certificate.

exception if that used by Torquay United, which cannot
accommodate 10,000 spectators).
Who is in charge:   the club or the police?


It will be one of the tasks of the inquiry to examine the
arrangements made by the club and the police for the
stewarfing and policing of spectators at the match. There is
Invariably close consultation between the police and clubs
over such arrangements.




IF PRESSED:


The police have responsibility for the preservation of the
peace and the maintenance of public order. If they perseive
a threat to public order or public safety, they have a duty
to take action to counter it.        This is an operational
Judgment for the senior police officer.

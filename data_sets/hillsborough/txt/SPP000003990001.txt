I- . Dr S L Popper




 Our reference         Extension            Your reference         Date
 JMJ/WO’D/1636          2091                                        14th January 1993




 I enclose, with pleasure, a copy of Mr Kilbey’s letter and my response to it. I have also
 made enquiries as to whether evidence was ever received from Dr James Bums (a Home
 Office Pathologist referred to on page 37 of the application for Judicial Review). A search
 of the Hillsborough database, now held by South Yorkshire Police, shows no record of
 having done so.

 I will continue to keep you in touch with developments as they are made known to me.

 I wish you a happy and peaceful 1993.

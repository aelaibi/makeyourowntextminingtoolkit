           MINUTES OF A DIRECTORS MEETING HELD IN THE
           CLUB BOARD ROOM ON FRIDAY 8 |H MARCH 1991~


Service of Remembrance

The General Secretary reported on a meeting which he had attended earlier
this day with the Hillsborough Family Support Group Committee to finalise the
arrangements for a Service of Remembrance at the Liverpool Cathedral on
the 15th April 1991, for those supporters who had lost their lives in the
Hillsborough Tragedy on the 15 April 1989. It was agreed that the club
should agree to pay the following costs in connection with this service

The printing of the Service hymn Sheets.

The cost of transportation by motor coaches for the families of the bereaved
and club personnel from the Anfield Ground to the Liverpool Cathedral and
return in the afternoon of the 15th April 1991.

The cost of providing at the Anfield Ground tea before the Service and light
refreshments after the Service for the bereaved families and club officials
attending the Service.

The General Secretary further reported that it is necessary for the stone
tablets to be replaced on the Memorial because a number of the names of the
deceased are incorrectly spelt. The bereaved families believe that the Club
Architects must accept responsibility for the mistakes. Some repairs are also
necessary to the gas flame system. It was confirmed that the club should
agree to pay the cost of replacing the stone tablets and the necessary repairs
to the gas flame system. The estimated total cost of Â£17,500.00. Attempts to
be made to recovered this cost from the Club Architects Insurance or the
Hillsborough Trust.

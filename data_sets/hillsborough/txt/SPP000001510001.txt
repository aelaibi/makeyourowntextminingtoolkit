  Dear Mervyn,

  Thank you for the fax re conversation with Mr. Hayes. I agree with
  your explanations to him.

  For the sake of the record :

  1. It is essential that all representatives and by extension the
  interested parties must be treated in an equal and even handed
  manner. It follows that SYP are not entitled to any privileges nor
  are they to be put at a disadvangage as compared to other interested
  parties.

  2. I confirm that it is my decision as to whom I wish to call and also
  my decision as to whether advance notice of the names of potential
  witnesses should be disclosed to interested parties or their
  representatives and if so whether this should be restricted to those
  who attended the meeting on 30th Oct. 1990.

  3. As indicated at the meeting of 30th Oct. 1990 I am not prepared
  to supply copy statements made by potential witnesses. There is no
  question of early disclosure of what is likely to be said. As you have
  pointed out the coronal enquiry is inquisitorial and not adversarial.

   4. To avoid doubt point 3 above does not apply where I decide that
   in exceptional cases copy statements or information should be supplied
   to witnesses. This could well apply for instant to expert witnesses
   though not to expert witnesses who are introduced by interested
   parties and who I decide in the interests of the enquiry or justice
   to caLt. Nor of course does it apply to WMP officers working on the
   inquiry or undertaking assignments or preparation of reports or
   statements at my request.

   5. My objective is to have a proper coronal inquiry and that it
   should be undertaken fairly, even handedly, openly and with the
   purpose of establishing the truth as far as this falls within my
   jurisdiction so that the jury at the end of the day can reach a
   verdict on the evidence.




   Yours sincerely,
         A   L

Subject:                 Quote for No 10 on the Hillsborough Disaster


Phil,

Please find attached a draft quote from TB re: Hillsborough which No 10 have insisted upon this evening in
response to a request from the Liverpool Echo.

I have discussed it in draft with lain Hepplewhite in Press Office. However, the quote has not been cleared
with Home Office (who have the lead on the policing aspects of the Hillsborough Disaster) and this should
be made clear when it is eventually faxed over to No 10.

DRAFT QUOTE CLEARED BY T O N Y BANKS RE: HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER



Jt is right and proper th a t we take a moment this week to reflect on the tragic events which occurred
at Hillsborough ten years ago. The past decade has seen dramatic improvements in safety and com fort
at football grounds in this country, and the way in which football matches are controlled. However there
is no room for complacency and the Government are determined th a t the improvements in spectator
safety since 1989 are built upon in the new Millennium. That is why we intend to establish a Sports
Grounds Safety A uthority to enable other sports to benefit from the expertise of the Football Licensing
Authority. We must never have a repeat of the Hillsborough Disaster.

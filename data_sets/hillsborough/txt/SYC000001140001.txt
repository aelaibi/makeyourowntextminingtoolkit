                                FOREWORD



I very much appreciate that the forthcoming inquests could cause you,
members of your family and supporting friends, distress. With that in
my mind a prime objective of Her Majesty's Coroner, myself, my West
Midlands Police colleagues and the Social Services is to ensure that
any distress is kept to a minimum and that you are adequately and
sympathetically supported.  If at any time whilst in Sheffield you
feel you need help please do not hesitate to contact me or one of my
officers. My officers can be contacted on 0742-731546.   (An
answerphone operates after normal office hours.)

We will do our utmost to ensure that all the necessary support is
available to y o u .

The contents of the attached guide may prove helpful in finding the
locations where the Inquests will be held.

The Memorial   Hall, Sheffield is the venue for the 'Hillsborough
Inquests' on   Wednesday 18 April and Thursday 19 April 1990. On Friday
20 April the   inquests will continue at the Medico Legal Centre.

The premises are located at therear of, and form part of, the much
larger Sheffield City Hall, Barkers Pool, Sheffield city centre.

Access to Car Parking

Limited parking will be available in the vicinity of the Memorial
Hall. Vehicles should proceed to Holly Street via Division Street (as
indicated on Appendix 'A'). On production of this document next of
kin will be directed to a suitable parking facility.

The (2) Railway Station is situated approximately half a mile across
the city centre.

(Appendix 'A' shows the locations of the above, together with (3)
access to Sheffield city centre by car from Junction 33 of the M1 ).

General Information

The auditorium is of theatre style comprising seating in a main area
and on a balcony. Approximately 500 people can be accommodated.

Commissionaires from the Hall will be on duty and available to direct
you, in addition to any Solicitor, Social Worker or friend who may
accompany you. West Midlands Police Officers who will present inquest
summaries will also be available to assist you in the building.

The balcony seating has been reserved for press representatives and no
access to this area will be permitted to the general public, unless
the main auditorium becomes full to capacity.  Press representatives
will not be permitted on the ground floor of the auditorium. The
proceedings will be relayed live to a press room. Within the main
auditorium some seating (front centre) has been reserved for legal
representatives who have been afforded representation by HM Coroner
and for the Coroner's Jury. Ample seating will be available for the
bereaved and their friends.

Privacy/Support

HM Coroner and his West Midlands Police staff keenly appreciate the
potential for distress which the resumed inquests may cause the
bereaved.

Sensitivity will be striven for at all times. A room away from public
view, where relatives may compose themselves will be made available.
One of the West Midlands Police team will direct you to this room on
request.

Although many have chosen to have a Social Worker to accompany them,
some have not. Sheffield Social Services (Hillsborough Task Team)
will be available to provide support/counselling again if requested.

Refreshments

Beverages, biscuits and sandwiches will be available on the first
floor of the building, provided by the Womens' Royal Voluntary Service
on a modest charge.  Local city centre restaurants and coffee shops
will provide a convenient alternative.

Help for the Disabled

A lift provides access to the first floor of the building, in addition
to staircases. The main auditorium, whilst comprising tiered seating,
can enable disabled visitors in wheelchairs to be accommodated without
too much difficulty*. If help is required please ask any West Midlands
Police officer or one of the commissionaires.

in Watery Street, approximately one half mile north of Sheffield city
centre in the district of Upper Thorpe. Signs on a blue background
indicating the Centre are affixed to nearby street lamp-posts.

The surrounding streets provide sufficient space for local parking.
Visitors are requested NOT to use the rear car park of the Medico-Legal
Centre.

The Womens' Royal Voluntary Service will provide limited refreshments
in the ground floor reception.

The Hearings

Each inquest will take place in the Coroner's Court situated on the
first floor of the building. A section of seating will be reserved
for the bereaved with priority being given to those related to the
Inquest being heard.

Privacy

A room has been set aside for families to consult privately with their
legal representatives or those who accompany them. A West Midlands
Police officer will be pleased to assist.

As at the Memorial Hall, video recording and live relaying of the
proceedings will be undertaken. For this purpose a portacabin
facility will be provided for press representatives. The total number
of persons permitted to be in the main building is set by Fire
Regulations which must be strictly enforced.

General Information

In addition to the daily listing of Hillsborough Inquests, other parts
of the Medico-Legal Centre will remain open to regular staff and other
visitors on separate business. Disruption to the daily routine of the
Centre is to some extent unavoidable.  Your co-operation in minimising
disruption will be greatly appreciated by HM Coroner, Deputy Coroners
and their staff.

                                FOREWORD




I very much appreciate that the forthcoming inquests could cause you,
members of your family and supporting friends, distress. With that in
my mind a prime objective of Her Majesty’s Coroner, myself, my West
Midlands Police colleagues and the Social Services is to ensure that
any distress is kept to a minimum and that you are adequately and
sympathetically supported.  If at any time whilst in Sheffield you
feel you need help please do not hesitate to contact me or one of my
officers. My officers can be contacted on 0742-731546.   (An
answerphone operates after normal office hours.)

We will do our utmost to ensure that all the necessary support is
available to you~!

The contents of the attached guide may prove helpful in finding the
locations where the Inquests will be held.

                                 SHEFFIELD



The Memorial Hall, Sheffield is the venue for the 'Hillsborough
Inquests' on Wednesday 18 April and Thursday 19 April 1990. On Friday
20 April the inquests will continue at the Medico Legal Centre.

The premises are located at the rear of, and form part of, the much
larger Sheffield City Hall, Barkers Pool, Sheffield city centre.

Access to Car Parking

Limited parking will be available in the vicinity of the Memorial
Hall. Vehicles should proceed to Holly Street via Division Street (as
indicated on Appendix 'A'). On production of this document next of
kin will be directed to a suitable parking facility.

The (2) Railway Station is situated approximately half a mile across
the city centre.

(Appendix 'A' shows the locations of the above, together with (3)
access to Sheffield city centre by car from Junction 33 of the M 1 ).

General Information

The auditorium is of theatre style comprising seating in a main area
and on a balcony. Approximately 500 people can be accommodated.

Commissionaires from the Hall will be on duty and available to direct
you, in addition to any Solicitor, Social Worker or friend who may
accompany you. West Midlands Police Officers who will present inquest
summaries will also be available to assist you in the building.

The balcony seating has been reserved for press representatives and no
access to this area will be permitted to the general public, unless
the main auditorium becomes full to capacity.  Press representatives
will not be permitted on the ground floor of the auditorium. The
proceedings will be relayed live to a press room. Within the main
auditorium some seating (front centre) has been reserved for legal
representatives who have been afforded representation by HM Coroner
and for the Coroner's Jury. Ample seating will be available for the
bereaved and their friends.

Privacy/Support

HM Coroner and his West Midlands Police staff keenly appreciate the
potential for distress which the resumed inquests may cause the
bereaved.




                                  - 4 -
Sensitivity will be striven for at all times. A room away from public
view, where relatives may compose themselves will be made available.
One of the West Midlands Police team will direct you to this room on
request.

Although many have chosen to have a Social Worker to accompany them,
some have not. Sheffield Social Services (Hillsborough Task Team)
will be available to provide support/counselling again if requested.

Refreshments

Beverages, biscuits and sandwiches will be available on the first
floor of the building, provided by the Womens' Royal Voluntary Service
on a modest charge. Local city centre restaurants and coffee shops
will provide a convenient alternative.

Help for the Disabled

A lift provides access to the first floor of the building, in addition
to staircases. The main auditorium, whilst comprising tiered seating,
can enable disabled visitors in wheelchairs to be accommodated without
too much difficulty. If help is required please ask any West Midlands
Police officer or one of the commissionaires.
                           MEDICO-LEGAL CENTRE
                                SHEFFIELD



The Medico-Legal Centre will be the venue for the Inquests from Friday
20 April 1990 onwards and to their conclusion. The Centre is located
in Watery Street, approximately one half mile north of Sheffield city
centre in the district of Upper Thorpe. Signs on a blue background
indicating the Centre are affixed to nearby street lamp-posts.

Car Parking

The surrounding streets provide sufficient space for local parking.
Visitors are requested NOT to use the rear car park of the Medico-Legal
Centre.

Refreshments

The Womens' Royal Voluntary Service will provide limited refreshments
in the ground floor reception.

The Hearings

Each inquest will take place in the Coroner's Court situated on the
first floor of the building. A section of seating will be reserved
for the bereaved with priority being given to those related to the
Inquest being heard.

Privacy

A room has been set aside for families to consult privately with their
legal representatives or those who accompany them. A West Midlands
Police officer will be pleased to assist.

Press/Media

As at the Memorial Hall, video recording and live relaying of the
proceedings will be undertaken.  For this purpose a portacabin
facility will be provided for press representatives. The total number
of persons permitted to be in the main building is set by Fire
Regulations which must be strictly enforced.

General Information

In addition to the daily listing of Hillsborough Inquests, other parts
of the Medico-Legal Centre will remain open to regular staff and other
visitors on separate business. Disruption to the daily routine of the
Centre is to some extent unavoidable. Your co-operation in minimising
disruption will be greatly appreciated by HM Coroner, Deputy Coroners
and their staff.


                                  - 6 -
Sheffield Social Services (Hillsborough Task Team) will be available at
the Medico-Legal Centre and have made available a nearby Community
Centre which is shown on Appendix 'B'.

The Medico-Legal Centre affords facilities for disabled visitors. A
lift is available to the first floor and the Coroner's Court is
entered by a wide entrance door. Wheelchair space is available in the
Court and purpose built toilets are located on the ground floor
adjacent to the Reception.

Once again help will be available from any of the police officers
present.

without            being       escorted          at    all,, for          about        haj^/past              two.

When     we        got    to    the     t u r n s t jn. e s t h e r e      was        just     a m a s s Jin p e o p l e .                  There

was     no     formal^c^/eue              like        there       is at       Anfield.               1.1 w a s      packed            solid

with      people          all    trying          to    get       into     th e    grounds.               I only          saw a          few

Police         Officers          who     were         frisking          the      fans       just        prior       to       them       going

Eventually,               I got       into       the       g round      through         on e       of    the       t u r n s t iles         and     I

did     no t       see a n y     stewards             at    all    at     this        point.

I had         difficulty            finding           which       turnstile            to     go     through            initially             due

to     the     sheer       numbers          of    people.              It w a s n ' t       until        we       got    right          up to

the     turnstiles              that     we      realised          we     had     got       the      right         one.

T h e re w a s       no    organisation                at al l         outside         the     g r o u n d,        we    had       to

organise            ourselves.              When       I went          through         th e    turnstile                I saw         no    gates

open     and        I witnessed             no    gates          being     opened.

I saw         no    unauthorised              entry         to    the     ground        and        I did          hand my          ticket         in

at     th e    stile.           Inside        I saw         the     letter        8    on     th e      wall       above        the        tunnel,

I believed               it w a s     the     only         way    to    get      to    the     terraces,                vi a    the        tunnel.

I did         not    see any o n                                                        d e--4,h a a r o u n d;— -------- — ------

I went          into                  and     stood         behind        the     goal        nearer          to    the        centre

railing            between       pens       3 and          4 about        halfway           up.         I took          up     this

position            at    about       quarter          to    three.           1 did         not      see      a    barrier            break       in

From      the       moment       I got        into         pen 3       it w a s       tight.            We    were       constantly

being         pushed       from       side       to    side       and     backwards            and       forwards.

Thank you for y o u r letter of 8 February about placing material about the
Hillsborough disaster in Liverpool Central Library.

I am sorry th a t m y reply to Frank Field in the House on 26 October last year
gave the im pression th a t the material from the Hillsborough scrutiny was to be
placed in Liverpool Central Library. I had misinformed m yself on this point.
There are no plan s to do this and I w rote to Frank on 7 December to apologise
for the m isunderstanding. A copy of my letter was also placed in the Library of
the House.

Much of the m a terial considered by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith's scrutiny w as
already in the pu blic domain. His report also included the material w hich he
considered re le v a n t to his conclusions. In my statement to the House on
 18 February 1 9 9 8 announcing the outcome of the scrutiny, I undertook to place
in the Library o f the House as much of the remaining evidence considered by the
scrutiny as po ssib le, including all the police statements. This has been done and
the material is available if Members wish to arrange for their constituents to
view it.

As you k n o w , w e were also able at the same tim e to provide the Family Support
Group w ith c o p ie s of the police statements in response to their request. This
was possible because there was minimal additional w ork and cost involved in
producing an e x tr a set o f copies at th a t stage. Unfortunately, th a t is no longer
the case and i t w ould be a large and costly exercise to copy all the material
again. A lso, fo llo w in g the completion of the scrutiny, the police statem ents
were returned t o South Yorkshire Police, whose property they remain. It w ould,
therefore, be f o r the Chief Constable in the firs t instance to consider whether to
release th e s ta te m e n ts now that the scrutiny which I established has ended.
We have tried to be as helpful as possible by placing the material in the Library
of the House and providing a copy to the Family Support Group. I realise th a t
there are families w ho do not belong to the Family S upport Group, although it
was the main representative body at the tim e o f the scru tiny. I am sorry th a t
i cannot be more helpful. I can only advise you to arrange fo r th e material to be
viewed in the Library o f the House.

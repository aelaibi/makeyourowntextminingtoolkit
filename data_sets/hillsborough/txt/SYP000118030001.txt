               On S a t u r d a y        April          15th       I p a r a d e d at       Barnsley Police               Station       at

               9.00pm.              This      was       to    be    transported             to H i l l s b o r o u g h    by T r a n s i t    Van      to

               Hillsborough                football               ground.

                Our       section         arrived            at    9.50am       and      paraded      in the         North Stand         for

                briefing.                I was      in S e r i a l        60 w ith P ol i ce          Sergeant           Thompson       of E

                Division,            collar         no.       20 19.

                The       serials        were       then          briefed and my             srial       60    then were         given a

                packed         lunch.             After       our       serial      at e    we    then were          posted      to    our

                po i n t s .        We    had      to    be       out    for    11.15.

               Because           the     other          officers          were      from     other       divisions            I was    paired         up

               with        Mick      Eustis         from my             section.           For    Phase       1 we    patrolled         in    pairs

                in P e n i s t o n e       Road.             We    also      had    to     patrol     Burton Street              and Borough

               Road.           It w a s       a    good 20 minutes                  walk     to    our    points         down Penistone

               R oa d .        We    patrolled               on    the m a i n      r oa d a n d    spoke       to a g a r a g e       owner     wh o

               had        cars      on   his       forecourt.

               After        about        an       hour       the    f an s     started       to a r r i v e     by    car a n d       on foot.

                customers.               After          about       40 m i n u t e s .       The    drinkers          b e g a n to     build      up

               outside           the     pubs a n d           drink       on    the      pubs     pavements.             We   noticed        t ha t    a

                l a r ge    Rotweiler              dog       was    on g u a r d at         The    Rose       Public      House       and a     large

    group     of    supporters               were       again         on    the     pavement.

    At    this     t i me    the       f a ns     were       ju s t    drinking           and    shouting.

    After     a further               half-hour           PS T h o m p s o n        then       told    us     between           150-200

    youths       had     gathered            outside          the      pub.         On    our    arrival            2 other       officers

    were    ther e.          I believe              they were              from Doncaster.                  This         made    4 P Cs

    and    one S e r g e a n t         he    told       us    the      landlady           had    refused            to    close       the

    pub.      Glasses            and    bottles           were        everywhere           on the        pavement.

    The    pub     itself         must       have       contained            at     l e as t    150     p e op l e.        The    people

    inside       began       to       shout       through         the w i n d o w s        and    the a t m o s p h e r e         b e g a n to

    be    hostile.

    The    Sergeant          had       one       personal         radio          between        5 of     us.         It    c rossed my

    mind    that       if    trouble             e r u p t e d we      would        be    powerless           to     stop       it.       A

    glass     bottle         was       then       thrown        towards            us    just    missing            the    group         of

    us.     About        15 m i n u t e s         l ater      a young            lad     ran    up to        sa y    that a bout              10

    youths       were       smashing             the    pub     in s id e .         Sgt.       Thompson         called          for

    reinforcements                and       the     dog m e n a r i v e d m i n u t e s           later.             The    pub w a s

    then    emptied          and       the       l a n d l a d y was        o r d e r e d to     clean        the        glass    and

    bottles        up.      The        youths          who    started            the     trouble       ha d     left       earlier.                Th e

    pub was        then emmptied                  and     c lo se d .

    The    fans were             still       pouring          down         the     ro a d a n d we       then        stood       on   the

    opposite        side         of    the       road.        A great            deal    of     the    f an s       were    drinking

    too    much.         Some         were       even    sat     near        traffic           lights       with         glasses      of

    beer    lined        up.

    We     then were             told       to    get     to the g r o u n d         fighting          had     started.               We ran

    down Penistone               Road        towards           the f o o t b a l l       ground.         A transit              t ha t        was

    pasing       s t o p p e d a n d we           jumped       in the            back    of     the    van.

On         arrival          at    the       g r o u n d we h ad to w a i t              while    the a m b u l a n c e s came             out

    of     the     ground.             It w a s        t h e n we w e r e         told    that        there had          been

    casualties.

After        waiting           fo r    about         ten min ut es               we w e n t     into    the     gr o un d a nd were

told      to    form a         cordon.           We    faced         the N o r t h S t a n d a n d            the       spectator's

were      shouting:at               the    p o lice.

They were           completely             overwrought               and     could       not      be    calmed          d own.       To my

right       a group          of a b o u t       6 or 7       began          fighting          each      other.           We    held

fast      and     then       the     fans       began       to     jump      over       the    s t a n d as        they w a n t e d         to

h el p.        They     began        to s m a s h      the       advertisements                up at         the       side    or    edge

of    the      pitch.         The        cordon       then       disbanded             and an      officer             sent    us    to

the    corner          of    the S p i o n Kop.

At    t hi s    time        t he    atmosphere             was     electric            it w a s    almost          as    if    the

police         were     going        to    be a t t a c k e d .         People          were      running          round       trying

to    find      relatives            or    loved        ones.          As    the       remains         of    our       serial       went

to    the      corner        of     the K o p a         p r es s     camera man was                taking          photographs              of

the    dead and             injured.            The     fans       were      ready       to    rip h i m          to    shreds.           He

was    told       to    put        his    c a mera away.               He w a s        then    surrounded               by f a n s    and

they      began        shouting,           swearing          and       spitting          at    him.          Some       of    the    fans

ran    up a n d        kicked        him.        :

His    p r es s    arm       bands        were       taken       off    and       he w a s     ordered            off    the       pitch.

He w a s       more     concernd with                 his    camera          equipment            and       had    to    be

frogmarched             off        the    pitch.           After       this       an    officer         then       s en t     PC    Eustis

and myself             to    the     gymnasium,             t h is     was    to       take    charge         of a body.              On

entering          the       gymnasium           I saw all            the     bodies        laid        out    on       the    floor

w h i c h was      a very           traumatic          sight         in deed.

I was       allocated              body    number          3 a Gen          18 w a s     completed            and       property          of

the    body       checked.               This    was       a male       25-30          years      old       dressed          in a    blue-

white       top and          j ea n s .     He       had    black       hair       and     green        eyes.           He    had    heavy

growth         on his        face.         He    had       green       eyes.

Scenes         of C r i m e        then    took       a photograph                of    the    deceased            and       this    was

then      handed        to    the        Scenes       of C r i m e .         At    this       time      the       gym was

screened          off.        It w a s      then a wait                for    the       relatives            to    come       to

identify          their       loved        ones.

            Each    o f f i c e r ’s n a m e    was     called         out a n d      he    then went          to    t he   relatives

            or    friend        fo r   identification.                 After     this       the     body was          returned       back

            behind        the     screens.

            After        about     7 or 8 h o u r s       half     of     the    people        had      been        identified.        At

            4 . 3 0 a m my      body      number      3 had      not     been    identified.               I remained          through

            the     night       taking        a short     drink        outside.

            The     relatives          could     be    heard across             the      other      side       of    the    gymnasium.

            After        it b e c a m e    ap>parent      t ha t   the       rest w o u l d       not     be    identified       t h at

            Sunday,         the    body was        then    transported              to     the M e d i c o      Medical       Centre.

            The     body was           then    handed     o ve r    to    them with           the    relevant             documents.        I

            was     led to        believe       that    I w o u l d be        called        back     again          for

             identification               purposes.        This        was    not     correct        as    the       officer    w h o w as

             at    the    centre        took    over    t h at     task.

             I then was           transported          to B a r n s l e y D H G       arriving          there        at    5.30am.

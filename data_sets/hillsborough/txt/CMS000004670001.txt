TIMES ARTICLE: STUART JONES 30 JANUARY

1.   No 10 have asked for the Minister to write to the editor of
the Times to repudiate the accusation in the Stuart Jones'
article about the Government being "inexcusably apathetic".

2.   I enclose a draft letter which, in covering the much which
has been done on safety and public order, draws a contrast
between Jones1 piece as the football correspondent and the better
balanced editorial in the same issue of the paper.

I was surprised to read Stuart Jones1 accusation, in his article

on 30 January about Lord Justice Taylor's final report on the

Hillsborough inquiry,             that the Government had been "inexcusably

apathetic"       towards       football.        Your     editorial,     strikes       a   much

better balance in acknowledging that the Government's concern is

with public safety and public order.



The Government has shown no apathy on either of these issues.                              On

safety, we have extended safety controls to all football grounds

with accommodation for over 10,000 spectators.                          The Fire Safety

and   Safety      of   Places         of    Sports    Act    1987     took    forward     the

recommendations        of       the        Popplewell    inquiry.            The     Football

Spectators Act 1989 provides for a Football Licensing Authority

to supervise the safety responsibilities of local authorities in

respect     of    designated          football       grounds    and    to     require     the

installation of seating at football grounds.                        Lord Justice Taylor

warmly     welcomed      the    establishment           of   the    Football        Licensing

Authority.



On public order the Government has introduced legislation which

restricts or prohibits alcohol and drunkenness in connexion with

football matches; the Public Order Act clarified and strengthened

legislation on public order and introduced a new offence to deal

with hooliganism generally.                   The Act also         introduced       football

exclusion orders and offences of incitement to racial hatred.



The police have consistently improved their response to football

hooliganism,      with      the       Government's       full      support.         The   new

National    Football       Intelligence Unit,            endorsed      by    Lord    Justice
Taylor, will have a crucial role in co-ordinating police action

against     football        hooliganism        at    home        and    abroad.      The

restriction    orders       provisions     of       Part    II     of    the    Football

Spectators    Act    will    enable   the       courts      to    prevent      convicted

hooligans from travelling to matches abroad.



We   have   worked   closely with        the    football         authorities      in the
campaign against hooliganism, agreeing a package of measures in
1987 including the preparation of local plans in consultation

with the local police and the local authority about how best to

handle football matches, the use of all ticket arrangements, the
use of closed circuit television surveillance of grounds,                            the

promotion of family enclosures and voluntary membership schemes.


This is not a record of apathy but the Government cannot cure all

of football's problems for it.              The essential message of Lord

Justice Taylor's report is that football must at last face up to

its responsibilities.        I endorse that message.

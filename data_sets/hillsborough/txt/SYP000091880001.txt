we were       checked for           tickets      on our   coach.



Our    coach ar ri ve d at Sh ef f ie ld that               day at about                 1. 1 5 pm    (1315)    and we

                                                             V
Whe n we got off             the    coach we just wa l ke d dir ectly                     to the Leppings Lane

end,     we knew whi ch way to go from the year before.                                      We      called    in a

shop     for some        sweets.



As far as other              fans are        concerned      I saw no bad behaviour                      or

drun ken nes s         but   I    did see    one or two fans          drinking             out of       beer cans.



At no time on our way to the ground were we                                     checked by Police              or

stewards,         w hic h was quite          different      to the year                 before when the             roads

were     cordoned off and you were                   checked before you got to the

t u r n s t i 1e s .



On    15 April         < 150489)     my two friends and              I got
                                                                                            /
                                                                                      to tlye turnstiles at

about      1.4Qpm       ( 134Q) .        At that t ime there were qtrl te a few f a n s , they

were     not formed          into queues         but just        in a m a s s /           The re were some

Police about,            one on a horse and some^ standiffcj but at no time was                                       I

ever     checked.                                                \          /



I did see one fan                 who had gone    into a turnstile                     brought out by a

Police Officer who                 looked aroun d and then just                        let him go and he got

into     the ground.               I don't    know    if this        fan had a ticket                  or not and          I

could not describe                 the    policeman.
                                                                                                        PAGE
                                                                                                        S 3614



I eventua lly            got through the fifth tu rnstile                  from the         left,    my ticket

was    taken,       so    I was al lo we d      in.      Inside the turnstiles                 there was a

line of Police Officers,                  and    I think       some    stewards,          they were

searching       fans       but    I was    not searched.                              /



Once    I got       into the ground          I went      to the toils'L,          I    saw no signs

telling me which way to go,                     I saw the tunne/ so we all                   just went       that

way, at the end of the tunnel                     I went       sllig>vtly to the           left    into what       I

now know to be Pen N o . 4 ,                I have m a r k e d the        position on the att ach ed

plan.



When we took             up our    position we         looked ar o un d and saw that on our                   left

there was much more                room but we all         thought       that     it must         cost more

m on ey to go to that area and so we just stayed where we were.



At the time we took                up our    position at the front                of the       pen it was

quite easy to stand and there was                        quite a bit arP room.                    I stood

waiting       for    the game to start            I did not notiore any                particular      change

but sud denly as the               players got onto the               pi^fch the terrace was very

full,    it became          impossible       to move apaXt            y r om your      head,      my arms were

pinned to my side and                   I could not      get    ttTsm a u t i .       I still      thought    it

was    just    very full          but    I was not too bothe/ed.



As the ma tch starte d              it just got w o r s / and worse,                  fans start ed to

climb over the front                fence and         I realised that so mething was wrong.

I had got se pa ra t ed from my two\ friends and                          I started to think about

trying    to    climb out.



It started to get a bit                   easier and      I heard some shouting                   from behind          I
                                                                                                         PAGE            *
                                                                                                         £>3614

    was able to half              turn and get my arms              up as a fan was          being    passed

    from the        pen towards       the front,           he    came to m e / a n d a bloke next        to me

    slappe d his face,             and then lifted him up a / nd over the fence at the

    front.          The    f a n ’s face was         blue,      his jmpi ls    of his eyes were small

    and    I thought        he was    in a bad way a^m might                  be dying.        I would

    describe        this    fan as ipale, £7/8 j/rs,               quite s t o u t,    gi ng eri sh hair,

    shortish,        stubble       on his facey wearing a brownish jacket material,                                his

    jumper was        pul 1 ed halfway j/p his               chest.        I have since       seen this       fan

    being     passed down the          crowd and over              the    fence,     on the BBC TV v i d e o .



    As more     fans got out of the                  peitfs it became        easier and ev ent ual ly         I

    was able        to climb over the f/snce on my                    left    into a very narrow         pen and

    then out onto           the    pitqh.     / l    met     up with my two mates            on the    pitch.

    We were only on the              pi^on for a short              time,     then we went      to sit on the

    side    of the        pitch and just watche d what was going                       on.     We stayed          in

    the ground for a              long time,         I would estimate          till about 3pm         (1700),

    then we went           out    round the sides of the stand                     into Le pp in gs Lane.



    While     the    crush was going          on in the           pen,    the Police and stewards             did

    not seem to app re ci at e what was hajjfpening,                         but    I also   know that       fans

    were shouting at the Police,                      selling      out what was        happening      i.e.

    askin g    for help,          the Polij                stewards who        I/ saw must     have    realised

    that            were     in trouble             it ignored      it.



      believe that outside              the ground before^the ma tch the Police                         should

K   have been more strict and the fans                           should have been fi ltered before

    they got to the ground,              as         I \think t/iat the whole           incident was      started

    by what hap pened outside.

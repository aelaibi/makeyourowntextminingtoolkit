                 I ATTENDED THE MATCH IN 1988 AND THE POLICE PRESENCE WAS MUCH
                 GREATER AND CONTROLLED THE CROWD PERFECTLY. THIS YEAR THERE WERE
                 ONLY TWO HORSEMEN INSIDE THE GATES PRIOR TO THE TURNSTILES WHERE
                 THERE WERE OTHER OFFICERS. THE HORSEMEN TRIED TO MOVE OUTWARDS
                 AND THEN COULDNT GET BACK TO THE TURNSTILES.ANYONE IN THAT AREA
                 WITHOUT A TICKET HAD TO GO INTO THE GROUND.

IT WAS ABOUT 230PM WHEN WE ARRIVED AND ABOUT 250PM WHEN I GOT IN. THERE WERE
FANS CRAWLING UNDER THE TURNSTILES WITHOUT TICKETS. PEOPLE WERE FRIGHTENED
OUTSIDE AND SCREAMING, I BELIEVE THAT THEY HAD NO OPTION THAN TO OPEN THE
GATES TO SAVE LIVES BUT THEY WERE ILL PREPARED INSIDE. THEY SHOULD HAVE
DIVERTED THE FANS TO THE SIDES AS WHERE I WAS STANDING THERE WAS PLENTY OF
ROOM.

I TRAVELLED WITH     FRIENDS:
1.


    CAN FIND OUT THOSE ADDRESSES BEFORE I'M CONTACTED FOR A STATEMENT.

I HAD LOST MY FRIENDS OUTSIDE THE GROUND IN THE CROWD.

IJttNT UP TO THE STAND AND STOOD AT THE BACK, THERE WERE QUITE A LOT OF
P W L E STANDING IN THE STAND, NOT IN THE GANGWAYS THOUGH.
AT ABOUT 2.55 JUST BEFORE THE TEAMS CAME OUT I SAW A SURGE FORWARD IN THE
TERRACES BELOW BEHIND THE GOAL. THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE WHO DIDN'T
SEEM TO BE ABLE TO MOVE, THEY LOOKED AGONISED.
THE TEAMS CAME OUT, BUT WE WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE
TERRACES - I WAS WORRIED BECAUSE MY BROTHER             WAS IN THE TERRACES
(HE'S ALREADY RUNG YOU AND MADE A STATEMENT). PEOPLE AT THE FRONT OF THE
STAND WERE PULLING PEOPLE UP ONTO THE STAND FROM THE TERRACES.
THERE WAS A LOT OF FRUSTRATION ABOUT THE PEOPLE NOT BEING LET OUT OF THE
TERRACE, THE GATES WEREN'T OPENED UNTIL ABOUT 3.05 TO LET THE PEOPLE OUT.
BEFORE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE CLIMBING OVER THE BARS ONTO THE PITCH.
I THINK IF IT WASN'T FOR THE THE SUPPORTERS HELPING PEOPLE THERE WOULD HAVE
BEEN A LOT MORE DEATHS.

                  I ARRIVED AT THE MATCH QUITE LATE IT WAS ABOUT 1455HRS. THE
                  REASON SO MANY PEOPLE WERE LATE WAS DUE TO THE ROAD WORK ON THE
                  WAY TO THE GROUND. WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE GROUND THERE WAS A LACK
                  OF POLICE OFFICERS OUTSIDE THE ONLY POLICE I SAW SEEMED TO BE
                  THOSE ON HORSEBACK AND THERE WERE FEW OF THEM. WHEN WE GOT INTO
                  THE GROUND, I KNEW WHERE TO GO AS I HAD BEEN BEFORE, BUT FOR THE

 THERE WAS NO ONE INSIDE EITHER STEWARDS OR POLICE TO DIRECT THEM. I NEVER SAW
 ANY SIGNS GIVING DIRECTIONS EITHER, SO MOST PEOPLE HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE
 TUNNEL WHICH LEADS TO BEHIND THE GOAL.
 I WAS AT THE MATCH WITH TWO FRIENDS 1)                  I DONT KNOW HIS
 ADDRESS, BUT HIS PHONE NO ISI. THE OTHER FRIEND IS 2)
 WHO LIVES IN EXETER, BUT I DONT KNOW HIS ADDRESS.

             VERY FEW POLICE THIS YEAR. ARRIVED 2.35PM ALREADY CRUSH.GATES

    •
            WERE OPEN INSIDE TAND SO PEOPLE WERE GETTING BEHIND THE GOAL
            THAT REALLY SHOULDNT HAVE.I COULD SEE AT ABOUT 2.55 THAT THERE
            WAS A CRUSH DOWN BEHIND THE GOAL AREA WHERE THE TRAGDIY HAPPENED.

                     AGED 48 CAN BE CONTACTED VIA CALLER

POLICE WERE RE-DIRECTING PEOPLE INCORRECTLY OUTSIDE THE GROUND. MY MAIN
COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE ACTUAL MATCH ARE THAT 1. THE FA HAVE A LOT TO ANSWER FOR
WITH REGARDS THE ALLOCATION OF TICKETS 2. POLICE WERE STOPPING VEHICLES AND
SEARCHING THEM ABOUT 1MILE AWAY FROM THE GROUND WHEN ALL PUBS AND OFF
LM E N C E S WERE OPEN NEAR TO THE GROUND.
I ™ S O SAW ON TV ABOUT 6WKS AGO THAT A POLICE OFFICER SAID IF FANS TURNED UP
TO A MATCH WITHOUT TICKETS HE WOULD OPEN THE GATES AND LET THEM ALL IN AS HE
WOULD RATHER POLICE THEM INSIDE THE GROUND THAN OUTSIDE THE GROUND. I FEEL
THAT THIS WAS ALMOST AN OPEN INVITATION TO FANS TO COME TO THE MATCH IF THEY
DIDNT HAVE A TICKET. I THINK THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE CHIEF CONSTABLE OF
MANCHESTER TALKING WITH REGARDS TO THE MILLWALL FANS AT MANCHESTER BUT I
CANNOT BE TOO SURE OF THIS.
I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT ALL THREE GATES WERE ACTUALLY OPENED WHICH I
DONT THINK HAS BEEN MENTIONED ON THE PRESS
I THINK THAT IT IS ALSO WORTH MENTIONING ON THE MAIN ROAD INTO SHEFFIELD
THERE IS ALWAYS A PROBLEM WITH TRAFFIC AND IT WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE A
POLICEOFFICER THERE TO RELIEVE THE PROBLEM.
I ALSO THINK THAT THE PEOPLE OF SHEFFIELD SHOULD BE THANKED FOR THEIR HELP AS
PEOPLE WERE WALKING FROM THE GROUND. THEY WERE OFFERING THE USE OF THEIR
TELEPHONES ETC TO U S .

THE CROWDS. I EVENTUALLY GOT INTO THE GROUND AT ABOUT 1450HRS JUST BEFORE THE
GATES WERE OPENED. INSIDE THERE WERE NO STEWARDS OR SIGNS TO DIRECT. THE ONLY
STEWARDS I SAW WHERE AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS WAY UP IN THE SEATING AREA OF
THE WEST STAND. I DID NOT SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE TRAGEDY, BUT I FEEL THAT
THE REASONS ARE DUE TO THE LACK OF CONTROL AND SIGNS OUTSIDE THE GROUND.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH MY FATHER AND BROTHER WHO ARE                   AND
                   WHO LIVE AT I                               , LIVERPOOL.

AFTER THE MATCH HAD STARTED IT WAS NOT APPARENT THAT THERE WAS TROUBLE IN THE
STAND UNTIL THE INSPECTOR STOPPED THE MATCH. THE POLICE ALSO DID NOT SEEM TO
KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION AT FIRST. WHEN
IT WAS REALISED WHAT WAS HAPPENING THEY STARTED TO HELP THE FANS OVER THE
BARRIERS. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE WAS AWAY FROM THE GROUND LAST YEAR WHERE SOME
PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS A BIT HEAVYHANDED BUT IT WORKED, NOT SO THIS YEAR.

I GOT TO THE MATCH AT ABOUT 2.30PM AND IT WAS RELATIVELY BUSY AND THERE WERE
ONLY TWO POLICE HORSES OUTSIDE.  THE POLICE OUTSIDE DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE
MUCH CONTROL OVER WHAT WAS GOING ON HAVING SAID THAT WHEN THERE WERE ONLY TOW
ON THE GATE WHAT DO YOU EXPECT.    THE OFFICERS WERE AT NO TIME OBUSIVE TO THE
FANS AND WERE QUITE FRIENDLY.     WENT THROUGH THE TURNSTILES AND THE TICKET
WAS ONLY CHECKED AT THE TURNSTILES. THERE WAS AN AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE MILLING
ABOUT OUTSIDE WHO APPEARED NOT TO HAVE ANY TICKETS AND WERE SITTING ON THE
WALLS BASICALLY BEING A NUSIENCE. ONCE INSIDE THE GROUND I ONLY SAW ONE
STEWARD AND NOBODY WAS DIRECTING THE CROWDS COMING INTO THE GROUND OR TELLING
PEOPLE IF THE STANDS WERE FULL.  I MADE A CONCIOUS EFFORT TO GO THE THE PEN
TO THE RIGHT OF THE GOAL AND NOTICED THEN HOW CROWDED THE MIDDLE PIN WAS. IT
ALL SUDDENLY HAPPENED, THE BALL   CAME DOWN TO OUR SIDE OF THE PITCH AND
iq0tYBODY SERGED FORWARD.

FROM WHAT I SAW THE POLICE AND SEVERAL OTHER PEOPLE WERE UNDER THE IMPRESSION
THAT A FIGHT WAS TAKING PLACE AND IT WAS NOT UNTIL A WHILE LATER DID THEY
REALISE WHAT WAS GOING ON.   THE OFFICERS WHO WERE THERE AND THOSE WHO
ATTEMPTED TO HELP WERE MARVELLOUS, THEY COULD NOT DO ANYMORE INCLUDING SOME
OF THE FANS WHO WERE TRYING TO HELP.

THERE IS ONE POINT I WISH TO MAKE. THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS AWFUL AND
IT WAS NOT USED TO ITS BEST. MAYBE IF THAT HAD BEEN USED IT WOULD HAVE
HELPED AND AWFUL LOT. AS FOR EVERYTHING ELSE THAT WENT ON IT IS ALL ON TV
TAPE . BASICALLY IT APPEARS TO BE TOTAL LACK OF COMMUNICATION.

THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN ALLEGATIONS OF LOOTING, I CAN SAY I SAW NO SUCH THING
AND AS FOR THE POLICE BEING ABUSIVE THAT COMMENT IS ALSO UNFAIR, THE ABUSE
WAS THROWN AT THEM THEY WERE ONLY DOING

MY CONTACT TELEPHONE NUMBERS ARE HOME

                 12 POLICEMEN STANDING BY THE VANS ON THE ROAD. IN THE RIGHT HAND
                 PEN, THE ENTRANCE TO THE GROUND WAS FULL OF PEOPLE, CHOC-A-BLOCK.

I TRAVELLED WITH MY SON:
                      HE LIVES AT                               , LIVERPOOL


WE SAW ONLY ONE POLICEMAN BY OUR TURNSTILE, AND WE WONDERED WHERE ALL             THE
POLICE WERE. THERE WERE A COUPLE MORE OFFICERS ON THE ROOF OF THE
TURNSTILES, AND THEY WERE HELPING LIVERPOOL FANS BY PULLING THEM UP TO GET
THMC OVER THE WALL TO GET THEM OUT OF THE CRUSH AND INTO THE GROUND -             THEY
H J P T I C K E T S . THIS WAS IN THE PEN TO THE TURNSTILE TO THE GROUND, NOT THE
STANDS.

 WHEN WE GOT THROUGH THE TURNSTILE WE SAW ONLY 2 MORE POLICEMAN, ON THE
 ENTRANCE OF THE STAIRCASE UP TO THE STANDS.  IT WAS ONLY WHEN WE GOT PAST
'THEM WE SAW THAT THE MATCH HAD ALREADY STARTED. WHEN WE ENTERED THE STAND,
 ALL THE PASSAGEWAYS IN THE STAND WERE FULL OF PEOPLE SITTING DOWN. WE WERE
 IN ROW 4, Y SECTION, C BLOCK. OUR SEATS HAD BEEN TAKEN, AND WE ASKED PEOPLE
 TO MOVE. MY SON SAID, LOOK DOWN THERE, THERE'S PEOPLE GETTING KILLED, AND WE
 SAW PEOPLE GOING OVER THE FENCE, AND SOMEONE ACTUALLY JUMPED OFF THE TOP OF
 THE FENCE, AND A POLICEMAN THREW A COUPLE BACK INTO THE TERRACE THROUGH THE
 SMALL GATE.  I SAW ONE SUPPORTED HIT A POLICEMAN BECAUSE HE WAS TRYING TO
 PULL HIM BACK INTO THE TERRACES.

THEN I SAW A SUPPORTER SPEAK TO A POLICEMAN, AND THEN THE POLICEMAN WENT TO
THE REFERREE AND THE GAME WAS STOPPED.

I WAS STANDING ON THE SEAT IN THE STAND AND SHOUTING AT THE POLICE TO RIP THE
FENCES OFF, BUT THEY COULDN'T HEAR ME, AND BEING AN    ENGINEER I KNEW THAT THEY
COULD PULL THE WIRE OFF.
THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICEMAN STANDING ON THE PITCH    DOING NOTHING,AND THE
SUPPORTERS GOING OVER THE FENCE WERE GIVING THE FIRST AID. BUT I SAW TWO
POLICEMAN LYING ON THE TOP OF THE FENCE WHERE THE CRUSH WAS, PULLING PEOPLE
OVER - IF ALL THE POLICE HAD BEEN THAT GOOD, THE PROBLEM WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
SO GREAT. MY SON WAS PULLING PEOPLE UP OUT OF THE STANDING AREA INTO THE
STANDS UP ONTO THE BALCONY.

A FEW PHOTOGRAPHERS GOT MANHANDLED BECAUSE THEY WERE COMING UP TAKING
PICTURES, AND THAT UPSET A FEW PEOPLE.

                               By T HE C O R O N E R :

       T H E WITNESS:          Dr. Joh n Clark,             Fore ns ic
P at holo gist , U n i v e r s i t y of Glasgow.

Dr. Clark, could you first of all c o n f i r m your
s a t i s f a c t i o n of the post m o r t e m w h i c h you are r e p o r t i n g
on relates to Stev en J o s e p h R o b i ns on ? - A. Yes.

Y o u are qu ite s a t i sf ie d we are talking about                      this
p e r s o n and n o -o ne else? - A. Tha t is right.

Yo u ha v e pr o d u c e d your repor t and you are no w go ing to
take me th ro ug h the r el ev an t pa rts of it? - A. Yes.
The ca use of Stev en's d e a t h was c r u s h a s ph yx ia and this
was ba se d on fi ndin g signs of a s p h y x i a in his face.
His face was rath er blue and there we re small p e t e c h i a l
h e m o r r h a g e s on the skin and in te rn a l l y - not great
numbers, but they c e r t a i n l y were present.             This wo ul d
be c o n s i s t e n t w i t h his chest h a v i n g been cr ushe d
p r e v e n t i n g h i m breathing .

In a dd it io n to that there were a n u m b e r of mi no r grazes
on his face, toge th er w i t h br ui s e s on his arms typical
of gripp in g, f i n g e r t i p g r i p p i n g on the arms.             No
in te r n al i n j ur ie s at all.             He was not s u f f e r i n g from^
any n a t u r a l d i s e a s e w h i c h co uld h a v e p l a y e d any pa r t in
his d e a t h so c a u s e of d e a t h was r e a l l y c r u s h i n g of the

w o u l d h a v e lost c o n s c i o u s n e s s in a bo ut ten or fi f t e e n
sec ond s or so and t h e r e a f t e r w o u l d h a v e k no wn lit tle
ab out it.

That    is important,          isn't     it?    - A. T h a t    is right,        yes.

        MR.   FRASER:          I ha v e no qu est ion s.

        MR. LIMB:          No, thank you, sir.

       T H E CORONER: Do you think,                      Mr.   Fraser,      would      the

Sir, if we can r e f e r then to L e s l i e C a m p b e l l ' s plan,
LFC.l, ag ai n that is in e n c l o s u r e n u m b e r 4, and we are
l o ok in g in that p o s i t i o n t h e r e .

T his is the p o s i t i o n w h e r e Mr. C a m p b e l l thou ght he
mi gh t h a v e b e e n h o l d i n g Steven? - A. Th a t is right,
sir.      Then, sir, r e f e r r i n g to MW JL .3 8, that is a plan
of the pitch, the p h o t og ra ph , we h a v e r e f e r r e d to
M W . 1/3 is in this p o s i t i o n h e r e .

J u s t o u ts id e e n c l o s u r e 4? - A. Th a t is right.            If I
can just go b a c k to those p h o t o g r a p h s P R . 2/8 in ca s e
the q u e s t i o n is asked, there is very lit tle d e t a i l on
those p h o to gr ap hs .           On this o c c a s i o n I w o u l d not like
to gi v e an o p i n i o n ei th er wa y as to w h e t h e r Steven, if
it is St ev en at that stage, at wh a t st age of the
p r o c e s s we are l o ok in g at.

W h a t you are sa yi ng is that one w i t n e s s has i d e n t i f i e d
him, the fam ily are doubtful.          Y o u say there is very
lit tle de ta i l in it and you c e r t a i n l y co ul d not say
wh a t st ate he was in at that point? - A. Th a t is right,
sir.

        MR.   FRASER:         No questio ns,         t ha nk you.

                    C r o s s - E x a m i n e d by MR.    LIMB:

P R . 2/3 and P R . 2/8 are p h o t o g r a p h s in w h i c h Mr.           Ca mp b e l l
has i d e n t i f i e d h i m s e l f a s s i s t i n g Mr. R o b in so n?   - A.
T h a t is right.

At the same time LFC.l, a plan si gn ed by Mr. Ca mpb ell ,
is w h e r e he pla ce s h i m s e l f a s s i s t i n g Mr. Ro b i n s o n ? - A.
Th a t is right.

C o m p a r i n g the two, P R . 2/3 and LFC.l, as you ha v e
i n d i c a t e d them on the ter ra ce plan, they are some
d i s t a n c e apart? - A. T h e r e is c e r t a i n l y a di ff er en ce .
It d e pe nd s wh a t you term "s ome dis ta nc e" .            In terms of
the ac tu al siz ing of the te r r a c i n g it is...

F u r t h e r f o rw ar d and mo r e    towards          the ra di a l fence?       - A.
Th a t is right.

Is there any i n d i c a t i o n from Mr. C a m p b e l l as to w h e t h e r
he says the ma r k that he has p l a c e d on the pl a n is
w h e r e he a t t e n d e d Mr. R o b i n s o n c o n s ta nt ly , or does he
in his st a t e m e n t r ef er to there b e i n g m o v e m e n t as he
was a s s i s t i n g Mr. Ro b i n s o n ? - A. Sir, w o u l d it be
c o n v e n i e n t if I go b a c k to the w i t n e s s bo x and r e f e r to
the sta tem en ts ?
       T H E CORONER:    Yes, cer ta in ly .              It is pa ge 21 I
t hi nk you w i l l find. - A. Yes, sir.

It m i g h t be ea s i e r if I read wha t Mr. C a m p b e l l          says.      -
A. It is q u i t e an e x t e n s i v e d e s cr ip ti on .

T h e r e are a few a m b i g u i t i e s in this      evidence.         Leslie
F r a n c i s Ca mpbell, w h a t he says is:

       "I saw a big         lad n e a r    to me wh o ha d     turned
       b l u e . .."

T h e n h e d e s c r i b e s him.

       "I ca n n o t r e m e m b e r wh a t else he was wearing.
       A n o t h e r lad w i t h h i m wh o lo ok ed very similar,
       c lo se en ou g h to p o s s i b l y be his brother, was
       h o l d i n g his h e a d and sh ou t i n g for p e o p l e to give
       h i m ro o m and that the lad wh o was b l u e s u f f e r e d
       from asthma.            He was sa yi ng to the bi g lad, 'Come
       on, our kid, get some air into you.'                      I h e l p e d to
       ho l d this lad s h e a d up to h e l p h i m b r e a t h e and
       get some air into h i m and tried to lift h i m up but
       h e was too h e a v y to lift.            T h e r e was a bit of
       wi nd b l o w i n g and I tried to p u s h his h e a d b a c k . a
       bit and an gl e his face into the wi n d to get some
       air into h i m but it was no go o d he s t op pe d
       breathing."

T h e n on pa g e 23 he       says:

       "About a w e e k a ft er the in ci d e n t at H i l l s b o r o u g h I
       saw in the S u n d a y M i r r o r p i c t u r e s of the p e o p l e
       who ha d di e d at the game.                   I am sure one of the
       p e o p l e w h o s e p h o t o g r a p h appe are d, St ev en Robinson,
       was the lad w h o m I ha d h e l p e d in the pen.               Th e
       one w h o s e h e a d I had be e n h o l d i n g . "

I know, I n s p e c t o r Layton, you h a v e not do ne the
evid en ce , but there are a n u m b e r of p r o b l e m s w i t h         this
b e c a u s e h e re fe rs to a b r o t h e r wh o has n e v e r be en
traced? - A. T h a t is right.

Indeed, there is no e v i d e n c e          that he ever was w i t h
an ybody, is there? - A. Tha t               is right.

W e h a v e i n c l u d e d this b e c a u s e of this    identification
f ro m the pi ct u r e ? - A. Th a t is right,            sir.

     T H E CORONER:            But    there is n o t h i n g h e r e   to sh o w
any movement.

       MR.    LIMB:       T h a n k you,   sir.
                                  T H E CORONER:         Mr. Fraser, do you wa nt          to ask
                        a n y t h i n g else a r i s i n g out of that?

                                  MR. FRASER:            No, sir, there are no q u e s t i o n s from
                        the fa mi ly for the officer, but n o w you ha v e in v i t e d me
                        to ri s e to my feet can I exp re ss Mrs. R o b i n s o n ' s thanks
                        t h r o u g h you.         She s p e c i f i c a l l y w a n t s you to thank

                        R o b i n s o n and she thanks them for that, sir.

                                  T H E CORONER:         Mrs. R o bi nso n, it is very, very
                        good and kind of you to ask Mr. F r a s e r to say those

                        It is a p i t y that it turned out in the event to be
                        u n s u c c e s s f u l , but that does not di min ish , of course,
                        those p e o p l e s atte mp ts .            It is als o ki nd of you to

  Our reference         Extension                Your reference      Date
 JMJ/EW/1341            2091                  ADM/DSH/MR             6 July 1992




 Thank you for your letter of 2 July 1992 informing me of the developments with regard
 to a possible judicial review of the Coroner’s actions, together with the covering
 documentation.

 I have noted the contents, and in particular the irony in the present Coroner’s position
 in respect of the Hillsborough Disaster.

 I have already spoken to the former Coroner, Dr S L Popper, and advised him what is
 going on. We both agree that neither of us will take any action at this stage unless
 invited to do so. Thank you for keeping me informed.

 Thank you also for your kind words of congratulations on the award of the Queen’s
 Police Medal. Whilst the honour is personal to me I do like to reflect upon the support
 that I have enjoyed from many colleagues over the years in police forces throughout the
 country. In particular, I cannot forget the debt that I owe to 500 police officers in West
 Midlands who supported me in a delicate and time-consuming investigation. As a
 consequence I view the personal honour as much as one to the police service as it is to
 me, particularly during these difficult times.

 With best wishes to you.

               REVOR Hicks used to believe In the system.
               Specifically, he believed that if you kept                                                                                             from terraces ‘
               your head down and worked hard then soci­                                                                                              of Hillsborough
         f.    ety would see you right. Raised in a three-
        &      bedroom. council house in Yorkshire, Hicks's
               was a very “northern” approach to life and
     for a while it served him well. By the time he was 43,
    Hicks was the managing director of a leading security
     company in London, with a home in Middlesex, a lov­
     ing wife and two beautiful teenage daughters.
       Then, on 15 April 19G9, the system let Hicks down.
    All he did was take his daughters, Sarah, 19, and             pi                              m
     Vicki, 15, to a football match. It was the FA Cup semi­
    final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest and
    the venue was Hillsborough. Sarah and Vicki did not
    return. "It is said that to lose a daughter is one of the
    hardest things to deal with,” says Hicks, almost
    matter-of-factly. "We suffered ■ a double family
    bereavement.
       “But what hurts most is not that I lost two daugh­
    ters, but that I was so naive. I was brought up to
    believe In British justice, that if you kept your nose
    clean and worked hard everything would be all right.                                                                                                    i
    I know now, that’s a load of rubbish."
       As the chairman of the Hillsborough Families Sup­
    port Group, Hicks is used to talking about the police
    errors that led to OS Liverpool supporters, Including
    his daughters, losing their lives in the crush in the
    Leppings Lane terraccs and the subsequent attempt to .
    smear the fans as drunkards. Hicks is the public face
    of the disaster and through his calm, reasoned words,
    we have become acclimatised to the tragedy.
       But no one who watches the televised dramatisation
    of the Hillsborough story tonight can fall to be moved
    by the injustice of what happened on that awful, day ,                                                        m m               m
    nor doubt that for Hicks the trauma remains acute.
       Although Granada's two-hour film focuses on three
    families, scriptwriter Jimmy McGovern has made
    Hicks the anchor and the pivot. Everything Is laid
    bare — his agonising choice as his daughters lay
    dying on the pitch to accompany only one of them to
    hospital; the subsequent guilt and breakdown of his
    marriage to his wife, Jenni; and finally, his failure to
 P  win compensation for the families.

          The Express
          1 November 1996

    Dealing with disaster is
    part of a policeman's lot
                E SHOULD not be fooled by the gowns
                and wigs of the Appeal Court judges.
                 For in allowing police officers to renew
                their fight for compensation because of
  “trauma” suffered at the Hillsborough soccer              ;
  disaster, the judges have acted like true                j
 revolutionaries.
      They have completely overturned our settled
 ideas of what we may expect of those who
 voluntarily undertake difficult, at times dangerous,
 tasks on behalf of society..
     The four officers claim they were made
 psychologically ill because of what they saw in the
 course of their duties that tertible afternoon in April
 1989. They want someone to pay, and that someone
 will be the taxpayer, by way of the South Yorkshire
 police. The judgment lays open the possibility that !
 17 other officers will be able to put in similar claims, i
     No one should doubt that their duties exposed
 them to terrible scenes, memories of which will live .
 with them for ever. But what did they think things
 would be like when they joined the force and pimed
 on the blue uniform?                       '
     If they wanted a professional life free of
 unpleasantness they joined th e wrong outfit.
 Moreover, any mature individual joining the police
— or any of the emergency services come to that—
surely makes the tacit declaration that he or she has
the moral fibre to do distressing and dangerous
tasks without expecting compensation. Anyone
unprepared to make that unspoken deal should not
join up in the first place.
     With their foolish decision the judges have
encouraged the growing compensation mania,
which is corroding the sense of professional duty
and responsibility that is such, a vital cement in any
decent society. Moreover, the judgement is a cruel
affront to relatives of the 96 fans who died. They
were refused stress damages while others received
only modest sums. In truth, it is possible to doubt
that even they should receive compensation — as
they would be the first to admit themselves, money
does not bring back their loved ones nor make up
for their loss.
     But if compensation is to be given, the relatives
should su rety be at the head of the queue.
Self-respecting members of the police should be
ashamed to be seen anywhere near it.

  When compensation
  becomes a habit >
   SO THE compensation culture claims
   another notable victory. Even the police
   are n o lo n g er im m une from th e
   pernicious American habit of claiming
   large fin a n cia l rew ards for every
  vicissitude of life.
    Of course officers had a desperately
   distressing task after the Hillsborough
   football tragedy of 1989. Many of the
  rescuers — fans as well as paramedics
  and police officers — were indelibly
   marked by the experience.
    But compensation? When the officers
  involved were sihiply doing the job for
  which they’d been trained and equipped
  and paid? And when they were not
  directly involved in the worst of the
  disaster? Yesterday’s ruling by the Court
  of Appeal, allowing four policemen the
  right to pursue their claim for damages,
  is an affront to common sense.
    According to the officers’ solicitor, the
■ decision ‘shows that the courts recognise
  that members of the emergency services
  deserve the same protection from the law
  as members of the public.’ Really? It
  seem s to show quite the opposite.
    Only a few relatives of victims in the
  disaster have received a penny. None of
  the spectators who pitched in to help the
  injured got compensation. But the police
  stand to make thousands.
    What next? Shall we see serving soldiers
  running to the courts for compensation
  because Britain’s enemies have fired
  shots at them? Will ambulance crews
  demand fat cheques every time they deal
  with the tragic consequences of a road i
  accident? Must we offer bonuses to make |
  up for the distress suffered by policemen
  every time a villain swears at them? Or
  pay traffic cops for the trauma of having
  to drive at high speed with light flashing
  and sirens blaring?
    The tragedy is that such questions are
  no longer merely rhetorical. Yesterday’s
  ruling opens the way for a flood of other
  compensation claims from the emergency
  services. And as always, the taxpayer
  must pick up the bill.

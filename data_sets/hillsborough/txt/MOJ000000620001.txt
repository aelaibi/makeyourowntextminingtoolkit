 Thank you for your letter 3 0 March to the Home Secretary about the inquest
 system which has been passed to me for reply. You referred to Lord Justice
 Stuart-Smith's review of the evidence relating to the Hillsborough disaster and
 the Home Secretary's parliamentary statement on 18 February.

 As the Home Secretary made clear, he fully agreed with Lord Justice Stuart-
 Smith's endorsement of the recommendation of the Home Office Working Group
 on disasters and inquests that the role of the coroner should be limited in cases
 where a disaster is to be subject to a public inquiry. In broad terms, the
 Working Group report proposed that inquests into the fatalities arising from such
 disasters should be suspended, and not resumed except in very exceptional
 circumstances.

 If it had been possible to avoid the need for an inquest at the time of the
 Hillsborough disaster - and the Taylor Inquiry had already covered substantially
 the same ground as the inquest - it would undoubtedly have spared the families
 of those who died unnecessary additional distress. W e therefore believe that the
 Working Group recommendation would provide the right solution. The problem
 is that implementation of the recommendation will require primary legislation.
 Unfortunately, as the Home Secretary made clear on 3 0 March in response to an
 oral question on the subject, there are no prospects for an early opportunity to
 bring forward the legislation needed. This is a matter of regret, but you will be
 aware of the very full legislative programme that we have.

                       THE LORD WILLIAMS OF MOSTYN

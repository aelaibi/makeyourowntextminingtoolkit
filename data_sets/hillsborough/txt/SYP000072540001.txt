                   who lives in                         Wigan.

We    com me nc ed our         j o ur n ey at        11.30 am       (1130)    to travel       the 80 to          100

m il e s    to Sheffield.

The    coach did not             stop     on the wa y but we wet/e held up in M a n ch e s t e r

for about          1 hour      due to         traffic       congestion/        We w e r e again held up on

our a p p r o a c h    to S h e f f i e l d for about           half     to t hr ee -q u ar t er s     of an hour.

The    coach a r r i v e d       in S h e f f i e l d betw ee n 2 . 3 0       (1430)       and 2.45     pm,      (1445)

it parked on a mai n                 road where we were               d r op pe d   off,    it was about a

mile       from the     ground an d due to                  it being     close      to kick off,        I ran to

the    ground,        my two friend s               had seat    tickets and did not hurry.                       Prior

to my arrival           at     the    ground,         I did not w i tn e ss         supporters       drinking

alcohol,           nor did     I see any fighting               or other        disturbance.

I got       to the L ep pi ng s         Ln end of the S t a d i u m at 2 .50                pm,    (1450)       from

the    coach to the gr ou nd                  I received no Po li ce Escort                 or directions.             /

Upo n my arrival             there was a m a ss iv e            c r o w d , I saw three m o un te d Polyce

Officers           in the    crowd,       they were          trying    to get the          crowd back,        away

from tur n st il e          ’B".      These         officers were        outside      the    large w rought

iron gates w h i c h were               closed to.            The    crowd were       trying       to get thro ug h

these       gates     in order        to a p p r o a c h the t u rn st il e area            in front     of

en t r a n c e s   A to G.

This a c t i v i t y was        forcing         some     of the      crowd towards          the West S ta nd

seating       turnstiles.
                                                                                                          /
At about 2.5 5          pm     (1455)         one    of the w r ou gh t      iron gates was          ope/ied by a

Po l i c e Offi c e r who was wear in g a tall                      hat.      The    crowd surged through

                                                                                                          S'1680

I entered           thro ug h the         gate and was        towards     the    rear    of the     crowd,

there was           hundr ed s      of supp or te rs        in front     of me and there was an awful

crush.           I saw      people       being    forced up a g ai ns t a barrier           that was           on the

right      hand side of the                turnstiles.         Some    of these       people were         in

t rou b l e and were              s c re am in g and shouting         to be     released.

I did not           see an yo ne         fall    down or die        in this     crush.     I decided that

it was         getting       too    bad so       I got    out of the      crowd and stood to one side

The m o u n t e d Po li ce O ff ic er s            were     trying    to stop anym or e       supp orters

e nt e r i n g     thro ug h the gates,            the flow was        too    strong and they         could not

stop     it,       some     suppoi/ters were          climbing       t he wrou gh t     iron gates        to get

at    the t u r n s t i l e s . / I saw others              on top of a wall,           they were     telling

the    crowd to move               back.

At a bout          £ .58    pm    (1458)       a m o u n t e d Pol icema/i informed me that           I could

enter      t h r o ug h a gate           to the     right    of t ur ns t il e s A to G.          I w alked

t h r o u g h alone and            found myself          on the other        side   of the turntiles.

I saw a m a t c h S t e w a r d at              this gate     but we     never spoke.

T h e r e was       ha rd ly a ny        people     betw ee n the     turn st il es and the C o n y r o 1

Tunnel         to Pens       3 & 4.        I w a l k ed down the tunnel with ou t             diffi/ulty,

not m an y         people were           there.                                                       /

B ec a u s e     1 had ente re d          via the     gate,    I did not        hand my tickaj/ i n .            I

still      have      the whole           ticket w h ic h     is at home       in Wigan.

As    I e me r ge d from the              tunnel     into the       terraces,       I could see that Pens

3 & 4 were           packed,        I had not seen any signs                 inside     the ground

d i r ec t i n g    people        to the       terraces.

Once     inside         the gr ou nd       I deci de d      to go    right    i nto P en 3.        I took up a

po si t i o n about a t hird               of the w a y down,         d i r e ct l y behind the goal,            as   I

reached          this      point    the    game was       just about      to be s t a r t e d .

The    teams        ki ck ed off,         the    crowd were sway in g         left a nd    right,     back and

forth.           A fter about £ minu te s             had    passed the       crowd swayed forward and

did not move               back    due    to    pressure     from behind.

                                                                                                            SI 680

I could ha r d l y move,                 I was    very     con ce rn ed   for my safety,        I could see

that    the    crowd was             forcing me towards a barrier and                      I did not want          to

be a n y w h e r e    near      it,      because     I believe       that    I w ould have been         injured.

The    pressure was             tremendous,          I was     in a vice      like       grip and the heat

was    unbearable,             people a r o u nd me were            s c re am in g and fainting.            I was

e:< pe r i enci ng      pa i n in my         ribs    but    I could br eathe            quite well.

T here was a man s t an di ng                   next to me,       he had     passed out an d his            face

was w hi t e and          e x pr es si on le ss ,     the    crowd a r o u n d him,        including me,

m a n a g e d to     inch this man up above                  us and he was          passed forwa rd toward

the    perimeter          fence.          I could not see very far                 in front    due to the

crowd.        I e v e nt u al l y        lost    sight     of the man we          had helped up.        I am of

the    opin i o n that          this ma n died           in the     crush.

As    I have       said,       due      to the    crowd     I could not       see what was          o ccurring       in

P e n 3,    I could see some                 people      in Pen 4 w he re         the    perimeter    fence

was    being       d i sm a n t l e d    by s upporters who were             on the track.

I could not move                from my standing              position a nd had w ai t- ou t          the    time

as the t ra g ed y u n f o ld e d a ro un d me,                e v en t ua l ly the      pressure    eased and

at a bout 3.20            pm    (1520)       I was able        to move      backwards       to the top of the

terraces.            I could now see the                 playing are a and          perimeter       fence,    the

Po l i c e were       urging         people      to move     back.

By this       time      I had seen           enough,       people were       lying on the       pitch being

r e n d e r e d first aid,              I w a l k ed back    thro ug h the        tunnel    where more       people

were    being        t r ea te d by P ol ic e Officers.

I met      up with two            people        I knew,     they were       looking       for a friend       of

theirs who           had got         s ep a ra t ed from them,        f o rt u n a t e l y he turned up and             I

left    of my own a c c o rd at 4 pm.                      (1600)

Whilst      inside        the    ground         I did not w i tn es s       the   c o ns um pt io n of alcohol,

fighting,          disorder          of a ny kind or any            criminal       offences.

1 came     out of the            incident         uninjured.

I do    not    have a n y o b se r va t io n s           on how the       incident was        h an dl ed after

                   the      game was     stopped.

                   I feel       that    in future,   direc ti on s   and signs    outside an d   inside    the

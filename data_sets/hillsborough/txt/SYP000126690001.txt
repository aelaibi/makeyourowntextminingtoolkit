The vast majority of the prisoners were the worse for drink,and they maintained a steady

stream of abuse against the Police during the period of their detention.

At approximatly 3«05pm the same date I was informed by Insp Scarf that the game had been

stopped,and within a short time Casualties began to arrive in our area in very large

numbers being carried by Police Officers and Liverpool supporters.xhese casualties

varied from the dead,unconsious,and seriously injured.

Bearing in mind the security of my prisoners ^ gave what assistance I could to the St

Johns Ambulance brigade and other medical people at Jar the scene,during the course of which

the First Aid kit from   the cell bus was put at the disposal of members of the Brigade.

For some considerable time these casualties were laid on the floor at either side of the

cell bus,until the desicion was made to take them into th the gymnasium which was

eventually set up as a tempory mortaury/Casualty recieving station.

I was appaled at the numbers of the dead casualties that were coming in,and wondered

when it was all going to end.

During the course of the operation I also saw a large number of Police Officers who

were in a very distressed state with some of the men and women openly expressing their

grief.

At approximatly 4.30pm. the decision was made to release all of the prisoners with a

verbal caution which came a a great relief because I was becoming increasingly

concerned at the lengh of time these prisoners were being detained in the cramped,

closterphobic conditions of the cell bus,^. was being pleaded bjr the prisoners to be

released as they could not stand it any more. They were becoming increasingly agitated

and I felt that sooner or later some harm would come of them.

At approximatly 6.15p.ro we were stood down from our duties at Hillsborough.

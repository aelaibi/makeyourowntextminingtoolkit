Continuation of statement of   Robert James Goslin


  an ideal position to assess the situation,          I had personally assisted
  several spectators to climb over the fence.          Mr. McGee expressed
  the vi-ew—that— the action of— bringing spectators-out onto the tafaek--- —
  was completely unnecessary and had had the effect of making the ground
  look 'untidy'.      He was obviously upset and said that because of our
  (the-police ■
              )— aet-iort-ii-t ■was unlikely that Hillsborough would ever be----
  invited to host a semi-final in the future ________ ;       ____________ _____

 was a real chance of fatalities he replied 'Bollocks - no-one would____

 The atmosphere throughout the meeting was hostile and there seemed to
 be a total failure to appreciate what might have occurred had we
 not taken-the action we did------------------------------------------ :
                                                                       —

 Relationships between officials of the club and oUtselves were strained
 for seme^t-ime after-the--semi-final— although it is true to-say that— — " '
 things did revert to the normal co-operative working relationships_____
 after a relatively short period of time

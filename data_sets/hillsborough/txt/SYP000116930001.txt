passengers w ou l d              be aware          of their         v e h i c l e ’s parking          place and w ould

Once    there were           suff i c i e n t officers                at    the Five Arches Pu b l i c House,

I c o ntinued up             hill       to the D e v o n s h i r e      Arms,       in company         wit h    Inspector

1 s u b s e q u e nt ly     r e t u r n e d to the Five Ar c h e s and saw Supt.                          C h a p m a n who

expressed          concern         that      the    premises were             full.        After       briefing

Inspector B a t e m a n an d              Inspector           Wallace        (the     latter      in a    "Tango'

mobile)       to    pay      parti c u l a r a t t e n t i o n        to the        premises,         I was    conveyed

by Mr.       C h a pm an     in his Land Rover                 to     a point        in Herries R o a d S o u t h

Mr,    C h a p ma n b ri ef ed me to pay a t t e n t i o n to                      public houses          in Pe n i s t o n e

Road    including           the Royal,             B r a d f i e l d Road,        where    a b u i l d - u p of

d r i nking     s u p p o r t ers      had    bsen noted.

I had to           return to the             g ym na s i u m at     the stadium           to exchange my            radio

(set    14)        as    it was       not     receiving properly.

A member           of the        c om mu n i c a t i o n s   staff      checked the           radio and returned

it to me           and     I p at ro l l e d towards Neepsend,                    meeting up w i t h           Inspector

B u r g e s s and several              officers          en route       to the Royal            Public House.

O n arrival         at     the     premises,          I found a S e r g e a n t           e vacuating         the

1' received         personal           radio m e s s a g e s        of trouble at the V i c t o r i a               public

house,       Neepsend,           involving Special                  C onstables.          Serge a n t     Dent,     Dog

S e c t i o n and       ’T a n g o ’ units went              to their assistance.                     I remained      in

P e n i s t o n e Roa d to moni t o r              the    beh a v i o u r    of N o t t i n g h a m    supporters,         who

w ere wa lking along                 Pe n i s t o n e Roa d towards               the ground.
About     that time,           a coach        containing L i ve rp o o l        s upporters    drove along

the    road     in the        same    direction.          A number       of supporters were           stood      in

the    coach g e s t i c u l a t i n g at N o t t i n g h a m     fans.

A l t h o u g h the For e s t        s u ppo rters a p p e a r e d     to have been drinking

heavily,        they were        good humou r e d and            c o n tinued    in a steady stream to

the    ground.

I am a season ticket                  holder at N o t t i n g h a m Forest F.C.           and the

b e havio ur     of fans was            no worse       than     I saw at W e m b l e y for     the

L i 1 1 1ewoods Cup Final               the    previous       weekend.      There was more            evidence

of drinking          that      I have e x p e r i e n c e d at League and other Cup games

t h is s e a s o n .

After 2 . 3 0        pm Inspector Burgess               and     I b egan to patrol         back towards

t h e g r o u n d , t a 1k in g w i t h fa n s e n ro u t &.

1' a rr iv ed outside           the ground approx imately 3.05 pm.                       I saw the

N o t t i n g h a m E ve ni ng Post        reporter,       Tony Donnelly,          and three Notts,

officers        in the v i c i ni ty of the             car     park entrance.

On my walk           towards     the     ground,       I clearly        heard Superintendent,

Marsh a l l     radio     for    “gate        to be opened"          on two separate        occasions.

After     the second           call,      in w hich     there were        screams and       cries      of panic

in the      background,          I heard a controller                  advise    that   “S e r g e a n t s 916

and 993 have            been    sent     to open the          gates".      I then heard Mr.           Marshall

ask    for the         game    to be      postponed       for    15 minutes.        I heard      no    reply.

At 3.03        pm,     I spoke       to PC     1200 W o o d w a r d who was       standing at the          car

park    entrance         gate a n d wa rned him that                 I expected a group          of around

50 Forest        fans     to try and           climb    into     the    ground.

I then heard a huge                  roar from the L i v e r p o o l       end of the ground

f o l l o w e d by silence.             Seconds      later,      I saw    PS Dent and 2 other            dog

h a n dler s    emerge        from their        vehicles,        leash their      dogs and     ran towards

' O ’ gate.          I heard     nothing        on   my   radio.

I entered the ground and went                        down the        ramp to the        perimeter      track in
                                                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                                                     RS4

         front     of the S pi o n Hop.                 I there    saw Supt.         C h a p m a n who    i n structed me

         to form a cordon facing                     the S p i on Kop,           I saw what      se e m e d to be a

         pitch     invasion at            the L e p pings L a n e / N o r t h Stand           corner      of the ground

         I continued the                cordon along         the track,          assisting      in pushing         several

         F orest       fans     off the         fence    from where       they had        climbed as though to

         get onto         the field.             I then m oved         to the     front      of the S o u t h Stand,

         which     is u n f e n c e d .         I saw Lia m 0 ’Kane         standing         on the      pitch but no

         players.            T hen Arc h i e Gemmill           and R o n Fe n t o n wa l k e d from the            players

         tunnel        and g e s t u r e d      to the Forest          supporters       to    cease      their    chanting

         a n d g e s t u r i.n g .

         I   saw a young L i v erpool                 supporter        run up the       centre     of the        pitch

         towards        the S pi on Kop,            making     obscene      gestures         at the      o pposing

         m u p po r t e r s .     H e w a s d e t a in e d ,

         M inu t e s    later an elde r l y Liverpool                   s u pporter weaved up the                pitch

         making        *V"      sings   at      the Forest       fans.      He was      detained.

         A man     climbed out of the S outh S t a n d and said that he was a doctor

         a n d a s k e d if h e c o u 1 d h e 1 p .

         A l t h o u g h the      public a d d r e s s      system a p p e a r e d    to have      been operating

         the noise           of the      crowd,      exacerbated          by the     incursion of the 2

         L i v erpool        supp o r t e r s    precluded my hearing what was                    said.      I    heard,

         nothing        on my        radio and had no            idea of what was             taking      place at       the

         Leppings         Lane     end.

         I   a c c o m p a n i e d the doctor           to the o p p o s i t e    end and he went           to tend to

         the    first        prostrate          body we h a p p e n e d   on at the end of the               penalty ar

         The    time      by now was after 3.1 5                 pm.

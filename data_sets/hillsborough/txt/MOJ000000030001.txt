MINISTER'S CASE:   SIR MALCOLM THORNTON MP OBO MRS ANNE WILLIAMS


I understand that Matthew Pyne has discussed this case with you;
Mrs Williams' son was killed at Hillsborough and she is
dissatisfied with the inquiries into his death.
2.   I attach copies of the correspondence, and would be very
grateful if you could provide a contribution regarding the
inquest.   (The target date for reply is 4 October.)

            Note of a meeting held at the Hillsborough Stadium,
                   Sheffield on 11th August, 1 9 8 ~

 PRESENT:   Representing the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

            Dr. W. Eastwood (Eastwood & Partners)
            E. England (Secretary)

            Representing the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District)

                            (South Yorkshire Police)
            C. W. Calvert (South Yorkshire Police)

            D. I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council)

1 .______ Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was primarily to carry out the "summer"
inspection of the Ground in accordance with the policy of twice yearly
visits to Football League grounds in South Yorkshire by the appropriate
Officer Working Party.

In particular, the Officer Working Party wished to see the position with
regard to the effect of the carrying out of the improvements at the
Penistone Road end of the Ground (considered by the Officer Working Party
on 28th June, 1983 and agreed subject to certain reservations contained in
a letter to the Club dated 29th Jun e ) . Reports being received from the
Building Authority had indicated extensive movement of existing retained earth
material, apparently of sufficient magnitude to impair the stability of the
adjacent access ramp and associated perimeter walls and barrier rails.

2 .______Ground Inspection

A.      Electronic Score and Message Board

It was noted that, since the agreement indicated at the "winter" inspection
of the Stadium on 21st February, 1983, the electronic score and message
board had been erected between the South and West Stands.  Evidently, it
was proving to be a most welcome feature.

B.     West Stand and Terrace

The Club's intentions with regard to the brick built former A.R.P. building
at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall (now used as a
store) were again discussed in view of its condition.

The condition of the crack in the brickwork’ at the rear corner of the Stand .
(nearest to the North West Terrace) raised at the last meeting was inspected.

Dr. Eastwood reported that the crush barriers on the Terrace had been tested,
completing the first cycle of crush barrier testing at the Stadium.  One had
failed and been replaced.
IT WAS AGREED -

(i)     That, if the Club intend   to continue to use the former A.R.P. building
adjacent to the boundary wall, the lintel over the door would requite attention
in particular, as would the general maintenance of the building.

(ii)    That the condition of the crack in the non load bearing brickwork at
the rear corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(iii)   That the Club would give attention during normal maintenance to the
loose concrete rendering apparent in places.

C.      North West Terrace

As the Terrace and the West Stand were separate structures, the Club were of
the opinion that there would continue to be movement between the structures
caused by changes in weather conditions, thus making it difficult if not
impossible to achieve a seal sufficient to permanently prevent the seepage of
water between the two.

IT WAS AGREED that this was not a matter of safety and that the Club would
continue to monitor the position.
D.      North Stand

The Club reported that the further attention to the crack at the expansion
joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" requested at the last meeting was in hand
as a matter of maintenance.

E.      Spion Kop

As requested at the last meeting, the Club had investigated the spalled concrete
and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the
North Stand e n d ) . Action would be taken shortly to cut off the front (and
worst affected) portion of the roof, which would also have the effect of
increasing the headroom.

Whilst certain remedial work had already been undertaken by the contractor to
stabalise the banking at the rear of the Spion Kop following digging out
to provide new refreshment and toilet facilities, the Officer Working Party
were of the firm opinion that further work was essential.  Measurements had
shown that in places there had been as much as four to five inches of
movement.  Simple visual inspection showed that there was a lack of the
former retained earth material underneath the access ramp in places, and
consequently there had also to be doubts about the stability of the foundations
of the existing barrier rails.  The Club would have to look to the contractor
(or his insurers) to meet the cost of the remedial work to the existing access
ramp and barrier rails.

As pointed out in the letter to the Club dated 29th June, measures would
require to be taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs of the
new facilities (as they were not load bearing).  Barriers would have to be
provided or other measures taken to enable the new facilities to withstand
crowd pressures where these were capable of being generated (as also pointed
out in the letter of 29th June).
IT WAS AGREED

(i)     That the Club's proposals for dealing with the spalled concrete and
corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop be supported in
principle.
(ii)    That as soon as possible, and certainly prior to the first home
match on 3rd September, the condition of the existing ramp and barrier
rails must be stabilised (possibly by- drilling holes at intervals and
inserting grouting under pressure) and the resultant success or otherwise
of the measures tested by test loading the barrier rails (or a representative
sample) to the Green Guide requirements.

(iii)   Also prior to the first home match on 3rd September, measures must
be taken (a) to prevent access by the public to the roofs of the new
facilities and (b) to enable the new facilities to withstand crowd pressures
where these are capable of being generated.

(iv)    That the new buttresses to the existing boundary wall in connection
with the new turnstiles and exit gate must be sited so as not to reduce the
support to the wall, and that the need for pointing of the wall externally
in places must also not be overlooked.

F.     "Stands" Club

It was noted that there was spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel
beams underneath the "Stands" club.  It was understood that the premises
were leased on a full repairing basis to Mansfield Breweries Ltd.

It was also noted that there was a certain amount of deflection £n the brick
built screening wall in front of the Male toilets underneath the Club if
pressure was applied to the top of the wall.

IT WAS AGREED

(i)     That the Club would request Mansfield Breweries Ltd. to give
attention to the spalling of the concrete surrounds to the steel beams
under the "Stands" Club in accordance with the terms of their lease.

(ii)    That the brick built screening wall in front of the Male toilets
should be test loaded to the Green Guide requirements.

G.     South Stand

It was noted that some of the loose coping stones on the top of the
dividing wall between the South Stand and the Spion Kop had been removed,
and that a certain amount of pointing of the wall had been undertaken.

It was also noted that there was severe corrosion at the bottom of both
steel supports to the sides of the    concertina-type exit gate from the
Stand (nearest to the Spion K o p ) .

IT WAS AGREED:-

(i)     That the Club would remove  the remaining coping stones and arrange
for the remainder of the pointing to the upper level of the wall to be
undertaken as a matter of maintenance.

(ii)    That the Club would shortly consider a scheme tobe prepared by
Messrs. Eastwood & Partners for replacement of both steel supports to
the exit gate from the Stand (nearest to the Spion K o p ) .
H.      Ground Fitness Certificate

Dr. Eastwood pointed out that many of the matters discussed at the meeting
were contained in his Annual Ground Fitness Certificate.   However, he had
delayed submitting this to the County Council, las required by the General
Safety Certificate, in view of the situation on the Penistone Road end of
the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED that Dr. Eastwood would submit his Ground Fitness Certificate

           Purpose of Meeting

The purpose of the meeting was to carry out the "summer" inspection of the
Stadium irj accordance with the policy of twice yearly visits to Football
League Grounds in South Yorkshire.

2.________ Ground Inspection

A.         South Stand

The progress of the alterations and extensions to the understand area of the
Stand (ndtified by the letter dated 16th May from M r . I        I Chartered
Architect, and commented on by the Officer Working Party through the Chief
Executive's letter dated 31st May) were noted.  The Club reported that the
contractors had stated that all except the Banqueting Suite would be finished
by the start of the season.

IT WAS AGREED that the areas of spalled concrete on the vertical columns at the
rear of the Stand required attention.

B.         West Stand and Terrace

IT WAS AGREED   -

(i)       That the cracked brickwork (adjacent to the concrete vertical column
at the rear of the Stand adjacent to the North-West Terrace) should continue
to be monitored.

(ii)     That the damaged angled support brackets to the pitchside security
fence at the front of the Terrace should be repaired or replaced.

C.         North West Terrace

The wire mesh barriers on the inside of the upper access desk had been
test-loaded (as suggested at the meeting on 29th February, 1984) , and had
satisfactorily met the Green Guide requirements.
D.        North Stand

It was noted that a metal water storage tank had been installed adjacent to the
ramped access to the upper stand level.  It was also noted that a store area
had been formed by timber screening under the stand between the outer edge of
the walkaway and the Gymnasium building.

IT WAS AGREED that the County Fire Service would investigate the acceptability
of the timber screened store area and/or the items stored, and inform Mr.
Vaughan of the outcome.

E.        Spion Kop

That part of the perimeter fencing, erected .at. the norther end of the ramp at
the rear of the Kop to prevent access to the roofs of the new facility (referred
to at the meeting on 29th February, 1984)had been up-graded     and satisfactorily
tested to the Green Guide requirements.

The brick built screening wall in front of the Male   Toilets underneath   the
"Stands" Club had been braced by metal supports.

It was noted that the condition of the spalled concrete and corrosion of the
roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop had continued to deteriorate, as had the
dividing wall between the Spion Kop and the South Stand and the outer perimeter
wall at the Penis tone Road ead of the Stadium.

IT WAS AGREED   -

(i)       That Mr. Strange should let Mr.           have proposals in writing
for stabalising the condition of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Kop (in
view of the Club *s reported intention of proceeding, with development proposals
m the comparatively near future), following which Mr. __________p.11 let
Mr. Vaughan have detailed comments.

(ii)      That the removal of loose coping stones and  the pointing of the wall
between the Spion Kop and the South Stand (mentioned at the 11th August, 1983
inspection) should be carried out as an urgent maintenance item.

(iii)     That, as it apparently now serves no useful purpose, thedamaged
corrugated metal sheeting between the Spion Kop and the South Stand should be
removed.

(iv)      That pointing work should be carried out as a matter of urgent
maintenance to the outer perimeter wall pending agreement between the Building
Authority and Dr. Eastwood as to its stability (during the present close season,
as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection).

(v)       That the redundant wooden post and loose- wire •adjoining:   the walkaway
at the top of the Spion Kop should be removed.

F.       Lighting Pylons

The visual inspection of the lighting pylons during the present close season
(as mentioned at the 29th February, 1984 inspection) had not yet been carried
out.

IT: WAS- AGREED that, pending the visual inspection of' the lighting py:lon&*
corrosion of the base of the pylon at the rear of the West Stand and of the
adjoining fence posts and manhole cover, required attention.
     G-        Crush Barriers
                                    *

     It was pointed out that the sets of tests carried out in June had completed
     the five year test cycle at the Stadium.  The cycle would re-commence next
     year.

     3 .________ General Safety Certificate

     The numerous alterations to the Stadium since the issue*of the General Safety
     Certificate on 21st December, 1979, were recalled.

     IT WAS AGREED that up-dated plans were required for incorporation into the
     General Safety Certificate in order to indicate the present facilities at the
     Stadium.

     4 .________ Toilet and Catering Facilities

     The Club gave an advance indication of the likely up-grading of toilet and
     catering facilities (particularly in the South Stand), subject to the outcome
     of an application for grant from the Football Improvement Trust.  In the more
•♦




     immediate future, the caterer in question had expressed a wish to serve food
     from the rear of the West Stand through serving hatches instead of from inside
     The area used would remain the same.  If structural alterations were required,
     the Club would also require building regulation approval from the City Council

areas of high risk;


(e)    the lining materials in the Restaurant areas                   be ing to ('lass "0"             level
where not alre ad y to such level;

         Purpose of Me e ti ng

The purpose of the m ee t i n g was to carry out the "winter" inspection of the
Ground in accordance w i t h the policy of twice yearly visits to Football L eague
grounds in South Yorkshire b y the appropriate Officer W or king Party.

The Club reported that the m a j o r i t y of the items listed as normal m a i n t e n a n c e
items following the    summer  inspection had yet ‘to be carried out.        This wa*s
due to a combination of the change in Club Secretary and certain development
proposals (outlined on a confidential basis) w h ic h the Club had in mind.
However, those which the Club's staff could undertake would be commenced shortly
and tenders had b ee n invited and received for the urgent remaining larger
items (to be carried out commencing in M a y ) . The exception was the roof of the
tunnel exit from the Spion Kop (towards the N or t h Stand end) in v i e w of its
possible inclusion in the development proposals outlined.

2•       Ground Inspection

A.       West. Stand and Te rrace

It was noted that the former ARP b ui ld i ng adjacent to the bounda r y wall was
in the process of de mo l it io n and the site cleared and levelled.   This would
have the additional benefit of improving the access/egress.

It was noted that whilst g en e ra ll y the sealing of the cracks b en e a t h the Terrace
to prevent seepage of water had been successful, there was still a slight
seepage from one of the repairs.

The possible need for protect i on of the wire m e s h on the inside of the upper
access deck was also discussed.

IT WAS   AGREED -


(i)    That the Club would continue to m o n i t o r the slight seepage                                       of      water
from the repaired cracks under the Terrace.                                                                                 j

 (ii)     That the p os sible need for lateral b ra cing to the frame of t h e •Wire

            Dear Sir

            Thank you for your letter dated 13.10.83. As you suggested, 2 Fire Prevention
            Officers visited the ground before the match on Saturday 29 October to carry
            out further checks on the effectiveness of the public address system when used
            for emergency procedures.

            In conjunction with the County Police, the public address system was checked
            and found to be satisfactory in all areas.

            If you require any further information, please do not hesitate to contact
            this Department.

            Yours faithfully

 Dear Mr. Wright,

 SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Further to your letter of the 7th October re your visit and
appraisal of the emergency procedure at this ground on
Tuesday, 4th October, when your Divisional Officer Johnson
came to see me after the match and explained thatiin his
opinion there were dead areas in our ground, as it appeared
that stewards had not heard the emergency announcement, to
say the least this surprised me, as only this last close
season have we had the P.A. System further improved.

I have taken the opportunity this morning to try out the
system in all the areas that were supposedly dead, and
I must report that everything that was said, was heard
clearly and distinctly.

I have informed Hamraerton Road police of this, and it
has been suggested to me that perhaps it would be a
sensible idea for one or two of your officers to cane
to the ground at say 1.00 o'clock on Saturday, 29th
October when w e play Huddersfield Town and go around the
ground with the police and hear the broadcasts for them­
selves.

Yours sincerely,

                                                                   D   f

The Secretary,

Dear Mr. England,

SAFETY AT SPORTS GROUNDS ACT 1975

Following a test and appraisal of the emergency procedure at the Sheffield
Wednesday ground, held just prior to the commencement of the Milk Cup Match
on Tuesday 4th October, 1983, please find «y observations belowt-

1,   On this occasion no prior warning was given by the Fire Service
     of the Intention to test the emergency procedure. This was done
     in order that staff reactions could be observed whin they thought
     that they were responding to a genuine emergency.

2,   The procedure was initiated by the announcement, over* the public
     address system of themessage "Will Mr. Derek Knight report to the
     Secretary's office*. It was cancelled approtlaately five minutes
     later by the announcement of "Mr. Derek Knight need not now attend
     the Secretary's offtee".

3.   Hy Officers questioned a number of stewards manning the exit gates
     at both Leppings Lane and Penistone Road ends of the ground. In
     both instances the stewards had not heard the eaerpmcy procedure
     announcement and therefore had not carried out their duties in relation
     to the evacuation procedure.

4.   Further investigation revealed that, in a number of areas, listed below*
     the public address system was not audible.          .

     (a)    Area between the kop and Penistone Road exits.

     (b)    Area between the west stand and Leppings pane exits.

     (c)    Walkways at ground and upfter levels to rear of Kortft stand.

     (d)    Areas in South Stand.

     (e)    Parking area.

     There are speakers at the rear of the west stand but these were not working
     on the night of the test. It is possible that speakers at the Peniatone
     Road end may have been removed or are not functioning correctly because of
 ---.r-s r* ,—   „-----------   .              ,..   ,.            .   .....

Sheffield Wednesday F.C.                -2-               7 th October, 1983



      the alterations currently being carried out at that end of the ground.

5.    Because of the problem with the audibility o f the public address system
      it was not possible for ® y Officers to assess the effectiveness of the
      emergency procedures, they did, however*, report that the stewards they
      questioned would have known what to do if the raessage had been heard
      ■by'them*

6*    A number of stewards were not wearing identifiable dress, i.e. fluorescent
      tabards, as required by condition 9(c) of your General Safety^Certificate.

7.    My Officers also reported that staff manning refreshment bars in the
      north and south stands did not know the position of fire alara call
      points or the position of and how to use fire extinguishers.

I have informed Mr. D. Vaughan (Secretary Officer Working Party) of the
problems listed above and toe will be arranging a site meeting as soon as
possible to resolve the natter of the public address system.   Item 6 is
a matter which I think you can deal wi th yourself.

0° the subject of staff training, which is a condition placed o n the Club
by the General Safety Certificate, I am prepared to sake my Officers
available to instruct your stewards and staff members in the emergency
procedure and.use of fire extinguishers.*

Please contact Divisional Officer Johnson at the above address if you wish
to take advantage of this offer or if you require any clarification on the
contents of this letter*

lours sincerely,_______________     ,

V                     SAFETY OF SPORTS GROUNDS-ACT 1975

    Note of a Meeting o f the Officer Working Party (Sheffield District) held at
         the Division Street Fire Station, Sheffield on 28th July, 1983.

    PRESENT:                2ity of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council),
                             (South Yorkshire P olice),
                  Calvert (South Yorkshire Police),
                        (South Yorkshire County Fire Service),
               M. Johnson (South Yorkshire County Fire Service),
                          (City of Sheffield Metropolitan District Council),
               D.    I. Vaughan (South Yorkshire County Council).

    1.     Purpose of Meeting.

    Whilst the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC and/or their Architect
    (Mr.                                          Sheffield) had evidently
    obtained the necessary planning and building regulation approvals, they had
    overlooked the necessity of seeking approval under the Safety of Sports
    Grounds Act, 1975, to the proposed improvements at the Penistone Road end of
    the Ground.  Through.the Officer Working Party, the County Council had
    indicated to the Club over 12 months ago that they supported the improvements
    in principle, particularly the provision of additional turnstiles, but the Club
    had not previously supplied any details or plans.

    2.    Penistone Road End Improvements.

    The Officer Working Party considered the detailed plan now supplied by the
    Club of the proposals to provide additional turnstiles, new toilet facilities
    and new refreshment facilities at the Penistone Road end of the Hillsborough
    Stadium by demolishing the existing toilet facilities, re-siting one of the
    existing sliding/folding egress gates and digging into the rear of the
    existing Spion Kop.

    IT WAS AGREED that D. Vaughan should reply to the Club that the-Officer
    Working Party sees no objection to the proposed Penistone Road end improvements,
    subject to:-

    (a)   the possible additional new exit gate adjacent to the proposed new
    refreshment facility being omitted, as indicated on the plans;

    (b)    the sliding/folding egress gates being regarded as acceptable only on
    condition that they continue to be permanently manned while ever the Stadium
    is open to the public (outward opening egress gates being preferable, as
    recommended by the Green Guide);

    (c)    the upper level of the wall of the new refreshment facility being
    capable of withstanding crowd loading levels or protected by a barrier to
    the same standard where such pressures are capable of. being generated;

    (d)    generally, the n e w refreshment facility, new egress gate and new
    turnstiles being capable of withstanding the appropriate crowd loading where
    these are capable of being generated;

    (e)    the plastic fall pipes being sited so as to prevent damage by the public
    or metal fall pipes used as an alternative;

    (f)   measures being taken to prevent the public gaining access to the roofs

of the new facility as they are not load bearing;

(g)    the possibility of using vandal-proof glazing in the new facilities
being considered, and
                                                                                                %

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act,            1975

I understand that the Club has commenced re-development work on the
Penistone Road side of the ground, involving new turnstiles, toilets
and refreshment area, etc.                              o

As you will recall, the proposal was first raised on a temporary basis
by the Club's letter dated 25th September, 1981.  Subsequent correspondence
and meetings of the Officer Working Party indicated that, whilst the
temporary proposals could not be supported, the County Council supported
in principle the need on public order and safety grounds for improvement
of the Penistone Road side of the Stadium.

However, except for a sketch plan of the temporary proposals forwarded
with your letter dated 30th September, 1981, the County Council has not
had formal notification as required by the General Safety Certificate or
detailed drawings and calculations of the Club's permanent proposals for
consideration under the Safety of Sports Grounds Act.

It may well be that, because of the County Council's support in principle
of the need for improvement of the Penistone Road side of the Stadium,
that this has been overlooked by the Club or its Consultants.

Perhaps you would kindly arrange to let me have five copies of the detailed
drawings and calculations of the work n ow in hand.

                                                            Yours faithfully,




                                                                                                 r

                                    (South Yorkshire County Fire Service)

             Purpose of Meeting

     The visit was the usual winter inspection carried out of the Football
     League grounds in South Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
     Executive's letter to the Club dated 10th January, 1981), as well as to
     discuss and comment on the Club's proposal to erect a new score and
     message board (referred to in the letter and plans from Messrs. Eastwood
     & Partners dated 7th February, 1983).

            N e w Score and Mes sa g e Board

     The new board was to be erected in the south west corner of the ground
     between the South and the West Stands at a height of some 7 metres above
     the terrace level.  The siting and construction of the supporting pillars
     were such that there would be no appreciable effect on the number of
     spectators who could be accommodated on the terrace.

     The Building Authority regarded the detailed drawings and calculations as
     satisfactory, and Messrs. Eastwood & Partners outlined the steps taken to
     take effect of wind and ice-loadings on the structure.  The South Yorkshire
     Police were satisfied with the assurances given that the structure would,
     for all practical purposes, be climb proof.  The South Yorkshire County
     Fire Service saw no objection to the proposal.

     IT WAS AGREED That the Officer Working Party saw no objection to the
     proposal, and that Mr. D. Vaughan would reply to Messrs. Eastwood & Partners
     to this effect.

     3._____ Ground Inspection

     A.     West Stand

     It was noted that, whilst the foot of the steel supporting pillar had been
     cleared of light surface corrosion and its gusset plate had been covered
     by a concrete haunch (as agreed at the summer inspection on 24th August,
     1982), it still required to be painted.

I
It was also noted that the crack in the concrete adjacent to stand entrances
"W" and "X" had been made good.

The Club had also been requested at the summer inspection on 24th August,
1982, to consider whether any useful purpose would be served by retaining
the store shed at the rear of the Stand and adjacent to the boundary wall.
This point was repeated, and the South Yorkshire Police added that at
some time in the future they hoped the Club would be able to provide some
form of segregation, as well as separate bar and toilet facilities, to
separate home and visiting supporters at the rear of the Stand.

IT WAS AGREED that the new expansion crack in the brickwork at the rear
corner of the Stand (nearest to the North West Terrace) should be
monitored to ensure its condition did not worsen.

B.     North West    Terrace

It was noted that the seepage of water between the North West Terrace and
the West Stand in heavy rain (also raised at the summer inspection) apparently
continued to occur.                                                             i
IT WAS AGREED that, whilst not being a matter of safety, the Club should
be recommended tb replace the bituman impregnated fibre board as a matter
of maintenance to overcome the seepage problem.

C.     North Stand

The crack at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance "R" (which    the
Club had been requested to investigate and make good at the summer
inspection) had received some attention but could not be regarded as
satisfactory.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would give further attention to the crack.

D.    Spion Kop

All of the crush barriers had been tested since certification, the main
problem having been rusting of some of the clips over the top tubes on          *
certain barriers.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club would investigate and make good the spalled
concrete and corrosion of the roof of the tunnel exit from the Spion Kop
(at the North Stand e n d ) .

E.    South Stand

In view of recent adverse weather conditions, the agreement to visually
inspect the roof trusses for apparent deflection after exceptional gale
or snow loading was recalled.  It was noted that the sixth roof truss from
the East Gable (including the Gable) particularly appeared to have deflected
since the summer visit.

IT WAS AGREED -

(i)    That some form of measuring the evident deflection in the roof
trusses was desirable, and the Club were requested to consider whether some
form of quick and/or economic method of doing so could be devised.

(ii)  That the Chief Fire Officer     be requested toconsider  thesuitability
from a fire resistance point   of view of thecladding   in the first floor
enclosed link bridge from the Stand to the Restaurant.

F.     Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand had been
welcomed by the users and were proving to be most useful.

G.     Maintenance

It was noted that certain items of maintenance throughout the ground
required attention.

IT WAS AGREED that under this general heading the Club would look particularly
into the loose wiring at both ends of the South Stand, at the pointing and
spalled concrete in the Male Toilets at the Spion Kop end of the South
Stand, and at the pointing required to the wall (including coping stones)
and the loose metal sheeting between the South Stand and the Spion Kop.

H.    Floodlighting Pylons

Whilst the electrical contractor's staff obviously had to climb the flood­
lighting pylons from time to time, it appeared that no regular inspection
of the pylons took place from a structural safety point of view.

IT WAS AGREED that a regular   inspection of the floodlighting pylons from
a structural safety point of   viexj was desirable, say, every, two or three
years, and that to establish   the present position, an inspection of one of
the pylons should be carried   to see what was revealed.

I•    Painting of Structural Steelwork, Roof Trusses, etc.

Whilst not being a matter of immediate concern, the Officer Working Party
felt it would be in the Club's own interests to institute a programme for
the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc.

IT WAS AGREED that the Club should be requested to consider instituting a
programme for the painting of structural steelwork, roof trusses, etc. on
a regular basis.

J.    Penistone Road Side

The Club were not yet in a position to say when the proposed improvements
at the Penistone Road side of the Ground were likely to be implemented.

Subject   Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975                                      D ate        10.2.83



          As you are aware, it is the policy for the Officer Working Parties to make
          routine inspections of the Football League Grounds in South Yorkshire
          twice yearly, roughly on a summer/winter basis.

          Accordingly, arrangements have* now been made for the following
          inspections to take place

          Date                                Time and Ground

          Monday 21st February 1983           2.30 p.m. at the Hillsborough Stadium of
                                              the Sheffield Wednesday Football Club PLC

          Wednesday 23rd February 1983        2.30 p.m. at the Millmoor Ground of the
                                              Rotherham United Football Club Ltd

          Thursday 24 th. February 1983       2.30 p.m. at the Bramall Lane Ground of
                                              the Sheffield United Football Club Ltd

          Perhaps you would kindly arrange to be represented at both Headquarters
          and Divisional levels as usual.

          So far as the Oakwell Ground of the Barnsley Football Club Ltd. is
          concerned, you will recall that this was inspected as recently as
          21st December.  Unless you have any views to the contrary, I intend to
          regard that visit as the routine winter visit.

          This leaves the Belle Vue Ground of the Doncaster Rovers Football Club
          Ltd.  As you will recall, it appeared in October, 1982, that the Club were
          now anxious for the Officer Working Party to prepare a Report on the
          Ground for them. However, since that date, the climate has cooled,
          possibly connected with the on— going discussions between the Clubs and the
          Police Authority on police charges.   As it appears likely that these will
          soon be concluded to the Clubs' advantage, I will raise the Safety of
          Sports Grounds Act aspect again with the Club shortly.     The Ground is not,
          of course, yet designated by the Secretary of State.     Accordingly, in
          the absence of conditions being such that there is a need for the County
          Council to seek an emergency order under Section 10 of the Act from a
          Magistrates Court, real progress can only be made with the Club's
          voluntary co-operation.                   -------------------------------------

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975

I thank you for your letter of 2nd February.

Dr. Eastwood has given informal intimation of the proposal,
and has undertaken to submit details and drawings for
consideration by the Officer Working Party (Sheffield
District) when these have been prepared.

I am also given to understand that the proposals for
permanent television camera facilities are now unlikely
to be implemented in the foreseeable future.

                                                   Yours faithfully




                                                   Chief Executive

Dear Sir,

Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1 9 7 5 .
Sheffield W e d e n s d a y Football Club P L C .

Fo llo win g y o u r letter dated 3rd December,                               I took this m a t t e r up w i t h the Chief
Constable.

As y o u are aware, the County Council issued a Gen era l Safety Cer tif i c a t e under the
Safety of Sports Grounds Act, 1975, in respect of the H i l l s b o r o u g h S t a di um on 21st
December, 1979.         The detailed pre -de t e r m i n e d E m e r g en cy E v a c u a t i o n P r o c e d u r e was
drawn up later b y Stat ion Officer F. Davis, in co nsu l t a t i o n w i t h the then Divisional
Commander of "F" D i v i s i o n of  the South Y o r k s h i r e Police (Chief S u p e r int en den t R.
H e r o l d ) , and fowarded to the  Club by yo ur letter dated 9th April, 1980.

This was done in accordance w i t h the Sc hedule of R e s p o n si bil iti es of the various
d i sciplines repr es ent ed on the four A r e a O f f i c e r W o r k i n g Parties, but, of course,
this in no w ay affects the ope rational r e s p o n s i b i l i t y of the South Y o r k s h i r e Police
for "on the day" safety and security.

The Chief Constable informs me that he consi der ed it adv isable that the present
co ntingency pl an for e vac uat ion of all or part of the ground s h oul d be amended
slig htl y in that w h e n a s i t u a t i o n arises the police control r o o m staff at the
g r o un d w i l l now pass the fo llowing m e s s a g e over the p u b l i c address s y s t e m to indicate
to p o lic e officers and stewards that e mergency eva cua t i o n procedu res are in force:-
I
    "Will M r ..D er ek Knights p l eas e go inmedia tel y                                    to the S ecretary's office."

In the event of an emergency                e vac ua t i o n b e c o m i n g necessary, a v erb al m e s s a g e will
then be passed by the p ol ice officer in                    charge at the S t a d i u m (again v i a the
p u b li c address system) giving s p e c i f i c instructions as to the a cti on to be taken by
the public.      W h e n the s itu a t i o n has b e e n resolved, the "all clear" wi ll be notified
by the following m e s s a g e passed over the p u b l i c address syste m: -

    "Mr.   Knights need not n o w attend                         the Se cretary's office."

W h i l s t I apprecia te that y o u w e r e not consulted in advance on the m i n o r amendment to
the p r e - d e t e r m i n e d E m e r ge nc y E v a c u a t i o n P r o c e dur e w h i c h I h a v e outlined,, I trust
that you wil l find it acceptable.

                                                                                                         Yours       faithfully,

 Dear     Mr.      Vaughan,

                                                     Sheffield                         Wednesday               Football           Club         PLC

                                                                     Spion                 Kop       - Camera Platform

                         We      have               been             passed                 a    copy         of    some       calculations                by
CSL     Contract            Services                           (Yorkshire)                       Ltd.         who       have     apparently been

asked by          Yorkshire                     Television                             to       construct               a permanent             camera
platform          at    the         top            of          Spion              Kop.              A    further           set    is e n c l o s e d

and    we      have     also            sent               another                     set direc t l y                  to Don       Sheriff          for

his    comments.                    Although                        not           shown,                we   understand            that         they       intend

to    site      the     tower where                             they              erect             the      temporary            structure.                Their

proposal          appears              to be                   structurally                             acceptable           although            we    have

requested          that         they              construct                            a    concrete            block        at    the        top     of

the terrace             instead of                             using             a         -Hilti’ anchor                  as     indicated            on
s h e e t 7.

                       You        will               see           on        sheet              1    that       it      is p r o p o s e d       to    clad
the    tower       using          plywood                       sheets                     round        all     four       sides.             If a c c e p t a b l e
this    will       need       to be                  good            quality                    external             ply     fixed        to a        timber

sub frame          and      the          plywood                     painted blue                            to m a t c h      the       barriers          and
railings.

                       We     have               suggested                         that          access            is    gained          to    the    platform
from a         ladder       inside                  the          tower.                     A    simple            door     which         can be        locked

For      the        attention                 of         Mr.             D.       Vaughan


Dear          Mr.    Vaughan,

                                                      Sheffield                            Wednesday              Football            Club          PLC

                                                                         Spion                 Kop    - Camera Platform

                          We       have              been                passed                 a    copy       of    some       calculations                    by

CSL     Contract            Services                          (Yorkshire)                            Ltd.       who have             apparently been

asked          by    Yorkshire                    Television                               to       construct             a permanent                camera
platform             at   the          top           of         Spion                  Kop.           A    further             set    is   enclosed

and we          have      also             sent              another                       set       directly             to                                for

his     comments.                      Although                        not             shown,             we    understand             that          they        intend

proposal             appears              to be                 structurally                              acceptable             although              we    have

requested             that         they              construct                             a    concrete             block       at    the          top     of

the     terrace           instead of                            using                  a       1H i l t i '     anchor          as    indicated              on
sheet          7.

                          You         will               see           on         sheet              1 that          it    is p r o p o s e d          to    clad

this      will        need         to be                good              quality                    external             ply    fixed       to a           timber

railings.

                          We       have              suggested                             that       access          is       gained      to        the    platform
from      a     ladder          inside                  the           tower.                     A    simple         door        which       can be              locked

                            IMERGENCY EVACUATION PROCEDURE


The following notes of guidance are prepared and issued to assist all official
stewards and others in a position of responsibility at the Hillsborough Stadium
on the action to he taken and procedures to he followed in the event of the
possibility of evacuation of the stadium during the playing of a game when
spectators are present. The notes are not intended to he a comprehensive list
of all the action necessary, hut are for personel issue to each steward and for
retention by the steward for immediate reference all the time he/she is on duty
at the stadium.

It is appreciated that the reasons evacuation may become necessary are many «nH
varied, but the most obvious are fires or information that explosive/incendiary
devices have been placed somewhere within the stadium/ground. That information may
be received or discovered either by members of the staff at the stadium, or Tjy
telephone to the stadium, police, local or national newspapers.

IT IS STRESSED THAT WHENEVER SUCH INFORMATION IS RECEIVED THE RESPONSIBILITT K)R THE
DECISION TO EVACUATE ALL OR PART OF T&E GROUND RESTS WITH THE SENIOR MAHAGE5523T OF
THE CLUB. (The senior police officer on duty will be in a position to advise as to
whether the ’bomb call* is likely to be genuine or not).

Whenever such information becomes known, a message will be relayed to the police
officer on duty in the "PA Commentary Box" at the ground, who, on instructions from
the senior police officer, and irrespective of whether the match is in progress or
not, will cause the following spoken message "WILL MR DEREK KNIGHT REPORT HC THE
SECRETARIES OFFICE" to be relayed over the PA system.

The playing of tHe (nes.sag*. will indicate to everyone present at the ground, other
than spectators, that a possible emergency situation exits.

NB;   As part of the regular pre-match brief of referees and linesmen and 'Dotii teams,
      this information should be passed to them so that the game officials azrs ai
      aware of the possibility of an interruption in play and the significance of the
      spoken message.

On hearing the message "all club stewards will make their way to their designated
duty points on gangways/gates/exits, etc. Those on exit gates will open the gates
and remain at that point. During this period senior officials will consider the
nature of the emergency alleged and will decide to evacuate all/part of the stadium.
Once that decision has been taken, but not until, the senior police officer" c m duty
will cause a spoken message to be relayed over the "PA System" which will        the
effect of:

(1) Stopping the game and removing players from the field of play
(2) Informing the spectators/officials of the precise nature of the emergency and
    its location if known, and requesting all or specified sections of the psblic
    to leave their seats and make their way out of the ground by the nearest; normal
    exit route unless specifically directed to do otherwise by means of the "PA
    System".
 IT IS STEESSED THAT NO EVACUATION WIJ.L TAKE PLACE EXCEPT TOJEEREME EMERGENCY
 AUD ALTHOUGH THE PREPARATORY WARNING pWILL MR TCNTGTPT1 -CTC?T t m Y BE played
 THERE IS EVERY POSSIBILITY THAT INITIAL ENQUIRIES WILL ESTABLISH THE PERPET-’
 RATION OF A HOAX, ETC, AND IN THAT CASE, INSTEAD OF A SPOKEN MESSAGE TO EVACUATE
 THE FACT THAT THE EMERGENCY HAS PASSED WILL BE INDICATED BY THE FOLLOWING SPOKEN*
 MESSAGE "MR DEREK KNIGHT NEED NOT NOW ATTEND THE SECRETARY*S OFFICE",
ON HEARING THIS ‘ALL CLEAR* STEWARDS ON EXIT GATES AND GANGWAYS WILL REMAIN ON
STAND-BY AT THAT P O I M 1 FOR 5 MINUTES BEFORE CLOSING THE GATES AND RESUMING THEIR
NOEMAL DUTY POSITIONS.

In the event of any steward/club official discovering a fire or receiving
information that an emergency situation exists within the ground, he will
immediately -
        (i) Notify the Club Secretary "by telephone
       (ii) Inform any police officer
      (ixi) He must also, on discovering a fire, activate the fire alarm system
            by means of a ’Break Glass® call point

The activation of the call point will not immediately sound any form of audible
alarm but will indicate by light signal in the police staffed control point the
location of the emergency. The police controller can then deploy manpower to
investigate the cause.

In the event of discovery of fire by a steward, he should take additional action
in. accordance with the following points:
(A) Sound the alarm by breaking the nearest break glass call point
(B) Tackle the fire with the appropriate extinguisher if safe to do so
(c)   Close doors within the immediate vicinity of the fire

(E) Upon completion of the evacuation of your section, report to the assembly
    area (which has been specified by the Club) and report to the person in
    overall charge, who will, in turn, report to the Fire Service and any other-
    relevant emergency service which may "be in attendance0                   Jflfe

 Further to the annual inspection visits recently carried out at the above
:premises.  I would inform you that my officers have now completed the series
 cf checks required under the Act and the following are ray observations and
 comments.

1.    Fire Equipment

1.1   Fire fighting equipment throughout the premises wa3 inspected and
      appeared to be in good order and functionable.

2.    Fire Alarm System

2.1   With the assistance of the police arrangements were made to fully check
      stage by stage all zones within the system.   At the time of the annual
      inspection the system operated satisfactorily.

3*    -Hnergency Lighting System     :

      The complete installation was checked through on mains failure and
      operated satisfactorily, although the maintenance staff could not
      produce any records of routine maintenance and testing.

4.    i-ire Routine and Emergency Evacuation Procedure

4.1   Many aspects of these safety requirements were found lacking, the
      details of which are as follows and are in contravention of those
      conditions laid down in Schedule 2 of the General Safety Certificate.

      (a)   Huaerous stewards, when questioned about their responsibilities
            under Section 9 of the Certificate, could not give correct or
            suitable replies to the questions.  Many were not familiar with
            alarm call point positions in the immediate area of their
            responsibility.

      (b)   Many stewards when questioned could not provide the fire service
            representative with the documents required under 9(d) of the
            certificate.

      (c)   Since the start of the season the Fire Authority have not been
            approached with regard to training on fire safety procedures,
            as has been the case in previous years.  Training sessions
            should be held at least once in every three months Section 9(3)
            of the certificate conditions.

            In view of staff changes, more especially amongst the stewards,
            regular training of staff roust be maintained in accordance with
            the standards laid down in Section 9 of Schedule 2 of the
            Certificate.
Chief Executive                        -   2   -                       14.9.1982




    (d )   Part of the emergency procedure at      the ground requires the
           playing of 'code' records over the      P.A. System.  A 'during match'
           check of the broadcasting facility      was carried out as part of
           the annual certificate inspection,      two faults were high lighted.

            (i)   The records in question could not be found by the D.J.

           (ii)   The disc jockey was not familiar with the titles of the
                  tracks to be played over the P.A. system as detailed in
                  emergency procedure schedule.

           The persons responsible should be familiarised with the routines
           centering around the emergency procedures for the stadium as
           soon as possible.

    s: low.


    Daar Sirs
#   1 refer to your letter of the 8th September, 1982, regarding the visit of
    my officers on the 7th September, 1932, and advise you that I have questioned
    the officers concerned.

    I understand from Divisional Officer Ray that he did inform you during his
    previoun visit that, in conjunction with the police, a fire alarm test would
    be carried out at the next home match to complete the inspection prior to
    licence renewal.

    I am sorry to note that there has been an apparent misunderstanding in this
    matter and that you were not made auare of my officers* presence on the
    promises*  I hope that our future relationship will continue in the spirit
    of co-operation that has existed in the past.

    Yours faithfully,




    Chief Fife Officer.

                   Dear Sir,

                   I must complain most strongly about the attitude of your
                   officers at Hillsborough last evening.  On trying to
                   approach them, they did not appear to have the time
                   to be even civil.

                   In the first place I would have thought it was only
                   courteous that someone should have contacted me to
                   inform me that they were coming to the ground, and
                   particularly at the time at which they arrived.

                   They drove in with two cars, parked in spaces
                   allocated to our regular people and so caused
                   embarrassment, as I had to put these people else­
                   where, plus a fire engine which was parked in the
                   middle of the car park, and did not then enquire
                   at our Enquiry Office, but walked through our
                   Players' Entrance and through our domestic area
                   without so much of a word that they were even
                   present.

                   I trust that on future visits you will ensure                    SOUTH Y O R K S H IR E
                   that the correct approach is made.
                                                                                   COUNTY F;R£ SERVICE

    1       Purpose of Meeting

The visit was the usual summer inspection carried out of all Football
League Clubs in Sputh Yorkshire (originally referred to in the Chief
Executive’s letter to the Club dated 10 January 1981).

    _
    2______ Ground Inspection

A          West Stand
                                     ■     /
•It was noted that there was light surface corrosion at the foot of the
 steel supporting pillar nearest to the North-West Terrace. As there was
no enclosing wing to the stand, the pillar was open to the elements.

The possibility of spectators climbing onto the roof of the store shed to
the rear of the stand and adjacent to the boundary wall was discussed.

IT WAS     AGREED -

(i)     That the Club would arrange for the foot of the steel    supporting
pillar to be cleaned and painted and possibly for the gusset     plate to be
covered by a concrete haunch.

(ii)   That the Club would consider whether any useful purpose would be
served by retaining the store shed adjacent to the boundary wall.

(iii)  That the Club would investigate and make good the crack in the
concrete adjacent to stand entrances "W" and "X".

B         North West Terrace

It was noted that the cracks in the concrete underneath the Terrace had
been repaired and appeared satisfactory.  However, there was seepage of
water between the North West Terrace atid the West Stand in heavy rain.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club'would make good the bitumastic sealing
between the Terrace and the West Stand.

C      North Stand

A crack in the concrete at the expansion joint adjacent to Stand entrance
"R" was noted.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would investigate and make good the crack.

D      Spion Kop

The Building Authority suggested that at some future date the Club should
consider giving attention to the original steps at the rear of the Kop
(at the bottom of the new staircase) so as to remove the slight downward
tilt and ensure a common height of ris e rs .

IT WAS AGREED - That, whilst there had been no reported incidents, the Club
would bear the suggestion in mind for attention at a future date.

E      South Stand

The Club reported that the gantry access to the Commentary Box on the top
of the Stand was not now used, except by ground maintenance staff.

IT WAS AGREED - That the Club would replace   the missing rings   in the chain
used as a handrail on the gantry.

F      Crush Barriers

The Club reported that the remaining third of the crush barriers on the
Spion Kop had now been tested.   The only problem had been rusting of some
of the clips over the top tubes.   These had been replaced or would be
replaced by the start of the Season on 28 August.

A visual inspection had also been carried out of the clips on the crush
barriers on the West and North-West Terraces, and similar action taken.

G      Police and First Aid Facilities

The new police and first aid facilities under the North Stand were well
on the way towards completion, and would be utilised at the opening match
on 28 August.

H      Penistone Road Side

It was    n o t e d ;that the steel girders adjoining the wall atthe rear ofthe
B ut cher’s Shop had been satisfactorily attended to, and that the Folding
Exit Gates had had new tops and runners installed and the concrete made
good.

So far   as the proposal to re-site an existing toilet block to     the   rear of
the Spion Kep to enable additional turnstiles and      an    exit gate to be
installed was concerned, the Club had reported to the Chief Executive
by letter that this had had to be deferred until the end of next season
due to the size of the problem and the possibility of creating hazards for
spectators.
I      Television Camera Facilities

It was noted that the scaffolding Tower erected on the Spion Kop for
Television camera purposes had now been removed.

There did not appear to have been any progress with the Television
Authorities to date on the subject of permanent or semi-permanent
facilities.

J     Fire-Fighting Equipment

Whilst the Club were confident that all of the fire extinguishers, etc,
were still sited as originally required by the General Safety Certificate,
the County Fire Service felt that a routine inspection of the equipment
would now be appropriate.

K     Maintenance

Certain areas of spalled concrete in the Stadium required attention, and
the Club had the work in hand as items of routine maintenance.

             Dear Mr. Mallett,

              Having met and conversed with Mr. David Vaughan at the police
              meeting in Sheffield yesterday, I confirm that the alterations
              to turnstiles etc. on Penistone Road have had to be deferred
             •until the end of next season, due entirely to the size of the
              project and the possibility of creating hazards for our
              spectators.

             The police and first aid facilities are progressing very well,
             ancl we are hopeful that they will be in operation for the
             start of the season.

             Yours sincerely,

  For         the     attention                    of         Mr.           D.         Vaughan



  Dear         Mr .      Vaughan,

                                     Sheffield                          Wednesday               Football        Club

                    Canopy           over             Television                         Platform      in    South       Stand

               We     have       had           a meeting with                                 representatives            of    the       YTV

  and         they       together                 with               the BBC              have    decided         that    they       cannot
  afford            the       canopy               after                all.             In    addition,        the     lifting beam
  for         hoisting           cameras                     into              position          cannot      be    placed       at       the

  back         of     ’
                      the      stand              because                      of      possible       future       developments.
  We      shall          therefore                    now           be         designing          a much        simpler system
  with         a    lifting beam                          over             the         open     seats.

               I understand                       that              representatives                    of    YTV have          had
  discussions                 with             Mr.                                            with    regard      to     the    structure

  on      top       of    Spion            Kop.                 We         have         not    been    involved          so    I am

  not         able       to    tell            you           the           outcome.



                                                                                        Yours     sincerely,

          Dear Sir,

          Safety of Sports Grounds Act 1975
          Sheffield Wednesday Football Club Ltd.

          I thank you for your letter dated 25th May.

          It is noted that the Television Authorities do not intend to
          proceed with the canopy over the television platform in the South
          Stand, and no doubt you will let me have details of the lifting
          b e a m proposals when these have been finalised.

          As regards the temporary structure at the top of the Spion Kop,
          it is true that at their request, YTV had discussions on a
          preliminary basis with the Building Authority earlier in the year.
          It was because of the fact that it became clear in March that
          further progress could not be made until arrangement drawings
          were submitted for consideration by the whole officer Working
          Party in the usual way that I wrote formally to the Club on this
          matter on 3lst March (a copy of whi^ch I forwarded to you for
          information).

          To date, I have not received any arrangement drawings from either
          the Television Authorities or the Club.

                                                          Yours faithfully,




                                                          Chief Executive.

Security Gates, ITorth Stand, Sheffield Wednesday
Jbotball Club

Daring the meeting- o f the Officer Working Party at Steffi-eld Wednesday      |
Efeotball Club on Thursday 4th February, 1982, a dispute arose regarding the
installation o f the n e w security gates at the head o f the ramp from the rear|
o f the North Stand,   The issue bein g that the width o f each ramp is reduced A v|
b y a total o f approximately 15 inches*                               ■ \       -',;i

When this .matter was first raised at an Officer Working Party to September, .             i:.^5
1981 the fire service indicated that there would be no objection to tike pro**              ;
po s e d gates providing that they did not reduce the existing critical width                t.
o f the rasps and were capable of being swung bade to’Y i ^ clear of t h e ramps,           '/|kj

It is the contention of Eastwood and Partners that from the balcony apek at
the rear of the stand, and town the rasps the flow rat.© should b e 60 persons         ,!
p e r minute (Claa.se 16*2 in the Home Office Guide),  The Fire Service ixrtter* .
pretation is that until persons are out o f the stand structure, i*e, at the           \-
bottom of the rasps, the flow rate of 40 persons pe r minute, contained in\ciause *

reaching the elevated          at the rear of the stand the original widths
of the two raraps reduced the units of exit to slightly under fourteen.

This reduction was accepted % the Eire Service when th© General Safety
Certificate was granted because the provision of additional or wider rasps
would have been unreason&bl in the circumstances*

Shis further reduction in exit widths to twelve units is not considered
satisfactory. 1 therefore recommend that the gates are re-constructed so
as not to reduce the existing width of the raiaps, that they are capable of
bei ng swung back to lie clear of the ramps and are locked in that position
cm match days.

THE MIDDLE PENS. THE POLICE BEHIND THE GOAL MOUTH WERE TRYING TO STOP THE
FANS CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES ON TO THE PITCH. I BELIEVE THE POLICE BELIEVED
AS I DID THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO INVADE THE PITCH. OVER THE NEXT 20 MINUTES
IT STARTED TO BE APPARENT THAT PEOPLE WERE INJURED, AND I COULD SEE SCUFFLING
BETWEEN THE CROWD AND THE POLICE. I REALIZED THAT THE MATCH WOULD NOT
COMMENCE SO I LEFT.

IT WAS A GOOD 10 MINS BEFORE THE POLICE REACTED PROPERLY.
ABOUT 150 POLICE OFFICERS CAME ONTO THE PITCH AND FACED THE NORTH STAND TO
PREVENT OTHER PEOPLE COMING ONTO THE PITCH INSTEAD OF HELPING THE INJURED.

              LEPPINGS LANE BY A P.C. THERE WERE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF
              OFFICERS IN LEPPINGS LANE WHEN I ARRIVED THERE AND TWO MOUNTED
              OFFICERS. THERE WAS A CRUSH TOWARDS THE GATE AS IT WAS OPENED AND
              A STEWARD THEN BLOCKED OFF THE TURNSTILES. I SAW A WPC WHO
              APPEARED TO BE IN TROUBLE

I PULLED HER OVER AND PUSHED HER THROUGH THE TURNSTILE AS SHE WAS BEING
CRUSHED.I, EVENTUALLY, GOT PUSHED ALONG WITH EVERYONE ELSE THROUGH THE GATES
AND FOUND MY SEAT IN THE NORTH STAND.AT ABOUT 1505 HOURS I COULD SEE FANS IN
THE WEST STAND CLIMBING OVER THE METAL FENCE, POLICE WERE PUSHING THEM BACK.
THE GAME WAS STOPPED AND EVEN MORE PEOPLE BEGAN TO CLIMB THE FENCE. THERE
WERE LOTS OF PEOPLE TRYING TO PULL DOWN THE FENCING AND ALSO A PC AND A WPC
IIVPRDER TO STOP THE CROWD BEING CRUSHED. THERE WAS SO MUCH MORE SPACE IN THE
T W OUTER PENS AND I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY EVERYONE WAS ALLOWED TO CROWD
INTO THE MIDDLE PENS.

                  TAIL BACK WE WERE AT A STANDSTILL AT EACH WE TRAVELLED THEN ON
                  THE Ml LEAVING AT JCT36 THERE WAS A LINE OF COACHES STRETCHING
                  THE FULL LENGTH OF THE SLIP ROAD BEING SEARCHED BY THE POLICE

<< WHO_WITH      >>
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THAT PROBABLY THE CAUSE OF FANS ARRIVING LATE WAS
BECAUSE THEY WERE BEING HELD UP ON THEIR JOURNEY BY THE POLICE. WHEN WE
ARRIVED AT THE GROUND AT ABOUTl345HRS WE SAT EATING OUR SANDWICHES IN THE CAR
THEN MADE OUR WAY TO THE GROUND AND GOT THERE ABOUT 1430HRS. THERE WERE ALOT
OF PEOPLE MILLING ABOUT AND WE ENTERED THE NORTH STAND NEAR TO THE LEPPINGS
LANE END BUT WE DIDNT TAKE TOO MUCH NOTICE OF THE CROWD BECAUSE WE WERE ONLY
LOCKING FOR THE ENTRANCE TO OUR STAND. ONE OBSERVATION I WOULD MAKE WAS THAT
WHfN WE GOT TO OUR SEATS WE COULD SEE THAT THE ONLY PART OF THE LEPPINGS LANE
TERRACES THAT WAS FULL WAS THE CENTRE WE THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE THEY
WERE BEING HELD UP ON THE MOTORWAY. WE SAW PEOPLE CLIMBING OVER THE FENCES
FROM THE MIDDLE TO GET INTO THE WINGS CAUSE PEOPLE WERE STILL PILING INTO THE
CENTRE PART.
THE ONLY THING THAT AGREVATED PEOPLE IN OUR STAND WAS THE LINE OF POLICE
STANDING ALONG THE LENGTH OF THE NORTH STAND DOING NOTHING I KNOW THEY WERE
ONLY DOING AS THEY WERE TOLD BUT IT DID CAUSE A BIT OF AGREVATION
IM NOT SURE IF THIS WILL ASSIST YOU IN ANY WAY BUT I AM WILLING TO BE
INTERVIEWED AND TO MAKE A STATEMENT IF IT WILL HELP.

  AS WE STOOD OUTSIDE THR CONCERTINA GATE WAS OPENED St EVERYONE PUSHED

DISAPPEAR. WQE THEN MADE OUR WAY TO OUR SEATS. WE DIDN'T SHOW OUR TICKETS TO
ANYONE AT ALL, I STILL HAVE MY TICKET NOW. WE THEN SAT IN OUR SEATS. THEN
GAME THEN BEGAN. WHEN LIVERPOOL HIT THE BAR THERE WERE ALREADY A MASS OF
PEOPLE SPILLING ONTO THE WEST STAND PART OF THE PITCH. THE NUMBERS GRADUALLY
GREW. I SAW A MAN WITH A BROKEN LEG BEING TOLD TO GET BACK INTO THE GROUND BY
THE POLICE. I SAW A NUMBER OF OTHER PEOPLE WITH BROKEN LIMBS WALKING AROUND.
THE FORREST FANS WERE CHANTING, & GROUPS OF LIVERPOOL FANS RAN TO THE FORREST
ENIW THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM WAS NONE EXISTANT. A LINE OF POLICEMEN THEN
Ca J 9 INTO THE GROUND TO THE CENTRE OF THE PITCH, THEY MADE NO ATTEMPT TO HELP
THE INJURED. BY THAT TIME THE FANS WERE USING THE ADVERTISING BOARDS AS
MAKE-SHIFT STRECHERS TO CARRY PEOPLE AWAY. AGAIN THE POLICE MADE NO ATTEMPT
TO HELP.AS THIS HAPPENED A NUMBER OF POLICE CAME ANE STOOD IN FRONT OF THE
NORTH STAND. THE POLICE WITH DOGS THEN CAME INTO THE GROUND AND STOOD IN
FRONT OF THE FORREST FANS. BY THIS TIME EVERYONE KNEW THAT SOME PEOPLE HAD
DIED AND SO ALL THE CHANTING FROM THE FORREST FANS STOPPED.
THERE WAS THEN AN ANNOUNCEMENT BY KENNY DALGLESH TELLING FANS NOT TO PANIC &
TO KEEP CALM.
WE THEN STOOD AROUND AND WATCHED WHAT WAS HAPPENING. WE WERE THEN ASKED TO
LEAVE IN AN ORDERLY MANNER TO HELP THE AMBULANCES.
I WENT TO THE MATCH WITH 4 OTHER PEOPLE

I COULD HELP, I AM A TRAINEDNURSE, AND I WAS TOLD TO GO ON AND DO WHAT I
COULD. I COULDN'T FIND ANY EQUIPEMENT WHERE I WAS, AT THE CORNER OF THE
NORTH STAND. THERE WAS NO ONE IN CHARGE AT THAT END OF THE PITCH, THERE WAS
NOTHING TO IDENTIFY ANYONE WHO KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING, SO I DIDN'T KNOW
WHO TO TAKE OVER FROM. I THINK THAT IF THEY HAD HANDED OUT SOMETHING TO
IDENTIFY PEOPLE I ,PERSONALLY COULD HAVE BEEN OF FAR MORE USE. THE POLICE
DID NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT ANYTHING. WHEN I TRYED TO LEAVE, I WAS
STOPPED FROM GETTING THROUGHBY THE POLICE.

WERE PEOPLE TRYING TO GET OVER TYHE FENCES AND ON TO THE PITCH THEN I SAW
OFFICERS COME ON TO THE PITCH TO STOP THE MATCH AND FROM THEN ON THINGSD JUST
ESIMULATED ONE POINT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE IS THAT EMERGENCY GATE 4 WAS
n P I r OPENED THEN I COULD SEE THAT THE FANS AND SOME OF THE OFFICERS WERE
TRYING TO TEAR SOWN THE FENCE SO AS TO ELIVIATE SOME OF THE PRESSURE THERE
WERE LOTS OF PEOPLE ON THE PITCH AND THEY WERE TAKING DOWN THE BOARDS TO USE
AS STRETCHERS FOR THE INJURED THERE WAS SO MUCH CONFUSION IT WAS DIFFICULT
TO TELL WHAT WAS REALLY HAPPENING UNTIL YOU COULD SEE THE POLICE OFFICERS
GIVING MOUTH TO MOUTH THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH TANNOY MESSAGES THEY REALLY SHOULD
HAVE LET US KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING BUT THERE WERE ONLY 2 MESSAGES THAT I CAN
RECALL ONE TO ASK PEOPLE TO CLEAR THE PITCH AND THE OTHER TO ASK FOR
EVERYONES CO OPERATION IN THIS MATTER. I DID SEE QUITE A FEW POLICE OFFICERS
WITHIN THE GROUND AND WHEN THE INCIDENT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THERE WERE
HUNDREDS OF THEM ON THE PITCH BUT I NEVER REALLY SAW VERY MANY STEWARDS.

             POOR WAY IN WHICH THEY WERE TREATED. THE SUPPORTERS ACTED
             APPAULINGLY, IT WAS ALSO DISGUSTING     THAT THERE WAS ONLY ONE

             AND THOUSANDS ALL TRYING TO PUSH IN AND FIGHTING. I LOST TRACK OF
             A FRIEND ON THE WAY IN BECAUSE IT WAS EVERYMAN FOR HIMSELF. WHEN
             I GOT IN I COULD SEE THAT THE TWO SIDE SECTIONS WERE ALMOST EMPTY
             AND THE CENTRE WAS PACKED. WHEN PEOPLE FIRST STARTED TO CLIMB
             OVER, I THOUGHT IT WAS A PITCH INVASION WITH THE FANS TRYING TO

FOREST FROM SCORING. THEN I REALISED THAT PEOPLE WERE BEING CRUSHED. WHEN THE
GATE WAS FINALLY OPENED IN THE FENCE, THE FANS WERE ALLOWED TO COME OUT ONTO
THE PITCH. I SAW TWO POLICEMEN JUST STROLLING SLOWLY ALONG WITH A STRETCHER,
AND I COULD SEE THAT THEY HADN'T REALISED THE SEVERITY OF WHAT WAS GOING ON.
THERE WERE A LOT OF POLICE JUST STANDING AROUND AND IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING
THAT THEY WEREN'T DOING ANYTHING TO HELP. THE LIVERPOOL FANS SEEMED TO BE THE
ONES DOING EVERYTHING FOR QUITE SOME TIME WITH JUST THE ODD POLICEMAN HELPING
HERE AND THERE. WHAT UPSET ME THE MOST WAS THE POLI9CE WHO WERE STANDING IN
    CENTRE AND ON THE SIDELINES WHO WERE DOING ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING FOR CROWD
C^WROL OR TO ASSIST. PEOPLE WERE TRYING TO CLIMB OVER FROM THE PENS, AND THE
POLICE WERE THROWING THEM BACK IN INSTEAD OF MOVING THEM INTO THE EMPTY
SECTION. INSTEAD OF HAVING DIFFERENT COLOURED TICKETS AND SIGNS FOR DIFFERENT
SECTIONS AND THINGS, THERE WERE ONLY TINY SIGNS, LOW DOWN, WHICH YOU COULDN'Y
SEE UNTIL YOU WERE ON TOP OF THEM. WHEN WE WENT LAST YEAR, I REMEMBER PEOPLE
SAYING THAT IT WAS PACKED IN THAT CENTRE SECTION THEN AND WE WOULDN'T GO IN
THERE BECAUSE OF THAT.
IT JUST SEEMED SUCH A SMALL ENTRANCE FOR SO MANY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE. THEY
USUALLY HAVE POLICE ORGANISING EVERYTHING SO WELL AT ANFIELD, BUT THERE WAS
NO ORGANISATION AT ALL AT SHEFFIELD. IT WAS JUST AWFUL.
I WAS WITH A FRIEND WHO WAS IN A DIFFERENT SECTION, BUT I CAN'T GIVE HIS
DETAILS WITHOUT ASKING HIM FIRST.

AFTER THAT A FEW POLICE RAN OVER AND WERE TRING TO DORT THINGS OUT BUT IT
BECAME OBVIOUS THAT IT WAS A REALLY BAD THING THAT WAS HAPPENING AND MORE
POLICE CAME ON AND JUST STOOD THERE IN FRONT OF US IN THE NORTH STAND, A LINE

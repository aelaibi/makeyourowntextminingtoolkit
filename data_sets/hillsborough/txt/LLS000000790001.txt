bwyneaa.                   will say:-

I was born on                   I work as a
        for                  in Bangor in North
Wales earning £6,750 per annum gross. On Saturday
15th April 1989 I went to the F.A Cup Semi-final
game between Liverpool and Nottingham For/est
travelling by coach.                            '

I was with a friend of mine Mr                                 of
                           Liverpool.

We went along the M56 M o t o r w a y _turning off at
about 1.15 p.m. There was terrible traffic and
I remember it took about one hour to travel eight
miles.                                                                              pU^SilAtL^ SCA^cUtc-t
                                                                           -o J d          w e rs .
The coach was stopped at a lay~by and everybody on                                       ha&ts        to
it was^searched by the Police. There was no djink                                                •
on the coach at all and the purpose of the Police
search was to ensure that there was no drink and
also to check that everybody had tickets.

We arrived at the coach park at about             2.15 p.m.

I saw no substantial drunkeness m: although obviously
I did see one or two people with cans of lager in
their h a n d s .
                                                                      •



There was not a great deal of noise but there were a
lot of people asking for. tickets all the way fr.Om
the coach park to the ground and it did seem to me
that a lot of cars and coaches were arriving at the
time and there was a panic to get a good position
in the .ground.

As far as I could see there were no pubs   open in^ .••
the vicinity of the ground along our route.
                                  at   Tic.        ****                              .
As we approached the turnstilesA at around 2.2^p. m
                                              queues
there was £ mass of people milling round but^que
formed at the turnstiles.

Whilst in the queue I did see a lad being ejected
from the turnstile and a Policeman h a d a quiet
word with him and allowed him to^back into the
queue a n d ^ r e s u m a b l y he got in. Whether he had a ticket
or not I do not know.

The actual queues would be about              ten deep.

Having got through the turnstile at about 2,25p.m
when at that stage there was no cause for concern
I saw that there was a steward inside the ground
and a rail indicating that ..We should go a certain
way and as I could only see one obvious way in
I walked through the tunnel which I saw ahead of me.

             T h e r e w e r e n&. .stewards or Police advising us to go to
             the side pens.-but'myself and m y friend after going through
             the tunnel veered towards the right hand pens which were
             fairly full even at that stage.

             We were pushed into that mass of people who were already
             in the pens by people who were coming in from behind
*            and we en^ed    ra44*er more than half way down the '
         ,   terraced steps.                          .  ,
-tvi*.                K                        .   .   .   .   .    .


             ,,   r       j        ,                                    .                          V I W>\l'
             We forced ourselves to the right                                     so that we were tia-rtf _ua
             nfininot- the dividing railings.
                                                                  ’' *
             To begin with we were reasonably alright where we wexe but
             by  2.30p.m I said to my friend that we had bet ter *getout
             of   there as there was going to be murder later on.

             I jumped over the -dividing railings and my friend went
             through a small gap.

             In   this right hand pen looking out over the goal ihere
             was plenty of room even to the extent that there was
             room to sit down.

             We would  be by then about six to ten yards away fr'om the
             fence dividing us from the other section where we had formally
             been.

             I looked round and within five minutes I saw that the pen to
             our left was completely full and it was uncomfortable even
             by the dividing railings where we had been.          .

             People started like we had done to jump over to our section
             and this was before the kick off.

             I saw no sign of anybody being injured however before the teams
             came out.                                             * u *•

             Just as the teams came out however two lads told, us that
             it had been murder "out there" as they ha d opened the g^tes.

             We immediately realised that this was probably going to mean
             that there was going to be a big crush wi th people coming
             in in force from the back.

             It was a case of watching the game and watching how the crowd
             situation was going at the same time.
                                                                                                               »


             Just before Peter Beardsley hit the bar with a shot at t h e '
             far end of the ground already a few people were scaling the.
             perimeter fences onto the pitch and were also coming over :
             the dividing fence into our pen.  ,

             People started to be thrown over the perimeter and dividing
             fences and some were hauled up' to the stand behind us.
                                                       .
                                                                   **•' i   •
                                                                             ■■

I*
 I had no idea that people were being killed.

The evacuation of the pen next door continued like this
until the game was stopped.

I knew people were being hurt as I could hear their
criesl could.not see anything definite.                   '

After the game wa§_ stopped I: could see* that bodies were
being brought passed as in front of us and laid on the
pitch.

This would be just about   the time -o^ the surge of' fans '
across the pitch towards   the Forrest end.

Three bodies were laid on the pitch in front of us these
unfortunates being patently dead.

There were many more people on the temporary stretchers
that had been fashioned out of the hoardings.

There were people who we re being given chest massage.

There were no blankets covering either the people who
were dead or the people who were receiving emergency
tr e a t m e n t .

My thoughts then and now are that the Police did not really
have a clue how to deal wi th this terrible emergency.

It was not until about 3,10p.m that one of the gates in the
perimeter fencing was opened by a Policeman,

Even then there were conflicting orders from the Police
to come out on to the pitch and stay where we were.

It eventually ended with   fans themselves forcing the gates
open,

I remember feeling shocked when the loudspeaker system
asked people to clear the pitch.

Eventually at about 3.40p.m we left the pen through the
gates that been opened on to the pitch.

We went   to look for a phone and telephoned home.

I was stunned and could not believe what I had seen.

I had started crying   in the ground before we left

The coach left at about    5.30p.m   ,

Everybody in it was    shocked and stunned and I was verv
badly affected.

In my view no one single person is to blame for all this
tragedy
I certainly blame the F.A for the ticket allocation
Nottingham Forrest getting far more tickets than was
warranted by their support and really they should
have been at the Leppings Lane end and the bigger
Liverpool following at the other end.

I really do not think the Police had any real policy
to control the crowds or deal with any emergency.
There was no . organisation.

I do not think that the invidual bobbies kne w what      to
do a-a-d X am not criticising, them as individuals.

After the acc ident I went   to stay with my parents    in


I found myself breaking out into tears very freque ntly and
could no.t bear to speak to anybody,

I could not read newspapers     or look at television and
I found sleep impossible,

I find it difficult to concentrate at work and suffer
from constant upsetting flashbacks of what I had seen
and heard.

On 20th April I went to the surgery of my parents Doctor
and saw a .Doctor    at

He prescribed sleeping tablets       for me which I have now used
up.

I still remain deeply shaken and disturbed by this accident
I feel a deep anger about all that has happened and I have
been told that it makes living with me very d i f f i c u l t , I
cannot say my anger is directed against any particular
person or body merely at the happening of this terrible
accident at a l l ,

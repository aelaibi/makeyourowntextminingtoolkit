familiar         with       the    ground.             I have      spectated          from all          parts      of the

ground,        except           in the West S t a n d             terraces,          over       the years.

I have w o r k e d          n u m erous       games       as a first aider                 at    the S h e f f i e l d

On Saturday               15th April          1989       <150489),           I was    present          at    the S h e f f i e l d

1 travelled               to the       game       in q u e s t i o n    by bus,       the       number       of which was            a

numbe r                                     and we        travelled           via the Hali f a x Rd to

Penistone            Rd     North.          During my jour n e y              to the       game,       I was

greater        number           of fans a b o u t ( mo re than a normal, game,                               and. 1 noticed

also     that        a great many             fans       were along           the    route,       a great        deal     of

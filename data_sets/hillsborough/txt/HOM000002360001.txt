S h e f f i e l d W e d n e s d a y F oo tball      Cl ub 's     g ro u nd   in H il ls bo ro ug h.      The    game

was    b e t w e e n Liv er po ol       F oo tb a ll   C lu b and N o t t i n g h a m Forest       F oo tb al l

Club.

I a sked       if they        needed any furt he r a ssistance,                     w hi ch they did,      so       I

volunteered            the services          of    both myself a n d

I left home            at about         11.30 am t o gether w i t h

                        I left at        this     time as       I was    to take                   o w o rk

prior      to going          to A rea H e a d q u a r t e r s    to    catch the m in i-bus        to the

ground.

O n my j o u r n e y t h ro u gh S h e f f i e l d       I saw about          fifty    cars   containing

f o o tball        s upporters       from both teams.                 I r ec og n is e d them because          of

their       scarves,         although      both sets of fans were w ea ri ng the same

colours        the      i ns ignia      is different.

I saw no evidence                 of d ri nk in g w i th i n these           vehicles,     whilst        passing

t hem     in h eavy traffic.

 I drop p e d                     off    at w ork      and as      I was     still    early   I drove a ro u n

the Moors            an d a r r i v e d at A r e a H e ad q ua r te r s      at about     12.30    pm.

At H e a d q u a r t e r s     I met     up w it h                           and a man    I know as

                        is a ls o a D i v is i on a l S u p e r i n t e n d e n t    of a different

 Div i s i o n .      Also     at H e a d q u a r t e r s was 1                            who was        loading

 his    car w i t h jumble           for a jumble          sale that          had been o r ga ni se d on

 behalf       of the B r ig ad e         later     the same        a f t e r n o o n so he was     not

 attending           the   football       match.

                         ,vas taking       one    of our two a mb ul a nc e s          to the ground and a<

 it    is a l l o w e d to       carry two        passengers,           I took the o p po rt un it y to

 travel       to the ground w i t h him                instead of w a it in g          for the mini-bus.

 We a r r i v e d at       the g ro un d at about               1 pm at w hi ch time        both            and

Ter ra ce s.         We s ig ne d        in the      a t t en d an c e R eg is t er and         I was given a

personal           radio.      One       radio      is    issued to each           corner       post    e na bling

contact        to be made             b e tw e e n e ach     post and the          first aid room,           which            i-

s i tu a te d b e ne a t h the N o r t h Stand.                    We were      posted w i t h two adult

n u rs in g members            but     I do not know their names.

In the first            ai d    room        I c he ck ed my first a i d bag and topped up my

w a te r   bottle,         t hen t og et he r wit h                       I went    out onto the side                  of

the    pitch to my             post.        By this         time     it was     about     1.20    pm.

At my      post      I can see to my                left the N o r th S t a nd w hi ch            is a seating

a r e a an d to my          right        is the       s ta nd in g     terr ac e   of Leppings          Lane a n d an

upper      seat in g       stand.           There     are    no     perimeter      fences       along    the N or t h

Stand      but a p erimeter                 fence     runs all along             he Leppings       Lane     t er ra ci n

which       has about          five      exit    gates       to allow          people    to get from the

t e r r a ci n g    onto    the side           of the       pitch.        At this       time,    the t erracing

was     sparsely        populated,.

At about           1.40 pm we were              jo in ed     by another Divis io na l             S u p e r i nt e nd e nt

                    L his wife an d three Cadets,                         w ho m I do not        know.      On being

 j oi ne d by these,            the two N u rs i n g             m e mb er s   stated they w ould move                 to

 the    corner       of L ep pings            Lan e a n d the S o ut h S t a n d where            other members

 they      knew were.           This        they did.

 A short        time      later,        a   radio        check was       c om pleted to     check that           the

 radios       were w o rk i ng          properly.           By     now   it was about 2 pm and               I

 co m me n te d to                             that       the S p i o n Ho p Ter ra ci ng was more               or         les

 full      of s p e c t a t o r s ,     but    that       the L ep pings Lane T e rr ac in g was                 still

 At about          2.30     pm whilst          looking at            the Leppings Lane Terracing,                       I

 could see           about      12 people           climbing         over a set of s e g r e ga t io n fencing

 from the a re a m a r k e d 4 on the m a p                        into A re a m ar k ed 5 and 6.                I

co m m e n t ed to             that we        could have          some    casualties      from that

position        if they were           not    careful       due    to the d es ig n of      the    railings

wi th the       protr ud in g metal           bars*        At   the same time,       I could see about

6 people        being     lifted       from the s ta nd i ng         area    into the      seating area,

I a s s u m e d that     t he y were         being    lifted       up by friends         to get a better

po si ti o n    to w a t c h the match.              At    this    time,    the areas m ar ke d 3 and 4

on the ma p were           b ec om in g      fuller       but    the y did not     seem full       to

capacity.         The     other areas          in L e p p i n g s Lane Terr ac e         were   stiLl         fairly

empty w h i c h       I f ou nd very unusual as                  it was    a big   game and n o r m al l y

the T e r r a c i n g   w o ul d be     ne ar ly full           at this    time.

At about        the same       time     I d i s c u s s e d <*,'ith A l a n a policy       p rocedure of

who w o u l d    go     into    the    crowd       if we were       required and who w ould               remain

on post.

At about 2 .40           pm I saw a S t e w a r d who was w e ar i ng              an orange       bib,

marked     up w it h the w or d Steward,                   come to the gate m a r k e d Number 6 on

the ma p       in Leppi ng .      i_ane T e r r a c i n g       and a llow a fan out.           T he y    came       u,

to us a n d the S t e w a r d          i nf or m ed us      that    the    fan had some grit             or

something        under     his     contact         lens and asked          us to assist.

                           the     fan,      who    I w o u l d describe      as a white male             in his

late    teens     about 5 ' 1 0 tall           with       light    brown hair      cut    part way over

his    ears,     wear in g an a n o r a k          style    coat,    in the    d ir e ct i on of the           firs'!

aid    room for treatment.

The S t e w a r d t hen a sked me             to direct          the fan t h ro ug h the        gate and

a long a p a ss a ge w ay        leading       to the seating a re a on his                return.            The

Steward        then wen t       back    into       the Stand.

I could see that               the S t e w a r d was       not mann in g     the gate,      but    there wert

about     six Police O f f i ce r s           along       the    fencing.

I did not        see a n y th i ng      else       h a pp en in g and at about        2. 4 5 the fan

re turned       from     r eceiving       t r ea tm en t    and    I d ir ected him back          into        the

T er ra ce s    be hi nd us       as   req ue st ed by the Steward.

I w 2 s stood at my                post      a nd just       looked a r o u n d    the    ground for a time,

but did not            see a ny th i ng         that was wrong.

At about          2*55      pm I looked a r o u n d           towards      the    goal are a at L ep pi n gs

L ane    end and saw                        b e ck on in g me wit h his          hand.     I b egan to walk

a long     the     track,       towards        him and        called t o _______ to follow me,                w hi c h

he did.           I was      looking         towards       the    crowd,       but did not detect          anythin

was wrong at             that      stage*

As    I reached the              gate m a r k e d 4 on the map,                 I could see that         it

a p p e ar e d    people were            p ushing      f or wa rd    from the back*             The fans at        the

front,       w h ic h were y oung              boys,      teenage       girls    and o lder      people,      were

pushed against               the    fencing         and    looked as       if they       c o u l d n ’t move.      I

could hear            the    older       people      shouting,          “Get them out,          get t hem out."

There was a            look      of terror and             fear     on all      the faces       that   I could se

A Police          O f fi ce r    at that        gate,     who     I can't       describe,       opened   the gate

and     it a p p e a r e d      that     the    force      being a p p l i e d    from somewhere         behind

pushed about             twenty fans            thro ug h the gate,             a Twer w hi ch    I believe        he

closed       it as       no more         came through*              I could hear a Police O f fi ce r

s ho u t i n g    towards        the     crowd,      "Get back,          get    back,"    but    I do not know

who*

As    they       came t h ro u g h the          gate      they    began to spread along the

t ra c k s id e     towards        one      post*

I went       up to a y oung              boy who       I would       describe       as a white male about

10 years          ol d w it h blonde            hair,      who    was    accompanied        by an older man,

who     st a te d he was           the      boy's    father.         I could see that he was               having

difficulty            bre at hi ng       but    had no visible            signs     of   injury*       I sat     him

down and e xa mi n ed              him.        I found       no signs      of    injury other than shock

a n d the        b r e a t h le s sn e ss    w h i c h was    caused      by being       crushed,      w h i ch was

re turning          to normal.

I r e- a ss u re d him and his father                        that there was          no need to w o rr y and

a s k e d one       of the Cadets              to take him to the First Aid Room so he                           caul

rest    for a short while.

I then went           to a ma n who was             sat on the       side    of the     pitch.       I a sk ed

him    if he was         alright.          He    said that     he was       having    d if fi c ul t y

b r e at h in g    and that         he had      p re vi o us l y had a heart attack.               I l oo sened

an y   light       c lo thing an d        checked him over           for a ny    injury and f ound              none

At this       time      he was       bre at hi ng    quite    n or ma l ly so    I wa lk ed him over             to

the    corner a n d sat             him on the s tr e tc h er w h i ch we         had     placed     there       on

taking       up our         post.

I would        describe         this m an as being w hi te male,                about 60 y ears           old

w i t h dark hair             b r us he d back w it h some      type of hair          dressing,          he was

very       thin about 5'6            tall,      clean s h av e n and     I believe        he was wear in g

an old suit           w h ic h was a dark           colour.     On checking          that     he was

breathing           c om f or t ab l y and was       in no danger,          I turned my a t t e n t i o n to

a young man who                I w o u l d d es cr i be as    being a white male age d a bout 20

y ea r s    of heavy build and                 clean shaven.         He was     sat d own on the           grass

of the       pilch near           to the       stretcher.      He    c om pl ai ne d of     pain    in his

right, ankle           so     I e xa mi n ed    this and     saw swelling        a ro u nd the      ankle and

I f or m e d the         o p in io n that       it was    fractured.

At this,           I d i r ec t ed                        'to fetch a w h e el c ha i r        from the

First       Ai d R o o m and t ra ns fe r         him there         for further      treatment.             It waj

 at this time            that       I r ea lised there were           about 30       people    on the       pitch

 b eh i n d me.        Most      of these were        s ta nd in g and a p p e a r e d w in d ed and         in

 shock.           I b egan to go aro un d            them to    check       on their    condition,

 o ff e r i ng     r e- as s ur a nc e   and drinks       of w ater     from my water          bottle       until

 it ran out.             It was at this stage                that    I realised that we w ould

 require          furt he r a s s i s t a n c e a n d fro m what       I had seen that we                could

 have      a lot of           crushing     injuries.

 I radi oe d the First                 A id R o o m an d ambu la nc e.        I said,       "Stand, by,      we

 have      s u s p e c te d    crush     i njuries    and we    need a s si s ta n ce . "      I believe          I

 got a      response,           but am not        sure.

                                                                                                               S761

I then gave a general                 assistance          call      to    inform the other            posts      that

we    r eq uired their            a ssistance.

The    people       I gave w at er         to an d e x a m i n e d at       this       time   I can only

d es cr i be    as being y oung            as    there was       such a large            number.

D ur i n g    the   time     I was    t re at in g      people,      I was aware          that    the     football

game     had s t ar te d from the               roar    of the      crowd,     but did not          see    any

football        being      played.         By the       time    I made      the    radio      call,     I would

e st im a te    it was       about 3 . 0 5       pm and     I realised         that      the game       had

s to pp ed     because       I could now see             large      numbers       of football         fans     on th*

pitch.
I could now see fans                 being       placed     on the        pitch by Police Officers,

Uj^ny of w hi ch were              lying     down.       I went a m on gs t        them checking           for

injuries,           that     they were       conscious,         had a pulse and were                breathing.

All    were     showing signs           of      being w i n d e d    so    I re— a s s u r e d them a n d        told

them     to take        deep      breaths.         I l oo sened tight          clothing and if             I

thought        it necessary,           I put      them     in'.o the       r ec overy        position.        Almost

all    had someone w it h them,                  so    I told those         to keep an eye on the

 injured and           call me       if their         c o nd it io n d et eriorated.            I t re at ed abou'

 t hi r t y    people      in this way and             can o nl y d es cr ib e         all    as being young.

 I can        recall    no other       d e s c r i p t i o n of them.        W he n my bottle           of water

 had become           empty,      I sent                ,o refill        it but    did not see          him again

 until        after    the    disaster.

 After        treating       about    t hi r ty fans,          I saw the      ambulance          come   onto     the

 pitch an d went             to     the a r e a beh in d the goal.                As    soon as     I arrived, a

 P o l i c e m a n who was          close       to me shouted,           "Have you got a Brookes                  Airway

 an d an y wire         cutters."           I said,       " I ’ll get      the Brookes           airway,       but we

 d o n ’t carry any           cutters."

 I ran to the a mb u la n ce               and     took the airway from there to the

 officer.           I c a n ’t      d es cr ib e this      offi ce r a nd      I did not         see what         he wa<

from anothe r comment.                   "We're    losing      this     one,     that    he was         giving

A lm o st     i m m e d i a t e l y after      this,    I saw a young man            I w o ul d describe           as

but found          none *        I then     chec ke d that his airway was                 clear     and began

and he b eg an           cardiac massage.               I f o l l ow e d his    counting.          We    continued

this    for a bout 5 minu te s                 but was      gett in g   no    response.          The Po li ce

O ff i ce r     then said,            "We're    gett in g    nowhere,        let's   put him on a

 the a m b u l a n c e a n d tol d the            staff     there     that we had a n ot he r           casualty

 dea d an d       I could do no thing              furt he r    for him.

 I returned to the                  pitch and f ou nd a lot more fans on the                        pitch,       agaiV

 them and         chec ke d for          injuries,       loose ne d     clothing and gave

 re-assurance.                  I t r ea t ed about 30 more           fans     in this way,         none of whit

late    teens     and of ver y slight                build.        I think    he had fair hair.              I

could see he was            u n co n s c i o u s a n d had no        colour    to his     face   it was

very white.            I c he ck ed for       a pulse        but    could find none,         whilst      the

sup po rt er    checked for          breathing.

We    then b egan to give            him m o u t h to m o u t h and          cardiac massage.            I was

doing    the    cardiac m a ss a ge whilst              he     did m ou th to mouth.           We did about

five minu te s         and the      s u pp or te r    a sked    if we    could      change    over.      I

a o r ppd and     I b egan to give            him m o u t h to mouth.            At the      first     breath,

fuid     t ri ck le d    out     of his mouth,            w h i c h smelt of alcohol,             w hen Igave

him the       second     breath,        I could taste that              it    was   beer.     This

pbout    a further         five minutes,             a w o ma n who     I would      describe    as white,

about 2 8 - 3 0 y ea rs        old wit h      long dark hair            came to us and stated                she

■vas a Doctor.           She     then took over           the       cardiac massage.          We then

carried on for about                f” .e minutes         after w hi ch time          she said,         There }

At this        time,     I saw that        there was          an a mb ulance     alo ng si de    us,    so    I

left    the     c as ua lt y    to be    loaded       into     the ambulance.

I then went         back to the L e p p i n g s Lane                end of the      pitch,    where     I agait

t re at ed fans who were              in shock        by loosening           clothing   and giving

 re-assurance.

At about 3 .50           pm my a t t e n t i o n was         d rawn by a Police O f fi ce r who              I

 3   q years    old,     b ro wn hair,        going          bald,    about 5 S tall.         I could        see

 that    he had a cut about              an    inch          long    to the back of his              head, this

 was    bleeding.

 I e xa mi n ed    it and d e ci de d that he                required t reatment          in the F ir st Aic

s ho ut in g    abuse       at him,      but      I do not       know e x ac tl y what was             said.         The

man w i t h me t ried to t urn to answer                         them back,          but   I a d vi s e d    him to

As we a r ri v ed at the F ir st                  Aid Room,        we were        d ir ec t ed   to the       gymnasi

As we a p r o a c h e d the gymnasium,                     I was a s k e d by some on e          possibly a

Steward        to    look    at a s u p p o r t e r who was            sat down against             the     g y m n as i u

walla       I went      to him and w o u l d d es cr i be                him as a white male,                 about

late     teens,        about 5'9 tall,               wit h a u bu r n hair.          He st at ed he felt

winded,        so I e x a m in e d him a nd could find no                         injuries.       I l oo se ne d

tight       clothing        and     r e - as s ur e d him.       I s t ay e d w it h him for a short

w hile    then w he n        I was      s a t i s f i e d he was alright,              I left     him.

It was       at this        point       I was     offered a drink            of     coffee,      w h i ch    I

ac cepted.           I then went          back       out onto      the    pitch.        I looked at my watc.

for the        first     time and saw             it was 4 . 0 5       pm.    I saw that the S p io n Kop

was    now empty of fans.                  I w al k ed back           to the L-*v;„ pings Lane              end,    when

there were           still       some    people        about.      I just     checked around and asked

if     people were alri gh t              a n d gave        r e -a s su r an c e w here     I could.             I did

not treat            any more       fans a fter this.

Once     the     pitch was          clear       of    people, I b eg an      collecting            blankets         and

 p r o p er t y a ro u nd the        pitch and             returned    it to the first aid                  room.           I

waited         until    e ve ry on e was          clear     of the ground,           w h ic h was about            6 pm

 at w h ic h time           I left      in one        of our ambulances.

 Du ri ng      the    incident,         I was        not a ware     of h o w people were             getting        onto

 the     r.i t c h because        I was     so       involved     in t re at in g      casualties.

             During      the w ho le       incident,        I could       not   really     c om pr e he n d or believe

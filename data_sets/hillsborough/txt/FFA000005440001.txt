 Dear Jo,
       Our current Handbook includes guidance to football clubs on
 the safety of spectators and the control of crowds at football
 matches (marked 1 and 2).
       Following the Fire and Safety of Places of Sport Act 1987,
 it is our intention in next season's Handbook to include the
 attached addition (marked 3).

       The current Handbook also includes the text of Form 'A' ,
 which clubs have to submit to The Football Association in
 pursuance of Rule 3 (marked 4). As a result of the above
 mentioned legislation, it is now our intention to replace Section
 9 with the attached (marked 5).

        I shall be very grateful for your views as to whether or
 not this is appropriate and acceptable in the current
 ci rcums tances.

                                                                          Yours sincerely




                                                                          Glen Klrton

HILLSBOROUGH REPORT

     As agreed I spoke informally by telephone on Monday 31 July,
1989, to Sir John Layden, Chairman of the South Yorkshire Police
Authority, at his home (     I     ) about the Lord Justice
Taylor's Report on the Hinscorougn Disaster. The Chairman was
willing to make himself available on the evening of Wednesday 2
August, 1989. During our conversation he said that the Police
Authority fully supported the South Yorkshire Police and had
complete confidence in the Chief Constable.

Following our later discussion with Sir Clive I spoke again with
Sir John and arranged a meeting in your office for 6.00pm on
2 August.

                Inspector WILLIS

                Hillsborough Inquiry Team



                Dear Mr WILLIS



                As promised,        this is a short resume of some^observations                I made during

                the Liverpool vs Notts Forest game at                                  in 1988-    I wrote a

S £ t~ \ I      lengthy feature article about this for the German weekly paper                       ’Die

                Z e i t ’ <Nr 17, 22 April 1988)           (220488).



                I went to Sheffield in a bus from Liverpool,                   which had been chartered

                by the Liverpool FC Supporters Club.                   The supporters were mostly very

                orderly,    sober,     quiet.     Along with - as I could make out - all other
                                                                            PAGE      2.
                                                                            S 3 151

buses, we were stopped before entering Sheffield.            Two Officers     came

aboard,      had a look through the bus, asking for tickets,       but not really

checking them.       They admonished us about a ban on alcohol       in the

stadium.       I got the impression they mainly had a good look for known

faces of tr oub le-makers.



The scene      changed quite dramatically near the stadium.        The following

is an extract from my articles



The pub,      "The Park", a few hundred yards above the stadium.        There

were two hours left before the start of the game.           The pub was

completely overflowing and the landlord locked the shutters            in front

of the doors.       People who didn't get in provided themselves with

canned beer,      fish and chips and chicken from a Fried Chicken

Restaurant.       Inside,   the singing and chanting of the fans seemed

nearly to burst the walls of the inn.          Outside,   the excluded turned

the forecourt in no time at all         into an absolute tip.   Crushed tins,

discarded chip bags,        chicken legs with just a bite taken out of ...

I ’ve never seen people who would piss all over the place in such

complete unconcern      ... What happened to my orderly companions from the

bus?   ...



Nevertheless,      the majority of the fans    is an utterly peaceful,

cheerful     crowd - at least as long as the Police acts as circumspectly

as it did in Sheffield.          Before the walls of the pub did burst,       ten

bobbies entered it, the crowd chanting,         "When the saints    come marching

in."    And,    "Bye bye baby,    goodbye," when they left shortly afterwards.

Then people started to leave the pub.          "They just turned the beer-

off," one fellow muttered - not without a hint of admiration            (for the

bobbies)      in his voice.    The anarchic streak in the Liverpudlian make""

                                                                                    S 3 151

    up (to which I had referred earlier),      did not get worked up at all

    about this action.      Quite the opposites   In this instance they proved

    their   longing for order and propriety ...



    The anorehie streak finds     in outlet on the terraces     ...



    The article now goes on to describe the swaying and pressing and

    heaving on the terraces and the blind devotion where individual action

    and responsibility is completely dissolved in the movement of the

    masses.



    I do, however,   recall a feeling outside the stadium as well as inside

    the stadium of permanently treading a tightrope.          At one point I noted

    down: The violent excesses     (like Heysel) appear just like the

    accidents of a high-risk human enterprise      ... but it is this risk and

    the tension which make football     in England so different        (from,       for

    instance Munich).

                                                                              ./)
    I felt the P o l ice behaved extremely disciplined and admirably settled

    and well mannered despite being abused and despite this f i l i n g              - this

    was my f ee 1 ing - that the re always was the poss ibl i    Ajr   the s ituat i on

    getting out of hand.     To put it this ways   11 w a s       t h ^ *"^

    psychologi cal skill of the Police that keptNarde^r.O ^ h e n       TJ heard       of

    this years disaster my reaction was most certbufnly not one of

    surprise.    1988 the Police was permanently engaged in diffusing

    potentially hazardous situations - despite the general            impression of a

    good humoured atmosphere.      They were engaged in an orderly defence.

    This,   of course,   cannot always work.



    I do not know whether these observations are of any value to you.                       But

          I thought I make them known - just in case.



         With best regards.



         Yours sincerely

             I am       a   schoolgirl              at                                                                   Sheffield*            but     I

             hold       a   part        time       job       with    Compass            Services         which    I have          held   for    the

             last       7-8       months,          as       a Silver          Service Waitress                 working       at   Sheffield

             Wednesday             football             ground       at       H illsborough.

             My      duties        on    match          days       are       usually      in   the       Riverside       Suite       which      .is

             situated             in    the     South          Stand.            This    Suite      on    Saturday       15th       A p r i l 1989

             <150489)              for       the    Liverpool                Nottingham        Forest          semi    final      match     was

             reserved             for    the       FA       Officials            and    guests.

             My      hours        of    work       for       that    date         were     10am~ 6pm(1000)-(1800).

             Within         the        Riverside             Suite       is a        television          situated       at    the    side      of     t he

             bar       that       was    showing             the    semi-final            m a t c h live        and I    was      aware     that

             the       match       started          on       time.

             I went         down        to    the       reception             lounge      within         the    same    building         where
                                                                                                                                                      PAGE
                                                                                                                                                      S714-

again        there          were       televisions                   showing          the       match          live.

As     we    prepared             the       reception                lounge          for    the       half          time       for       the

Officials              and    guests             I heard             on    the       television                that       there          had       been       a

pitch        invasion.                 I saw          on       the    television                screen          the       pictures               of    fans

climbing           over       the       barriers                at    Leppings             Ln    end       and       running             onto         the

pitch        some       appeared             to       be       staggering.

At     first       I didn't             take          much          notice       thinking             it       was    just          a    normal         pitch

invasion,              then       one       of    the          other       Waitresses             told          me    that          it       was

something              more       serious             than          that       because          she    had          seen       ambulances

arrive.            I decided                to    go       out       on    the       South       Stand          to    look          for       myself.             At

first        I    c o u l d n ’t s e e           at    all,          but       I was       aware       through             what          I heard

that        t h e re    were       lots          of    people             on    the    pitch.              1 walked             along            the    Stand

towards           the       Spi on      Kop       end          of    the       pitch       where       I       could       see          m o re

clearly.               At    this           point,          I was          close       to       the    p l a y e r s t u n n e 1.

I    looked        out       onto           the       pitch          and       saw    that       there          were a         great many

people           staggering             around.                 There          seemed       to    be       a    lot       of    people             actually

lying        on    the       pitch          with       Police             Officers          trying             to    resusitate                  them.

As     I    looked          over       towards             the       pens       at    Leppings             Ln       end    of       the       ground,             I

could        see       more       Police          Officers                in a       line,       helping             fans       over          the      top        of

t he       bar r iers        and       on    to       the       pitch.

There        were       no    loudspeaker                      announcements                to    the          public,          as       to      what       was

happening.                  The    only          one       I did          hear       were       asking          the        fans         to g e t       off

the        pitch.           Where           I stood            in     the      South        Stand          looking          out          on the        pitch

I was        surrounded                by    Nottingham                   Forest       fans,          who       obviously                d i d n ’t

realise           the       seriousness                of       the       incident.              They          seemed          to       be    fooling

about        and       one    had       to       be    restrained                by    his       colleagues                to       stop         him    going

onto        the    pitch.              I would             say       that       this       group       had          been       drinking               prior

to     entering             the    ground.                 I    could          smell       alcohol             on    them       and          their

behaviour              gave       me    that          impression.                I went          back          inside          to       the      Riverside

Suite        after          I had       seen          what          was    happening             outside.                 I returned                  outside
                                                                                                                                         PAGE
                                                                                                                                         S714

again       to    fetch       all       the      rest       of       the    catering                staff       inside       as    the

Management             requested             everyone            to    come          inside.

As    I got       outside          to      fetch       the       staff          in    everyone             was    requesting             water

for    the       injured        on      the      pitch.              I went          inside          and       reported          this    to    the

management             and    we      gattered             any       vessels          we       could       to    contain          water       and

took    it       outside        onto         the      pitch,          via       the    Riverside                Suite       onto       the    South

Stand.

As    I got       onto       the      pitch          I headed          towards             where          most    people          were       near

to    the    goal       posts         on     Leppings            Ln    so       that       we       could       leave       the    water       for

anyone       who       needed         it.        I    cannot          remember             who       I was       with       at    this       time,

I know       that       there         was       quite       a    few       of    us    from          the       Riverside          Suite

together.              We    l e ft     the      water          at    random          points          for       the    fans and

as    I walked          back       along         the       pitch       towards             the       South       Stand       I saw       a    group

of    about       3    or    4 youths            and       a Policeman                round          a youth          on    the    floor,          the

youth       was       white     and        in    his       early       20*s          and       had    been       stripped          down

to    his    boxer          shorts         (light          coloured)             and       a    8T 8 s h i r t .           The    Policeman

was    down       on    his     knees           trying          to    resuscitate                   the    youth       and       the    other

youths       were       watching             him,      they          appeared          to       be    friends          of    the       youth.           1

momentairly             stopped            with       another          girl          and       heard       the    Policeman             say    that

he    was    dead.           The      youths          were       distressed                on       learning          this       news.        (I

have    since          seen     pictures              of    this       youth          on       the    news       with       the    Policeman

and    the       youths       around            him).

On    seeing          this    happen            both       my    colleague             and          I were       very       upset       and    at

this    point          I think          it      really          came       home       to       me    what       was    happening.              It

was    chaotic          on    the       pitch,         nobody          knowing             really          what       to    do    or    where       to

go.     The       Police       were          still         helping          people             over       the    barriers          on    the

Leppings          Ln    end     on      to      the    pitch.

I made       my       way    back       to      the    South          Stand          and       was    helped          over       the    wall       by

the    Forest          fans.          The       South       Stand          fans       seemed          very       bewildered             and

shocked          as    to    what       was      happening             and       there          was       no    problems          with       the
                                                                                                                                             PAGE
                                                                                                                                             S714

crowds       behaviour.                 The    Spion       Hop       end       was    also       quiet          as       if    they          were

all    stunned             and    shocked.

I went       inside          the       Stand       again       for    more       water,          I have          no       first          aid

training          and       I felt       helpless          that       I    couldn't             help       the       injured             so    I

thought          if    I could          help       by    taking       water          I would          be       doing          something

useful.           Once       I got       inside          the    Stand          I became          very          upset,          but       I

realised          that       they       needed          more    water          outside          so    after          a    few       minutes,,             I

took       some       more       out    via    the       players          tunnel          again       onto       the          pitch.

As    I walked             towards       the       Leppings          Ln    end       with       the       water,          fans       from          that

end    started             running       towards          us    and       towards          the       Spion       Hop          end    and       the

Nottingham             Forest          fans.        It    seemed          quite       a    large          number,             I turned

round       to    see       why    they       were       running          towards          the       Spion       Kop          but    I       could

see    no    reason          and       they    suddenly          stopped             and    turned             back       towards

Leppings          L n.

I    could       see       there       was    large       number          of    ambulances                around          the       goal       mouth

obviously             ferrying          the    dead       and    injured             away       but       there          still       seemed           a

large       number          of    people       injured          and       dying       on    the       pitch          receiving

treatment             from       the    Police.

I made       my       way    back       to    the       South    Stand          after       leaving             the       water          on    the

pitch       and       as    I turned          round       I saw       the       Police          form       a    line          across          t he

pitch       to    keep       the       fans    apart.

I went       back          inside       the    Riverside             Suite       of       the    South          Stand          and       felt        so

distressed             at    the       sights       I had       seen       that       I    could          not    face          going          back

out    onto       the       pitch       again.

At    no    time       during          the    match       was    I threatened                   with       any       violence,                I did

not    witness             anything          which       I would          consider          to       be    a    Criminal             Offence.

I must       say       that       in    my    opinion          all    of       the    Nottingham                Forest          fans

behaved          well,       during          the    confusion             of    not       knowing          what          was    happening

they       remained          calm       and    did       not    cause          any    unnecessary                problems                for       the

Police       I did          not    witness          any    alcohol             being       brought             into       the       gorund           or

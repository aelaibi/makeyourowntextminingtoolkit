    stayed with the 2 13 year oids.           A number of people came out of the
  terrace onto the pitch, as if fighting had broken out, and perhaps they
  »ere being moored to the wings, as on previous occasions.         Several people
  seemed shocked and distressed.        A number of them sat at the corner of the
  pitch on and around        the stretcher.   A policeman was stood near the a
 younger cadets.      He     was attempting to guide the fans into the wing.

 A boy of perhaps 12         washelped towards me.    He was crying and seemed    to
 be in quite a lot of pain in his ribs.           Supporting him by his arms we
 steadily walked to the first aid room, where I left him in the care of
            and

 I immediately returned to the pitch to find many people on it.           I walked
 along trying to see whether anyone needed assistance.          A young woman sat
 amongst many othew, with her back to the hoarding.           She appeared quite

 distressed.        a cadet went to the woman. She told him she was
 hyper-ventilating.    □ □    took over with the man and I went back to the
woman.   She asked for a plastic bag, which I gave to her.          She was able
to hold the bag over her nose and mouth.           I stayed with her long enough
to see her begin to improve.         I left her to attend a man lying on the
grass.   He was conscious and laid in the recovery position.          He appeared
to need a stretcher.       As I looked around I saw one close by, but as I
tried to organise the spectators to help lift him other spectators ran
up with another man in their arms and laid him on the stretcher.           I
quickly noticed severe bruising to the left side of his abdomen.           He was
conscious but in great pain.        He had been placed on the stretcher on his
left side.   A spectator was left with the other man.         I got spectators
to help push the stretcher and went round with him to the ambulance room.

On arriving there I found it very busy with blankets laid on the floor and
people laid on them.

the rest of my time checking the men/boys laid on the floor, trying to
ensure that they were not deteriorating.          All were resting in the most
appropriate position, awaiting removal to hospital on a priority basis.

           I am the mother of          drew DEVINE,    b                              who was

           i njured in the Hillsborough disaster on Saturday 13th April                   1989.

           (150489).

           On Tuesday 26th October        1989 (261089) WPS 7 8 4 4 -APPLETON of the West

           Midlantis Police visited me at my home address and returned to me a

           hijack leather jacket which I am able to pb^itively identify as
                 \                \oV>                       \
           be 1 onqroq to my son A n d r e w . In the pocket of\the jacket there were

           f ourXswiz*g 1 e * 1 oI ly-pops .   Andrew used to get them at the Cabin

           Nightclub in Liverpool and I bel i eve he went with his gsirl friend

           on the Friday night before this incident-            There were a i s \ two packel

           of^Reglfl cigarettes in the pocket and t h e s e ^ a h ^ the brand that

           Andrew srnoked.        There was a^’ptacket of matches, a clipper          lighter and
                                                                                               PAGE    2
                                                                                               S3454

               I also received a pair of Adidas training shoes             < ref S T D / 2 ) (Exh

               No        ) which I believe belonged to Andrew.

               The shoes are the ones that were returned to Inspector SMITH of the

               West Midlands Police on 25.5.89           (250589) we 11 at least the right

               one is.

               Originally we thought Andrew was wearing a burgundy woollen ju mp er ,

               I have since found that and I am now unsure what jumper if any he

               would have been wearing.
           ■
               The only other thing m i ^ \ n g       is a turquoise   casual T shirt,     like

4-c? W j       a Fred Perry shirt.

               F ron^ftty own enq uiries I have found out that Andrew was standi ng next

               to                     in the pen.     I believe that       has made a statement
                                                                                  ovT,
               to the West Midlands Poli             Andrew is still detained in Walton

               Hospital, C a i r n s > ^ r d .   He is still

               poorly but is^s^owing some signs of improvement but only slight.

               At the moment Andrew has a chest infection.

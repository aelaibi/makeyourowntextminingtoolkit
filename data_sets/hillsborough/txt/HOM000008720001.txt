Police authority members resign over chief
 By Lisa Bratby
 THREE members of the M ersey­
 side   Police   Authority   have
 resigned in protest at the new
 chief constable's links with the
 Hillsborough disaster.
     Councillors Frank Prendergast
 and Dave M artin, both members
 o f the board which appointed
 W est Yorkshire ACC Norm an Bet­
 tison, said they did not know of
 his association with the tragedy
 and believe he should have made
 his role known during the inter­
 view process.
    The third m em ber to resign,
 Councillor Stephen Foulkes, was
 not a member of the appointment
 panel, but also said M r Bettison
 should have told the authority
 about his role in the afterm ath of
 the tragedy. All three have called
 for M r Bettison's resignation.

 AFTER THE MATCH WAS STOPPED?

 AFTER I HAD CLIMBED OVER INTO PEN 2, I SAW ONE FAN AND A POLICEMAN GO TO THE

 REFEREE AND THE GAME STOPPED.     THEN THERE WAS A MASS OF PEOPLE CLIMBING

 OVER THE FENCING ONTO THE PITCH SIDE.      I SAW A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

 CARRIED OUT OF THE PENS AND PLACED ON THE PITCH.      THEY JUST LAY ON THE PITCH

 NO MEDICAL ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE M , THEY Wp?RE UNCONSCIOUS.    THE POLICE

 INITIALLY DID NOTHING EVEN THOUGH THE FANS WERE SHOUTING THAT THERE WERE

 PEOPLE SERIOUSLY INJURED IN PEN 3.      SOME OF THE POLICEMEN JUST STOOD THERE

 FORMING A LINE ALONG THE PITCH.      IT APPEARED THAT ALL THE POLICEMAN

 WANTED TO DO WAS TO KEEP BACK THE FANS IN THE PEN.       I SAW A YOUNG LAD

  ..ACED ON A STRETCHER, HE WAS UNCONSCIOUS, P0LICEMEN WERE WALKING PAST

*HIM IGNORING HIM.    THE POLICEMEN ON THE PITCH SEEMED TO BE UNAWARE OF

 THE SEVERITY OF THE SITUATION.                  ^ ^                   COMK^Ai'/

 THE POLICEMEN WERE RELUCTANT TO OPEN THE GATES IN THE FENCE TO RELIEVE

 THE PRESSURE AND LET FANS OUT.    THE ATTITUDE OF THE POLICE WHEN FANS

 APPROACHED THEM WITH QUERIES WAS ABRUPT^ AND IMPOLITE.

 I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I SAW FANS AND THE EMERGENCY SERVICES

 RESUSCITATING PEOPLE WHO WERE LYING ON THE PITCH.

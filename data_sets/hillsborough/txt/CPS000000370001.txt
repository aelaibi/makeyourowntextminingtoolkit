      Dear Mr Metcalf

      HtUsbarouah Prosecution

      Than!* you for your letter of 16 July 1998 on the above subject.

      I agree with your recommendation at paragraph 4: please write to Leather Watts on behalf
      of the Chief Constable and tell them that we will take no action until we know the result of
      the CPS review.

      i agree with your recommendation at paragraph 5: please write to Mr Croston and ask him
      to advise when the review has been completed and its outcome.

      On Saturday 18 July 1998 David Duckenfield advised me that he had just received a
      further summons through the post. It was issued by Leeds Magistrates Court on Monday
      13 July and is returnable on 20 August. It is for the same offences as before but with
      slightly amended wording.

      Yours sincerely




      Assis .ant Chief Constable

        Further to my statement dated 10th August 1989 (100889) I would like

        to add that today I have been shown various photographs and video

        tapes relating to the Hillsborough enquiry by                and 1        ^

        of the West Midlands Police.

        On a photograph ref no PR4/A/27 (Exhibit No           ) I can be seen

        running across the pitch pulling a cot together with a Policeman and a

        fan.    I now know that the patient on the cot is the deceased Lee NICOL

        (95) whom I refer to in my original statement as an 8-10 yr old youth.

        I also refer to a 25 yr old youth whom I transported to the

        Hallamshire Hospital together with a Doctor and a Derbyshire

        Ambulanceman.    I have viewed a video tape ref no MAP 9 and at a point

        06.09.13 and a point 06.24.12 showing a facial shot and a view from

        the back of the deceased Carl James LEWIS (85) I am able to identify

        LEWIS as being this male.       I have also viewed a video tape ref no JB1

        and at a point timed (real time) 0015 LEWIS can be seen lying on the

        pavament next to some bushes being tended to by the Derbyshire

        ambulanceman with the white hard hat on, I can identify this

        Further to my previous statement of 5th May 1989 (050589), concerning

        my duties on Saturday 15th April 1989, (150489), the day of the

        football disaster at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield I wish to add

        the following points about my recollections of the 3 patients I

        transported from the football ground to hospitals.

        I was working in emergency vehicle call number Sierra 209, accompanied

        by           '

        About 1515 hrs (1515) on 15.4.89 (150489), I was on the pitch of

        Hillsborough Stadium, at the     goal area at the Leppings Lane end of the

        ground.    On the pitch to the   left of the goal area asyou looked at

        the terrace, about 15 yards from the goal I saw a young boy lying on

        his back, he had a doctor I don't know who, working on him.     This boy

        was blue coloured, I would describe him as a white boy aged 8-10

        years, he had on jogging bottoms,     elasticated waist Ithink they were

        black, but I'm not sure.    He   also wore a top, I thinkan anorak type

        top, I can't remember the colour he had on a red and white football

        scarf.     I believe he had on a pair of trainers.   He vcmited quite a

        bit.     I believe he was the first casualty received at a Sheffield
FLA UK                  JOHN   KEVIN


Hosoital from the football ground.

We ronveyed him to the Northern General Hospital.

Last Saturday the 5th August 1989 (050889), I saw a photograph in that

days edition of the Sheffield Star of myself on the football pitch.             I

am wheeling a trolley and this boy is the patient on the trolley.           I

am pictured running to the ambulance in this photograph. I ran so that

I cDuld continue my resuscitation on the boy as quickly as possible.

               and I returned to the football ground in our ambulance.

Ones inside the ground on foot a fireman approached me, he told me he

was working on a man about 18 years old, and that they were getting

some response, I went over to some firemen who were in the area

outside the gym, below a stand.        The firemen had a casualty who was

still warm he was lying on his back he was being given oxygen, I would

describe this casualty as a white man, 18 to 20 years clean shaven, I

can't remember his clothing, he had his shirt open on his chest.        I

could not find a pulse on this man.              and I conveyed this man to

the Northern General Hospital, I worked on this man on the journey and

David drove.

On arrival at the Northern General we were met by a Doctor he met us

at the casualty doors.    The Doctor placed his stethoscope on this

patient he examined him and instructed me to place him in the plaster

roo.Ti, which was to be used as a temporary mortuary.     When we delivered

this man to the plaster room, I saw the young boy that we had first

brought to the Hospital also in this temporary mortuary.

There was a bearded policeman in there.       He was upset, in tears, he •

had been working on a young lad aged about 13 years, and this lad was

also in the temporary mortuary.

Again                and I returned to the ground, where a policeman

approached me to tell me there was a doctor and patient ready for
FLA IK                 JOHN   KEVIN


moving to hospital.

This patient was at the rear of the south stand.    There was a lot of

bodies in this area all covered up.   The patient had a drip in his

arm, and an intubation tube in his trachea, which I understand had

been put there by a Derbyshire ambulance from Heath Station,

Derbyshire, who was on duty in uniform I don't know the ambulanceman

or the Doctors name.

I would describe this patient as a white male, aged about 25 years,

about 6' (6'0) tall, a stockily built man.   He was clean shaven I

can't describe his clothing.          irove us in the ambulance to the

Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, the Doctor and I and the    ^ r
        *‘ f- .. o
Derbyshire Ambulanceman all worked on this patient on the journey to

the hospital.

This man had a good colour, we handed him over to the casualty

department at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

On returning the trolly to the ambulance I found a mans wristwatch on

the trolley which I handed into the Royal Hallamshire staff.   There

was a couple of coats that had possibly been placed under the heads of

patients in the ambulance and our control instructed us to hand

these in at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital and this is what we did.

I did return to the ground, but did not have any further dealings with

casualties as the area was now pretty well cleared we had a de­

briefing at the ground and returned to our depot.

OCCUPATION: AMBO OFFICER PARKWAY



           1.            I JCWN FLACK will say:    I was born on

                         I am a leading ambulance man and have been with SYMAS for
           2.
                         21 years.   I have been a leading ambulance man for 11

                         years.   Before that I was a qualified ambulance man.     I have

                         worked at Corporation Street, Bataroor and Parkway.

                         Thursday was my day off and on Friday I v«rked from 1400
           3.
                         hours (1400) to 2200 (2200) hours.

                         On Saturday I was to work 1400 hours (1400)to 2200 hours

                          (2200) as well.   I have worked on semi-final day

                          before but have never had to visit the ground except as a

                          spectator quite a few years ago.

            4.            My driver was                            called at 1410 hDUrS
                          (1410) to the Merry Monk Pub where an old man was having

                          problems breathing,     we took him to Northern General casualty

                          unit.   We called control to say that we were clear at about

                          15.05 hours (1505).     We were using channel 2 which is the

                          ordinary emergency ^annol
                                             channel,     We were xn
                                                          we were in a
                                                                     a front line accident

                          emergency vehicle call number Sierra 209.

                           Shortly after this we received a message that there had been

                           an incident at Hillsborough.    I believe that Mr. CLARKE was

                           the control officer.    No details were given except that we

                           were told to go to Hillsborough, Penistone Road entrance.

                           We travelled down Herries Road which is about one and a half
FLAZK               JOHN                                                    2


        to two miles with the blue light on.     It took us no more

        than three minutes to get to the junction of Penistone Road

        and Herries Road south.     There was chaos with public

        vehicles and police vehicles everywhere. We were directed

        across the junction by the police to the entrance with the

        sliding gates which I think is the first entrance.        There

        were no problems with being directed across by the police.

        We got through the gate and saw Station Officer EASON

        frantically waving to us.     I got out of the vehicle and told

        the driver to stay with the vehicle.    Another ambulance was

        already there.     I think that thus was the ambulance which

        had been there from the start.     Otherwise I think that we

        were the first ambulance to arrive on site and get into the

        ground.   I went up to EASON and he asked for a cot to be

        taken out of his ambulance.     He said that there had been a

        bit of a crush and that a young boy had been crushed and

        stopped breathing.     At this time we were all unaware of the

        extent of the situation.     We removed the cot and made our

        way by foot onto the pitch.     It was now about 1515 hours

        (1515).   The game had stopped and there were no players in

        sight.    There were a few people on the pitch.   We went

        diagonally across the pitch towards the west stand.        We did

        not come across any other ambulance men.     We reached the boy

        who was lying in the goal area with a few people around him.

        A police man was giving mouth to mouth resuscitation and a

        man was giving cardiac compression.     I assume that he was a

        doctor from the way that he was talking.     The doctor said

         that the boy had a good chance of surviving.     We then put

         the boy on to the cot and ran back across the pitch to the




                                                                                43
FLAZK                JOHN                                                 J


        ambulance.    While we were tending to the child we could see

        people behind the fence climbing on top of each other but at

        that point the boy appeared to be the worse casualty and we

        did not see anyone else laid out on the pitch.     I was really

        just concentrating on the boy rather than the crowd.

6.      We got to our ambulance which by this tune was coming down

        onto the pitch.     We opened the doors and took one of our

        cots out so that we could get the cot with the boy onto the

        ambulance.    I jumped into the back of the ambulance and

        started resuscitation and put an airway into the boy s

        mouth.   The police officer was doing cardiac massage.      EASON

        was in our vehicle and he got onto the radio and informed

        casualty at Northern General of the condition of the child.

        We then turned the vehicle round and went back out.      It was

        a tight fit to get off the pitch but there were no other

        ambulances trying to get in while we were trying to get out.

         I was working on the child and so I could not see what the

         situation was in the yard.    I do not know what time it was

        when we got back to Northern General. The driver radioed

         when we arrived at Northern General. We were still on

         channel 2 at this stage.

 7.
         At Northern General I spoke to a doctor and he asked whether

         there was likely to be more casualties.     I said that it was

         serious but I could not say how many more would be caning

         u{>.
         I told the driver to clean the suction equipment as soon as

         possible so that we would be ready for off.     We were about

         three or four minutes in the hospital and then we loaded the

         vehicle again and radioed to say that we were clear at




                                                                              44
FLA IK                JOHN                                                   4


         Northern General and ready to go back to the ground if

         required.    I was then told to switch to ERC.      I was told to

         return to the ground at the Penistone Road entrance.       We had

         a quick trip back down Herries Road south and a police

         officer directed us across the junction.       We went through

         the first entrance and back into the yard.       There were a few

         ambulances going up Herries Road as we were coming down.

         There was still a lot of confusion at the ground as we

         pulled into the yard.    I got out and told the driver to stay

         with the vehicle.    There were bodies around that area and

         police officers walking about.       I spoke to an inspector and

         asked where our casualty clearing point was and where our

         senior officer was.     He did not know.     At this stage I did

         not realise that the casualty clearing point was in the gym.

         I was not aware of any Hillsborough plan prior to this

         emergency.

         I then saw                                        from Rotherham

         station on foot.     I then tried to radio through to control

         to find out the casualty clearing location but could not get

         through as there was interference on the radio in the

         vehicle.     At this point there were fans grabbing me and

         asking me to help.    Then a fireman came up to me and said

         that they were resuscitating an 18 year old boy and were

         getting some response.     I went over to the boy who was

         nearby in the gym yard area.     There were people lying nearby-

          on boards who appeared to be dead.      I went over and looked

          at the boy.    He was still warm.    I went back to the

          ambulance and got out a cot.    I called the driver and we

          loaded the boy onto the ambulance.        I shouted to the fireman

         to see if there were any others that we could load quickly

         as we needed to rrcve the boy as soon as possible.                  There did

         not appear to be any walking wounded about who wanted to

         ccme with us.        As   we had one stretcher case already on the

         ambulance we could only take slightly injured people because

         of the room.        It took us about 2 minutes to get the

         stretcher on to the vehicle and I then gave the order to the

         driver to set off.          I   did not see a senior officer and I

         made the decision to go myself.              We were going up to the

         Northern General.          My driver tried to radio to say that he

          was   leaving     the scene but I do not know whether he got

          through or not.          Again I was working on the patient on the

          trip   up   and   so did not follow the route to the hospital.               It

          did not seem to take long.
  10.     we got to the Northern General and were met by a doctor.                     He

          said that there was no hops for the toy and he told us to

           take him to the plaster roan which was a temporary mortuary.

           The doctor asked me to tell control that it was getting too

           busy at Northern General and that he wanted casualties to be

           taken to the Hallamshire.             I radioed control and gave the

           all clear.        There was no problem in getting through this

           tiIne. I was told to go back to the ground.                 I asked where

           the casualty clearing point was.             There was a pause and then

            I was told to go to lappings Lane end.             Bay CLARKE was at

            control.        I think he was telling me where      t o   g o   and   I do not

            think he knew where the casualty clearing point was.

   u .      we went down the M i n Herries Road to the roundabout and

            then round onto Leppings Lane.             The police were on every

             junction directing          us   and we were not held up at all.         I




                                                                                              46

          have no idea what time it was when we got to lappings lane.

          There was some delay around the gates because of the amount

          of people around.              It was bedlam when we parked with fans

          and police everywhere.               There were about three ambulances in

          front of us on the road.               I saw Leading Ambulance Man

          from Maltby and asked him where the casualty clearing point

          was as I thought that control had told us it was in lappings

          Lane.     He said that he did not know but that the vehicles in

          front were being loaded and would be moving shortly.                     I

          tried to find an officer in charge but could not see one.

          Then a police inspector can* up to me and asked me to take a

           young   b o y   and    his dead father because the boy would not

           leave his father.             The toy was not injured.      I said that I

           could not move dead bodies and              as   the boy was not injured he

           had no priority.
           The vehicles started to nove up.                 B u s was about five
  12.
           minutes after we had arrived at I c i n g s lane.              Then another

            police officer came and said there was a doctor and patient

            ready for noring.             I went up to the doctor who had a drip in

            the patient's a * .            A Derbyshire ambulanceman who was

            separated frcm his colleague and had been advanced trained

            helped with the loading of the cot on to our antoulance.

            There was a lot of equipment with the patient and so we did

            not look for any nor* patients to take with us.                 We managed

            to get out onto Penistone Road which took about three or

             four minutes.           I   was   in the back assisting the doctor who

             told    us    to go to Hallamshire because he had worked there

             before and understood that Northern General was quite full.

             I „as not aware of the journey because I was helping in the
    13.




                                                                                         47

          back.   I think it took about 7 minutes to get to the

          Hallamshire.

14.       We unloaded the patient and handed.him over to casualty.           I

          then radioed clear and was told by control to go back to

          Leppings Lane.     I   still assumed that Leppings Lane was the

         casualty clearing point.        We had a quick journey back down

         which took about 7 minutes.        We went around to just outside

         the gate and the doctor got out to see who he could help.

         The Derbyshire ambulance man stayed with us.        I radioed to

         control again to ask where the casualty clearing point was.

         I was then directed to the Herries Road bus depot to stand

         by.   We were able to turn round and go back ujTLeppings Lane

         and along Herries Road where we met Station Officer EASON.

         He told us to park in the driveway to the depot.        All

         drivers remained in their vehicles and I liaised with EASON.

         We were there about 30 to 45 minutes and then heard control

         sending all West Yorkshire vehicles back to base.        We left

         the Derbyshire man and his colleague with his equipment at

         the bus depot.    All South Yorkshire vehicles were then

         instructed to go to the Penistone Road entrance.       We went

         right up to the side of the gym where we were met by

                                 We parked the vehicles and he then called

         us together for a briefing.       There were probably about 20 of

         us.   He split us into groups of those on the various duties

         and those who were off duty but had been called in.       He then

         directed us back to the station.       We got back to the station

         at about 1800 (1800) hours, cleaned our vehicle and

         completed our shift.

I transferred to 'F' Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

(Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As   a preliminary     to the event I received an overview of the planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1989.

I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April 1989-

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

9.^5 a.m.     I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

in front of the Special Constables.

It appeared to me that attention to detail was evident in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                 He impressed that

officers     must   act   in a professional    manner which would reflect credit on

South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a microphone

 and amplifier.

 This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

 I was     again    impressed with   the   standard    of briefing,    again attention       to

 detail such as the evacuation procedures and officers being aware of their

 indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality..

 I   particularly     recall   him   saying,   "We    have   fully   tried   the   evacuation

 procedures twice this season, the first time was good, the second time was
                                                              -   2-




    excellence;      if we        are   required to           impliment            evacuation today,       it must be

    excellent."

    This    briefing        was    followed         by   an       up     to       date    intelligence    report     from

    Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

    Finally,    Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios,                                         issue and

    mealing arrangements.

    It was     stressed          that   all   officers must                  be   on their      respective   points    by

    11.15 a.m.

    After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until
A
    later     into    the    operation        so I left                the    stadium      to return to my private

    vehicle.        I was approached on three separate occasions in Penistone Road and

    asked if I       had any tickets to sell.

    There were       a lot of people around first sitting on walls in                                 groups.

     I went    to    my vehicle          and drove       to Hammerton                Road Police      Station where         I

     carried out some outstanding clerical work.

     I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

     Station,       when     a    police      car    offered            me    a    lift    to   the   ground.      This     I

     accepted.

^    I saw Policewoman             Smith and another                   officer       outside Threshers       near Holme

     Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

     I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

     officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

     I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

     and not in uniform.

     All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

      at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

      By Hillsborough Park I saw a group of people sitting around,                                           there was a

      white plastic carrier bag with them and                                 the outline of cans could be seen.
                                                      -3-



The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were six men and they were joking about                            having to drink the            lot as

they would not be allowed to take them into the                          ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By Leppings   Lane    gates    were        few supporters,          road clear,          plenty of Police

officers evident.

I went   to   the   barrier        at    Leppings      Lane/Vere         Road    where    I    spoke to    'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and                          Drury.       A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I then walked       past   Leppings            Lane   gates   and    came       to   barriers     and   Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                                   There were no

other people near this area.                     I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell      the necessity              to provide    a sterile             area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I continued along the road being the South Stand past                                  the T.V.    unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

I produced my warrant         card,        but I was known to one officer who I did not

know.

I went down and along Penistone                  Road which was busy.

I walked towards Parkside Road                   and I was against the flow of people, it was

very busy.

I   stopped   and   spoke     to    Police        Constable      Vallance        from    'A'    Division    and

Police Constable                        from    'A'   Division      at   separate points but due             to

 enquiries and sheer numbers of persons it was prudent to move on, as they

 needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

 I returned to rear of South Stand.

 About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

 There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
                                                -4-



awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

-    "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the Nottingham Forest team coach arrived. The                          procedure was

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this area and returned to Penistone Road                        as I intended to use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I     would have expected.        At that time about                 one hour to kick off.

I     knew there was       a Liverpool train due at                  Wadsley Bridge around 2.05p.m.

but decided to go into the ground.

I went to the main sliding gate and produced my warrant                           cardand a special

card     issued    to me    by Superintendent Murray.                Both were fully checked        and

examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

 I was assured no unauthorised person would                          gain entry at that gate.

 I went down onto the perimeter track and was immediately surprised by                              how

 full the Spion Kop was.           I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

 I made my way to the Police Control box.

 Inspector      Sewell     had   alerted   me   to    the     fact   that    inside   there   was   only

    limited space.       I intended to visit, see it operated and leave if I was in

    the way.

    I wanted    to see     the Control     point     as   I was at Doncaster Rovers when the

    camera equipment was first installed and operated at the beginning of the.

    present    season.     The   engineer was        always    quoting      the   Sheffield Wednesday

    system as being excellent and holding the system as the way all grounds
                                                      -5-



    should operate.

    On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

    at    the    front    and    Police     Constable    Bichard       at    the   rear   by   the     camera

    operating controls.

    I was       informed by Police         Sergeant   Goddard        that   Superintendent     Murray had

    gone    to speak to the referee so I sat on his                     seat and was       offered a      hot

    drink.       It didn't appear         particularly busy and quite clearly everything                  was

    under control.

    Assistant      Chief    Constable       (Operations)       Mr.    Jackson      came   to   the    control

^   point, he was in civilian clothing.

    I    saw    through    the    control    room     window    Superintendent        Murray     and    Chief

    Superintendent Duckenfield,             in uniform, walking along the track.                     They came

    through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and                        entered the control room.

    I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

    I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

    I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

    On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had                        a lot of space, the Notts

    Forest parts I could see               on the South Stand and             the Spion Kop were quite

     full.

     I recall Chief Superintendent Duckenfield commenting about                            there being no

     entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

     I remember when            I was   a child     there   always      being a band playing by            the

     players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

     Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

     a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                                When

     I looked the person was jiggling around.                    I remember thinking how empty the

     area around this youth was.                Police Constable            Bichard operated the camera

        and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super
facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was aware         the area in Leppings Lane                   behind the goal was              filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was    then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

up.    As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                          The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                              All was good humoured.

The    area behind the goal at Leppings Lane was getting full but                                         there was

space at the front.              People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

Approx 2.30 p.m.

I     looked   on    the   left monitor         and       was    aware    there     seemed       a    build     up   of

supporters.

I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

necessary      segregation        of fans,          access      to the North Stand,              which had been

allocated      to    Liverpool         supporters,         could       only    be   done    by       Leppings    Lane

entrances, this meant              that       the    entrances         on Penistone        Road      to   the   stand

which would normally be used were unavailable.

This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

 I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

 fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

 People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

 An     engineer     came       into    the     room      to     try     and    improve     transmission             and

 reception.

 I    remember      him    in   blue    under       the    control       room   bench,      I    thought        it was

 crowded as Police Sergeant Goddeard was walking round/over him.
                                             -7-



I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was.

I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the closure of Leppings Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                         It was not

extraordinary.        I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception,                the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                         The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 p.m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on the screen.           Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

 team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

 to assist officers outside.

 Around    this   time    a radio message was      relayed   requesting       the   gates   to be

 opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

 I remember thinking, you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

 is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

 and may     create      a difficult   public   order   situation      for   Police    inside    the

 ground.

 The     gates    were    not   authorised   to    be   opened    by    Chief    Sueprintendent

 Duckenfield at this time.

 I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

 be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the
Police Control.

It occurred     that some Liverpool supporters were        leving it late      but people

often enter     after the start of many games.

About this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to the controllers.      I then saw the gates displayed on the camera which I

believe   are    the concertina gates   on   the   service road   to therear      of   the

South Stand     open and a surge of people rush intothe ground.             Isaid,     'The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.      It seemed control was regained with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the g ate.

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent Marshall again requests         the gates   to be opened.       This is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

I can see by the players tunnel a semi         circle of photographers awaiting the

arrival of the two teams.

It seems the Superintendent will have to try and prevent the start of the

game as the fans will not all get in but I thought there is no way anyone

can get to the referee or team managers to do this at this late stage.                 As I

was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.             I've no idea which

 team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

 I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

 At   this point Superintendent Marshall       requested    the gates   to be opened as

 there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in               the crush

 if they were not opened.

 There was still room on the terrace under the control.            The South Stand was

 much fuller but not full.
Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was evident there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect - If there’s likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent Murray gave the general instruction over the radio to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.   The play was

at the Penistone Road end.

I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

 Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as directed

 but then stopping and standing watching the game.

 A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was space

 but did not open it.

 I thought she probably didn’t have a radio or handn't sensed that she must

 open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

 I began to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of the

 control point, through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got

 the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.     More

 and more were coming onto the track, I was ushering them to the open gate

 and the Policewoman assisted.
I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I    could   see   people   pushed   up   against   the   fence   but   not   aware   of   any

particular problems or injuries as there is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run to control        but by the uncovered seats I meet          Superintendent Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.             We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

Terrace.

I think it is a public order situation.

As they are Liverpool supporters,            I run onto the playing area and protect

Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

 When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

    people spilling onto the playing area.          There is quite clearly in my mind a

    major public   order    situation which will     need   a large uniform presence         to

    control.

    I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

    There is nothing I can usefully do in a public oder context so I decide to
return to the Police Control point.

En   route     I am passed         by    uniformed       reinforcements     as I    pass    through    the

uncovered seating.

On   re-entering         control    room    I    learn    that persons aresuspected           of being

in jured.

An   ambulance      is    called    for    and    quickly    arrives    behind the         Leppings    Lane

goal.

A message      is relayed to Police control that many people                        are     injured.     As

they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides to call

out Casualty Bureau staff.

I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson, to call for uhief

Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

I've    no accurate        assessment       of time,      but this call should be recorded on

tape    in Force Control.               Coins    or other     items   are   being    thrown at Police

Control      in large numbers.             In view of the situation unfolding,                  Operation

Support' is authorised.

All available personnel are deployed in area.

 I   suggest    I   go     to   Hammerton        Road    Police   Station    and    receive     Operation

 Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground Control.

 I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

 I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

 in a marked Police car.                He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

 I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Commander.

 Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific areas in

 makeshift serials.

 I remain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

 enquiry room.
Relatives and calls are all being dealt with from Hammerton Road.

At   this   stage   there   is   little   further which   is   of benefit   regarding   the

series of events under review.

Subsequent    actions   by myself     involve reception and sympathetic welfare          of

distressed relatives.

Liaison with Social Services and other support agencies.

Setting up of HOLMES incident room.

All non contentious but essential facilities to assist officers at scene.

I did not directly handle any injured or dead bodies.
CHIEF INSPECTOR MCROBBIE                                                                R125



I transferred to *F ' Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

(Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As    a preliminary to the event I received an overview of the planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1989.

I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April I98 9.

On Saturday 15 April 1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

9.45 a.m.     I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

in front of the Special Constables.

It appeared to me that attention to detail was evident in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                 He impressed that

officers must       act   in a professional manner which would reflect credit on

South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a microphone

and amplifier.

This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

I was    again   impressed    with   the   standard    of briefing,    again   attention   to

detail such as the evacuation procedures and officers being aware of their

indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality.

I    particularly    recall   him    saying,   "We    have   fully   tried   the   evacuation

procedures twice this season, the first time w as good, the, second time was
                                                       -2-



excellence;     if we are required                to impliment        evacuation today,      it must be

excellent."

This    briefing      was    followed        by   an   up     to    date    intelligence    report    from

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Finally,    Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios, issue and

mealing arrangements.

It was     stressed       that   all    officers must          be    on their respective         points   by

11.15 a.m.

After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

later    into   the       operation     so   I left      the       stadium to return      to my private

vehicle.     I was approached on three separate occasions in Penistone Road and

asked if I had any tickets to sell.

There were a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

I went     to my vehicle         and drove        to Hammerton Road Police              Station where I

carried out some outstanding clerical work.

I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

Station,    when      a    police      car   offered     me     a    lift   to   the   ground.     This    I

accepted.

I saw Policewoman           Smith and another officer outside Threshers                      near Holme

Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

and not in uniform.

All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

By Hillsborough Park I saw a group of people sitting around,                                there was a

white plastic carrier bag with them and                        the outline of cans could be seen.
                                                   -3-



The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were six men and they were joking about having to drink the lot as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By Leppings     Lane   gates were        few supporters,        road clear,      plenty of Police

officers evident.

I went   to    the   barrier       at   Leppings    Lane/Vere    Road        where   Ispoke    to 'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                        A few peoplepassing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I then   walked      past    Leppings      Lane   gates   and   came    to    barriers   and   Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                           There were no

other people near this area.                 I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell       the necessity to provide a sterile area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I continued along the road being the South Stand past the T.V. unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

I produced my warrant card, but I was known to one officer who I did not

know.

I went down and along Penistone Road which was busy.

I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the                         flow ofpeople, it was

very busy.

I   stopped   and    spoke    to    Police    Constable      Vallance    from    'A'   Division   and

Police Constable                    from     ’A ’ Division    at separate points but due to

enquiries     and sheer numbers of persons it was prudent to move on, as they

needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

I returned to rear of South Stand.

About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
                                               -4-



awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.                   The procedure was

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this area and returned to Penistone Road as I intended to use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.        At that time about one hour to kick off.

I knew there was a Liverpool train due at Wadsley Bridge around 2.05 p.m.

but decided to go into the ground.

I went to the main sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a special

card   issued   to me by Superintendent Murray.              Both were     fully checked and

examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

I was assured no unauthorised person would gain entry at that gate.

I went down onto the perimeter track and was immediately surprised by how

full the Spion Kop was.        I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

I made my way to the Police Control b o x .

Inspector    Sewell    had   alerted me   to    the   fact   that    inside   there   was   only

limited space.        I intended to visit, see it operated and leave if I was in

the way.

I wanted    to see     the Control   point     as I was at Doncaster Rovers when the

camera equipment was first installed and operated at the beginning of the

present    season.     The   engineer was    always    quoting      the   Sheffield Wednesday

system as being excellent and holding the system as the way all grounds
                                                  -5-



should operate.

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at    the    front    and    Police    Constable    Bichard       at    the   rear   by    the    camera

operating controls.

I was       informed by Police        Sergeant    Goddard       that   Superintendent      Murray had

gone    to speak to the referee           so I sat on his seat and was offered a hot

drink.       It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant      Chief    Constable      (Operations)       Mr.    Jackson      came   to   the    control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw    through    the   control    room     window    Superintendent        Murray     and   Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, in uniform, walking along the track.                            They came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the Notts

Forest parts I could see on the South Stand and the Spion Kop were quite

full.

I recall Chief Superintendent Duckenfield commenting about there being no

entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

I remember      when    I was    a child there          always    being a band playing by the

players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                              When

I looked the person was jiggling around.                   I remember thinking how empty the

area around this youth w a s .           Police Constable          Bichard operated the camera

and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super
facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was aware the area in Leppings Lane behind the goal was filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

up.    As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                       The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                              All was good humoured.

The   area behind the goal at Leppings Lane was getting full but there was

space at the front.               People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

Approx 2.30 p.m.

I    looked   on    the    left monitor           and was     aware   there       seemed     a build    up    of

supporters.

I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

necessary     segregation         of fans,        access     to the North Stand, which had been

allocated     to     Liverpool        supporters, could            only    be    done   by   Leppings       Lane

entrances , this          meant    that     the    entrances       on Penistone Road          to the    stand

which would normally be used were unavailable.

This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

An    engineer      came       into   the    room       to   try    and    improve      transmission         and

reception.

I remember         him    in   blue    under      the   control     room    bench,      I thought      it    was

crowded as Police Sergeant GoddAard was walking round/over him.
                                                -7-



I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was.

I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the closure of Leppings Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                         It was not

extraordinary.          I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception, the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                        The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 p .m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on the    screen.        Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

to assist officers outside.

Around    this    time    a radio message      was    relayed   requesting   the     gates   to be

opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

I remember thinking, you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

and may    create       a difficult   public     order    situation     for Police    inside   the

ground.

The   gates      were    not   authorised   to       be   opened   by    Chief   Sueprintendent

Duckenfield at this time.

I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the
Police Control.

It occurred that some Liverpool supporters were leving it late but people

often enter after the start of many games.

About this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to the controllers.       I then saw the gates displayed on the camera which I

believe   are   the   concertina gates   on   the   service   road   to the rear of the

South Stand open and a surge of people rush into the ground.                I said,   "The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.       It seemed control was regained       with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the gate.

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent Marshall again requests         the gates to be opened.        This is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

I can see by the players tunnel a semi circle of photographers awaiting the

arrival of the two teams.

It seems the Superintendent will have to try and prevent the start of the

game as the fans will       not all get in but I thought thereis no way anyone

can get to the referee or team managers to do this at            this late stage.     As I

was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                I've no idea which

team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

At   this point Superintendent Marshall requested the gates to be opened as

there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in the crush

if they were not opened.

There was still room on the terrace under the control.               The South Stand was

much fuller but not full.
Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was evident there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect - If there's likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent Murray gave the general   instruction over the radio to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.   The play was

at the Penistone Road end.

I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as directed

but then stopping and standing watching the game.

A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was space

but did not open i t .

I thought she probably didn't have a radio or handn't sensed that she must

open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

I began to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of the

control point, through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got

the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.   More

and more were coming onto the track, I was ushering them to the open gate

and the Policewoman assisted.
                                           -10-



I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I   could   see   people   pushed   up   against    the    fence    but   not   aware   of   any

particular problems or injuries as there is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run to control but by the uncovered seats I meet Superintendent Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.             We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

Terrace.

I think it is a public order situation.

As they are Liverpool supporters,          I run onto the playing area and protect

Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

people spilling onto the playing area.             There is quite clearly in my mind a

major public      order situation which will        need    a large uniform presence          to

control.

I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

There is nothing I can usefully                                    context so^fr decide to

return to the Police Control point.

En route       I am      passed    by    uniformed       reinforcements     as    I pass   through    the

uncovered seating.

On   re-entering         control    room    I    learn    that    persons   are    suspected of being

in j ured.

An   ambulance      is    called    for    and    quickly     arrives   behind     the   Leppings    Lane

goal.

A message      is relayed to Police control that many people are injured.                              As

they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides to call

out Casualty Bureau staff.

I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson, to call for Chief

Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

I've no accurate           assessment       of time,      but this call should be recorded on

tape    in Force      Control.          Coins    or other     items   are being      thrown at Police

Control      in large numbers.             In view of the situation unfolding,                'Operation

Support' is authorised.

All available personnel are deployed in area.

I    suggest    I   go    to   Hammerton        Road     Police   Station    and    receive   Operation

Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground Control.

I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

in a marked Police car.             He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Commander.

Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific areas in

makeshift serials.

I remain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

enquiry room.
                                           -12-



Relatives and calls are all being dealt with from Hammerton Road.

At   this   stage   there   is little   further which   is of benefit   regarding   the

series of events under review.

Subsequent    actions   by myself involve reception and sympathetic welfare          of

distressed relatives.

Liaison with Social Services and other support agencies.

Setting up of HOLMES incident room.

All non contentious but essential facilities to assist officers at scene.

I did not directly handle any injured or dead bodies.

I am a Chief Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police and at

present deputy to the Sub-Divisional Commander at           'Fl' Sub-

Division .

I was posted to         'F' Division on 3 April 1989 as Chief Inspector,

Administration.         As such I was not included in the operational

order for the semi final to be played at the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club on Saturday 15          April 1989.   I did however attend

the match with the authority          of my Chief Superintendent as an

observer.

On the day I attended the ground and the 10.00 am briefing and

then carried out other duties until about 2.00 pm when I went to

the Police Control Box where          I was informed by Sergeant Goddard

that Mr Murray had gone to see the         referee.

At about 2.30 pm I looked on the monitor and was aware there

seemed to be a build up of supporters.          I remember asking

Superintendent Murray about this and he explained that due to

necessary segregation of fans access to the North Stand, which

had been allocated to Liverpool supporters,           could only be done

by Leppings Lane entrance.         This meant that the entrances on

Penistone Road to the stand which would naturally be used were

u n ava i l a b l e .

I recall a suggestion that the tannoy should be used to request

fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent

c r ow d i n g .

People began to tell us that the radioed reception and

transmissions were poor when an engineer attended to see to the

radios.

I can remember Superintendent Marshall asking for Leppings Lane

to be closed and officers being deployed to assist at Leppings

Lane,     including a Police Land Rover with Public Address

eq ui p m e n t .

Around this time approximately 2.45 pm,          I can remember a radio

message requesting the gates to be opened.           I remember thinking

you can't open the gates or you lose control over who is

admitted and may cause a difficult public order situation for

Police inside the ground.         The gates were not authorised to be

opened on this occasion.



* H ow come?        Was there any conversation    - was there a refusal -

was the request simply ignored?



I then saw people climbing over the turnstile walls and pointed

this out to the controllers.         I then saw what I now know to be

Gate    'C' open and a surge of people rush into the ground.        I

said,     "The gates have been forced."

Control of the gate appeared to have been regained very quickly

with the assistance of a Mounted Police Officer.           People however

were still climbing into the ground.

* Was there any conversation or comment at this time?

Did he v iew terrace pens 3/4?

* Where did influx go?

What was his assessment at this stage?



Superintendent Marshall     again requested the gates to be opened.



* This next section requires some corroboration if it is at all

possible?



It seemed to me that the Superintendent *(Does he mean

Superintendent or Chief Superintendent?) would have to prevent

the start of the game as the fans would not all get in but I

thought there is no way anyone can get to the referee or team

managers to do this at this late stage.

As I was thinking this, the crowd erupted as one of the teams

ran onto the pitch.     I don't know which team it was.     I saw on

the monitor that control appeared difficult outside the ground.

At this point Superintendent Marshall requested the gates to be

opened as there was going to be serious injury or someone killed

outside if they were not opened.

Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his

hand asking Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.           I

recall Chief Superintendent Duckenfield thinking aloud and

saying,    "If there's likely to be serious injury or death

outside,    I have no option than to open the gates."     He told
ROBERT IAN McROBBIE - CHIEF INSPECTOR                    PAGE 4




Superintendent Murray,     "Open the gates."

Superintendent Murray gave the general instruction over the

radio to open the g a t e s .



* Can he say - was there any further discussion, did Murray

advise Chief Superintendent Duckenfield further - was there any

indication of consequences - did anyone including himself look

at the monitor to v i e w both the general and manpower situation

on the concourse? - Is he sure Murray gave the instruction?



On the monitor I saw what I now know to be Gate   'C' open and

fans come flooding in.



* Any comments in Control Box - Did he remember Buxton's request

to delay kick off, Higgins request to open Gate   'A' - Ryan using

tannoy etc, etc.



The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.

I then noticed fans behind the Leppings Lane goal and on the

instructions of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield left the

Control Box and went to the pitch to assist.



* Was there prior to or consequent to the order to open the

gates any advice sought, warnings or instructions given with

regard to controlling or directing the influx of fans?

I subsequently left the Control Box and took various roles in

the subsequent rescue operation of Liverpool fans who had been

injured or had died in pens 3/4 of the Leppings Lane terrace.

It is to m y knowledge that a total of 95 fans died within those

pens.

Chief Inspector McROBBIE attended the match on the day as an observer in the

Police Control Box until he was sent to the pitch to assess the problems.

I transferred to 'F' Division on Monday 3 April 1989, as the Chief Inspector

(Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to be    able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As   a   preliminary      to the event I received an overview of the planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday 12 April 1989.

I did    not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 14 April 1989.

On Saturday 15 April        1989, I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

9.^5 a.m.     I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

in front of the Special Constables.

It appeared      to me that attention to detail was evident in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                   He impressed that

officers    must    act   in a professional     manner       which would reflect credit       on

South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a microphone

and amplifier.

This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

I was    again     impressed   with   the   standard    of    briefing,   again   attention   to

detail such as the evacuation procedures and officers being aware of their

indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality..

I    particularly     recall   him    saying,   "We    have    fully   tried   the   evacuation

procedures twice this season, the first time was good, the second time was
excellence;       if we       are   required         to   impliment        evacuation      today,     it must be

excellent."

This    briefing        was    followed         by   an    up    to       date    intelligence      report     from

Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

Finally,     Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios,                                     issue and

mealing arrangements.

It   was    stressed        that    all   officers        must       be   on     their   respective      points     by

11.15 a.m.

After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

later      into   the    operation        so    I left      the       stadium      to    return   to my private

vehicle.      I was approached on three separate occasions in Penistone Road and

asked if I had any tickets to sell.

There were a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

I went      to my       vehicle     and drove         to Hammerton             Road   Police    Station where I

carried out some outstanding clerical work.

I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

Station,      when      a     police      car    offered        me    a    lift    to    the   ground.       This    I

 accepted.

 I saw Policewoman             Smith      and another officer                  outside   Threshers     near Holme

 Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

 I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

 officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

 I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

 and not in uniform.

 All Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

 at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

 By Hillsborough            Park I saw a group of people                         sitting around,      there was a

 white plastic carrier bag with them and                              the outline of cans could be seen.
                                                       -3-



The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were       six men and they were joking about having                           to drink the lot as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By Leppings       Lane    gates      were    few     supporters,     road clear, plenty of Police

officers evident.

I went     to    the   barrier       at     Leppings    Lane/Vere       Road        where   Ispoke     to   'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                              A few people passing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I   then   walked      past    Leppings       Lane    gates    and   came      to    barriers    and    Police

Officers - Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                                  There were no

other people       near    this area.          I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell          the necessity        to provide        a sterile      area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I continued along          the road being            the South Stand past             the T.V.    unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

I produced my warrant             card,     but    I was known       to one officer who I did not

know.

I went down and along Penistone Road which was busy.

I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the                                flow of people, it was

very busy.

I   stopped     and    spoke    to    Police       Constable     Vallance       from    'A'   Division      and

Police Constable ________ from                 'A'    Division     at   separate points but due              to

enquiries       and sheer numbers           of persons it was prudent to move on, as they

needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

I returned to rear of South Stand.

About 11.45 p.m, the Liverpool team coach arrived.

There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the         Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.              The procedure was

as for Liverpool,          no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this area          and returned to Penistone Road               as I intended to    use    the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.            At that time          about one hour to kick off.

I knew there was a Liverpool train                      due at Wadsley Bridge around 2.05        p.m.

but decided to go into the ground.

I went to the main          sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a special

card   issued   to me       by Superintendent Murray.                Both werefully checked       and

examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

I was assured no          unauthorised person would               gain entry at that gate.

I went down onto the             perimeter    track and was immediately surprised            by how

full the Spion Kop was.            I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

I made my way to the Police Control box.

Inspector    Sewell        had    alerted me       to   the   fact   that inside   there   was only

limited space.        I     intended to visit, see it operated and leave ifI was in

the way.

I wanted    to see        the    Control   point        as I was at Doncaster Rovers when the

camera equipment          was    first   installed and operated at the beginning             of the

present    season.        The   engineer     was        always   quoting the Sheffield Wednesday

system as being excellent and holding the system as                      the way all grounds
should operate.

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at    the    front     and    Police     Constable       Bichard    at     the    rear    by   the     camera

operating controls.

I was       informed    by    Police   Sergeant    Goddard        that    Superintendent        Murray had

gone    to speak to the referee so I sat on his                          seat   and was    offered a hot

drink.       It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant       Chief    Constable       (Operations)       Mr.    Jackson       came    to    the    control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw    through     the    control    room    window     Superintendent         Murray       and    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield,              in uniform, walking along the track.                    They came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the Notts

Forest      parts    I could see       on the South Stand and the Spion Kop were quite

full.

I recall Chief          Superintendent       Duckenfield commenting about there                      being no

entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

I    remember    when    I was     a child       there    always    being       a band playing         by the

players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                                    When

I looked the person was jiggling around.                     I remember thinking how empty the

area around this youth was.                 Police Constable Bichard operated the camera

and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super
facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

I was    aware        the area in Leppings                  Lane    behind the goal was             filling up but

this was to be expected.

I was     then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

up.     As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

looked onto the playing area.

I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

as I didn't think he would be playing.                             The Liverpool fans were shouting his

name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                                    All was good humoured.

The    area behind the goal at Leppings                            Lane was getting full             but     there was

space at the front.                  People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

Approx 2.30 p.m.

I     looked   on     the     left    monitor         and    was    aware     there     seemed      a    build     up of

supporters.

I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

necessary      segregation           of    fans,      access       to   the   North Stand,          which had been

allocated        to    Liverpool          supporters, could               only   be    done    by       Leppings        Lane

entrances, this             meant     that      the    entrances          on Penistone        Road      to   the    stand

which would normally be used were unavailable.

This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

An     engineer        came      into     the    room         to    try    and   improve       transmission              and

reception.

I     remember      him     in   blue      under      the     control      room bench,        I     thought        it    was

crowded as Police Sergeant Goddeard was walking round/over him.
I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was.

I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the closure of Leppings Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                                It was not

extraordinary.            I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception, the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                               The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 p.m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on the screen.             Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

to assist officers outside.

Around      this    time      a radio message       was   relayed   requesting      the     gates   to be

opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

I remember thinking, you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

and   may    create       a    difficult   public     order    situation     for   Police    inside   the

ground.

The   gates        were       not   authorised   to       be   opened   by    Chief   Sueprintendent

Duckenfield at this time.

I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the
Police Control.

It occurred      that some    Liverpool supporters were        leving   it late but people

often enter after the start of many games.

About this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to the controllers.          I then saw the gates displayed on the camera which I

believe    are   the   concertina gates   on   the   service    road    to   the   rear of the

South Stand open and a surge of people rush into the ground.                       I said, "The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly    closed again. It seemed control was regained              with help of a mounted

officer    who put his horse across the gap in the gate.

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent     Marshall    again requests   the gates      to be opened.         This   is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

I can see by the players tunnel a semi circle of photographers awaiting the

arrival of the two teams.

It seems    the Superintendent will have to try and prevent the start of the

game as    the fans will not all get in but I thought                thereis no way anyone

can get    to the referee or team managers to do this at             this late stage.       As I

was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                   I've no idea which

team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

At   this point Superintendent Marshall         requested      the   gates   to be opened as

there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in the crush

if they were not opened.

There was still room on the terrace under the control.                  The South Stand was

much fuller but not full.
Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was evident   there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect - If there’s likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent Murray     gave   the general    instruction over the   radio to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.          The play was

at the Penistone Road e n d .

I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

Fans were going onto the track starting to move in the direction as directed

but then stopping and standing watching the game.

A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was space

but did not open i t .

I thought she probably didn't have a radio or handn't sensed that she must

open it to let fans into the open areas behind her.

I began to sense youths would run onto the playing area so ran out of the

control p o i n t , through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got

 the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.         More

and more were    coming onto the track,        I was ushering them to the open gate

 and the Policewoman assisted.
I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I   could   see   people    pushed   up   against    the    fence   but   not   aware   of   any

particular problems or injuries as there is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More    and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run    to control    but by the uncovered seats I meet             Superintendent Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.              We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

Terrace.

I think it is a public order situation.

As they are       Liverpool supporters,     I run onto the playing area and protect

Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

people spilling onto the playing area.              There is quite clearly in my mind a

major public      order    situation which will      need    a large uniform presence         to

control.

I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

There is nothing I can usefully do in a public oder context so I decide to
return to the Police Control p o i n t .

En   route     I am      passed    by   uniformed        reinforcements     as    I pass    through     the

uncovered seating.

On   re-entering         control    room    I    learn    that    persons   are    suspected    of    being

injured.

An   ambulance      is    called    for    and    quickly arrives       behind      the    Leppings    Lane

goal.

A message      is relayed to Police              control    that many people         are   injured.      As

they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides                              to call

out Casualty Bureau staff.

I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable, Mr. Jackson, to call for Chief

Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

I've    no   accurate      assessment       of time,      but this call      should be recorded          on

tape    in Force      Control.          Coins    or other    items    are   being    thrown    at Police

Control      in large numbers.             In view of the situation unfolding,                 'Operation

Support' is authorised.

All available personnel are deployed in area.

I    suggest    I   go     to   Hammerton       Road     Police   Station    and    receive    Operation

Support personnel and deploy them from there as directed by Ground Control.

I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

in a marked Police car.             He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Commander.

Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific areas in

makeshift serials.

I remain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

enquiry room.

        Relatives and calls are all being dealt with from Hammerton Road.

        At   this   stage   there   is   little   further which   is   of benefit   regarding   the

        series of events under review.

        Subsequent    actions   by myself     involve reception and sympathetic welfare of

        distressed relatives.

        Liaison with Social Services and other support agencies.

        Setting up of HOLMES incident room.

        All non contentious but essential facilities to assist officers at scene.

        I did not directly handle any injured or dead bodies.




C
    CHIEF INSPECTOR MCROBBIE
                                                                                              R125



    I transferred to 'F' Division on Monday 3 April 1 9 8 9 , as the Chief Inspector

    (Admin).

The Operational Order for the F.A. Cup semi-final was drafted and I was not

 included on the order.

As a new member of the Division I made a request to the Chief Superintendent

to be able to attend the event in order to observe the Police operation.

As     a preliminary to the         event      I received an overview of the planning and

rationale from Inspector Sewell at 2 . 3 0 p.m. on Wednesday 1 2 April 1 9 8 9 .

I did not attend the Commander's brief on Friday 1 4 April 1 9 8 9 .

On Saturday 15 April 1 9 8 9 , I attended Sheffield Wednesday football ground at

9.45 a.m.        I was off duty attending in my own time, in civilian clothing in

order to watch, listen and learn.

I took up a place at the rear of the North Stand, behind CID Officers, but

in front of the Special Constables.

It appeared to me that attention to detail was evident in the way serials

were ordered, officers wore headgear and professionalism prevailed.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield imparted a factual briefing identifying the

various Section Senior Commanders by name and in person.                      He impressed that

officers       must    act   in a professional manner which would reflect credit on

South Yorkshire Police.

This brief was clear, concise and audible at the rear by use of a microphone

and amplifier.

This part was followed by Superintendent Murray.

I was     again       impressed   with   the    standard    of briefing,    again   attention   to

detail such as the evacuation procedures and officers being aware of their

indvidual requirement in the event of such eventuality.

I    particularly       recall    him    saying,   "We     have   fully   tried   the   evacuation

procedures twice this season, the first time w as good, th^ s e c o n d time was
; #.'
                                                                   -2-



        excellence;       if we        are    required        to   impliment       evacuation today,         it must be

        excellent."

        This    briefing        was     followed         by   an     up    to    date   intelligence    report     from

        Detective Sergeant Charlesworth.

        Finally,     Inspector Sewell gave general information about radios,                                  issue and

        mealing arrangements.

        It   was    stressed         that    all    officers must           be   on their respective         points    by

        11.15 a.m.

        After the briefing it was evident that little of value would be gained until

        later      into   the       operation       so   I    left    the    stadium    to return     to my private

        vehicle.      I was approached on three separate occasions in Penistone Road and

        asked if I had any tickets to sell.

        There were a lot of people around first sitting on walls in groups.

        I went      to my vehicle            and    drove     to Hammerton Road Police              Station where       I

        carried out some outstanding clerical work.

        I began to walk back to the stadium, leaving my car at Hammerton Road Police

        Station,      when      a    police        car   offered      me     a   lift   to   the   ground.      This   I

        accepted.

        I saw Policewoman             Smith     and      another officer outside Threshers               near Holme

        Lane and was pleased to see officers doing what was expected of them.

        I asked to be dropped a little away from the stadium as I wanted to observe

        officers on their respective areas and see how they were performing.

        I was really anonymous to them or many of them as I was new to the Division

        and not in uniform.

        AH   Police Officers were acting properly, but I was a little surprised that

        at 1.00 p.m. there were so few cars and pedestrians in the area.

        By Hillsborough Park I saw a group of people sitting around,                                    there was a

        white plastic carrier bag with them and                             the outline of cans could be seen.

The visible cans were of Heineken lager in the green can.

There were       six men and they were joking about having to drink the lot as

they would not be allowed to take them into the ground.

Approx 1.15 p.m.

By Leppings       Lane    gates      were    few supporters,        road clear,      plenty of Police

officers evident.

I   went   to    the    barrier      at     Leppings    Lane/Vere    Road        where     Ispoke   to 'A'

Division officers, Police Constables Parkin and Drury.                            A few peoplepassing

and we spoke about running and 'A' Divisional work.

I   then   walked      past    Leppings       Lane   gates   and    came    to    barriers     and Police

Officers “ Police Sergeant Norburn and others I do not know.                                There were no

other people near this area.                   I knew from my preliminary discussions with

Inspector Sewell         the necessity to provide a sterile                  area to keep opposing

fans separate.

I continued along         the road being the South Stand past                      the T.V. unit vans

where I was met with another barrier of metal barriers and Police Officers.

I produced my warrant            card,      but I was known to one officer who I did not

know.

I went down and along Penistone Road which was busy.

I walked towards Parkside Road and I was against the                             flow ofpeople, it was

very busy.

I   stopped     and    spoke    to   Police     Constable       Vallance    from     'A'    Division   and

Police Constable                      from    'A'    Division    at separate points but due to

enquiries and sheer numbers of persons it was prudent to move on, as they

needed all their attention to deal with the volume of people.

I returned to rear of South Stand.

About 11.45 P . m , the Liverpool team coach arrived.

There was a motorcycle lead and Police horses controlling a large crowd
awaiting the trains arrival.

I noticed the horse near me was displaying a Merseyside Police badge on the

saddle.

There were no incidents.

Sergeant Sorsby of South Yorkshire Police Mounted said to the other officers

- "Exactly the same for the Notts Forest Coach".

About 1.55 p.m. the Nottingham Forest team coach arrived.                         The procedure was

as for Liverpool, no problems, crowd good humoured.

I left this         area and returned to Penistone Road as I intended to use the

entrance to the ground by the Police Room.

Penistone Road was quite busy but there was no queuing at the turnstiles as

I would have expected.            At that time about one hour to kick off.

I knew there was a Liverpool train due at Wadsley Bridge around 2.05 p.m.

but decided to go into the ground.

I went to the main sliding gate and produced my warrant card and a special

card   issued       to me    by Superintendent Murray.            Both were       fully checked and

examined by the stewards which I thought was excellent.

I was assured no unauthorised person would gain entry at that gate.

I went    down      onto the perimeter track and was immediately surprised by how

full the Spion Kop was.            I turned and saw the North Stand was not very full.

I made my way to the Police Control box.

Inspector       Sewell      had alerted me      to    the fact    that   inside    there   was   only

limited space.            I intended to visit,        see it operated and leave if         I was in

the w a y .

I wanted       to   see     the Control   point      as   Iwas   at Doncaster Rovers       when the

camera equipment            was first installed and operated at the beginning of the

present       season.      The   engineer was     always    quoting      the   Sheffield Wednesday

system as being excellent and holding the system as the way all grounds
                                                   -5-



should operate.

On entering the Police box there was Sergeant Goddard, Police Constable Ryan

at     the    front     and   Police    Constable    Bichard       at   the   rear   by    the    camera

operating controls.

I was        informed   by Police      Sergeant    Goddard       that Superintendent       Murray    had

gone       to speak to the referee         so I sat on his seat and was               offered a hot

drink.        It didn't appear particularly busy and quite clearly everything was

under control.

Assistant       Chief    Constable      (Operations)       Mr.    Jackson     came   to   the    control

point, he was in civilian clothing.

I    saw     through    the   control    room     window    Superintendent       Murray    and    Chief

Superintendent Duckenfield, in uniform, walking along the track.                            They came

through the uncovered seats in the South Stand and entered the control room.

I went to the far end of the room and stood by the camera control area.

I was prepared to leave, but did not appear to be hindering anyone and felt

I would gain onset benefit from staying and observing from this point.

On looking into the ground the Liverpool areas had a lot of space, the Notts

Forest       parts   I could see on the South Stand and the Spion Kop were quite

full.

I recall       Chief    Superintendent     Duckenfield commenting about there being no

entertainment being provided to encourage the supporters to come early.

I remember       when    I was   a child     there    always      being a band playing           by the

players tunnel at every game at Hillsborough.

Whilst I didn't see it, Assistant Chief Constable Operations commented that

a person just below the Police control had just dropped his trousers.                              When

I looked the person was jiggling around.                   I remember thinking how empty the

area around this youth was.               Police Constable Bichard operated the camera

and I watched him be able to zoom onto him which I thought was a super

                                                                  -6-



        facility for spotting troublemakers in the crowd.

        I was aware         the area in Leppings Lane behind the goal was                                 filling up but

        this was to be expected.

        I was    then aware that both teams came onto the pitch for a pre-match warm

        up.    As there was nothing special happening on the screen or in the ground I

        looked onto the playing area.

        I was aware that Alan Hanson of Liverpool was on the ptich and was surprised

        as I didn t think he would be playing.                          The Liverpool fans were shouting his

        name and he acknowledged them by raising his hand.                                 All was good humoured.

        The    area behind the goal at Leppings Lane was getting full but                                          there was

        space at the front.               People seemed reluctant to move forward, probably all

        wanting to maintain their best view of the playing area.

        Approx 2.30 p.m.

        I   looked     on   the    left    monitor         and   was     aware   there       seemed       a    build     up    of

        supporters.

        I remember asking Superintendent Murray about this, he explained that due to

        necessary      segregation        of    fans,      access      to the North Stand,               which had been

        allocated      to   Liverpool          supporters, could              only    be    done    by    Leppings          Lane

    entrances, this               meant    that      the    entrances         on Penistone         Road       to   the   stand

    which would normally be used were unavailable.

    This explained at that time in my mind the crowds on the screen.

    I recall a suggestion that the loud hailer/tannoy should be used to request

    fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent crowding.

    People began advising control that radio reception was poor.

    An        engineer      came    into       the    room       to     try    and    improve       transmission              and

    reception.

    I       remember     him   in    blue      under       the   control       room    bench,      I thought           it     was

    crowded as Police Sergeant Godd^ard was walking round/over him.
                                                   -7-



I thought of leaving but was unable to get past and was better staying where

I was.

I was aware Superintendent Marshall requested the closure of Leppings Lane

to traffic.

I looked to the screen and whilst there seemed a lot of people this was to

be expected and this had been the situation for quite a time.                            It was not

extraordinary.            I recall seeing a cream double decker bus travelling slowly

through the crowd which indicated the road was not blocked and free movement

was possible.

The situation remained like this, poor reception, the ground slowly filling

up and everything progressing as one would expect for such an occasion.                           The

crowd seemed good humoured in the ground.

Approx 2.45 p.m.

The crowd outside appears denser on the camera but I can see a Police horse

on the      screen.       Having seen them at close hand control the crowd when the

team coaches arrived, I sensed they were well in control.

Officers were deployed to assist, including a land rover with P.A. equipment

to assist officers outside.

Around      this    time a radio message         was    relayed requesting        the   gates   to be

opened as persons were trapped up against the gates.

I remember thinking, you can't open the gates or you lose control over who

is admitted, you are unable to search or check persons admitted for weapons

and   may    create       a difficult   public     order    situation     for Police     inside   the

ground.

The   gates        were    not   authorised   to       be   opened   by   Chief     Sueprintendent

Duckenfield at this time.

I am aware that the teams are no longer on the pitch so the start could not

be far off and there was still a lot of space on the terrace under the
                                            -8 -




Police Control.

It occurred that some Liverpool supporters were leving                  it late but people

often enter after the start of many games.

About this time I can see people climbing over the wall and point this out

to the controllers.       I then saw the gates displayed on the camera which I

believe   are   the   concertina   gates   on   the   service   road   to   the   rear of the

South Stand open and a surge of people rush into the ground.                      I said, "The

gates have been forced".

It was difficult to estimate how many entered the ground but the gates were

quickly closed again.      It seemed control was regained with help of a mounted

officer who put his horse across the gap in the gate.

People however are still being able to climb over the wall into the ground.

Superintendent Marshall again requests             the gates to be opened.          This is a

general request.

It is getting close to kick off time.

I can see by the players tunnel a semi circle of photographers awaiting the

arrival of the two teams.

It seems the Superintendent will have to try and prevent the start of the

game as the fans will not all get in but I thought there is no way anyone

can get to the referee or team managers to do this at this late stage.                   As I

was thinking this the crowd errupted as a team ran on.                 I've no idea which

team as the sound inside the ground transmitted itself outside and from what

I saw on the monitor control was difficult outside now.

At   this point   Superintendent Marshall requested the gates               to be opened as

there was going to be serious injury or someone killed outside in the crush

if they were not opened.

There was still room on the terrace under the control.                 The South Stand was

much fuller but not full.

Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his hand asking

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.

It was evident there existed a tremendous problem for officers outside the

Leppings Lane entrance.

Chief Superintendent Duckenfield was deeply considering the situation.

I recall him thinking aloud words to the effect - If there's likely to be

serious injury or death outside I have no option than to open the gates - He

told Superintendent Murray, "Open the Gates".

Superintendent Murray gave the general     instruction over the radio to open

the gates.

On the monitor I saw the concertina gates open and fans come flooding in.

The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.    The play was

at the Penistone Road end.

I became aware of a perimeter track gate being opened and people being let

onto the track out of the pen behind the goal and ushered and pointed in the

direction of the part where there was still plenty of space.

The movement seemed orderly but the numbers were building up.

Fans were going onto the track   starting to move in thedirection asdirected

but then stopping and standing   watching the game.

A Policewoman was in control of the gate into the area where there was space

but did not open i t .

I thought she probably didn't have a radio or handn't sensed that she must

open it to let fans into the open areas    behind her.

I began to sense youths would    run onto the playingarea   so ran out   of the

control point, through the uncovered seats onto the perimeter track and got

the gate by the Policewoman open and began directing fans to the area.     More

and more were coming onto the track, I was ushering them to the open gate

and the Policewoman assisted.
I went behind advertising hoardings to prevent persons encroaching onto the

playing area.

I   could   see    people    pushed   up   against    the   fence   but   not   aware   of   any

particular problems or injuries as there is a steady stream of people onto

the perimeter track.

More and more people on the track and beginning to move onto the grass by

the goal line.

I see Superintendent Greenwood on top of the fence, having climbed up and he

is gesturing by waving his arms and asking for the game to be stopped.

It seems by his frantic waves Control are not understanding his request.

I run to control          but by the uncovered seats I meet Superintendent Murray

with his hat on running the opposite way.               We run together to a linesman to

get his attention to stop the game.

The linesman ran straight past Superintendent Murray.

I chase the linesman shouting him to get the referee's attention to stop the

game.

I then see Superintendent Greenwood running towards the referee.

There are lots of fans in the Liverpool goalmouth in front of Leppings Lane

Terrace.

I think it is a public order situation.

As they are Liverpool supporters,           I run onto the playing         area andprotect

Nigel Clough in case any Liverpool supporters try to attack him.

When I am satisfied there is no danger to players I look and see hundreds of

people spilling onto the playing area.               There is quite clearly in my mind a
           •                                                     (
major public      order    situation which will need a large uniform presence to

control.

I am in the centre of the playing area, in plain clothes.

There is nothing I can usefully do in a public c^ler context               so    decide   to
                                                                                          -11-



                          return to the Police Control point.

                          En         route    I       am    passed    by    uniformed       reinforcements              as       I      pass          through                  the

                          uncovered seating.

                          On         re-entering            control    room    I    learn    that persons               are        suspected of being

                          injured.

                         An          ambulance         is    called    for    and    quickly      arrives         behind              the        Leppings                Lane

                          goal.

                         A message             is relayed to Police                 control      that many people                       are injured.                           As

                          they are not local people, Chief Superintendent Duckenfield decides to call

                         out Casualtj' Bureau staff.

                         I am directed by Assistant Chief Constable,                                Mr. Jackson, to                             call for Chief

                         Superintendent Addis and request he comes to Hillsborough.

                         I make the request by telephone to Force Operations Room as instructed.

                         I've         no     accurate         assessment      of time,       but this call                 should be recorded on

                         All available personnel are deployed in area.

                         I      suggest           I    go    to   Hammerton        Road    Police   Station              and         receive               Operation

                         I go to Hammerton Road Police Station.

                         I leave the ground by Leppings Lane and am able to stop Chief Inspector Shaw

                         in a marked Police car.                      He conveys me to Hammerton Road Police Station.

                         I change into uniform and act at this location as Incident Commander.

                         Officers are deployed as requested from Ground Control to specific areas in

                        makeshift serials.

                         I remain to organise Social Services who have arrived and set up an incident

                         enquiry room.

Relatives and calls are all being dealt with from Hammerton Road.

At   this   stage   there   is   little   further which is of benefit   regarding   the

series of events under review.

Subsequent    actions   by myself involve reception and sympathetic welfare         of

distressed relatives.

Liaison with Social Services and other support agencies.

Setting up of HOLMES incident room.

All non contentious but essential facilities to assist officers at scene.

I did not directly handle any injured or dead bodies.

I am a Chief Inspector in the South Yorkshire Police and at

present deputy to the Sub-Divisional Commander at              'FI' Sub-

Division.

I was posted to      'F' Division on 3 April 1989 as Chief Inspector,

Administration.       As such I was not included in the operational

order for the semi final to be played at the Sheffield Wednesday

Football Club on Saturday 15 April 1989.            I did however attend

the match with the authority of my Chief Superintendent as an

observer.

On the day I attended the ground and the 10.00 am briefing and

then carried out other duties until about           2.00 pm when I went to

the Police Control Box where I was informed by Sergeant Goddard

that Mr M u rr a y had gone to see the r e f e r e e .

At about 2.30 pm I looked on the monitor and was aware there

seemed to be a build up of supporters.            I remember asking

Superintendent Murray about this and he explained that due to

necessary segregation of fans access to the North Stand, which

had been allocated to Liverpool supporters,              could only be done

by Leppings Lane e n t r a n c e .   This meant that the entrances on

Penistone Road to the stand which would naturally be used were

unavailable.

I recall a suggestion that the tannoy should be used to request

fans to move forward to create room at the rear to prevent

crowding.

People began to tell us that the radioed reception and

transmissions were poor when an engineer attended to see to the
radios.

I can remember Superintendent Marshall asking for Leppings Lane

to be closed and officers being deployed to assist at Leppings

Lane,    including a Police Land Rover with Public Address

equipment.

Around this time approximately 2.45 pm,      I can remember a radio

message requesting the gates to be opened.       I remember thinking

you can't open the gates or you lose control over who is

admitted and may cause a difficult public order situation for

Police inside the ground.     The gates were not authorised to be

opened on this occasion.



* H ow come?    Was there any conversation   - was there a refusal -

was the request simply ignored?



I then saw people climbing over the turnstile walls and pointed

this out to the controllers.     I then saw what I now know to be

Gate    'C' open and a surge of people rush into the ground.    I

said,   "The gates have been forced."

Control of the gate appeared to have been regained very quickly

with the assistance of a Mounted Police Officer.      People however

were still climbing into the ground.
ROBERT IAN McROBBIE - CHIEF INSPECTOR                          PAGE 3



* Was there any conversation or comment at this time?

D id he v i e w terrace pens 3/4?

* Where d i d influx go?

What was his assessment at this stage?



Superintendent Marshall     again requested the gates to be opened.



* This next section requires some corroboration if it is at all

possible?



It seemed to me that the Superintendent *(Does he mean

Superintendent or Chief Superintendent?) would have to prevent

the start of the game as the fans would not all get in but I

thought there is no way anyone can get to the referee or team

managers to do this at this late stage.

As I was thinking this, the crowd erupted as one of the teams

ran onto the pitch.     I don't kno w which team it was.     I saw on

the monitor that control appeared difficult outside the ground.

At this point Superintendent Marshall requested the gates to be

opened as there was going to be serious injury or someone killed

outside if they were not opened.

Superintendent Murray was standing with a personal radio in his

hand asking Chief Superintendent Duckenfield for a decision.            I

recall Chief Superintendent Duckenfield thinking aloud and

saying,    "If there's likely to be serious injury or death

outside,   I have no option than to open the gates."       He told
 ROBERT IAN McROBBIE - CHIEF INSPECTOR                           PAGE 4




Superintendent Murray,     "Open the gates."

Superintendent Murray gave the general instruction over the

radio to open the gates.



* Can he say - was there a n y further discussion, did M u rray

advise Chief Superintendent Duckenfield further - was there any

indication of consequences - did anyone including himself look

at the monitor to v i e w both the general and m a n power situation

on the concourse? - Is he sure M u r r a y gave the instruction?



On the monitor I saw what I now know to be Gate         'C' open and

fans come flooding in.



* A n y comments in Control B o x - Did he remember Buxton's request

to delay kick off, Higgins request to open Gate         'A' - Ryan using

t annoy etc, etc.



The game had started when I looked back onto the playing area.

I then noticed fans behind the Leppings Lane goal and on the

instructions of Chief Superintendent Duckenfield left the

Control Box and went to the pitch to a s s i s t .



* Was there prior to or consequent to the order to open the

gates any advice sought, w a r n i n g s or instructions given with

regard to controlling or d i r e c t i n g the influx of fans?
ROBERT IAN Mc ROBBIE - CHIEF INSPECTOR                 PAGE 5




I subsequently left the Control Box and took various roles in

the subsequent rescue operation of Liverpool fans who had been

injured or had died in pens 3/4 of the Leppings Lane terrace.

It is to my knowledge that a total of 95 fans died within those
pens.

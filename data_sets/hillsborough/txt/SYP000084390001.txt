went    over    to the L e p p i n g s Ln         turnstiles          area     to make     enquiries-               He

the    turnstile           had been      closed-        There were        perhaps a few            100    (?)

Li v erdqoI     s u pporters want i n g           to enter          the ground by the L e p p i n g s               Ln

t u r n s 1 1 1 as but      these were        refused entry on the grounds                    of    s a f e t y , even

fans     who were           producing        tickets     for    the    ground-         This   caused some

argument.       There was           no    trouble       however.        Whilst        being   deployed          in

this manner           we    received      no further        instructions,              1 do not       recollect

any further           radio       broadcasts.,



A short while              later,    after      being    deplo y e d     in this manner,            PC 1639

M c I N T G S H who    had been securing             the u n a t t e n d e d    police    vehicle,            joined

us at     the   cordon and           commented       that      he    had just     heard on channel                  2 VrtF

that    'Operation Support"                  had been     called       into action,,          Know i n g       no

better     I presumed             this was      because     of a public          order     si t u a t i o n

escalating,,



S h o r t l y after        this    1 remember,       I think,         2 ambulances         responding           to the

large    gats     to the          side   of the L e p p i n g s Ln t u rnstiles           area-          T h e y were

a l l o w e d through      the    cordon and then                I d i d n ’t pay much a t t e n t i o n as                 I

had no     idea what was           taking          place and a s s u m e d they had                  received

directions        to a part        of    the ground-              A short while              later       I o b s erved

one of the a m b u l a n c e s      outside          'the gate'           and a frantic a c t i v i t y where

some    police      officsrs/supportsrs                   were    bringing a casualty,                    or several

casualties,         to the a m b u l a n c e        to    place     in it.I remember                     seeing       one       of

the    casualties         being    placed on the                floor     at      the   rear of       the a m bulance

and    frantic a t t empts         by police             officers        to    revive      the     person,

se e m i n g l y without     result-           I remained           in the         cordon       in L e p p i n g s    Ln

as    instructed and saw            that the a m b u l a n c e s              were a p p a r e n t l y    now filling

with    easuaItxes/police               officers         and s u pporters             ana the        nature      of    the

c asualties       being     placed       in the vehicles a p p e a r e d                 serious.          Despite

this    fact we were         still       to remain          in position             in the       cordon outside

L e p p i n g s Ln w h i c h as    then s u p p l e m e n t e d        in number         and     reinforced.

After    bing     d e p loyed     on this          cordon for          some      time    I then       r ecollected

Superintendent            HARSHALL approaching                   the     cordon       in Leppings Ln from                   the

area    of the      large    conc e r t i n a      gate C , and           beckoning/motioning                   us with

his arms      for    us    to enter          the ground-            I do not          recollect          him giving

any    command      just motioning,,                I then       ran     into     the ground          thro u g h      the

c o ncertina      gate and        into       the    concrete        quad r a n g l e     area at         the    rear       of

the L e p p i n g s Ln t e r r a c e / W e s t S t a n d area            on my own and             I believe          prior

to the     rest     of officers          from Serial             46-      On doing         so    I saw      no disorder

or    casualties      in that       area of the ground                    and      made my way           to the

central     tunnel        from    that area          leading        to    the       central pen          area    of the

L e p p i n g s Ln terraces-            As    I approached             the     entrance         to this        tunnel

from the q u a d r a n g 1e a rea            I saw       people     stood at the m o u t h to                  i t , some

of whom were         clearly       d i s t r e s s e d and making              enquiries         of me-         1 had no

idea of what         had    taken       place       inside       the     stadium and            had r e c e v i e d no

instructions         or advice          so    1 ignored          these        people and. e n t e r e d the

making my way down this                      tunnel        I saw no       casualties           in the        tunnel

itself,          but    on seeing       the     ground and          pitch are a nearing                 the       latter

part     of the         tunnel     1 saw that             the football          pitch area            near    to    the

Leppings          Ln end of the           ground was           covered with             lots     of    ''standing''

and at      the        front    of the L e p pings Ln terrace                     by the security                 fence,

People were a p p a r e n t l y           climbing          over    the fence and at this                     time       1

be l i e v e d    that we had a public                    order    incident          and that         the    pitch had

been     invaded.           I do not         recollect whether                 or not       the m a t c h was         still

in play or not.                 I do    not     think       it was.

and    exit       -From the      t e r raced area.             I saw that            he was      clearly          distressed

and was missing                items    of his        police       u n i f o r m and was        dishevelled.                 He

commented          'that       he had had e n o u g h ’ or words                  to that effect,                 clearly

distressed.              1 then     believe          he    left    via    the     tunnel       from the           terrace =,



I remained at the                rear     of    the       terrace     some      t i m e , not     clearly          sure       of

what was          taking       place at the front                 of the       t e r r a c e d area.         At    this       time

unaccompanied             I w ould      be     ' l y n c h e d ’ by the        crowd of Liverpool

seeing      the    quantity        of this a b a n d o n e d          property       I then      believed        it to

be much more,,             1 also      saw    that a metal              crush barrier           to the     left       of

Having      recovered these              properties            to the       perimeter        track    1 then

remained on the              playing      field area.               By this       time      casualties      appeared

to have all            been evacuated.              Despite          this    s upporters        to tne     front       of

any    casualties          to be     removed        so they were n ' t            really      required as         'matce.

             We all set out en route to the Football Ground                         at about 10.00        am

              (1000)       that Saturday morning,        from Shrewsbury.             We did not stop on the

             journey and I would describe the roads as containing nothing unusual

             for normal Saturday traffic.

             We eventually parked near the Ground, at about                         1.30 pm (1330).            We^A

went to a supermarket,      I would say alpout lalf a rnile from the Ground,

where about 5 of our party, myself        ihclu/te^     purchased and drank some

lager and light refreshments.        We then made our way on foot towards

the Ground.     There was already a crowd, although we were able to

walk with the crowd,      ushered along by Police without any hold-ups and

eventually to the turnstile area.         At this stage,      it was a matter of

passing the tickets to the attendants, and having the butt ends

returned.     There were no hold-ups,     naf organised queues,      people were

generally milling around and in g                 rits.I entered the Ground and
C/VT   O ia2 _ £ O T I O v/5                  -   A-
cannot recall seeing any directi              to/Where supporters should make

their way, although, as I have 'be^fi' to the Ground before,             and am aware

of the layout,    I already knew what to do, where to go and would not

particularly be looking to rely on other           pers on’s directions.       Also I

would like to point out that at the time I entered the Ground,                 at

approximately S.30 pm (1430),       once inside,       there was not such a large

crowd inside as I could walk freely j/ithin the area.

My ticket was for the seating a r e V abov             ? W Stand area.     People

were moving that freely inside at the tkiwfe I'N«H,
                                                  f Xered, that I was able

to walk to a vendor selling programmes to the right as I entered,                   I

was then able to walk across the yard area,             to the left of the W Stand
                                                                     /
and to the steps      leading up to the seating a r e a .     I ^ e v e ^ ual ly reached

my seat at about/S.35 pm (1435),        seated next to

                   was on the first row, virtually overlooking the penned

area tJe'lbw B£n 4.

At about S.55 pm (1455),       I decided to go to the toilet,        thinking that

I would not have to go during the match.           At this time,     I had already

become aware of a large number of people already in the area Pen 3 to

my right.     Pen 4 below myself did contain supporters but there were

nowhere near as many supporters       in Pen 4 as in Pen 3, which appeared

to be filling rapidly.
                                                                               PAGE         5
                                                                               SI 959

 I went to the toilets near my seating area.             Whilst there,    I

• heard someone,   I know it was a Ground Steward,          remark that   ’they*

 were     opening the gates.       I was able to look out of the window of the

 toilet,    overlooking the yard entrance area inside the Leppings Ln

 ent/ance.       wouVd say I was approximately 50 yards away from the
                               /
  rancertina    ype/ ga e whLch was eventually opened and being slightly

 above the crowd,    I saw a Police Officer and a Steward at the gate.                  I

 cannot say which if either of theXe opened the gate as I could only

 see the upper parts of thefi r ^ a f o d i .    The gates were opened and

 obviously allowed the peri             itside the Ground to enter and come

 forward as one larga-^m^s^

 Due to the layout of the Ground,         this incoming large crowd were moving

 towards the tunnel     leading to Pens 3 and 4 which I knew were already

 heavily filled at the time I had left my seat a few moments earlier.

 I returned to my seat which would be at approximately 3.00 prn <1500).

 The match had not yet started but I became aware,             it was obviously

 noticeable that there were problems downstairs             in Pen 3 to my right.

 The people there were totally packed and several of them were already

 attempting to climb over the fencing towards the pitch.               Others were

 trying to attract attention of Police Officers and Stewards,                 and

 people were generally becoming in a distressed state.               All during this

 time,    there were more and more people entering and pushing forward.

 The game started although I paid little attention heicause of /the

 serious    problems below.    I saw the crowds in Fferfs /3 and 4/raore

 tightly packed in 3,     push forward.         I would notv-dest ribs? it as a

 surge,    but a push forward with pure weight and no bal ;ward movement.

 At this stage it became more apparent to other supporters of the

 problem and people made attempts to escape from the crush by climbing

 upwards and some being assisted by those in the seated area,                 to my

 right and above the Pen 3.          In a short length of time, more people,
                                                                                     PAGE       6
                                                                                     S 1 9 59

            the Police,     and Stewards became more aware of the situation and made

          - attempts to either      pull the fence down or assist the supporters out.

            There was nothing I could do;         if I had moved over to my right,   I would

            have added to the confusion and probably have been in the way.             I

            would like to say that as soon as everyone became aware of the

            situation,      everybody concerned,    the supporters, Stewards, Police,

            St. Johns Ambulance etc.,       did all that they possibly could in my

            opinion,      although they were unco-ordinated.

            Some time later I made my way to the tunnel entrance to Pens 3 and 4

            to attempt to locate the members of our party.          I was unable to do so

            but later returned to the coach and subsequently everybody returned

            saf e l y .

            I would like to add that when I went to the tunnel,         I was not shown as

            much courtesy by Police,        although I appreciate that they too were

            probably suffering a sense of shock, which I feel better training

            should be called for.       As a member of the public,    I expect the Police

            should be able to comfort        people in distress.

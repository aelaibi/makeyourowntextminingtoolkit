                                           SATURDAY 1 5 t h APRIL 1989




                                     and myself arrived in S h e f f i e l d              at 2.05pm,        we left

 the    coach park and wal k e d down towards the ground.                                   We saw quite          a lot

 of p e o p l e    just l y i n g around on the               grass e m b a n k m e n t s    and s i t t i n g on

 walls.       I t h ought to my s e l f then tnat they were l e a v i n g it a bit late.




 /Ye a r r i v e a at the h i l l s b o r o u g h gates about 2 ,2 up:n.                  ,Yhen we went        through

 ti.ii gates,      we then s ^ 11 l 4.1                  anu               '.vent t o w a r a s    the stands

 Lane    standing.               .vas already congested,                 «ve were     all     squashed       up   then




            and I s t a r t s u        ;;o try to    g u c -u g   up Tor    tne turnstile,            i-ut taere was

no organization.               There       /.ere three        or ;'our p o l i c e m e n on hor s e b a c k

s n o u t i n g at e v e r y o n e    to get in lines,             cut you     just      could not,        wereas         last

year    there were b a r r i e r s up to make you go into lines,                                  and people      were

cnecked      before      g o i n g past tne n i l l s b o r o u g h gates           to     see if tney h a d         a

ticket,      but    this y e a r there was none of that,                       so p e o p l e even w i t h o u t

t i ckets were        t r y i n g to get t h r o u g h       the turnstile.




W h e n we m a n a g e d to get to the turnstile,                      the p o l i c e m a n who was on the B

one went t h rough just i n front of us sa y i n g "I've                              ha d enough of this."

‘rVe got through the t u r n s t i l e ,there               was quite a lo t             of pol i c e m e n s t a n d i n g

              -      chaos o u t s i d e . " ,Vo walked d o w n the tunnel                     and we got to the b o t t o m

             although our             tickets were for              'B' we went into            'A'    compound,             b e cause    'B'

           of the b a r r i e r .            This was about 2 .4 0 pm.              We   could see into                  the side

    Just    on 3 . 0 0 p m I told |               |to get over as it was n o w g e t t i n g so b a d you

   could h a r d l y move.           I told h i m to meet me at the             c o a c h e s after.     He    was

  pinned to my           sides,     one was b e i n g pushed t h r o u g h t h e     railings     and was

  h i i r t m g as well         as my chest.      I started to find my b r e a t h i n g g e t t i n g

  people     i n front of me,            his face going pale then t u r n i n g        like blue,        and I

  then r e a l i z e d    he was suffocating.            I started     to s h o u t at the      policeman

 I PAUL TAYLOR of                         Liverpool will say as follows


 I am a season ticket holder of Liverpool Football Club for the Kop end.


 I have had no medical problems                                                     I am a

             and have to be careful to look after my back.   I would not describe myself as a
 nervous person.



 I am employed as a             for



 On 15th April 1989 I went to watch the semi-final football match between Liverpool and

 Nottingham Forest at the grounds of Sheffield Wednesday at Hillsborough.



 I was able to get into the ground at about 2.45.     I had a septic toe and was concerned
 about people standing on my toe.



 I went into section A of the ground and went behind the goal post.       I stood in a crash

 barrier just behind me on about the seventh row.     About 5 minutes before the start of
 the game a man urinated near were I was standing so I moved across to the right hand
 side.



 The section was getting very crowded and I could see that people were begining to be
quashed I helped some people over a fence from the A Section to the h Section.



I remember seeing one.little boy almost going blue from^general mass of people down at
the front.



I also saw another person who was trapped in front of a crash barrier and seemed to be
bent over double.



I recall trying to help even more people over the fence from A to B Section and I was
doing this about 5 minutes to three.



I recall shouting to the Police again that the gates to the D Section should be opened.

People in the D Section were just lying and sunbathing as there was so much room there.



Things seemed to get worse before the match started with more and more people coming
into A section.



The entrance to A section is on a slop and then you come to the steps.



I was finding that I was being pushed back up towards the entrance because of the number
of people who were coming down on the left hand side and I was in effect being pushed
back up as people at the bottom tried to come back up again.
     ,.i the Football match began



  X remember that there was an initial serge when Barnsley hit the cross bar and then
  there was a second charge forward.



  I was .,'1 the side by D Section I was holding onto          the railings so that I was not

  carried down the steps by the serge, I saw that people in the second serge were standing

  on people in the first serge and then I realised that some disaster had happened. ' I saw
  a large mass of bodies which all seemed to be tangled up amongst each other.               I had been

  about on the seventh step from the front people slowly came back from the serge and were

  climbing over bodies.           I immediately began to pull people up who could not get up by

  themselves and then I pulled a girl who I immediately realised was probably dead.                  Her

  eyes were wide open as if she had been in shock and her lips were all turned up.                  She

  was about 15 or 16 years old and wore a blue cardigan with a white t-shirt and had

  protruding teeth.      I gave her the kiss of life and breathed deep into her body and then
 a terrible stench    came out of her mouth which I took to be bad air.       I realised that she

 was dead and I pulled her arm out of the blue cardigan to cover her face, I am not sure

 what her name was whether it was Victoria Hicks or Paula Smith I then carried on helping

 to pull other people out and I found a lad who was wearing a blue ski jacket and seemed

 to have rust all over his mouth which I think came from a collapsed crash barrier which
 a fan in his anger had thrown at the Police.



 I gave him the kiss of life but this seemed to bring up the contents of his stomach.
 This made me sick and I turned away to be sick.           When I looked at him again his tongue
 seemed to have fallen down his throat.          I could not seem to pull it back as it was
 slippery.



 I have since learned that his name may have been Carl Lewis.

                         %




Some Police then came and I helped fold some more people out but then I was told to
leave the ground.



At the time I did not have any real emotions apart from being absolutely stunned and

shocked I remember a stunned silence and I remember carrying the boy to a fence and
passing him through and the Police taking over.


I then went home to Liverpool«



I arrived back home on Saturday evening           and it was only when I got out   of the taxi   that

  reacted to the scene.          I was crying. I remember being very     upset.       I remember that

my Wife s parents were there and I was crying in the kitchen.             I also remember that
neighbours had come round and I was upset in front of them.



It was suggested to me that I should go           to bed and a locum was called out    to see me.
      , Sunday I spent most of the time sleeping, on Monday I went to a Church mass service
  for the dead as it was suggested to me that I may feel better if I attend Church, however
  I felt very upset and had to leave half way through.      I
  i




  I now i.-el that I was very lucky to not have been crushed in the incident and the thoughts
  that I may never have seen my Wife or they very young baby again distresses me.



  I also feel shaken by the fact that the Police did not seem to care about people who had

  originally packed in and they were crowded in the Section and they did not react very
  swiftly or properly to the incident.



  I also feel that the Police operations outside the ground were appalling when compared

  to last years match when there seemed to be lots of cordons of Police who were checking
  peoples tickets well before you reached the football ground.



 I also think that even if the doors had to be opened the Police should have filted
 people off into sections B & D rather than to A section.



 I have now noticed that I have a saw back which think was from lifting up peoples bodies
 and handing them over which I found more difficult I




___________________is trying to find out the
                                               exact name of the girl and the boy who died
in order that I can contact the
                                parents to express my grief.   At the moment I find that
I do not have any person upon which I can attach
                                                 my grief in order to make myself feel
  ■ter.


Originally I was told that the girl who I had held and who may have died in my arms was
Victoria Hicks however, I have been told that it was not her and it may be a Paula

Smith.

       Dear S i r s ,

       RE:       HILLSBOROUGH

       Further to the above mat t er . As you are aware we are the Legal
       Representatives of M r . John Harrison who is the father of the late
       Peter Andrew Harrison deceased who died as a result of the tragic
       events at Hillsborough in April 1989.

       We wonder whether you could confirm whether a decision as to the bring
       of a ^Prosecution for manslaughter is to be made by the Director of
       Public Prosecutions in the very near future or alternatively please
       confirm the present state of enquiries being m a d e .

       We look forward to hearing from you.

       Yours faithfully,




       Mackrell & Thomas

Dear Mr Owston

RE: DAVID DUCKENFIELD - HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER

Thank you for your letter of 1 July 1998 with enclosures.

Your letter addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions has been forwarded to me so that
I can give a more detailed preliminary answer to your representations. I have been asked
to read all the papers and make recommendations concerning the available options open to
the Crown Prosecution Service and to your request that we take over this private prosecution
in order to discontinue it.

In order that I can be sure that I have all the relevant material before me, I would be grateful
if you could let me have a schedule of any documents in your possession that you consider
to be relevant to the prosecution.

The issues raised in your letter can then be fully considered and a detailed reply given to you
as soon as possible.

I regret that I am unable to provide an estimate for the conclusion of this review as there are
a number of factors which are not within my control.


Yours sincerely




GEORGE R CROSTON

Dear Mr Owston

David Duckenfield - Hillsborough Disaster

Thank you for your letter of 1 July 1998 with enclosures.

Your letter addressed to the Director of Public Prosecutions has being forwarded to me so
that I can give a more detailed preliminary answer to your representations. I have been
asked to make recommendations to the Director about the options open to the her in this
private prosecution and to your request that we take over this prosecution in order to
discontinue it.

As you know, in 1990 the Crown Prosecution Service decided that there was insufficient
evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction against any person on any charge.
In 1997 following representations made to us by the Hillsborough Family Support group
and the provision of what was said to be new evidence, the case was considered afresh.
The new review was on the basis of whether or not the new material, if properly
investigated, might lead to a realistic prospect of conviction. The conclusion of that review
was that there was no new evidence as alleged by the HFSG and therefore no grounds for
reopening the police investigation into the Hillsborough disaster.

The Scrutiny, conducted by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith, concluded that there was no material
which should be put before the DPP which might cause her to reconsider decisions already
taken. He stated that the joint opinion of Counsel, obtained by the CPS in 1990, set out
a full, detailed and careful resume of the facts, had no error or omission, and correctly
considered both the offences of manslaughter and culpable misfeasance in a public office.
%
^ However, in order for the DPP to exercise her power under section 6(2) of the Prosecution
  of Offences Act 1985 to take over a private prosecution there must be a particular need for
  it to be done on behalf of the public. While there is no change to our previous stance that
  there would not be a realistic prospect of conviction on allegations of unlawful killing or
  misconduct in a public office (subject to the HFSG providing new evidence in their papers),
  we had not specifically considered the allegation that your client had perverted the course
  od justice by stating to the FA’s Chief Executive that Gate ‘C’ had been forced open by
  Liverpool fans.

    Further, the test that the CPS will apply, having looked at the papers provided by the
    private prosecutor, is that we will take over and discontinue the prosecution only if there
    is clearly no case to answer (as a private prosecution in these circumstances would be
    unfounded and therefore an abuse of the right to bring a prosecution) or it is not in the
    public interest to continue.

    We hope to finalise our review of this matter in the near future and you will be contacted
    as soon as possible after that.

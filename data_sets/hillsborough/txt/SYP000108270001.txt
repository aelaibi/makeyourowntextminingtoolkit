PAUL LYTHALL                 PC 283       â€¢                                                            ROTHERHAM CLD




At 8.30 a.m.          on Saturday              15 April        1989 I commenced duty at Main Street Police

Station,        Rotherham.          Along       with other officers                including my serial No 53 I was

conveyed        to Hillsborough                Football    Ground,          Sheffield          for briefing      in the         North

Stand      of   the     ground.           My    serial    sergeant          was    PS Bown of C Division Community

Liaison and the Inspector was Inspector Charles CID.

We   were       given    briefing             instructions       by    a    senior       officer       and    then    briefed         as

individual         serials.           Our      serial    53 was       deputed       to    police       the    Herries    Road       Bus

Garage where all the Nottingham Forest coaches were to be housed.

About      1100    hrs       I took    up      duties     outside       the Herries            Road    Bus    Garage my duties

being      to    direct       the     coaches      into        the    bus    sheds       and    then    to    check     supporters

coming out from the coaches.                       I continued to do the above duties.                           Approximately

74   coaches        entered         the       garage     the    last       coach    arriving          about    2.40     p.m.         The

Nottingham          fans       although          boisterous          appeared        sensible          and    reasonably            well

behaved. There was very little sign of any drunkenness from the Nottingham Forest

supporters.         At     this     time       I did not see any incident                      which would attract             Police

attention.

About      2.55 p.m.         Inspector Charles             informed our serial                  to go to Claywheels Lane.

Traffic Dept for meal.

We   had    only      been     walking         for a couple           of minutes         when I heard a message                 on PC

Bown's      radio       to    the     effect      that    there       was    some    sort       of crowd problems              at    the

Leppings Lane end of the football ground.                                  I also heard a shout on the radio "Get

the gate open, get the gate open."

Inspector         Charles       instructed         us    to halt       and    he     radioed      ground       control     that       we

were available if required.

A radio message              was    received       for us to proceed to the Leppings Lane entrance of

the ground.         As I walked along Leppings Lane I noticed large amounts of beer cans

strewn      about     in      the   roadway       and     footpaths.          There       were    also supporters milling

PAUL LYTHALL                                                                                                 QOR 262

about in the vicinity.              As we neared the ground we were halted, Inspector Charles

radioed for further instructions and a reply came back "straight into the ground,

straight into the ground."

Inspector Charles            then instructed our serial and another serial to move into the

ground.    As we moved forwards towards the entrance gate I noticed that there were

a lot of supporters               still    near to the entrance to the Leppings Lane/West Stand.

We entered through the main gate and apart from hearing bits of radio messages I

did not     know why we were              going into the ground.                       I thought            there to be a bit of

crowd    disorder       in    the West Stand.                  Upon going through                the       gate    towards      the West

Stand central tunnel entrance I then realised that there was something more than

just    crowd     disorder.         As    we      approached            the    tunnel        I     saw      spectators          all      over

running     about,      they       appeared        to      be    in     a   panic.      I    also          saw    a   couple        of   male

persons    being       dragged      out     from         the    tunnel.         I entered          the       centre         tunnel and a

strong smell of intoxicants hit me.                             I have never encountered smells as strong in

football grounds previously.                      Upon entering the tunnel we were greeted by jeers,

boos,     and loads      of       obscene      and       abusive      remarks were            directed            at us.      Supporters

pushed     and    jostled          with     us.      They        were       shouting        things          like       "you    murdering

bastards".         "you're         fuckin'       useless"         and       "why    don't        you       fucking      do something,

people     are   dying       in    there."           I    still       did     not   know     what          lay    ahead       but    it was

obvious     by    the    aggressive            attitude          of     the    crowd        that       a    wrong      word     in       their

direction would have caused us a lot of trouble.                                     The situation in the tunnel was

very volatile          but   due    to our numbers                being       small,    no action was                  taken.        It was

obvious that a large amount of Liverpool supporters were the worse for drink.

As   we moved down the              tunnel we            gradually got          separated amongst                     the    crowd.       The

crowd was very hostile               and as myself and others tried to get into the stand the

crowds made       no    immediate         efforts to move.                  It was still not clear to me what had

happened.        By now radio links were non existent.                               As we moved into the West Stand

the first thing I noticed were people on the pitch.                                         I thought at first there had

been    a pitch     invasion        but     as    I motfed down the                 stand I saw people                      lying on the

ground      towards       the       bottom       of       the      stand.            I then    saw a       supporter             trying      to

struggle      to    pick       up       a male      body.         I     assisted and          helped       carry          the person      out

through     the     tunnel        to     the    back       of      the       stand. This       man appeared               to    be   a blue

colour and was lifeless.

Another     police        officer         who    had       assisted          commenced        to    give    mouth          to    mouth    but

after    several         attempts        it was obvious                there was no response                and due to the fact

that there was no first aid facilities                                 at the rear of the stand at this stage, we

laid this man with two others who appeared dead.

The   man    I    carried        out     was     about      5'     10"       tall,    20 years old,          slim          build,     light

brown short hair, wearing denim jeans,                                 he smelled of intoxicants.

There was        still panic            and hysteria at                the back of the stand.                     I       went back down

the   tunnel       into the stand and I assisted in carrying another male person out of

the   stand.       Again we         laid him down at the rear of the stand.                                 This man again aged

about 20 years slim build and short light brown hair was still alive although he

was     unconscious.                I    laid       him     in    the        recovery     position          and       sought         medical

assistance        but     the only assistance                    was    an ambulance near to the gate and it was

obvious     that        no-one      could assist            immediately.              By this time there were numerous

casualties         at    the     rear     of     stand some            appeared       dead,        some    unconscious            and some

hysterical.             People were        coming up to Police Officers screaming to help to find

friends,     relations           and      when      informed           you    could    not     help       them    immediately            they

became a b u s i v e .

A young boy came up to me and asked me if I had seen his dad.                                                    I took him to one

side and told him not to worry his dad would turn up. A Liverpool fan aged about

40 years     came        up to me and offered to look after the young boy.                                                I accepted his

offer.      By this time two ambulances had arrived and with assistance from a police

officer     and     two    civilians           we     carried      the       unconscious man              towards          the ambulance

and handed him over to ambulancemen who placed him with others in the ambulance.

I then assisted in carrying others to the ambulance point.

I also carried with others                      two bodies one of them being the man I had initially
                                                                                                                      ^        ,__ lL__ li

PAUL LYTHALL                                                                                         QOR 262

carried out from the stand.                     We placed them near to the ambulance point.

An    inspector then              instructed myself and some                other officers to go and clear the

tunnel    and        keep    it clear       and    don't      allow    supporters        back    into    the West      Stand.

This     was        difficult       to     achieve     especially          with    people    stating         they    had    lost

relatives           and wanted       to    find    them.       We    had    to let them into the             stand.    Dozens

approached asking                 if match had been           abandoned or not. We were unable to give an

answer.        We    were     unable       to   say    where       bodies    and    casualties        were    being     taken.

People were very aggressive because no information was forthcoming.

Whilst    inside        the       ground    club      stewards      were    non existent        apart    from some young

girls who continually brought trays of cups of water for fans and helpers alike.

The club stewards were not in evidence.                             Eventually an announcement was made over

the    loudspeaker           system        stating      the    match       had    been   abandoned.       The       supporters

started    to leave           the    ground.      After a short while when most fans had dispersed I

assisted in collecting various bits of property up from the tunnel and stand area

including           shoes,    coats,       scarves,       hats      etc.     All    placed      in    polythene      bags    and

placed at front of West Stand.

Then     requested           to    obtain       details       of    possible      witnesses      to     incident.          Names

collected and passed to PC collating them.

Remained in West Stand until stand emptied.

I then made my way to the North Stand where others had congregated.

Dear Mr Ediss

I refer to a letter from Mr Alan Brown to yourself on
5 October 1989, a copy of which is attached for your reference. As
we have not yet received a reply to this letter I would be most
grateful if you could give this matter your early attention.

Following on from Lord Justice Taylor's Final Report this division
is currently in the process of revising the 'Guide to Safety at
Sports Grounds' (the Green Guide). As part of this process I would
be grateful to receive any comments which you wish to make on the
recommendations relating to the provision of First Aid etc. (I
attach a copy of these recommendations). Your assistance is greatly
appreciated.

                                                  Yours sincerely




                                                  Steve Bilbe

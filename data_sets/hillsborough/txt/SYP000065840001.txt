                 I am a single man and                I reside at the above address.

                 On S a t u r d a y ,    15th April       1 9 8 9 / I a t t e n d ed the H i l l s b o r o u g h P .A.        Cup

                 Semi-F i n a l .        I support Liwe/r poo 1,

                 I t r a ve l l e d to the         game alone        on a coach run by Barnes                    Trave 1, Anfifdd,

                 I p u r ch a s e d the       coach ticket       from W in ga t es         Travel,         St.   Johns

                 Precinct,          L i v erpool   C i t y Centre.         The     coach     left L i verpool         at about

                 10.45 a.m.             The   coach was       full    of supporters.

                 I p u rchased my m a t c h ticket              from A n f i e l d .        I am a S e a s o n Ticket

                 holder.         I paid £6 for          it,    a L e p pi n gs Lane        Terr ac e       ticket.       I no

                 longer have            the   ticket.      My father         returned         it to L i verpool          F .C . on

                 T u e s d a y 9t h May       1989 for a       refund.        My    name a n d a d dr es s        is w r it t e n

                 on the      back       of the ticket.

                 We did not          stop on the way           to S h e f f i e l d of our own volition.

    However,         our     coach was      s t op pe d     by the Police              yn four occasions.

    The    first         of these    stops was about one m i i V 'b e fo r e we                       reached

    S heffield.            1 cannot      remember          our     precise       route.       The traffic             became

    c on g e s t e d as we a p p r o a c h e d Sheffield.

    E ach time we were              s t op pe d    by the Police we had the                     same tre at me nt

    a nd   procedure         that    is to say,            officers        boar de d the        coach an d           checked

    our bags         for any alcohol.                No one        p ossessed an y alcohol.                   The

    o ff i c e r s told us that we must                    possess        tickets       otherwise we w o ul d not

    be a l l o w e d     entry     into the ground.                E ve ryone      was a sked the q u e st i on

    "Have yo u got t i ckets."                    E ve ry o ne     had tickets          on our      coach.

    We a r r i v e d at S h e f f i el d at a p p r o x i m a t e l y           1.45    pm   < 1 3 4 5 ).     I did not

    see any       supporters         con s u m in g alcohol           on the w ay to the ground.                         A f ew

    pubs were            closed.     Some were          open,       there were          no unruly fans as                far as

    I could s e e .          The    coach was          parked near to the                transport Police

    Station.           All   of the     s up po rt er s were          orderly,          I did not see an y bad

    We did not            receive any Po li ce             escort     from the          coach to the ground.                      I

    a r r i v e d at t h e L ep pi ng s Lane            entrance          of the       gr ou nd at about £ p . m .

    The    p e r imeter       railing     gates were             open.      The    queues       at the t ur ns t il e s

    were    o r d e r l y at this       time,        perhaps        ten    persons       in each queue.                My

    ticket      had       entrance     *C * w r i t t e n on it,           so    I went      to use the terr ac e

                   These     four    friends went             to a shop,        they e nt e re d the ground a fter                    I.

                   did,      I saw them          later     in the          ground.     All    ten of us stood toget he r                    in

                   the L e p p i n g s Lane        terrace.

                   I saw about        one       in three         fans      searched at       the    turnstiles,          after    having

                   gone    through the t ur n s ti le s              I was s e a r ch e d by a Pja'Ci c e m a n . I did not

               Lepping           lane.         These    barrierfs had thy effect                   of separ at in g       terrace,

                   b efore    they entered the                perirrl^? ter/gates.           These     barriers were            not

                   used    this y e a r .

                   1 did not see any s te wards                     di recting the          fans.      I had no d i f fi c ul t y

                   finding my entry point as                      this      is the    fo ur th time       I have        been to this

                   ground.       There was            no d i ff i c u l t y entering         the    ground.        I did not          see

               any open gates.                   As    I e n te re d     through the t ur n st i le             there    is a double

                   gate    to the     left       inside       the    ground.         This    gate was       closed.        I

                   r emember     this as there was a steward s ta nd i ng                           there d ri nking a cup of

               tea.          I did not see an y u n au t h o r i s e d               e ntry to the ground.

               As        I got   to the         entrance         to the ground         I could hear             lots of    people

s aying     they had no tickets.                      The y were     trying     to buy tickets           off

anyone      they      could.      I heard        some    supporters         saying     they were       going          to

offer m o n e y to the            ’Gate * men to try and get                   in,   a lt ho ug h    I did       not

witness anybody actually                     do i ng this.

Once    1 got      inside      the      gr ou nd      I did not see any signs                d irecting me to

my m a t c h viewing          point.         E v er y on e was     using     the     centre     tunnel      to Pens

3 and 4,        so we went         this w ay as well.

We had a free           passage a lo ng            the tunnel,        this was aro un d 2 .1 5             pm    <

six    of us went        thro ug h        the    t u n n e l together.         I did not see any Police

or stew a r d      control        at    this     point.

Last    year     there were            s te wa rd s    behind the turnstiles,                looking at

supporters         tickets as           they     came thro ug h and          d irecting       fans    to various

points       in the g r o u n d .

I did not see any d is or de r                   or    c on su mption      of alcohol        inside    the

ground.         The    six of us took              up our m a t ch view in g          position       in Pan 3

near    to the        back wall.           At a p p r o x i m a t e 1y 2 .25 pm       ( 1 4 2 5 ) we were        joined

there     by the       other      four     lads,

        ,                               We st a y ed at this           l oc at io n for about         ten minutes.

The    crowd star t e d gett in g               closer    together.          I noticed that           the       pen

was    getting        quite f u l l , we we re getting                j os t le d a b o u t .    We were         be i ng

pushed to the front                by the        crowd.       W i t h in   ten m i nu t es    of taking          up my

m a t c h v i ewi ng position,              1 had      been   pushed to the           front     of the      pen,

about     two    people       in front          of me,     I was w i t h i n       an arms length           of the

front       railing.        Our    g ro up got split            up in the          crush.     I nitially

                        ,                               and   I stayed       t o g ether     in the    crowd.

The    pressure was u n b e 1 i e v a b l e .            The three         of us were        pushed to the

front     of the       pen.       I don't        know what h a p p e n e d         to the     rest of my group.

The    three     of us were            pushed      into a blue         crush       bar r i e r during the

crush,      this      barrier was about 8 feet awa y                       from the front           fence.

             ind                were      to rny left.         E ve ry on e    in front       of us were

duck i n g    down u n d er n ea t h this             barrier.     The       pressure       from behind was

unbearable.            I saw a r o u nd        this time        that    the    players were          coming       onto

the    pitch.         I knew that          if we a l lo w ed our se lv es            to get stuck a gainst

the    barrier,        we    could be         in serious       trouble,        so as       soon as we       reached

the    barrier,        I told I                 and               to duck       u n d e r n e at h the

barrier.           The y did this.             It was      impossible         to push back against                the

crowd.

I ducked u n d e r n e a t h this             barrier.         This was       the    barrier       that

eventual ly col lapsed.                  As    I. ducked u n d er n ea t h      it,    I was       pushed forard

a g a i n and s l i ghtly to the               left.

P e o p l e were      s c reaming an d         shouting,        trying       to get out of the front

gate.        This     gate was about            four     or five       feet    to my       left.     There were

fans    trying        to push a g a i ns t        this     closed gate,         trying       to get       out.     I

saw a Police Offi c e r                 keep this       gate    closed by stand in g            up agai ns t       it

a nd s p r eading       his arms          out wide a g ai ns t         it, .leaning on it w it h his

back,    facing        the    pitch.

E v e r y o n e was    heading          towards       this gate,       the    pressure       of the       crowd

forced       it open,        t he P o l i c e m a n    could not hold          it.    ___________________ got

onto    the    pitch thro ug h this               g a t e , ________ was       right       behind him about

to fo ll ow h im            when    there was a great surge                   from behind.           I heard

s o me b od y behind me shout                 "The bars gone"            It s o un de d      like a middle

aged    bloke.

This    surge       caused                    to be     pushed f o rw a rd and down a ga in st               the

front    of the        pen.        His    face was forced down,                he was       h a lf wa y t h ro ug h

the gate       but unable           to move.           Pe op le were w al k in g       over     him to get

out.      I later       found out          that       he was    pulled       clear    by

a nd                            although        I did not w i tn es s          this.

I was    unable        to    reach the gate.               I could see         reporters        on the      pitch

taking       photographs           of    injured and dying,             instead of helping                them.

Im me d i a t e l y after                  got thro u gh the gate                 I saw                               run

on to the       pj_tch,      h e s poke     to Steve N IC H OL L and Steve Me M A H O N . I d o n ’t

know how h e ’d got on to the                    pitch.        He     later told me that he                  climbed

over    the front         fence.

This was       recorded by the             t el ev i si o n    crewrecording               the m a t c h ,

The    next    thing       I remember       is                                run across          the     pitch,

b ehind the goal            in front       of the L ep pi n gs Lane               fence?      I raised my

right ar m      into the air and shou te d                    'I'                      '      He heard me,

stopped,       saw me,       and he    cl imbed on to the front                      fence     to try and get

me out.        He    could not quite             reach my           right   hand.-     I was       upright       in

the    crush,       but    I could feel          bodies       u nd er n ea t h me.         E ve ry on e   a r o u nd me

then.    The Po li ce Officer              said,     "Get      back an d       leave       them alone,

More Police were             coming a long and                          and                were    pushed off to

the    left by that Po li ce Officer.

For about a ten mi nu te              period,       fans were           crawling       over       peoples       heads

and    climbing       the front       fence       to try and ./get out.                This       included

children as young as ten.                     However,         W n e n they got        to “the fence at               the

front,     there were         two p o l i c e m e n dj/rectly in front                 of me forcing

people     back      in the    crowd.         T he y /w e re        using   t ru nc he on s     to do this.

They were       not       hitting    people jwith t h e m , r a t h e r , they were                     using    the

tips    of the       trun ch eo ns    to    pj/sh people             back   into     the     pens.

Before     1 lost /consciousness,                 at about 3 .20            pm,    there were about              10 ™

15 people a r o u n d m e , thay were all                     d e a d , pi us some         others       underf oot

who must also h'ave been dead.                       The      10 or     15 a r o u n d me were all

upr ight      in the       cXjisjp^ they had all              turned blue.

I was saying          things     to them,         like     “Come       on mate,       bre at he ."         I knew

                                                                                                           S1010

deep down that           they were        d e a d , but    I just    did not want            them t o .

I remember         a y o ut h on the        pitch,      he was about 21 years                old,    I cannot

remember        a ny th in g     else about      him.      He was    pointing      to a you ng st er             in

the    crowd      in front        of me saying        things     like    “Pull    our    kids       head

back,."        There was a P o l i c e m a n       next    to him saying,         "Get       back."        The

21 year        old said to the P oliceman,                 "My b rother's        there,       h e ’s d ying."

The P o l i c e m a n   replied,        “Just    go a wa y before        I arrest you."              I d o n ’t

know what         h ap pe ne d    to him then.          I could not see          this    lads       brother

but    I think       he was       in front      of m e .

I remember                                  returning       to the front         fence at about 3 . 2 0

pm.     He was       looking       for me and his own brother                                He saw m e „         I

must    have jLost consc io us ne ss             then because        I cannot      r e m e m b e r what

h ap pe ne d    until yibout 3 . 4 0        p.m.

I woke        up then,     in the same          position,       there was     less      pressure       from

behind me        then.         I was    upright,      w ith my head slum pe d f o rw ar d on to

a n ot he r    person.         I must    have moved my head             I h eard a m an say           " H e ’s

still     alive."

There was a dead b o d y , a m a n               leani ng on m e , someone m ov ed this                    body,

and    I fell      back.         To my s ur pr is e     I was able       to kee p my feet.              I wa

still     in a daze.             There were about F o rt y          bodies m o s t ly male,           s 1umped

on the t er races a r o u nd me.                M an y were     still    upright.        The    bodies       in

front     of me were           lying    s 1umped agai nst the f ront             fence.        Some were

lying     flat     on the terraces.

1 half        crawled half w a 1ked back              t h ro ug h the    tunnel.        As    I came       out    of

the    back     of the tunnel           I saw an a mb u la n ce      parked      behind       the West S t a n d ,

A St.     Johns A m bu la nc e         man a s k e d me    if   I w a n t e d an y help.         I said no,

I just w a n t ed       to be awa y from the ground.

I left the gro un d an d went and sat on a wall                           in L ep pi ng s Lane,            close

to a shop.           X bought a         can of Coke and sat             on the wall          drinking       it.

X w a lk e d    back    to the       coach still        dazed.

As    I got on the          coach     I remember           o ve r- he a ri n g    on a tran si st or        radio,

that E v e r t o n had just kic ke d off                   for the      second half         of the     other

semi-Final          at V il la     park-

After about an hour on the                   coach         I got off an d went             to

house     near       to the C oa ch      park     in S h e f f ie l d and t e le p ho n ed my

g ir l fr i e n d    in Liverpool.          I boar de d the            coach an d we went            back    to

Liverpool,           got home at about 9              pm.       I had a shower.




After     the m a t ch was         stopped,       all      the Police        se em ed    to want      to do was

to tell       people       to do as      they were          told,      if not      they w ou ld get

arrested.           They seemed to be act in g                  like    robots.          I did not see any

Police O ff i c er s        r e cu si ta ti ng    people,        inside      or outside         the ground.

The    only      people who        seemed    to be aware            of what        to do were        the fi r e m e n .

On    returning        to the      coach we a p p r o a c h e d Police Of f i cers               by the      coach

a n d a s ke d      if we could use         the    telep ho ne s        located       in their T ra n sp o rt

Pol ic e Station.               They said no,         we    could not,           we w o u l d have    to use       the

public      phones.         I    found this d i ff ic ul t           to u n d e r s t a n d , it seemed

heartless.

I believe           that   the    ticket    allo cat ion for            this m a t c h     by the F .A » was

ridiculous.           Both they and the Po li ce must                    have      thought      it went      O.K.

last y e a r , we will            repeat    the a llocation.

The gro u n d        itself      is badly d e s i g n e d .        The a p p r o a c h    from L e p pi n gs      Lane

is    like a bottleneck.

The Pol i c e        g e nerally     j ust did not seem to have any                       traini ng or

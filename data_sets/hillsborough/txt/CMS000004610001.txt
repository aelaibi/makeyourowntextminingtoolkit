       ground Improvements


1,     Lord Justice Taylor’s report says that


                no     capital       allowances can be claimed against tax in
                respect of ground improvements (para 109);


                fiscal      provisions        penalise    the     redevelopment      of
                grounds        but     encourage payment of huge t.r' ^fer fees
                (para 115).


He does not specifically recommend tax                 changes;     but    h-     pons
suggestions     for     further        tax   reliefs put to him by the i          tbali
authorities, and suggests that the               rules    on    napital     allowances
might bear re-examination.


Background and,comment


2,    Both of Lord JusticeTaylor's                  statements are misleading.


3,    In summary -


a,    alcanafeg teas


       The     tax     rules     are    in   keeping     with     normal    accounting
       principles and treat transfer payments received by the club
       selling        the   players as a taxable trading receipt and as a
       deduction in computing the taxable profits                    of    the   buying
       club.        In other words, tax is neutral in this respect,


b,    Expenditure onijnpro-Y.lng stands

       Depending       on      the circumstances, this can - and frequen              »
       does     -    already     qualify      for    capital      allowances     under
       existing law.
                           (B&TVUcI^
       Safety measures


       Expenditure   on   safety     measures,       which     are certified as
       necessary by the appropriate authority,               already    qualifies
       for tax relief at the plant and machinery rate of 25%.                   And
       if any expenditure on       new   seating     did     not   qualify      for
       relief   under the normal capital allowances rules, it would
       nevertheless still qualify        for   the    same      (25%)    rate    of
       relief   if provision of the seating, or indeed a newstand,
       were made a condition of a safety certificate,

       Relief would only help the big profitable clubs.                 But   many
       clubs are not making taxable profits.


Line to take

4,    Not   normal   to comment on tax matters at this time of                year
(i.e. in advance of Budget),
                                  ftSffciC'TS)
  1)     fiool Betting Duty and VAT


The report recommends *


Either - the Government donating an amount equivalent                        to    2 *a%    of
pool stakes to football ££
reducing pool betting duty from 42*$% to 40% with the extra benefit
going to football and
removing VAT from Spot the Ball competitions.


Background comment

Football already benefits from pools promoters.                       They   pay        2.251
stakes   after duty (£l4m last year) to the Football League for use
of the fixture lists and 21%         turnover          (£9m    last     year)      to      the
Football Trust from "Spot the Ball".


Government     assistance    would       amount       to hypothecation of revenue
which is undesirable.


Furthermore pool       betting    duty     is     a   tax     on   gambling       not      on
football.      Those   who   do    the    pools       do not necessarily support
football.


Ling to taka

Not normal to comment on tax matters in period before Budget.

         additional information. Please return it to my coroner's officer

                 It is my normal practice not to issue subpoenas or summonses to
                               'If!’-10 att6nd at Inquests as 1 find that most people
                 are perfectly willing to come to Inquests by invitation.

                You will appreciate that with Inquests of the size and complexity
                the^t^ rf W      the Hillsborough Disaster it is very important that
                the attendance of witnesses should go as smoothly as it is possible to
                     f6,     therefore would like to have your confirmation that if I
                withnn? re<1UKSt y0U t0 attend as.a witness you will in fact do so

        Dear Sirs,

        Re:   RES UME D INQUESTS 19th NOVE MB ER 1990.



        If you are not already aware, I intend to resume the Inquests into the deaths
        of the 95 people w h o died at Hillsborough, one or more of w h o m you represent,
        on the 19th of No vember 1990 at 1 0.a.m.  Details of venue wil l be notif ie d in
        due course.

        I do not have to remind you of the fact that a considerable amount of
        evidence has already been taken, n or of the nature and limitations of a
        coronal i nve st igation w h i c h you will recollect is not adversarial but
        inquisitorial in nature, and w h i c h of course has only limited objectives.

        Subject to the C o r o n e r s ’ Act 1988 and the C o r o n e r s ’ Rules, the Inquest is
        un de r my control, and in particular, it is my responsibility to select the
        wi tn esses w h o w i s h to give evidence.   I am at present engag ed in considering
        this and in de termining who I w i s h to invite to attend.

       W i t ho ut pre jud ic e in any way to my rights in the matter, I am w r i t i n g to you
       to give you an o pportunity to dr aw to my attention the names and other
       ap propriate details of any witness or witnesses w h o m you w o u l d like me to
       cons id er calli ng to give evidence at the resumed Inquests.

       M a y I please ask you in consi der in g w h e t h e r you w i s h to d r a w any names                     to my
       attention, to bear in m i n d the scope and limitations of an Inquest.

       I also want to make it a bsolutely clear that the submission of a name or
       names for c o n s ide ra tio n is n o t hi ng more than that, and that the d ecision as
       to w h o to call to give evidence is and remains a m a t t e r for me.

       I w o u l d be grateful if you could respond as soon as possible. If I have not
       h e ar d from you by the end of September I will assume you have no names to
       submit.

       Yours    faithfully,

         Re:   H I LLS BO RO UGH RESUMED INQUESTS.                                                                             ,

         I have had some requests for a Pre-Inquest review in order to enable an
         exchange of views to take place between m y s e l f and representatives on
         procedural matters, w i t h the object of ensuring that as far as possible the
         Inquests p r ope r run smoothly w i t h the m i n i m u m amount of delay and to the best
         advantage.

         1 have n o w decid ed that this revie w should take place on Tuesday
         30th O c t obe r 1990 at the Medic o Legal Centre, Water y Street, Sheffield at
         2 p.m.                                                    '■

         A l t h o u g h this m e e t i n g is intended for legal representatives, I w o u l d not
         raise any o b j e c tio n if interested parties w i s h e d to attend to see w h a t was
         going on, subject of course to us not exceeding the space availability at
         the M ed ico Legal Centre.

         I w o u l d be g rateful if yo u could please con fir m to me that you w o u l d like to
         at tend the review.



         Yours   faithfully,




         S.L.Popper,
         H.M.Coroner.

              Dear

                                               Resumed Hillsborough Inquests

              Further to earlier correspondence I have now decided that hearing your
              evidence at the resumed Inquests would be helpful.

              Accordingly you should present yourself at. the Town Ilall, Pinstone

              St., Sheffield on                                           the                                      1990

             at                             a.m/p.m. Please go to the main
             reception desk and ask for the Listing Officer Hillsborough Inquests.
             A street plan is enclosed to assist you.

             You will appreciate that the smooth running of the inquests and the
             minimising of stress and distress to every one is dependent on people
             being on time and available and your cooperation in this regard i®
             both requested and thanked for in anticipation.

             You will I am sure also realise that, organising the witnesses for
             inquests of this complexity presents major problems. For example it is
             often impossible to predict precisely how long the evidence of a
             particular witness is likely to take. Although it is regretted, it is
             anticipated that rearrangements may have to be made often at short
             notice. You should therefore be prepared to come on a different date
             to that specified and in your planning for events around the above
             mentioned date you should allow for this.

             It is therefore essential that you should keep in touch with
             the listing officer Det. Sgt I         He can be reached on
              021__________. You should check with him 48 hours before the above
             date and again 24 hours before so that he can keep you informed of any
             likely changes as they affect your attendance and so avoid unnecessary
             inconvenience to yourself. Should your times or dates have to be
             rearranged we take this opportunity of apologising for the
             inconvenience this may cause you and thank you for your forbearance.

                       The amount reimbursable in respect of financial loss, subsistence
                       and travel costs are laid down by regulation. When you arrive you
                       will be given a form so that you can make the appropriate claim for
                       travel and subsistence before you leave, Please note that
                       reimbursement for overnight accommodation will not be made unless
                       prior approval has first been obtained.

                       If you intend to make a claim for financial loss then please make
                       sure that when you come you let us have your employers name and
                       address together with a payroll reference if you have one so that the
                       amount of your claim in this respect can be established and paid
                       subject to and in accordance with the regulations. Payment will be
                       made by cheque to you at your home address.

                       As far as travel is concerned you should assume that the amount
                       reimbursable will be based on appropriate public transport costs
                       such as coach or uecond class rail fare whether or not you use your
                       car.

                       We hope that the foregoing is clear to you but if y o u do have any
                       particular problems please get in touch with Sgt,            who will do
                       his best to assist. Please however remember that he is likely to be
                       very busy.

                       Please acknowledge receipt of this letter by signing the attached form
                       and returning it in the^envelope provided.

 Re: Coaches

               I have his statement tut not his questionaire which
               I think will give his time of arrival in Sheffield
               Describes late arrival of coaches I think

         has found 4 coach drivers but they all arrived
relatively early. Do we have any statements fran the managers
of the firms eg Amberline as to the nunber of coaches and their
arrival time. I am writing to Mr.         md Ms        both
of whom have asked for seme evidence on caoch arrival to give me
specific names but in the mean while I think it would be useful if
we could find some drivers who cane on the late side. We might then be
able to dispense with PC       I think that we might be able to produce
the evidence of some of the coach drivers as documentary evidence.
The names of the four drivers are:




Finally I think we have had a letter from Hamncnd Suddard re Mr. Seaman
It enclosed a statement but I cannot remember what has becane of either
the letter or the statement. Can we see if we can retrive it?
H/5/6/2 12/1/91 revision of names to be called and postponed
as of that date subject ot revision and adjustment.

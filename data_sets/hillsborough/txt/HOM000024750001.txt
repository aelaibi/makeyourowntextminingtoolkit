    Dear Sir,

    The enclosed letter is self-explanatory.

    Quite clearly despite Mr Moynihan's many protestations that the national
    membership scheme will cost soccer nothing and could well be a profitable
    enterprise, here is one large finance house in the City who dont believe
    so.

    Yours faithfully.

TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH MR STURT

MONDAY, 4th MARCH 1991, at 5.30 pm.

 I discussed with him what he thought about simply reading part of
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ptatement, leaving out the controversial bit. He
thought this was an acceptable way     %        analag&s
statement in criminal proceedings.


He took^the view that if I felt that any Jury properly directed
could^reach a verdict of Unlawfully Killed in respect of any
particular person then I ought to withdraw that verdict from
the Jury in respect of him, even if I left it available in
respect of others.


He was surprised that counsel took a contrary view. He said that
he would be interested to see the draft direction on law and
he also very generously offered to be available for discussion
and indeed to come up to Sheffield if I felt I needed his support.

                                          stands and the west terraces;

on the west terraces and for spreading spectators everily through
the pens on those terraces;


obtained a safety certificate on the false representation to the City
Council that they had agreed a system of crowd control with the
Police;


failed to appreciate that by reason of the existence of the radial
fences, the projecting walls at the rear of pens 3 and 4 and the size
and position of the gates in the radial fences, the crowd required
assistance from stewards and/or Police to enable even spread to be
achieved;


failed to inform the Police of the estimated flow rate through the
turnstiles a t the Leppings Lane end;


failed to observe that by 2.45 p.m. at the latest pens 3 and 4 were

failed   to station any or sufficient stewards in the concourse
between the turnstiles and the west stand wall to enable, if and
where necessary, the direction of spectators from any pen which

plans for the closing of the tunnel situate under the west stand
either by closing one or both doors, by moveable barriers, by a
 cordon of Police or stewards, or by any other means;


 failed to inform the stewards and/or Police between turnstiles and
 the west stand wall that by 2.45 p.m. a t the latest pens 3 and 4

steward or otherwise and/or to the stewards in the area between
the turnstiles and the tunnel that by 2.45 p.m. a t th e latest, pens 3

failed to warn the Football Association and/or the Sheffield City
Council and/or the First Defendants that in the event of as few as
one third of the total capacity of the north and west stands and the
west terraces arriving in Leppings Lane within a period of                                        15

          the turnstiles area adjacent thereto of sufficient numbers to
          justify the closure of the road and which had caused some
          six to eight thousand people to be in th e lane, with more
          expected, by evaluating the situation and by giving orders for
          the control of the numbers joining the already stationary

                              employed by the Post Office. Levels.           It is anticipated th at his
                              future employment would be worthy of greater remuneration than
                              th at obtained by him from the Post Office a t the time of his
                              injuries.    The Plaintiff's claim therefore includes a claim both for
                              lost future earnings and, as the life expectancy of the Plaintiff has
                              been reduced, for loss of earnings during the lost years.
                                                                                                     the
                              Plaintiff will also seek damages for the cost of future nursing care,
                              other treatm ent, the cost of adapting the accommodation which has
                              been purchased to house him for his special needs, and to bring that
                              property into a fit and habitable condition, and all ancillary m atters
                              necessary for the future care of the Plaintiff in his current state,
                              to include if necessary any sum to represent the nursing care
                              provided by any member of his family. The Plaintiff will also seek
                              to recover damages for the increased annual cost of housing, the
                              cost of medical aids, and also the costs of and incidental to having
                              to have his affairs administered on his behalf because of his
                              disability including the costs of proceedings           in the Court of
                              Protection on an indemnity basis.



                              The above is the nature of the Plaintiff's claim, and is not meant to
                              be exhaustive. Further details will be provided in due course and on
                              discovery.

   Dear Sirs,


   Andrew S. Devine - Hillsborough


   We refer to our recent telephone conversation. We do not know whether you have yet
   heard from E. Rex Makin & Co., but we have written to them to tell them that we now
   have instructions from our Clients that we will not oppose their Application for
   Judgment against the Second Defendant in this action. We have also asked them to
   discontinue against your Clients' in the way in which they have in other cases and we
   have told them that if they fail to do that and cause unnecessary expense being
   incurred we will refer the correspondence to the Court in connection with the
   responsibility for those costs.

   We would not have thought                           there was any necessity for you                                         to attend before         the
   Registrar on Friday.



   Yours faithfully,

Dear Mr. Summers,
Re;   Andrew S » Devine - Hillsborough
I refer to our telephone conversation today and enclose a copy
of my facsimile letter to E. Rex Makin & Co* concerning the
hearing tomorrow,
I confirm that the Club will not be represented at the hearing,
as clearly there is no point given the agreement to allow
Judgment to be entered.    However, I would be grateful if you
would kindly explain our position to the Court as no
discourtesy is intended by reason of our non-attendance.
Yours sincerely,




Enel:

          Andrew Devine - Hillsborough

          Thank you for your letter of 12th December, 1990.

          We enclose copy of letter dated 11th December which we have received from
          Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords, together with a copy of our reply theretb.

          Our Client has a valid claim against those responsible for the disaster who include
          those you represent. They have failed to deal with the m atter satisfactorily as is
          abundantly clear from the correspondence what deal has been reached between
          those responsible.

          Your approach is misconceived. Before asking for the proceedings to be
          discontinued against your clients, what steps do you propose to take to ensure th at
          our client is protected in the way in which he would have been, had Judgment been
          obtained against the Second Defendant on 15th December 1989?

Dear Sirs,


Andre** Xtevine — Hillsborough


Thank you for your letters of the 6th and 10th December. We are not at present
prepared to consent to your Summonsand in any event you are seeking directions? and
we have not been given any indication of the directions you seek. If you will let us
bear from you with your suggestions we will take instructions.

In the meantime we understandfrom Messrs. Davies Arnold       & Cooper                                                                   that you     have
served the Summons, the Statement of Claim and the Affidavit on them.

As you know an agreement has been reached between the Defendants and there, i.s
therefore no necessity for you to continue with your action against         the first
Defendants here.   In other cases you    have discontinued against theFirst Defendants
on the basis that the Plaintiff will not be responsible for the First Defendants
costs and it would therefore seem appropriate for you to discontinue against the
First Defendants in this action to avoid unnecessary costs beingincurred.       This
letter is written as an open letter and we reserve the right to refer the same to the
Court in connection with the question of the costs in relation to the First
Defendants generally should that become an issue at a later stage in these
proceedings.


 Yours faithfully,




 WE-TGI1TMAN RUTHERFORDS

           Andrew Devine - Hillsborough

           Thank you for your lette r of the 11th December 1990.

           It would be helpful if you could deal with our outstanding correspondence which is
           exhibited to our Affidavit.

           Our client requires to have a Judgment which will provide for damages to be
           assessed by the Court at a later date. It is your refusal to agree to such a
           Judgm ent being entered which has caused us to have to proceed in the way in
           which we have done. We enclose undertaking and declaration - please sign and
           return to us.

           Are you contending th at our client has all the benefits to which he would be
           en titled if Judgment had been entered against your client on 15th December 1989
           If so, why is th ere reluctance to agree to Judgment being entered? If not, please
           will you identify precisely what advantages you are trying to maintain for your
           client in not having Judgment entered against him.

           We have w ritten to Messrs. Davies Arnold & Cooper indicating th at we do not
           require them to serve a Defence prior to the Hearing on 21st December 1990. If
           Judgment in suitable term s is obtained on th at date for the Plaintiff it would
           appear th a t the main consequential direction th at would be required is one th at the
           Action be set down for Assessment (or approval) on our Certification th at the
           action was ready for th at determination.

Defendant with damages to be assessed on 15th December 1989.


For the avoidance of any possible doubt all consequential advantages which
the Plaintiff would have derived had such a judgment been obtained on
15th     December 1989 will be payable by the Second Defendant                 who
expressly agrees     to the Plaintiff enforcing such advantages in the same

                                 2ND AFFIDAVIT SWORN ON 10th DECEMBER 1990



                I, ROBIN SIMON GRAHAM MAKIN, Solicitor with E. Rex Makin & Co., of
                Whitechapel, Liverpool, LI 1HQ, MAKE OATH and say as follows:-


                 1.               That I have the conduct of this m atter on behalf of the
                                 Plaintiff and am duly authorised to make this Affidavit in
                                 support of the Plaintiff’s application for Judgment pursuant to
                                 Order 1^ of the Rules of the Supreme Court.


                 2.               That I   make   this Affidavit    from   facts   within   my    own
                                 knowledge, or information which I have received which I believe
                                 to be true.


                 3.               That I annex hereto marked "RSGM 3" a copy of th e Statem ent
                                 of Claim and that I am          able from my own knowledge to
    FROM   E REX   Mfl KIN   CO                                                                             P .   2




                                  confirm paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim.           I can also
                                  confirm paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Statem ent of Claim, they
                                  are m atters of common public knowledge.


                      4.          That I can further confirm the contents of paragraph 5 of the
                                  Statement of Claim.     I understand from my instructions from
                                  the parents of the Plaintiff that he left in good health to
                                  attend the football match at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April
                                  1989, and later that day was admitted to the Royal Hallamshire
                                  Hospital in Sheffield in a deeply unconscious state,
                                                                   I believe that the Plaintiff was
                                  injured in one or other of pen 3 or pen 4 of the west terrace of
                                  Hillsborough Football Ground (I annex hereto marked "RSGM V
                                  a copy of a planof the ground) and th at      his injuries occurred
                                  at the     time when what is now known         as the Hillsborough
                                  Disaster took place.


                      5.          That I can further confirm that the Particulars of Negligence
                                  alleged against the Second Defendant are proper allegations to
                                  make,     i verily believe that the allegations made against the
                                  Second Defendant in paragraph 7 of the Statem ent of Claim
                                  can be supported fully or in part by the findings of      the Right
                                  Honourable Lord Justice Taylor in his interim report dated the
                                  1st August 1989 dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.
                                  Extracts from that report (pages      1 to 47 (inclusive) 49 to 50
                                  and 54) are reproduced and annexed hereto marked "RSGM 5" -
                                  paragraph 268 on page 47 and chapter 18 in pages 49 to 50
                                  appearing to be extremely relevant.


                      6.          That my instructions also confirm that the heads of damage
                                  pleaded    in    the Statement of Claim     are   correct,   and     in
                                  particular from my own knowledge I can sta te that a property
                                  known      as                  ~~| specially suitable   (following
                                  adaptation/building works) has been purchased for the needs of
                                  the Plaintiff.    Exhibited as "RSGM 1" to my First Affidavit
                                  sworn on 14th August 1990 was a copy of the medical report
                                  dated the 2nd August 1990 received from Dr. I. R. Williams.
                                  That report confirms the condition of the Plaintiff.




I
That I verily believe that the Second Defendant has no defence
to this claim, and that perhaps the only possible area of dispute
is as to the amount of damages which they should pay with
such an assessment to be made by the Court.                    The report of
the Right Honourable Justice Taylor referred to above provides
a clear indication of the Second Defendant’s negligence


That further, the Second Defendant has indicated th at "all bona
fide claims for compensation by those injured                        [in pens 3
and 4] at the ground will be paid on a common law basis to be
agreed if possible, or failing agreement to be assessed by the
Court."      I annex hereto marked "RSGM 6" a bundle containing
a copy      of a letter dated 15th December written by Messrs.
Hammond Suddards (the Solicitors who were then on the record
for   the        Second   Defendant    in   this    Action)       giving     such
indication and an extract to a report of the Hillsborough
Steering Committee it was thought that the Second Defendant
in this action (who was the First Defendant in the Chapman and
Rimmer actions) would consent to m atters proceeding without
having to serve a fully pleaded Statement of Claim.


That I annex hereto marked "RSGM 7" some further open
correspondence (together           with a schedule thereof)                passing
between my firm and Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords the
Second Defendant's Solicitors now on record which together
with the letters of 16th and 19th July 1990 exhibited as 'RSGM
2' to my 1st Affidavit indicate the attitude of the Second
Defendant         towards the      Plaintiff's claim.       The     implications
contained in the said correspondence are clearly that the
Second       Defendant      does not     dispute        having to    meet      the
Plaintiff's claim in full and further, that he must believe that
he has no defence to this action. In particular I would wish to
 refer      to     the    second   paragraph       of     Messrs.    Weightman
 Rutherfords letter dated the 19th July 1990 (exhibited as part
 of "RSGM 2" to my 1st Affidavit).
That I annex hereto marked "RSGM 8" a bundle containing some
copy correspondence passing between my firm and Messrs.
Davies Arnold Cooper the First Defendants’ Solicitors ( letters
dated 30.8.90, 4.9.90, 12.9.90 and 14.9.90). It appears th at the
First Defendants’ Solicitors are unable to say whether "it is
appropriate for Judgment to be entered against the Second
Defendant”.


That bearing in mind the Plaintiff is a person under a disability
subject to the Court of Protection it is important this this
action is dealt with effectively and properly on his behalf. The
Second Defendants have in the past tried to avoid judgment
being entered on the basis that the various Defendants whom it
has been alleged are collectively liable for the disaster have
not come to terms.   I refer to Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords
letter of 16th July 1990 (exhibited as part of exhibit ’RSGM 2’
to my 1st Affidavit herein Sworn on 14th August 1990) in which
it is stated that the Second Defendants "are not prepared to
consent to Judgment being entered [and that Messrs. Weightman
Rutherfords] have explained the reason for that In other cases."
As is recorded in Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords letter of 19th
July 1990 I spoke with                of th at firm on 17th July
1990.   In the pre-penultimate paragraph of my firm ’s letter of
22nd    August   to   Messrs.   Weightman   Rutherfords   is   my
understanding of "the reason1' given for the reluctance for
Judgment being entered against the Second Defendant (i.e. an
argument as between the Defendants) and my view thereof.            I
verily believe that in October 1990 the Defendants cam e to
term s as between themselves, although such term s as have been
come to remain confidential.



 That it is my opinion that the Second Defendant has no defence
 to the Plaintiff's claim, and therefore I would ask the Court to
 grant the Plaintiff judgment in this m atter with damages to be
 assessed a future date.
                    - —---------    s.uugmcm            pe entered for the Plaintiff upon    such term s as th e Court
may think fit including the making of such provision or provisions              as the Court may consider
appropriate to re fle c t the fact th at the Second Defendants agreed to m eet the P laintiff’s claim in
fuH^some stage in or shortiy after December 1989;
3.*        The costs of and incidental to this Application be paid by th e Second Defendants to the
Plaintiff on an Indemnity basis.

Counsel.

 Dear Sirs,


 Andrew S. Devine - Hillsborough


 Thank you for your letter of the 20th December.     We                                                      obviously do not wish further
 unnecessary costs to be incurred and we       agree it                                                       would be appropriate for the
 Plaintiff's Solicitors to discontinue their   Client's                                                      action against yourClients and
 we have written to them to-day in an effort to persuade                                                      them to do that.

 We will write again as soon as we have heard from them.



 Yours faithfully,




 WEIGHTMAN RUTHERFORDS

                         STATEMENT OF CLAIM




1.     The Plaintiff is a mental patient whose property is administered by
       the Court of Protection and proceeds through his father who is his
       Receiver and Next Friend, Stanley Devine.


2.     The First Defendants are and were a t all m aterial tim es the owners
       and occupiers   of the football ground premises         known as    the
       Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.
I




    3.   The Second Defendant is the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire
         Police, the police officers hereinafter referred to were at all
         m aterial   times   members of the said Force      acting     under   the
         direction   and control of the      Second   Defendant   in    purported
         performance of their duties as police officers.


         The Second Defendant's Police Force was a t all m aterial times the
         Force responsible for policing a t the said stadium on the occasion of
         football matches, in particular the football m atch on the 15th April
         1989 hereinafter referred to, being the match between Liverpool
         Football Club and Nottingham Forrest Footba 11 Club, in a semi­
         final cup tie of the F.A Cup.


    5.   The Plaintiff on the 15th April 1989 was a t all m aterial tim es a
         lawful spectator in the said stadium on the occasion of the said
         semi-final cup tie, and as such was the lawful visitor of the First
         Defendants .within the meaning of the Occupiers Liability A ct 1957.
         At all m aterial times the Plaintiff was on the standing terrace at
         the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in either pen 3 or pen ^
         thereof. The aforesaid area shall hereinafter be referred to as the
         West Terrace.


    6.   At a tim e between about 2A5 p.m. and about 3.10 p.m. on the 15th
         April 1989 the Plaintiff, while on the West Terrace, was subject to
         crushing owing to the overcrowding of spectators in pens 3 and b as
         a result’ whereof he sustained injuries.


    7.   The said accident     and resultant injuries were    caused      by the
         negligence and/or breach of statutory duty on the part of the First
         Defendants, their servants or agents and/or by the negligence of the
         Second Defendant and/or his police officers.

      PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE OF THE FIRST DEFENDANTS.
                        THEIR SERVANTS OR AGENTS


The First Defendants, their servants or agents were negligent and/or in
breach of statutory duty in that they:-


(a)    failed to provide at the Leppings Lane end of their premises
       adequate turnstile facilities to accommodate a crowd of 2^,000;
       such facilities would have included:-


       (i)     a t least 30 turnstiles;
       (ii)    turnstiles accommodated on a straight wall or on          two or
               more straight walls to enable spectators to queue parallel to
               each other;
       (iii)   adequate space between the turnstiles and th e public part of
               Leppings Lane to permit long parallel queuing than at
               present possible, and to accommodate in the region of 7,000
               spectators, but certainly more than 5,000;
       (iv)    the provision of parallel rails a t right angles to the
               turnstiles to delineate the queues a t each turnstile;
       (v)     clear signs, plainly visible to approaching spectators
               indicating the separate turnstiles for the north and west
               stands and the west terraces;



(b)   failed within the ground at the Leppings Lane end to sign clearly
       the existence of, and way to pens 1/2 and 6/7;


(c)   failed to provide any mechanical or any other means of monitoring
       the numbers in the individual pens on the west terraces (in breach
       of the recommendations contained in the Home O ffice Guide to
       Safety at Sports Grounds, hereinafter referred to as the Green
       Guide);


(d)   ignored a warning from the Police th at the designated capacity of
       the west terraces as a whole was too high for safety;


(e)   failed to co-ordinate with the Police and agree a clear division of
      responsibility for the visual monitoring of the numbers in the pens
      on the west terraces and for spreading spectators evenly through
      the pens on those terraces;


(f)   obtained a safety certificate on the false representation to the City
      Council th at they had agreed a system of crowd control with the
      Police;


(g)   failed to   appreciate that by reason of the existence of the radial
      fences, the projecting walls a t the rear of pens 3 and 4 and the size
      and position of the gates in the radial fences, the crowd required
      assistance from stewards and/or Police to enable even spread to be
      achieved;


(h)   failed to inform the Police of the estim ated flow rate through the
      turnstiles a t the Leppings Lane end;


(i)   failed to observe that by 2A5 p.m. a t the latest pens 3 and 4 were
      full or a t the least approaching capacity;


(j)   failed to institute any or any proper system for informing stewards
      and/or Police in the concourse between the turnstiles and the west
      stand th at pens 3 and 4 were approaching capacity;


(k)   failed to    station any or sufficient stewards in the      concourse
      between the turnstiles and the west stand wall to enable, if and
      where necessary, the direction of spectators from any pen which
      was approaching or had reach capacity, and failed to formulate any
      plans for the closing of the tunnel situate under the west stand
      either by closing one or both doors, by moveable barriers, by a
      cordon of Police or stewards, or by any other means;


(1)   failed to inform the stewards and/or Police between turnstiles and
      the west stand wall that by 2M5 p.m. a t the latest pens 3 and 4
      were full or a t least approaching capacity, and when this was or
      ought to have been visible on the club's close circuit television
      monitors;


(m)   placed in the perim eter fence, in particular pens 3 and        gates
         which were too small to be exit gates in breach of the Green Guide;


(n)      failed to place stewards a t the gates in the perim eter fence with
         clear instruction as to when to open them, in breach of the Green
         guide;


(o)      failed together with the Police before the said semi-final cup tie
         properly to view, evaluate and heed the available data concerning
         the number attending the equivalent fixture in 1988, in particular
         the   data th at more than the perm itted capacity      entered   the
         turnstiles a t the Leppings Lane end of the said ground, so as to
         avoid a recurrence of such excess entry in the 1989 fixture;


(p)      failed to possess and/or have readily available bolt cutters or other
         adequate means to enable the perim eter fence to be opened up to
         allow emergency escape of spectators;


(q)      in the premises failed in breach of their statutory duty under
         Section 2 of the Occupiers Liability A ct 1957 and/or negligently to
         take all reasonable care for the safety of the Plaintiff whilst on
         their said premises for the purpose of which he was invited, namely
         as a match spectator.




        PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE OF THE SECOND DEFENDANT
                       AND/OR HIS POLICE OFFICERS



The Second Defendant and/or his Police Officers were negligent in that
they:


(a)      failed when devising a plan for the policing of the crowd to ensure
         th a t clear arrangements were made with the First Defendants for
         the control of the numbers entering each separate pen in the west
         terraces;


(b)      requested the installation of radial fences on the west terraces
         without ensuring th at by separate turnstiles or otherwise the safe
      capacities of each pen would not be exceeded;


(c)   failed to ascertain and/or brief Ground Commanders of the flow
      rates through the turnstiles a t the Leppings Lane end of the said
      ground;


(d)   failed adequately or a t all to brief Police Officers in attendance a t
      Hillsborough in Police control, club control and west stand and on
      the perim eter a t the west end that it was a duty to monitor the
      numbers of spectators in the separate pens on the west terraces and
      in particular to observe and report to Police control if and when
      any particular pen was approaching capacity, particularly when he
      knew or ought to have known that the First Defendants had ignored
      a Police warning that the capacity of the west terraces as a whole
      was too high;


(e)   failed adequately or a t all to monitor the number of spectators in
      the separate pens on the west terraces from the Police control
      room, and/or the club control room and/or by Police Officers in the
      west stand and/or by Police Officers on or near the perim eter
      fence, but to the contrary operated a policy of allowing spectators
      to "find their own level" on the whole terrace, and on the basis that
      so long as spaces existed in any part of a pen, th at pen could not
      have reach capacity;


(f)   failed to appreciate or ignore the fact th at brick walls a t the exit
      from the Tunnel under the west stand into pens 3 and 4 and the
      position and size of gates a t the rear of the pens hindered in
      practice self levelling of spectators throughout the whole terrace;


(g)   failed as early as 2.00 p.m. when informed that 8,000 fewer were in
      the ground than a t the previous years fixture, the previous year's
      cup tie between the same teams as on the 15th April 1989, and that
      the majority of those were expected a t the Leppings Lane end, to
      appreciate that a crowd problem a t the Leppings Lane turnstiles
      was likely to occur and failed to warn Superintendent Marshall
      accordingly;




                        ...   £•
by his Police Officers as aforesaid failed to observe and report that
by 2A5 p.m. at the latest, pens 3 and U were for all practical
purposes full to capacity, or a t the very least were approaching
capacity;


by his officers in Police control and otherwise failed to report to
the First Defendants by their proper Officers, whether the head
steward or otherwise and/or to the stewards in th e area between
the turnstiles and the tunnel that by 2A5 p.m. a t th e latest, pens 3
and 4 were for all practical purposes full to, or a t the very least
were approaching capacity;


failed to warn the Football Association and/or th e Sheffield City
Council and/or the First Defendants th at in the event of as few as
one third of the total capacity of the north and w est stands and the
west terraces arriving in Leppings Lane within a period of                   15
minutes, the Police would not be capable of controlling the crowd
and th at a dangerous crushing situation was likely to or might
develop;


by his Superintendent, Marshall:-


(i)     failed a t 2.17 p.m. on requesting the closure of Leppings
        Lane,   or    at   any   material   tim e     th ereafter,   to   seek
        information    from Police Control as to           the approximate
        numbers still expected through the Leppings Lane turnstiles;
(ii)    failed between 2.17 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. or a t any m aterial
        tim es thereafter to respond to a situation which he believed
        to be unprecedented, i.e. the arrival in Leppings Lane and
        the turnstiles area adjacent thereto of sufficient numbers to
        justify the closure of the road and which had caused some
        six to eight thousand people to be in the lane, with more
        expected, by evaluating the situation and by giving orders for
        the control of the numbers joining the already stationary
        crowd in the bottleneck of the turnstile area;
(iii)   failed prior to 2.35 p.m. to inform Police Control th a t a
        dangerous situation was developing and to seek advice and
        guidance . from     Control   and   in      particular   from     Chief
        Superintendent Duckenfield;
(1)   by his officers patrolling the turnstile area and/or Leppings Lane,
      both mounted and on foot:-


      (i)     caused or permitted the area between the turnstiles and the
              blue perimeter fence to become jammed with spectators
              thereby causing crowd pressure and rendering movement
              through the turnstiles insufficient;
      (ii)    failedTafter 2.25 p.m. to control the crowd approaching
              the turnstile area from Leppings Lane from both
              directions adequately or a t all, if necessary by cordons
              across the road and the use of horses on Leppings Lane
              nearer the roundabout than the turnstiles;
      (Iii)   perm itted the build-up of several thousands of
              spectators with forward, impetus when those a t the front
              were liable to be crushed either against the perim eter fence
              or against the turnstiles wall;
      (iv)    perm itted horses to become trapped within         the turnstiles
              area where their presence was counter-productive or a t the
              least useless when they were needed on Leppings Lane;


(m)   failed a t 2.17 p.m. or a t any time thereafter to         inform Chief
      Superintendent Marshall of the numbers still expected to arrive at
      the ground of the Leppings Lane end;


(n)   by his Chief Superintendent, Duckenfield:-


      (i)     having a t 2A7 p.m. been warned by the said Marshall
              th at a dangerous situation existed outside the turnstiles and
              th at   the   gates should be opened,    failed,    despite   two
              intervening and urgently expressed identical requests, to give
              an answer until 2.52 p.m.;
      (ii)    failed between 2A7 p.m. and 2.52 p.m. to           evaluate the
              consequences inside the ground of opening the gates and in
              particular the danger that those entering by gate C would be
              likely to or might enter pens 3 and 4 via the tunnel;
      (iii)   having correctly decided a t 2.52 p.m. to order the opening of
              the gates, failed prior to transm itting such an order to warn
              the First Defendants and his own Officers in the area of his



                               2 /
t




                   intended action in order to prevent further ingress into pens
                   3 and 4;


          (iv)     failed to inform the Ground Commander, Superintendent
                   Greenwood that he had ordered the opening of the gates and
                   there was a likelihood (or even only a possibility) that
                   further spectators might have entered the already packed
                   pens 3 and 4;
          (v)      by causing or permitting the opening of gate C a t 2.52
                   p.m. without taking any measures to seal the tunnel, caused
                   or perm itted a large influx of spectators into the already
                   packed pens 3 and 4;


    (o)   by his Officers in Police control, club control, in the west stand
          and/or    on or near the west perim eter           fence,   to   appreciate
          sufficiently quickly that the problems obviously existing in pens 3
          and 4 were not due to hooliganism or an attem pted pitch invasion,
          but were to the contrary due to overcrowding and in consequence
          failed in tim e to take action to save further crushing;


    (p)   failed to train, instruct, and/or brief his Officers on or near the
          perim eter fence adequately in the dangers of and consequence upon
          overcrowding, but to the contrary so concentrated their minds upon
          the problem       consequent on hooliganism and pitch invasions th at
          their judgement was likely to be clouded;


    (q)   failed, by tannoy and/or signals or otherwise to order or arrange for
          the immediate evacuation through the tunnel of spectators a t the

                           th at in consequence little control by Police Officers would
                           be called for;

            (w)   failed together with the First Defendants before the aforesaid cup-

                  particular the data that more than the perm itted capacity had
                  entered the turnstiles a t the Leppings Lane end, so as to avoid a

             PARTICULARS OF PERSONAL INJURY




                 The Plaintiff was in full health prior to the 15th

     FURTHER PARTICULARS OF PLAINTIFF'S CLAIM



The nature of the Plaintiff's claim for general damages is as
follows:-



The Plaintiff     was a t   the tim e of   the   Hillsborough   Disaster,
employed by the Post Office. Levels.        It is anticipated th at his
future employment would be worthy of greater remuneration than
th at obtained by him from the Post O ffice a t the tim e of his
injuries.    The Plaintiff's claim therefore includes a claim both for
lost future earnings and, as the life expectancy of the Plaintiff has
been reduced, for loss of earnings during the lost years. Due to the
Plaintiff    being reduced to the persistent vegetative s ta te       the
Plaintiff will also seek damages for the cost of future nursing care,
other treatm ent, the cost of adapting the accommodation which has
been purchased to house him for his special needs, and to bring th at
property into a fit and habitable condition, and all ancillary m atters
necessary for the future care of the Plaintiff in his current state,
to   include if necessary any sum to represent the nursing care
provided by any member of his family. The Plaintiff will also seek
to recover damages for the increased annual cost of housing, the
cost of medical aids, and also the costs of and incidental to having
to have his affairs administered on his behalf because of his
disability including the costs of proceedings        in the Court      of
Protection on an indemnity basis.



The above is the nature of the Plaintiff's claim, and is not meant to
be exhaustive. Further details will be provided in due course and on
discovery.
9.     Further, the Plaintiff is entitled to and claims interest a t such rate
       and for such period as the Court thinks fit pursuant to Section 35A
       of the Supreme Court Act 1981.



AND the Plaintiff claims:



       (i)    damages;
       (ii)   the aforesaid interest pursuant to Section 35A of the
               Supreme Court Act 1981.

Dear Sir,
Re:   Hillsborough - Claim by Andrew Stanley Devine
The Plaintiff's solicitors in the above action have served us
with a Statement of Claim and a copy of their application to be
heard on Friday, 21st December at 2.30p.m.      The Plaintiff's
solicitors are seeking directions on the basis that liability
is disputed, or alternatively on the basis that Judgment be
entered against the Chief Constable.
We consider it appropriate that Judgment be entered against
your client for the purposes of this action only and on the
basis that the claim is discontinued against our clients.
Alternatively, if Judgment is not entered, directions will be
given and we will be involved in incurring further costs - both
in attending the application and subsequently.         In those
circumstances, we do have the benefit of the indemnity in
respect of the civil contribution proceedings settlement.
We would now ask you to indicate how you intend to proceed.
We have written to your agents solicitors in similar terms.
Yours faithfully,

DAVIES ARNOLD COOPER

Dear Sirs#

Re;   Andrew S. Devine - Hillsborough
We thank you for your letter dated 19th September.          The
Plaintiff's solicitors have served us with a Statement of Claim
and an application to be heard on Friday, 21st December at
2.30p.m.   We note that the Plaintiff's solicitors are seeking
directions, or alternatively Judgment to reflect the agreement
that your clients agreed to meet the Plaintiff's claim.      We
have no wish to become involved in these proceedings, a3
clearly it would be appropriate for Judgment to be entered
against your clients in this action only and on the basis that
the claim against our clients is discontinued.
Our clients also have the benefit of an indemnity under the
terms of the settlement reached between the parties in the
civil contribution proceedings. In that regard, if the action
continues and directions are given without Judgment being
entered, we will need to serve a Defence and to incur further
costs, which we recover from your clients under the terms of

Dear Sirs,
Rei   Andrew Devine - Hillsborough
We thank you for your facsimile letter of the 6th December,
together with the Statement of Claim and the Summons.
However, we have not received these documents through the post,
although we are prepared to acknowledge that the documents have
been properly served.
We hope that it will not be necessary for us to attend your
application.   As you are aware, the Second Defendants agreed
to pay claimants without admission of liability, and in our
view it would be appropriate for Judgment to be entered against
the Second Defendants in this action only, and that the action
proceed to trial;     or alternatively that an assessment of
damages hearing take place.
We shall write again shortly, but in the meantime we would ask
you to provide us with a copy of the Affidavit in support of
your application.
Finally, please confirm that you do not require us to serve a
Defence to the Statement of Claim as hopefully this will not
prove necessary; but in the event that directions are given
without Judgment being entered, a direction can be included to
allow the Defendants sufficient time in which to serve Defences
to the claim.
Yours faithfully,

DAVIES ARNOLD COOPER

  Dear Sirs,


  Andrew S. Devine - Hillsborough


  Thank you for your letter of the 14th September. We have no idea why E. Rex Makin &
  Co., have written to you in the terms of their letter of the 12th September. They
  know perfectly well what the position is. As we are sure you are aware an agreement
  was reached between the Chief Constable and the Steering Committee whereby the Chief
  Constable agreed, without an admission of liability, to compensate those injured and
  the dependants of those who died at figures to be agreed or if necessary assessed by
  the Court. This claim is potentially one of the largest and E. Rex Makin & Co., have
  been attempting to obtain a Judgment.

  We agree with the content of your letter of the 14th September to E. Rex Makin & Co.,
  and if E.Rex Makin & Co., take any steps in this action which attempt to deal with
  liability then our instructions are to make an immediate Application to Stay the
  proceedings.

  We trust this is sufficient explanation for you.

        Andrew Stanley Devine

        Thank you for your letter of the 4th September 1990.

        Will you please confirm that there is no reason why the Chief Constable cannot
        admit liability in a case such as this and, if necessary, seek to recover something
        from your clients.

        There has to be a Judgment in this m atter before the case can be finalised. We
        do not see what purpose is served by liability not being resolved in this particular
        case.

        We look forward to hearing from you.

Andrew Stanley Devine
We thank you for your letter dated the 30th August together
with the enclosures.
We note what you day concerning the entry of Judgement against
the Second Defendants* However, as we were not privy to the
discussions that took place# we are not in a position to
confirm whether it is appropriate for Judgment to be entered*
It is our understanding that the Chief Constable agreed with
the Hillsborough Steering Committee to pay damages, without
admission of liability* to claimants save as to nervous shock
cases where a remoteness of damage issue arose* We anticipate
that Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords are proceeding on this
basis to settle the claim# and therefore we cannot see any
real purpose achieved by attempting to enter Judgment.
We would add that the lead actions of Chapman and Rimraer have
been regarded by the court as the proper proceedings for the
determination of liability.     It has been indicated by Mr
Justice Steyn that a Defendant to these actions is entitled to
make an application to stay any other action brought by a
party, as clearly it would not be in the interests of
efficiency if a multitude of actions were allowed to proceed*
As you may be aware, the trial of the Chapman and Rimmer and
lead actions will commence on the 2nd October 1990.
in the event that a Summons for Directions is Issued to deal
with liability# it is likely that such a step will be met by a
joint application for a stay. A copy of this letter has been

  As you may be aware we are handling the compensation claims in those categories where
  it has been agreed between those representing the Chief Constable and the Steering
  Committee that compensation will be paid.

  In this case proceedings were issued by E. Rex Makin & Co. shortly                                                                           after      the
  disaster. We have been negotiating but discussions have broken down.

  Hammond Suddards have told us that they wish us to go on the record in their place to
  deal with the damages claim and in the circumstances we enclose Notice of Change.

  We understand the Plaintiff’s Solicitors will not discontinue against the Club but we
  further understand that that should have no particular consequences as the Rules make
  it quite clear that such discontinuance does not carry any implication that the Club
  have no liability.

  We should be obliged if you would kindly acknowledge receipt of this letter.                                                                            We

            Andrew Devine - Hillsborough

            We refer to earlier correspondence and to                          the w riter's discussion with
                    on 29th August 1990.

            We can so no reason why judgment should not be entered for the Plaintiff against
            the Second Defendant.

            You have indicated th at the Second Defendant will m eet the Plaintiff's claim in
            full and th at arrangements have been made between the various Defendants in this
            regard.

             It seems to us to be clearly appropriate th a t the Plaintiff, who is entitled to
             judgment, should now have judgment entered in his favour. Will you please take
             specific instructions from your clients and let us know the following:-

             1.         If they are prepared to consent to judgment being entered against them;

             2.         If not, why not?

             3.         What arrangements have been made between the respective Defendants with
                        regard to liability and meeting the Plaintiff's claim; and

             4.         If the Second Defendants have already conceded th at they are prepared to
                         m eet the Plaintiff's claim in full on what basis can it be contended th at
                         judgment on liability should not be entered against the Plaintiff andVcould
                         the Second Defendant be prejudiced by such judgment being entered?

             We assume on the admission th a t the Plaintiff's claims in this m atter will be m et
             in full       means th a t the Second Defendant will m eet all claims as if judgment
             has already been entered. Please will you let us know the date upon which you are
             contending th at a Plaintiff is entitled to the equivalent of having judgment against
             your client.

             We would hope th at it will be unnecessary to have a further interlocutory hearing
             to deal with the obtaining of judgment or further directions with regard to tidying
             up th e liability issue in this case. However, if we do not hear from you
             satisfactorily within seven days of the date of this le tte r, we are proposing to
             issue a summons for directions so th at the Court can consider the position further.

             We a re sending a copy of this letter to the solicitors acting for the First
             Defendants.

         I   R O B IN S IM O N G R A H A M M A K I N Solic ito r w ith E. R e x

 Makin & Co. o f Whitechapel Liverpool L I /H Q M A K E O A T H                   and

 say as follows

 I.      I have conduct of this m a t t e r on behalf of the P l a i n ti ff

 2.      I make this A f f i d a v i t from facts within m y own knowledge or

 information which I have received which I believe to be true.

 3.      I annex hereto marked "R.S .G.M . I"            a Medical R eport dated

  2nd August 1990 received from Dr. I.R. Williams (the Consultant

  Neurologist responsible for the P l a in tiff 's c are )

  4.     The following are apparent from Dr. Williams re p o r t:-

  (a )       The P l a i n t i f f had a sound education;

  (b)        The P l a i n t i f f was employed;

  (c)        The P la in tiff was well prior to attending       Hillsborough Stadium

             on Saturday 15th April 1989;
 (d)




\(e)




\ (f )




  (9)     Although the P la i n t i f f w ill continue to be to t a lly dependent

          i t would be possible for him to be looked a f t e r by his fa m ily

          given

           (i)     proper housing        w ith modifications;

           (ii)    adequate aids ( e.gsw he elcha iry hoist and bed);

           (Hi )   the assistance of nurses probably on a daily      basis;

           (iv)    occupational therapy;    and

           (v)     physiotherapy

  (h)




  5.     The P l a i n t i f f was injured at the Leppings Lane end of the

  Hillsborough football stadium in Sheffield.          The incident causing the

  P l a i n ti ff 's injuries occurred as a result o f the negligence and/or

   breach of statutory duty of the Defendants and/or th eir servants

   or agents;

   6.    An interim payment of                                            was

   made an or about 4th January 1990

   7.    The Solicitors acting fo r the 2nd D efe ndant have indicated th at

   proceedings against the 1st Defendants should be discontinued.

    The 2nd Defendant has accepted responsibility for ' dealing1
with the quantum aspect o f the P l a i n ti ff 's claim including any costs

of joining the F irst Defendants in the proceedings

8.     The Second De fendant does not have any valid Defence to

these proceedings. L i a b il i ty is not in issue.   Notwithstanding

the foregoing the Solicitors acting for the 2nd Defendants have

indicated tha t they are not prepared to consent to judgment being

entered against the 2nd D e f e n d a n t • 1                  r, cJ    R .3 (r^
C-Ofter     Uhh.ri       *1 Iftt,          M f c t , ‘3 ' u 1^

9. I verily believe tha t when this action proceeds to tr i a l the

P la i n t i f f will recover substantial compensation

10 -   The e xten t of the substantial compensation which the

P l a i n ti ff will recover will, inte r alia, include damages for

(a )     pain and suffering;

(b)      loss of amenity;

(c )     loss of earnings and earning capacity;

(d)       suitable home accommodation w ith modifications and

          adequate aids; and

(e )     The   cost of nursing, occupational therpay, physiotherapy,

          general medical and other carers.

//.. A great deal of work has been undertaken in connection

with the proposed acquisition o f suitable home accommodation

for the P laintiff .    This work has involved locating a suitable

property and having its suitability considered by

(a )      The P la in tiff 's fa mily;

(b)       The P l a i n ti ff 's Consultant-

(c )      Occupational therapist;

(d)       Physiotherapist;

(e )      Social Worker;

(f)       Surveyors and Valuers

(9)       Charte red Quantity Surveyors;
(h)     Damp proof, moisture and insect a tta c k specialists;

(i)     Consulting structural engineers;

(j)     Plumbing and heating specialists;

(k )    E lec trica l experts;

(I)     Arc hite cts (specialising in the adaptation o f property for the

        disabled);

(m )    Solicitors;   and

(n)     The Court o f Protection

 12.   The Court o f Protection have made an interim order for the

purchase of the property in question.          The fu rth e r steps to be taken

with regard to the purchase are in hand.           These steps include the

Court o f Protection giving directions as to the provision o f the

purchase price.

13.    The amount required for the acquisition of the prope rty i s

substantial.    The proposed purchase price which has been agreed subject

to con tract is                  Certain works have to be c arried out

to the property to accommodate the P la in tiff 's special needs.

Other work is essential fo r valuation purposes - the valuers basing

their valuation on the basis that such work is undertaken.              O th er work

which has not y e t been costed has been recommended and is likely

to have to be undertaken within a relativ ely short ti m e period

a fte r the property is acquired.       The cost o f th a t p a r t o f the work

which has so fa r been costed is likely to be approxim ately

           exclusive o f Value Added Tax.

14.. In addition to the costs o f the accommodation and its

adaptations there are the associated professional costs to be met.

15.    I t is apparent from the evidence that the P l a i n ti ff 's

claim is very substantial indeed.        An interim payment which is

su fficient to secure the suitable home accommodation required by
            ; the P l a i n t i f f is now urgently needed.

            : 16.     As the P l a i n ti ff 's affa irs are being handled through the Court

            ■ o f Protection I respectfully submit th a t any Directions as to the

                payment out and use o f monies ordered to be paid by way o f

            j in terim payment should be given by th a t Court

           2ND AFFIDAVIT SWORN ON 10th DECEMBER 1990



I, ROBIN SIMON GRAHAM MAKIN, Solicitor with E. Rex Makin & Co., of
Whitechapel, Liverpool, LI 1HQ, MAKE OATH and say as follows:-


1.        That I have the conduct of this m atter on behalf of the
           Plaintiff and am duly authorised to make this Affidavit          in
           support of the Plaintiff's application for Judgment pursuant to
           Order 1^ of the Rules of the Supreme Court.


2.        That    I   make this Affidavit    from   facts   within   my   own
           knowledge, or information which I have received which I believe
           to be true.


3.         That I annex hereto marked ”RSGM 3” a copy of the Statement
           of Claim and that I am         able from my own knowledge to
confirm paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim.            I can also
confirm paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Statem ent of Claim, they
are m atters of common public knowledge.


That 1 can further confirm the contents of paragraph 5 of the
Statement of Claim.     I understand from my instructions from
the parents of the Plaintiff that he left in good health to
attend the football match at Hillsborough Stadium on 15th April
1989, and later that day was admitted to the Royal Hallamshire
Hospital in Sheffield
                                 I believe th at the Plaintiff was
injured in one or other of pen 3 or pen 4 of the west terrace of
Hillsborough Football Ground (I annex hereto marked ”RSGM bn
a copy of a plan of the ground) and that his injuries occurred
a t the time when what is now known as the Hillsborough
Disaster took place.


That I can further confirm that the Particulars of Negligence
alleged against the Second Defendant are proper allegations to
make.     I verily believe that the allegations made against the
Second Defendant in paragraph 7 of the Statem ent of Claim
can be supported fully or in part by the findings of       the Right
Honourable Lord Justice Taylor in his interim report dated the
1st August 1989 dealing with the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster.
Extracts from that report (pages      1 to 47 (inclusive) 49 to 50
and 54) are reproduced and annexed hereto marked "RSGM 5" -
paragraph 268 on page 47 and chapter 18 in pages 49 to 50
appearing to be extremely relevant.


That my instructions also confirm that the heads of damage
pleaded    in the   Statement   of Claim    are   correct,   and   in
particular from my own knowledge I can sta te th at a property
known     as                       specially   suitable    (following
adaptation/building works) has been purchased for the needs of
the Plaintiff.   Exhibited as ”RSGM 1” to my First Affidavit
sworn on 14th August 1990 was a copy of the medical report
dated the 2nd August 1990 received from Dr. I. R. Williams.
That report confirms the condition of the Plaintiff.
That I verily believe that the Second Defendant has no defence
to this claim, and that perhaps the only possible area of dispute
is as to the amount of damages which they should pay with
such an assessment to be made by the Court.                  The report of
the Right Honourable Justice Taylor referred to above provides
a clear indication of the Second Defendant's negligence


That further, the Second Defendant has indicated that "all bona
fide claims for compensation by those injured                      [in pens 3
and 4] at the ground will be paid on a common law basis to be
agreed if possible, or failing agreement to be assessed by the
Court.”        I annex hereto marked ”RSGM 6” a bundle containing
a copy        of a letter dated 15th December written by Messrs.
Hammond Suddards (the Solicitors who were then on the record
for     the    Second     Defendant   in   this    Action)     giving     such
indication and an extract to a report of the Hillsborough
Steering Committee it was thought that the Second Defendant
in this action (who was the First Defendant in the Chapman and
Rimmer actions) would consent to m atters proceeding without
having to serve a fully pleaded Statement of Claim.


That I annex hereto marked "RSGM 7" some further open
correspondence (together          with a schedule        thereof)       passing
between my firm and Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords the
Second Defendant's Solicitors now on record which together
with the letters of 16th and 19th July 1990 exhibited as 'RSGM
2' to my 1st Affidavit indicate the attitu d e of the Second
Defendant       towards the      Plaintiff's claim.     The       implications
contained in the said correspondence are clearly that the
Second        Defendant    does not    dispute having        to    meet    the
Plaintiff's claim in full and further, that he must believe that
he has no defence to this action. In particular I would wish to
refer     to     the    second   paragraph    of     Messrs.       Weightman
Rutherfords letter dated the 19th July 1990 (exhibited as part
of "RSGM 2" to my 1st Affidavit).
That I annex hereto marked "RSGM 811 a bundle containing some
copy correspondence passing between my firm and Messrs.
Davies Arnold Cooper the First Defendants' Solicitors ( letters
dated 30.8.90, ^.9.90, 12.9.90 and 1^.9.90). It appears th at the
First Defendants' Solicitors are unable to say whether "it is
appropriate for Judgment to be entered against the Second
Defendant".


That bearing in mind the Plaintiff is a person under a disability
subject to the Court of Protection it is important this this
action is dealt with effectively and properly on his behalf. The
Second Defendants have in the past tried to avoid judgment
being entered on the basis that the various Defendants whom it
has been alleged are collectively liable for the disaster have
not come to terms.        I refer to Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords
letter of 16th July 1990 (exhibited as part of exhibit 'RSGM 2'
to my 1st Affidavit herein Sworn on l^th August 1990) in which
it is stated that the Second Defendants "are not prepared to
consent to Judgment being entered [and that Messrs. Weightman
Rutherfords] have explained the reason for that in other cases."
As is recorded in Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords letter of 19th
July 1990 I spoke with                  af that firm on 17th July
1990.   In the pre-penultimate paragraph of my firm 's letter of
22nd    August   to   Messrs.    Weightman   Rutherfords   is   my
understanding of "the reason" given for the reluctance for
Judgment being entered against the Second Defendant (i.e. an
argument as between the Defendants) and my view thereof.         I
verily believe that in October 1990 the Defendants cam e to
terms as between themselves, although such term s as have been
come to remain confidential.



That it is my opinion that the Second Defendant has no defence
to the Plaintiff's claim, and therefore I would ask the Court to
grant the Plaintiff judgment in this m atter with damages to be
assessed a future date.

  MEDICAL REPORT ON ANDREW DEVINE         BORN                                      LIVERPOOL


          (CURRENTLY RESIDENT IN THE YOUNGER DISABLED UNIT   FAZAKERLEY HOSPITAL)



This report is based upon evidence contained in the case notes, from Walton Hospital
and Fazakerley Hospital, a letter from the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield
and from conversations with his family and current carers in the Younger Disabled
Unit in Fazakerley Hospital.


HISTORY

I understand that he was well when he left to attend the football match at Hillsborough
Stadium at Sheffield on Saturday 15 April 1989-    He was employed by the Post Office
having gained thirteen 'O' Levels and four 'A' levels.

   I am not aware of the events which led to his injury.           He was admitted to the
   Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield later that day.



                 He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit in the Royal Hallamshire
   Hospital.                                                     he was transferred
   to the Regional Neurology Centre at Walton Hospital on 18 May 1989 under the care
   of Dr A N Bowden.

   He remained under Dr Bowden's care until 7 March 1990, when he was transferred
   to the Younger Disabled Unit at Fazakerley Hospital, under* my care._____________




YOUNGER DISABLED UNIT      FAZAKERLEY




   There has been no appreciable change in his condition since I first saw him to
   assess him in August 1989*  He remains totally dependent upon Nurses and members
   of his family.

                                                                      Continued
     iUMMARY OF PRESENT CLINICAL STATE




    PROGNOSIS




    PRACTICAL ISSUES

    Andrew will continue to be totally dependent.. His family are keen to look after
    him at home and this should be possible given proper housing and modifications, along
    with adequate aids. In addition to modifications to the house, the family will require
    the assistance of Nurses. probably on a daily basis     Q n n n n a t in r m ] The; ra m * s t s f r o m
    time to time,

         A specially modified wheelchair, hoi3t and bed should be supplied.        Depending
         upon the type of shower or bath installed in the house, suitable means of transport­
         ing him to and from the shower or bath will be required.     Transporting of Andrew
         is possible in an ordinary car, but would clearly be easier with modifications.

Dear Sirs,

Andrew S. Devine ~ Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of the 12th July. We do not know why we have not received
Dr. Cumming's report other than to say that we know that there is often some delay
with him between his seeing a patient and-his preparation of the report.

We did however have great difficulty in finding a suitable Specialist who would act
in this case.

We are acting as Agents for Messrs. Hammond Suddards who are the Solicitors on. the
record as acting for the Chief Constable. It has been agreed that we will handle all
aspects of the quantum side of these claims. It is therefore proper that you should
continue to correspond with us.

Neither we, nor our Clients have any objection in principle to making a further
interim payment but because of the nature of your Client’s injuries and the amount
you are seeking any further interim payment should be made by way of Court Order and
that should involve a proper Application supported by an Affidavit in the usual way.
You will appreciate that you have sent us no evidence with regard to any of the
matters raised by you in correspondence relating to the quantification of the claim.
We are not sure what you mean by "short notice" provided we have a proper Application
and Affidavit and the Court can give us an early appointment we would have no
objection to that thought the Court should be asked to allow sufficient time to deal
with the Application which may well be contested with regard to the overall amount
paid.

Our Clients are not prepared to consent to Judgment being entered against their
Insured. We have explained the reason for that in other cases. You are aware of the
identity of our Insurance Clients and you therefore know who is providing our
instructions.

Yours faithfully,




weig:                      RUTHERFORDS

Dear Sirs,

A.S. Devine - Hillsborough

Following the Writer's telephone conversation with Mr. Robin Makin on the 17th
instant we confirm that we are acting as Agents for Messrs. Hammond Suddards and have
instructions to.accept service on behalf of the Second Defendants.

You have of course already issued proceedings in this case. We suggest, as you have
done in other cases that you discontinue as against the First Defendants and we can
then proceed to deal with the quantum aspect on behalf of the Chief Constable. If
you proceed in this way then our Clients would be responsible for any costs incurred
in connection with the joining of the First Defendants in the proceedings and
discontinuing against them.

Although we are happy in principle to deal with an Application for an Interim payment
as we have said we will require a full Affidavit in support of your Application.
                                                                  1
We look forward to hearing from you.

Yours faithfully,

         (sued as the Chief Constable of the SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE)
                                                                 Second Defendant




                              STATEMENT OF CLAIM




    1.     The Plaintiff is a mental patient whose property is administered by
           the Court of Protection and proceeds through his father who is his
           Receiver and Next Friend, Stanley Devine.


    2.     The First Defendants are and were a t all m aterial tim es the owners
           and occupiers of    the football ground premises        known as    the
           Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield, South Yorkshire.
The Second Defendant is the Chief Constable of the South Yorkshire
Police, the police officers hereinafter referred to were a t all
material    tim es    members of the said Force acting        under   the
direction   and      control of the Second Defendant     in    purported
performance of their duties as police officers.


The Second Defendant’s Police Force was at all m aterial tim es the
Force responsible for policing a t the said stadium on the occasion of
football matches, in particular the football match on the 15th April
1989 hereinafter referred to, being the match between Liverpool
Football Club and Nottingham Forrest Footba 11 Club, in a semi­
final cup tie of the F.A Cup.


The Plaintiff on the 15th April 1989 was a t all m aterial tim es a
lawful spectator in the said stadium on the occasion of the said
semi-final cup tie, and as such was the lawful visitor of the First
Defendants within the meaning of the Occupiers Liability Act 1957.
At all m aterial times the Plaintiff was on the standing terrace at
the Leppings Lane end of the ground, in either pen 3 or pen 4
thereof. The aforesaid area shall hereinafter be referred to as the
West Terrace.


At a tim e between about 2.45 p.m. and about 3.10 p.m. on the 15th
April 1989 the Plaintiff, while on the West Terrace, was subject to
crushing owing to the overcrowding of spectators in pens 3 and U as
a result'w hereof he sustained injuries.


The said accident and resultant injuries were          caused    by the
negligence and/or breach of statutory duty on the part of the First
Defendants, their servants or agents and/or by the negligence of the
Second Defendant and/or his police officers.
      PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE OF THE FIRST DEFENDANTS.
                        THEIR SERVANTS OR AGENTS


The First Defendants, their servants or agents were negligent and/or in
breach of statutory duty in that they:-


(a)    failed to provide a t the Leppings Lane end of their premises
       adequate turnstile facilities to accommodate a crowd of 24,000;
       such facilities would have included:-


       (i)     a t least 30 turnstiles;
       (ii)    turnstiles accommodated on a straight wall or on           two or
                 more straight walls to enable spectators to queue parallel to
                 each other;
       (iii)     adequate space between the turnstiles and the public part of
                 Leppings Lane to permit long parallel queuing than           at
                 present possible, and to accommodate in the region of 7,000
                 spectators, but certainly more than 5,000;
       (iv)    the provision of parallel rails a t right angles to the
                 turnstiles to delineate the queues a t each turnstile;
       (v)     clear signs, plainly visible to approaching spectators
                 indicating the separate turnstiles for the north and west
                 stands and the west terraces;



(b)    failed within the ground a t the Leppings Lane end to sign clearly
       the existence of, and way to pens 1/2 and 6/7;


(c)    failed to provide any mechanical or any other means of monitoring
       the numbers in the individual pens o n wthe west terraces (in breach
       of the recommendations contained in the Home Office Guide to
       Safety at Sports Grounds, hereinafter referred to as the Green
       Guide);


(d)    ignored a warning from the Police that the designated capacity of
       the west terraces as a whole was too high for safety;


(e)    failed to co-ordinate with the Police and agree a clear division of




                                     3
                                                                                  \

                                                                                  V-

       responsibility for the visual monitoring of the numbers in the pens
       on the west terraces and for spreading spectators evenly through
       the pens on those terraces;


(f)    obtained a safety certificate on the false representation to the City
       Council th at they had agreed a system of crowd control with the
       Police;


(g)    failed    to appreciate that by reason of the existence of the radial
       fences, the projecting walls a t the rear of pens 3 and 4 and the size
       and position of the gates in the radial fences, the crowd required
       assistance from stewards and/or Police to enable even spread to be
       achieved;


(h)    failed    to inform the Police of the estim ated flow rate through the
       turnstiles a t the Leppings Lane end;


(i)    failed    to observe th at by 2.45 p.m. a t the latest pens 3 and 4 were
       full or a t the least approaching capacity;


(j)    failed    to institute any or any proper system for informing stewards
       and/or Police in the concourse between the turnstiles and the west
       stand that pens 3 and 4 were approaching capacity;


(k)    failed    to station any or sufficient stewards in the       concourse
       between the turnstiles and the west stand wall to enable, if and
       where necessary, the direction of spectators from any pen which
       was approaching or had reach capacity, and failed to form ulate any
       plans for the closing of the tunnel situate under the west stand
       either by closing one or both doors, by moveable barriers, by a
       cordon of Police or stewards, or by any-other means;


(1)    failed    to inform the stewards and/or Police between turnstiles and
       the west stand wall that by 2.45 p.m. a t the latest pens 3 and 4
       were full or a t least approaching capacity, and when this was or
       ought to have been visible on the club’s close circuit television
       monitors;


 (m)   placed in the perim eter fence, in particular pens 3 and 4, gates

                                             -I
                                                                   \

                                                                   V
          which were too small to be exit gates in breach of the Green Guide;


(n)       failed to place stewards a t the gates in the perim eter fence with
          clear instruction as to when to open them, in breach of the Green
          guide;


(o)      failed together with the Police before the said semi-final cup tie
          properly to view, evaluate and heed the available data concerning
          the number attending the equivalent fixture in 1988, in particular
          the   data th a t more than the perm itted capacity      entered   the
          turnstiles a t the Leppings Lane end of the said ground, so as to
          avoid a recurrence of such excess entry in the 1989 fixture;


(p)      failed to possess and/or have readily available bolt cu tters or other
          adequate means to enable the perimeter fence to be opened up to
          allow emergency escape of spectators;


(q)      in the premises failed in breach of their statutory duty under
          Section 2 of the Occupiers Liability Act 1957 and/or negligently to
          take all reasonable care for the safety of the Plaintiff whilst on
          their said premises for the purpose of which he was invited, namely
          as a match spectator.




         PARTICULARS OF NEGLIGENCE OF THE SECOND DEFENDANT
                         AND/OR HIS POLICE OFFICERS



 The Second Defendant and/or his Police Officers were negligent in that
 they:


 (a)       failed when devising a plan for the policing of the crowd to ensure
           that clear arrangements were made with the First Defendants for
           the control of the numbers entering each separate pen in the west
           terraces;


 (b)       requested the installation of radial fences on the west terraces
           without ensuring that by separate turnstiles or otherwise the safe
                                                                                   •i




                                  S '*
                                          I


      capacities of each pen would not be exceeded;


(c)   failed to ascertain and/or brief Ground Commanders of the flow
      rates through the turnstiles a t the Leppings Lane end of the said
      ground;


(d)   failed adequately or a t all to brief Police Officers in attendance a t
      Hillsborough in Police control, club control and west stand and on
      the perim eter a t the west end that it was a duty to monitor the
      numbers of spectators in the separate pens on the west terraces and
      in particular to observe and report to Police control if and when
      any particular pen was approaching capacity, particularly when he
      knew or ought to have known that the First Defendants had ignored
      a Police warning that the capacity of the west terraces as a whole
      was too high;


(e)    failed adequately or a t all to monitor the number of spectators in
      the separate pens on the west terraces from the Police control
      room, and/or the club control room and/or by Police Officers in the
      west stand and/or by Police Officers on or near the perim eter
      fence, but to the contrary operated a policy of allowing spectators
      to "find their own level" on the whole terrace, and on the basis th a t
      so long as spaces existed in any part of a pen, th at pen could not
      have reach capacity;


(f)   failed to appreciate or ignore the fact that brick walls a t th e exit
      from the Tunnel under the west stand into pens 3 and b and the
      position and size of gates at the rear of the pens hindered in
      practice self levelling of spectators throughout the whole terrace;


(g)    failed as early as 2.00 p.m. when informed th at 8,000 fewer were in
      the ground than at the previous years fixture, the previous year's
      cup tie between the same teams as on the 15th April 1989, and th at
      the majority of those were expected at the Leppings Lane end, to
      appreciate th at a crowd problem a t the Leppings Lane turnstiles
      was likely to occur and failed to warn Superintendent Marshall
      accordingly;




                              Q-
by his Police Officers as aforesaid failed to observe and report that
by 2A5 p.m. at the latest, pens -3 and 4 were for all practical
purposes full to capacity, or at the very least were approaching
capacity;


by his officers in Police control and otherwise failed to report to
the First Defendants by their proper Officers, whether the head
steward or otherwise and/or to the stewards in the area between
the turnstiles and the tunnel that by 2A5 p.m. a t the latest, pens 3
and 4 were for all practical purposes full to, or a t the very least
were approaching capacity;


failed to warn the Football Association and/or the Sheffield City
Council and/or the First Defendants that in the event of as few as
one third of the total capacity of the north and west stands and the
west terraces arriving in Leppings Lane within a period of                   15
minutes, the Police would not be capable of controlling the crowd
and th at a dangerous crushing situation was likely to or might
develop;


by his Superintendent, Marshall:-


(i)      failed a t 2.17 p.m. on requesting the closure of Leppings
         Lane,    or   at   any   material   tim e     th ereafter,   to   seek
         information    from Police Control as to the             approximate
         numbers still expected through the Leppings Lane turnstiles;
 (ii)    failed between 2.17 p.m. and 2.30 p.m. or at any material
         tim es thereafter to respond to a situation which he believed
         to be unprecedented, i.e. the arrival in Leppings Lane and
         the turnstiles area adjacent thereto of sufficient numbers to
         justify the closure of the road-and which had caused some
         six to eight thousand people to be in the lane, with more
         expected, by evaluating the situation and by giving orders for
         the control of the numbers joining the already stationary
         crowd in the bottleneck of the turnstile area;
 (iii)   failed prior to 2.35 p.m. to inform Police Control th at a
         dangerous situation was developing and to seek advice and
         guidance ' from     Control   and   in      particular   from     Chief
           Superintendent Duckenfield;
by his officers patrolling the turnstile area and/or Leppings Lane,
both mounted and on foot:-


(i)      caused or permitted the area between the turnstiles and the
         blue perim eter fence to become jammed with spectators
         thereby causing crowd pressure and rendering movement
         through the turnstiles insufficient;
(ii)     failed 'after 2.25 p.m. to control the crowd approaching
         the turnstile area from Leppings Lane from both
         directions adequately or a t all, if necessary by cordons
         across the road and the use of horses on Leppings Lane
         nearer the roundabout than the turnstiles;
(iii)    perm itted the build-up of several thousands of
         spectators with forward impetus when those a t the front
         were liable to be crushed either against the perim eter fence
         or against the turnstiles wall;
(iv)     perm itted horses to become trapped within the turnstiles
         area where their presence was counter-productive or a t the
         least useless when they were needed on Leppings Lane;


failed at 2.17 p.m. or a t any time .th ereafter to inform Chief
Superintendent Marshall of the numbers still expected to arrive a t
the ground of the Leppings Lane end;


by his Chief Superintendent, Duckenfield:-


(i)      having a t 2A7 p.m. been warned by th e said Marshall
         th at a dangerous situation existed outside the turnstiles and
         th at   the   gates should be opened,     failed,   despite   two
         intervening and urgently expressed identical requests, to give
         an answer until 2.52 p.m.;
 (ii)    failed between 2A7 p.m. and 2.52 p.m. to evaluate the
         consequences inside the ground of opening the gates and in
         particular the danger that those entering by gate C would be
         likely to or might enter pens 3 and 4 via the tunnel;
 (iii)   having correctly decided at 2.52 p.m. to order the opening of
         the gates, failed prior to transm itting such an order to warn
         the First Defendants and his own O fficers in the area of his
         intended action in order to prevent further ingress into pens
         3 and


(iv)     failed to inform the Ground Commander, Superintendent
         Greenwood that he had ordered the opening of the gates and
         there was a likelihood (or even only a possibility) th at
         further spectators might have entered the already packed
         pens 3 and
(v)      by causing or perm itting the opening of gate C a t 2.52
         p.m. without taking any measures to seal the tunnel, caused
         or perm itted a large influx of spectators into the already
         packed pens 3 and


by his Officers in Police control, club control, in the west stand
and/or    on or    near the   west   perimeter ’ fence,    to   appreciate
sufficiently quickly that the problems obviously existing in pens 3
and 4 were not due to hooliganism or an attem pted pitch invasion,
but were to the contrary due to overcrowding and in consequence
failed in tim e to take action to save further crushing;


failed to train, instruct, and/or brief his Officers on or near the
perim eter fence adequately in the dangers of and consequence upon
overcrowding, but to the contrary so concentrated their minds upon
the problem . consequent on hooliganism and pitch invasions th at
their judgement was likely to be clouded;


failed, by tannoy and/or signals or otherwise to order or arrange for
the immediate evacuation through the tunnel of spectators at the
rear of pens 3 and 4 to relieve pressure to enable those at the front
to comply with otherwise impossible demands by Police on or near
the perim eter fence to move backwards;


failed a t 2.15 p.m. or at any other material tim e to arrange for the
postponement of kick-off;


by his Senior Offices on or near the perim eter fence failed in the
period between it becoming apparent to them               th at there was
overcrowding resulting in injuries, and the arrival of one C. S.
Nesbitt to organise a rescue operation;


failed to institute a system of hand and arm signals to enable his
Officers on the Ground to communicate with Police Control in the
event of crowd noise or breakdown causing the radios to                 be
inaudible;


by his Officers both outside the ground and on or near                 the
perim eter fence failed to appreciate that where crowd pressure had
developed the proper way to relieve such pressure was to achieve it
from the rear forwards and not from the front backwards;


operated     a   general   policy   of   crowd   control   on   the   false
assumptions:-


(i)     th a t a crowd arriving in large numbers at a football match in
         1989 would be wholly sober, patient and self-disciplined, or
         with tickets and with a desire to policing by consent and
         th a t in consequence little control by Police Officers would
         be called for;
(ii)    th a t because no problems had arisen from their policing plan
         in the past, no problems would arise in the future;


failed together with the First Defendants before the aforesaid cup-
tie    properly to review, evaluate and heed the           available d ata
concerning the numbers attending the equivalent fixture in 1988, in
particular the data that more than the perm itted capacity had
entered the turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end, so as to avoid a
recurrence of such excess entry in 1989.


By reason of the m atters aforesaid the Plaintiff, who is currently
2k years of age (date of birth                         suffered pain and
suffering and loss of amenity, and loss and damage.

             (f)                  The nature of the Plaintiff's claim for general damages is as
                                  follows:-



                                  The Plaintiff     was at   the time of    the   Hillsborough Disaster,
                                  employed by the Post Office. Levels.       It is anticipated th at his
                                  future employment would be worthy of greater remuneration than
                                  th at obtained by him from the Post Office a t the tim e of his
                                  injuries.    The Plaintiff's claim therefore includes a claim both for
                                  lost future earnings


                              -


                                                      the cost of adapting the accommodation which has
                                  been purchased to house him for his special needs, and to bring th at
                                  property into a fit and habitable condition, and all ancillary m atters
                                  necessary for the future care of the Plaintiff in his current sta te ,
                                  to include if necessary any sum to represent the nursing care
                                  provided by any member of his family. The Plaintiff will also seek
                                  to recover damages for the increased annual cost of housing, the
                                  cost of medical aids, and also the costs of and incidental to having
                                  to have his affairs administered on his behalf because of his
                                  disability including the costs of proceedings       in the Court     of
                                  Protection on an indemnity basis.



                                  The above is the nature of the Plaintiff's claim, and is not meant to
                                  be exhaustive. Further details will be provided in due course and on
                                  discovery.

   1. On 15 April 1989 a football match to decide a semi-final round o f the FA Cup competition was to be
played between the Liverpool and Nottingham Forest Clubs. The neutral venue chosen was Hillsborough
Football Stadium, Sheffield Wednesday’s ground. Only six minutes into the game, play was stopped when it
was realised that spectators on the terraces behind the Liverpool goal had been severely crushed. In the result,
95 died and over 400 received hospital treatment.

  2. On 17 April 1989 I was appointed by you to carry out an Inquiry with the following terms o f reference:

      To inquire into the events at Sheffield Wednesday football ground on 15 April 1989 and to make
      recommendations about the needs of crowd control and safety at sports events.

  3. Two Assessors were appointed to assist me: M r Brian Johnson Q P M , Chief Constable o f Lancashire,
and Professor Leonard Maunder OBE, BSc, PhD, ScD, FEng, FI Mcch E, Professor of Mechanical
Engineering at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne. T h eir help has been invaluable and I am very grateful
for their expert advice and wise counsels. While the sole responsibility for this report is mine, I am comforted
in the knowledge that both Assessors agree with it.

  4. M r Robert Whalley was appointed Secretary to the Inquiry. He and his assistants have worked
prodigiously and skilfully to give me all the advice and support I could have wished. I also wish to acknowledge
the help I have received, as always, from my clerk, M r Ernest Pott.

    5. The policing arrangements for 15 April were in the hands of the South Yorkshire Constabulary. The
 efficacy of those arrangements and their implementation was from an early stage called into question. It was
 therefore decided that the investigation of the disaster and the gathering o f evidence for this Inquiry should be
 conducted by an independent police force. M r Geoffrey Dear Q P M , Chief Constable o f West Midlands
 Constabulary, undertook this task. He was made responsible directly to me; he appointed Assistant Chief
 Constable Mervyn Jones to take full-time charge o f the investigation. I am deeply indebted to both o f them.

   6. On 18 April I visited Hillsborough Stadium. I inspected the scene o f the disaster on the terraces and all
 relevant parts o f the stadium and its approaches. M y Assessors and I have made further visits during the
 Inquiry. I also visited Liverpool on 21 and 29 April.

    7. The Lord Mayor and the Sheffield City Council kindly offered to make the accommodation and facilities
 of Sheffield Town Hall available for the hearing o f oral evidence. This offer was gratefully accepted and I would
 like to record my thanks for those facilities and for the co-operation afforded to the Inquiry by the authorities
 in Sheffield.

    8. On 28 April 1989,1 held a preliminary hearing to announce the date when the oral evidence would begin,
 to give some directions as to the procedure I intended to follow and to hear applications from those wishing to
 be represented at the hearing. I accorded representation to the following:
       (i)     Those bereaved or injured as a result o f the disaster.
       (ii)    The Football Supporters’ Association.
       (iii)   The Football Association.
       (iv)    Sheffield City Council.
       (v)     Sheffield Wednesday Football Club together with the Football League, the Club’s casual staff and
               their insurers, the Sun Alliance.
       (vi)    South Yorkshire Constabulary.
       (vii) South Yorkshire Fire and Civil Defence Authority.


                                                              1
Subsequently, during the hearing, 1 further accorded representation to:
      (viii) Trent Regional Health Authority, for the South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service
             (SYMAS).
and   (ix)   D r W Eastwood, consultant engineer to Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.

  9. Since the circumstances of the disaster raised urgent questions o f safety, especially at football grounds,
you indicated at the outset that you would welcome any recommendations, even o f an interim nature, which I
might be able to give in advance o f the new football season due to commence in mid-August 198 9.1 therefore
announced at the preliminary hearing on 28 April that 1 would conduct an oral hearing with all possible
expedition as the first phase o f the Inquiry to discover the facts and causes of the disaster and enable me to
make any immediate interim recommendations necessary in the short term.

   10. The West Midlands Police investigation began on 24 April. A “ Freephone” number was advertised to
enable members of the public, especially those who had attended the match, to offer their evidence to the
Inquiry. Initially this number was available lor three days on 28 different lines. The response from the public
was such that the lines were continued for a further three days by the end o f which 2,666 calls had been
received. There were also many written offers ofhelp. Some 440 West Midlands officers were deployed on the
Inquiry. To service this operation, special police offices were established in Birmingham, Liverpool and
Sheffield and computer technology was used to the full. In all some 3776 statements were taken. There were
also some 1550 letters to Ministers, to the Inquiry anil to me personally all o f which 1 read. The police,
Sheffield Wednesday football C lub anil the 11UC had video cameras filming at the ground on 15 April. In
aggregate, they recorded some 71 hours of film covering the period before, during and after the disaster. Thus
the material gathered and potentially available for presentation at the oral hearing was enormous. From this
mass it was essential to select only sufficient good and reliable evidence necessary to establish the facts and
causes o f the disaster.

  11. Where it seemed likely that any allegation or criticism might be made o f the conduct o f any person or
party, the Treasury Solicitor, after consultation with Counsel for the Inquiry, wrote to the party concerned
setting out the likely grounds for complaint. This followed the practice established by the Royal Commission
on Tribunals o flnquiry (the Salmon Commission).

    12. The hearing began on 15 May. It continued, sitting long hours, for 31 days concluding on 29 June. In
 that period, 174 witnesses gave oral evidence. Counsel's submissions were delivered in writing on 7 July and
 on 14 July I heard their brief oral submissions supplementing the written argument.

   13. Witnesses were not sworn. Since this is a departmental inquiry, there was no power to administer the
 oath but there was no instance o f any witness giving evidence which 1 considered might have been different
 had he or she been sworn.

    14. The witnesses called were only a small fraction o f those from whom statements were or could have been
 taken. Nevertheless, I am satisfied that they were sufficient in number and reliability to enable me to reach the
 necessary conclusions. To have called more would have prevented me from prcscntingan interim report in the
 required time and would not have added significantly to the relevant evidence. 1 have, however, been able to
 take into account many written statements in addition to oral testimony.

    15. Apart from the evidence called by Counsel for the Inquiry which was drawn from statements taken by
 the West Midlands Police and others volunteered by individuals, each o f the represented parties was given full
 opportunity to put forward any witnesses they considered should be called. A final submission was made by
 Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police that since the investigation by West Midlands Police is still continuing,
 all the evidence has not been assembled and it would be unsafe for me to make findings of fact. I should
 therefore make clear that the investigation continues principally to furnish as much detail as possible to H M
 Coroner for the City o f Sheffield as to the cause o f death, the precise position at death and the care and
 movement of each o f the 95 victims individually. I am assured by C h ief Constable Dear and Assistant Chief
 Constable Mcrvyn Jones that it is most unlikely any further evidence gathered will significantly alter or add to
 the history of events which emerged at the hearing.

    16. I should like to thank all those who made it possible for the oral hearing to take place so soon after the
  event and for evidence to be efficiently presented and tested so as to give a full and fair account o f what
  happened in all its aspects without irrelevancy or duplication. 1 pay tribute particularly to the West Midlands
  Police for their speed and dedication in gathering the evidence and to all those responsible for processing it.
The most eloquent tribute to the fairness and thoroughness o f the police investigation came from the Secretary
of the Football Supporters’ Association. He said there had been initial anxiety in Liverpool as to whether that
investigation would be fair and objective. His Association therefore collected 200 witness statements
themselves. Having heard the opening statement by Counsel to the Inquiry based upon the evidence gathered
by the police, he found that it accorded entirely with his Association’s evidence and the initial anxiety was
wholly dispelled.

   17. Before and during the Inquiry I derived great assistance on a wide range of technical issues from the
Health and Safety Executive who providentially have a laboratory in Sheffield (the Research and Laboratory
Services Division) where tests were conducted and reports prepared swiftly and efficiently. This was done
in close consultation with Professor Maunder. I am most grateful to the Director. D r A Jones, and to the
Deputy Director, D r C E Nicholson, for their invaluable help.

  18. I wish to commend Counsel to the inquiry, M r Andrew Collins Q C, M r Alan Goldsack and M r
Bernard Phillips for their industry, care and fairness in selecting and presenting the necessary evidence; also.
Counsel for all those represented who tested that evidence fully but expeditiously. This Interim Report could
not possibly have been prepared in so short a time had I not had the whole-hearted co-operation o f all those
mentioned and many others.

   19. The second phase o f the Inquiry will be directed to making final and longterm recommendations about
crowd control and safety at sports grounds. I need to consider in depth information, opinions and arguments
from a wide range o f sources and contributors both here and abroad. It was clear from the outset that this
second phase could not be carried to completion before the next football season. However, at an early stage of
the oral hearing I invited evidence from all who wished to contribute to it and specifically from many sporting,
local authority, emergency service and police bodies as well as technical consultants. I asked that submissions
should be in writing and should be made promptly so that the second phase of the Inquiry could
follow immediately after the first. I shall now proceed to consider the large body o f written evidence which has
been submitted. I shall want in some instances to have further oral evidence or discussion in conjunction with
my Assessors. We will also need to make a number o f visits and inspections.

   20. I now present my Interim Report and Recommendations. I shall prepare my Final Report and
 Recommendations as soon as reasonably possible.

Fixing The Venue
  21. On 20 March 1989, the Football Association (the FA) requested that their Cup semi-final between
Liverpool and Nottingham Forest be held on 15 April at Hillsborough Football Stadium. The corresponding
semi-final between the same two teams had been held there in April 1988. The arrangements had been
successful in the view both o f the police and o f the host club. Sheffield Wednesday (the Club) were therefore
willing to accommodate the 1989 match. South Yorkshire Constabulary were prepared to police it but only if
the ticketing arrangements were the same as those for 1988. Otherwise, the FA would have to look elsewhere.
Those arrangements did not please Liverpool or its supporters either in 1988 or 1989. They thought the ticket
allocation was unfair for reasons to be explained later. Reluctantly, however, the police requirement was
accepted and the match was fixed for 15 April at Hillsborough.

The Ground
  22. The Hillsborough Stadium is some 2'/: miles to the north-west of central Sheffield in the district of
Owlcrton. The ground was opened in 1899 on what was then a greenfield site by the river Don. The pitch lies
roughly cast to west. A plan o f the ground and its immediate environs is at Appendix 1.

  23. The west end, with which this Inquiry is principally concerned, is known as the Leppings Lane end. The
east end abuts on Penistone Road, the A 61. To the smith is the river Don and to the north a residential street.
Verc Road, which runs between Leppings Lane and I’enistone Road North.

   24. Alongside the river is a private roadway giving access to the south stand, to the Directors’ and players’
entrances, and to the administrative block under the stand. The roadway gives both vehicular and pedestrian
access between Pcnistonc Road and Lcppings Lane, but there arc gates which can shut it off at each end. There
is some car parking along this roadway principally for Directors, players and employees o f the Club. The south
stand dates from 1914 and is the oldest at the ground. It is all seating with places for 8,800. 5,500 o f those arc
roofed over and 3,300 arc uncovered.

  25. The north stand is also all seating and accommodates about 9.700. Behind it is a gymnasium or sports
hall. There arc also a first aid room and police room close by.

   26. The cast end is all terracing and is known as thcSpion Kop. It was enlarged and roofed over in 1986 and
 now accommodates some 21,000 standing spectators. There arc crush barriers in the Kop running parallel to
 the goal line but no dividing fences to prevent free movement from side to side.

    27. At the west or Lcppings Lane end of theground there is tcrracingclose to the pitch. Behind it is the west
 stand which provides covered seating and was built in 1965 lor. World Cup matches, some ol which were held
 at Hillsborough in 1966. The covered stand accommodates 4.456 seated spectators. The terracing in front o f it
 extends higher in the corners between the stands and its total capacity was stated to be 10.100. At both the Kop
 end and the west end access to the pitch is barred by perimeter fencing. The fencing is about eight feet high
 mounted upon the low wall at the foot ofthe terracing. At the top of the fencing the wire returns back at a sharp
 angle for some 15 inches to make it difficult for anyone to climb over towards the pitch. There are gates at
 intervals along the perimeter fencing to afford access between terrace and pitch. These gates are less than a
 metre wide and were designed to be opened only from the pitch side for police purposes or in an emergency.
 They arc marked and numbered on the plan Appendix 1.

    28. Unlike the Kop end, the west terracing has not only crush barriers parallel with the goal line but radial
 fences at right angles to it, dividing the area into pens. This division was begun alter an FA Cup semi-final in
  1981 when crushing occurrcd due to overcrowding and gates had to be opened. It proceeded in stages, the final
 arrangement being shown on the plan Appendix 1, The first section ofthe west terracing moving south to north
 contains gates 1 and 2 and is known as pens 1 and 2 although in fact constituting only one pen. Next is pen 3
 with one gate; next pen 4 with one gate; pen 5, which is extremely narrow, was intended as a sterile area to
 divide pen 4 from pen 6. This was to isolate home and away fans on occasions when both might be
 accommodated on the west terracing in separate pens. Finally there is pen 7 at the north-west corner. Pens 5,6
 and 7 each have a perimeter gate. At the back o f the pens, under the front ofthe west stand, there is a gate in
each radial fcncc. When those gates arc open, the back row o f the terracing is intended to permit access from
pen to pen along the whole west side. In practice, when substantial numbers are present, those gateways are not
readily visible or accessible. The present layout o f the pens, fences, crush harriers and gates lias resulted from a
scries ol'piecciiieal changes. The nature and effect of those changes must he considered later.

The Turnstiles
  29. Bccausc o f the housing in Vcrc Road there is no acccss from the north side o f the ground. Along
Penistone Road North there are some 46 turnstiles which usually give access both to the Kop and to the east
end ofthe north stand. They arc marked 43 to 88 inclusive on the plan. The 12 numbered 77 to 88 are designed
to feed the north stand but were not used for that purpose on 15 April in order to segregate supporters of the
two teams as appears later. Two o f them, 77 and 78, were however used for acccss to the Kop.

  30. At the south side o f the ground there were 24 turnstiles (numbered 19 to 42 on the plan). Those
numbered 37 to 42 led to the Kop and the rest to the south stand.

  31. In summary, the south and east sides of the ground accommodated some 29.800 whose acccss on the
day was through 60 turnstiles.

  32. The other two sides o f the ground, north and west, with a capacity o f 24.256 were fed solely from the
Lcppings Lane entrance where there were only 23 turnstiles.

Travel to the Ground
   33. Most supporters were expected to come by road although rail transport was available. Nottingham
supporters travelling by train would arrive at the main line Sheffield Midland Station whence they would be
directed and escorted northwards by the police. They would arrive at the ground along Penistone Road.
Nottingham supporters travelling by coach, mini-bus or car would approach Sheffield from the south mainly
on the M 1. Again their arrival at the ground would predominantly be via Penistone Road or Herries Road.

    34. Liverpool supporters travelling by normal rail service would arrive at Sheffield Midland Station just
 like their Nottingham counterparts. The police aimed to segregate the rival fans and put them into separate
 coaches. Liverpool fans could alternatively travel by special train to Wadslcy Bridge, a British Rail station
 catering solely for football supporters and situated to the north of the ground. A police escort was available to
 conduct them on foot to the Lcppings Lane entrance. Those coming from Liverpool by road would approach
 Sheffield either via the M 62 and down the M 1 from the north or across the Pcnnincs from the north west. All
 such routes would bring them to the ground via one or other limb of Leppings Lane as shown on Appendix 1.
 Broadly, therefore, arrivals from Liverpool would be from the north and west; arrivals from Nottingham
 would be from the south and cast.

 Allocation of Places and Tickets
   35. Experience in recent years has produced a policy o f segregation to prevent trouble between supporters
 of rival teams. The need for this policy to be maintained was endorsed and emphasised by the Popplewcll
 Report following the Bradford City disaster in 1985. Accordingly, before the 1988 semi-final the police decided
 that sections o f the Hillsborough Stadium should be allocated so as to achieve efficient segregation o f
 Liverpool and Nottingham Forest fans. The section to be granted to each was determined by the direction
 whence each predominantly approached. Thus. Liverpool were allotted the north and west sides ofthe ground
 for which acccss was from Lcppings Lane. Nottingham Forest were allotted the south and cast sides with acccss
 from Pcnistone Road.

   36. The effect o f the decision was that for this all-ticket Cup Tie. Liverpool were allotted only 24.256 places
 as against 29.800 for Nottingham Forest. This, although average attendance o f supporters at home matches
 was substantially higher at Liverpool than at Nottingham. Moreover, with standing tickets at £6 and scats at
 £12. Nottingham Forest had 21.000 standing places compared with Liverpool's 10,100. So, Liverpool's
 allocation was more expensive as well as smaller. Understandably. Liverpool were aggrieved by the allocation
 of places and tickets. They sought with some support from the host club and the FA to have it changed in
  1988, but the police were adamant. To switch ends would, in their opinion, have involved rival supporters
 crossing each other’s paths when approaching the ground thereby frustrating attempts at segregation and
 creating a risk o f disorder. In 1989, when the same plan was proposed, Liverpool again challenged it. The
 police, however, maintained their view, adding that those who had attended in 1988 would he familiar with the
 arrangements and that any change would lead to confusion.
A c c e s s I r o n i 1 ,c|>piiif>s 1 a h w
   37. As the plan Appendix 1 shows, the approach to the west turnstiles is across a narrow neck or forccourt at
a bend in Leppings Lane where, coming from the north, it turns to the south-west and crosses a bridge over the
river Don. Parking areas for the Liverpool supporters had been arranged north and west ofthe ground. They
were therefore expected to arrive on foot along both limbs of Leppings Lane and would converge on the
forecourt at the bend. In an arc across that forecourt is a line o f railings with six sets o f double gates. Inside
those perimeter gates is the short approach to the turnstiles. As shown in the photographs Appendix 2, the
latter are in two sections divided by a fence. The northern section consists o f turnstiles 1 to 16. Numbers 1 to
 10 gave access to the north stand. Thus there were 10 turnstiles for the 9.700 with north stand scats. Their
tickets were marked “ Entrance A ” and were colour-coded brown. Turnstiles 1 to 10 correspondingly had the
letter A above them and brown boards on the wall.

   38. Turnstiles 11 to 16 were for those with seats in the west stand. Thus 4,456 were served by six turnstiles.
They were the next block to the right of those marked A. However, instead of these turnstiles and the west stand
tickets being marked B as might alphabetically have been expected, they were marked C. Their colour-code on
tickets and boards was red.

   39. On the other side o f the dividing fence in the approach area, there were only seven turnstiles to serve
10,100 with tickets for the west terracing. Those seven turnstiles were labelled A to G. This was because there
had originally been 18 turnstiles at Leppings Lane and the sequential numbering continued from 19 upwards
on the south side of the ground. When the number at Leppings Lane was brought up to 23 the present
arrangements o f 1 to 1-6, A to G and then 19 upwards was adopted to avoid re-numbering all round the ground.
However, above the lettering A to G was a large letter B. "Entrance B” also appeared on tickets for the west
terrace. Thus, the three blocks of turnstiles encountered by a ticket holder at the Leppings Lane end read from
left to right A, C, B. The colour-code for west terrace tickets and the boards beside turnstiles A toG was mauve.
To the right o f turnstile G is a tubulai steel barrier to divide the queue for that turnstile from the roadway to the
south stand.

 Inside the Leppings Lane Turnstiles
   40. Turnstiles 1 to 10 gave access to a passageway leading to the north stand. There is an exit gate (marked A
 on Appendix 1) between turnstile 1 and the adjacent housing.

   41. Inside turnstiles 1 to 16 is a concourse leading to pens 6 and 7 and the steps to the west stand. There is a
 wall dividing this area from that inside turnstiles A to G, It had been built to segregate home and away fans at a
 time when the Club intended they should share the west terrace. That idea was not pursued but the wall
 remained. There was, however, a gateway in the wall which did permit access between the two areas. An exit
 gate (marked B on Appendix 1) was provided from the area inside turnstiles 11 to 16.

   42. Finally, anyone using turnstiles A to G entered a concourse bounded on the left by the wall just
 mentioned and on the right by the wall o f the private roadway coming from the south stand to Leppings Lane,
 There was an exit gate in the latter wall (marked C on Appendix 1) just inside turnstile G.

   43. All three exit gates. A, B and C. were of concertina design. They could be opened only from the inside
 and were not intended for entry o f spectators into the ground.

   44. Those entering through turnstiles A to G had three options once inside the ground. They could by
 moving to the right go round the south end ofthe west stand and gain entry into pens 1 and 2. They could go
 through the gap in the dividing wall towards the concourse behind turnstiles 11 to 16 and then round the north
 end o f the west stand into pens 6 or 7. However, there were no conspicuous signs inviting them to take either of
 those courses. The obvious way in was straight ahead of the turnstiles where a tunnel under the middle of the
 west stand gave access to pens 3 and 4. Above its entrance in large letters was the word “Standing" and a large
 letter “ B”. Thus B ticket holders were drawn towards the tunnel.

     45. The length of the tunnel is some 23 metres. It rises slightly at first then levels o ff but finally descends
  towards the terraces at a gradient oi l in 6. As it emerges onto the terrace, the way ahead is bisected by the radial
  fence between pen 3 on the right and pen 4 on the left. A short spurofbrick wall projects forward from each side
  o fth e tum id at its mouth. Those emerging arc thus guided straight forward rather than to cither side. The
  photograph at Appendix 3 shows the west stand and terraces.

    46. As with the layout on the terraces, the configuration ol'the Lcppiugs Lane turnstiles and the areas inside
  them was effected by a series ol'piecemeal changes. Again, it will be necessary lo analyse their resulmnt efleet.

Policing Arrangements
   47. At the 1988 semi-final, policing luid been under the control o f C hief Superintendent Mole, then
Commander o f F Division within whose area Hillsborough lies. 1le was still in post on 20 March 1989 when
the FA broached the 1989 semi-final, but he was due to hand over command o f F Division on 27 March to
Superintendent Duckenfickl on the latter's promotion to Chief Superintendent. Both were present at an initial
meeting on 22 March, but on 27 March M r Mole bowed out and M r Duckenfiekl took over. Under him were
Sector Commanders, all Superintendents with much experience of policing football matches at Hillsborough
and elsewhere. In particular. Superintendent Marshall was in charge o fth e area outside the Lcppings Lane
entrance and the approaches to it. Superintendent Greenwood was in command inside the ground, but this
included the area between the turnstiles and the perimeter fence. They thereby swapped roles from the
previous year. Under M r Duckenfield’s overall command were some 801 officers and men on duty at the
ground plus traffic officers and others from D Division to deal with the influx of supporters into the city centre.
In all, therefore, some 1,122 police were deployed for this match amounting to about 38 per cent o f the total
South Yorkshire force. Included in the mounted section of 34 were officers from Liverpool and Nottingham to
assist respectively in marshalling their home supporters. The total at the ground was divided into serials
consisting usually of eight to ten Constables plus a Sergeant and an Inspector. The serials were posted to duties
at various stations in and around the ground in three phases: before, during and after the match. All of this
was provided for in an Operational Order which followed closely the Order drawn up for the 1988 semi-final
and took into account the force's “Standing Instructions for the Policing o f Football Grounds". The Order
described the duties o f each serial at each phase. It was supplemented by oral briefings before and on the day of
 the match.

Sheffield W ednesday’s Arrangements
  48. The Club provided 376 stewards, gatemen and turnstile operators for duty on 15 April. The stewards
were briefed as to their duties on the morning of the match by police Inspectors and were allocated round the
ground. They wore yellow tabards. The Club’s control room, situated below the south stand, could
communicate by V H F radio with the stewards. Closed circuit television was installed by the Club with
screens in their control room showing all the turnstiles round the ground. A computerised counting system was
incorporated in the turnstiles. This flashed onto a screen in the Club control room the running total o f
spectators passing through the turnstiles section by section. Thus, at the Leppings Lane end, there would be
separate running totals for turnstiles 1 to 10 (north stand), turnstiles 11 to 16 (west stand), and turnstiles A to G
(west terraces). When the total forany section was within 15 percent of its permitted capacity a warning pulse
showed on the screen. For the west terracing that warning would occur when the numbers were within 15 per
cent o f the total terrace capacity o f 10,100. What the system could not do was monitor the distribution of fans
on the terracing, pen by pen. It could give no warning therefore if one pen was full beyond its safe capacity.

Police Communications
   49. The nerve centre for police control is the control room or box situated at the south-west corner o f the
 ground between the south stand and pen 1 o f the west terracing. The box is elevated and reached by a number
 of steps. It has windows commanding views across the pitch and straight along the line of the west perimeter
 fence. The box is very small and has seats for only three officers. Superintendent Murray was in control of it
 and was advisor to M r Duckenficld as he had been to M r Mole the year before. Next to him sat Sergeant
 Goddard who operated the radios. The third seat was for Police Constable Ryan who operated the telephone
 and public address systems. At the back o f the box stood Police Constable Bichard who was in control o f the
 police closed circuit television system operated by a row of consoles on a bench in front o f him and behind the
 three seated officers.

   50. There were five television screens showing views of five roving cameras fixed at high points on the
 stands and directed both inside and outside the ground. There was also a master screen which flicked in
 rotation from one camera view to another and which made a video recording. The cameras have a zoom
 facility to close in on any point of interest. Specifically, there were good camera views o f the west terracing, o f
 the Lcppings Lane turnstiles and beyond them o f Leppings Lane itself.

   51. The Tannoy public address system was relayed through speakers fixed at vantage points inside the
 ground and outside the turnstiles. It was used by a disc jockey, housed under the police control box, to relay
 music before the match, but it could be overridden by the police. Messages could be relayed through all
 speakers or if appropriate to one area only.




                                                           7
   53.   Radio contact at Hillsborough from control to serials operating both inside and outside the ground was
U H F on channel 25. There was a W1 F U portable base station in the control box and if it failed there was a
stand-by station under the operator's bench. Hand sets were issued to all ranks o f Sergeant and above.
Community Constables on duty would already have their own. Other Constables had no radio.
Communication was on “talk through” i.e. any message from any source would be heard by everyone tuned in
and if more than one source spoke messages could become garbled. Ear pieces were issued to some officers in
an attempt to overcome the loud crowd noise which made receipt of signals very difficult. There were other
radio channels open to Sergeant Goddard: V H F to police Headquarters at Snig H ill, channel 35 to FI
Sub-divisional Headquarters at Hammerton Road and channel 19 used by Cl D. There was also a set tuned to
Sheffield Wednesday’s radio system between its control room and the stewards.

                                 15th APRIL : T I I E B U I L D - U P T O 2.30pm

Early Arrivals
  54. 15 April 1989 was a warm sunny spring Saturday. The match was a sell-out, so 54,000 ticket holders
were expected. Others would come without tickets hoping to acquire them or even to gain acccss otherwise.
The following account concentrates, as did the evidence, on the western approaches and the Liverpool
supporters since the disaster occurred at their end. They began to arrive in the Hillsborough area quite early in
small numbers. Some brought cans o f beer with them and were seen drinking as they walked: others took
advantage o f the weather and sat about on walls and open spaces. When the public houses opened, many
resorted there, drinking inside or spilling out into the sunshine. Leppings Lane and its environs comprise a
mixed shopping and residential area. Local residents saw groups o f Liverpool supporters keen to find a public
house or off-licence. Many were asking for tickets or '‘spares”. There were a few touts selling them at inflated
prices. From an early stage, some of the fans were using private gardens and yards to urinate. As the morning
wore on, numbers increased. Requests for tickets and trespass to urinate also increased. Still the prevailing
mood was one o f carnival, good humour and expectation.

Public H ouses
  55. There were some 74 shops with off-licences in and around Sheffield. In general, they opened at 8 am.
Liverpool supporters did visit them but the evidence did not suggest a great amount o f alcoholic drink was
bought there.

  56. Opening time at public houses was in general 11 am. Some remained closed all day. O fthe others, sonic
72. mostly in the city, were frequented by local patrons only. Some 23 public houses, however, served over :i
hundred Liverpool supporters each. Another 51 served more than 20 each. Little trouble was reported, but
many supporters drank enough to affect tlicir mood. At first excitement: later frustration.

The Gathering Crowd
  57. Towards the end of the morning, fans gathered on and around the bridge near the Leppings Lane
entrance. They seemed reluctant to enter the ground early. All turnstiles were open at 12 noon and one or two
as early as 11.30 am. Some 53 police had been deployed to operate outside the turnstiles and in the Leppings
Lane area. They enquired at random whether fans had tickets. Those who had not were advised to go away;
nevertheless, many returned more than once. Those who had tickets were guided in the right direction. The
police tried to persuade them to enter the ground early. Officers, male and female, had been posted outside
each turnstile with the duty of searching entrants for weapons, drink or drugs. Once through the turnstile, an
entrant was liable to be searched again by one o fa serial ofofficers positioned just inside.

  58. At about 12 noon Chief lnspector.Creaser asked Superintendent Murray whether the pens on the west
tcrrace were to be filled one by one successively, but was told that they should all be available from the start and
the fans should find their own level.

   59. By 2 pm it was apparent to those inside the ground and those monitoring events in the police and Club
 control rooms that the number o f Nottingham fans in their places greatly outnumbered those from Liverpool.
 The Kop and the south stand were filling up steadily, but the north and west stands were half empty. It was
 noted about that time that the turnstile figures showed only 12,000 had entered as against 20,000 at the same
 time the previous year. On the west terraces, although pens 3 and 4 were filling, the wing pens 1 ,2,6 and 7 were
 nearly empty. At 2.15 pm a Tannoy message asked fans in pens 3 and 4 to move forward and make room for
 others.

   60. There had been three special trains from Liverpool in 1988. This time, there was only one. It arrived
 early, just before 2 pm, at Wadsley Bridge station. The 350 passengers were met by both mounted and foot
 police officers who escorted them in a crocodile down Lcppings Lane. They were orderly and passed through
 the turnstiles into the ground by about 2.20 pm without incident.

   61. By this time the police Traffic Division reported that the Liverpool routes were clear, so the majority o f
 Liverpool fans were in the Sheffield area. The numbers converging on the Leppings Lane entrance were
 increasing rapidly. Between the perimeter gates and the turnstiles the crowd became congested. There was no
 longer a separate queue at each turnstile but a single phalanx filling the whole approach area. The foot officers
 outside the turnstiles were no longer able to search everyone and had difficulty in searching even selectively.

    Mounted officers in and outside the turnstile area were having difficulty manoeuvring in such a dense crowd.
    The police were beset by fans bemused by the ticket and turnstile labelling asking for directions. Many had
    been drinking but up to and just after 2.30 pm the mood remained good.

      62.     Superintendent Marshall was on foot amongst the crowd. He became anxious about the numbers
    coming down Lcppings Lane and spilling out onto the roadway where buses and cars were moving. At 2.17
    pm he radioed to control to have motor traffic in Leppings Lane stopped. This was eventually done at about
    2.30 pm. U p to this time, despite the large mass outside the turnstiles and the numbers still approaching, there
    was still no panic in the crowd: no perception o f crisis by the police. In the control room M r Murray, who could
    see Leppings Lane on the video, advised M r Duckenfield that they would get everyone in by 3 pm. M r
    Duckenfield reaffirmed to him the policy about a delayed kick-off. It would be ordered only if there wassome
    majorcxternal factor such as fog on the Pennines or delay on the motorway: not if spectators merely turned up
    late even in large numbers.

                                   T H E CRISIS A T T IIE T U R N ST IL E S

  63. In the 20 minutes from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm there were crucial developments both inside and outside
the ground. In pens 3 and 4 there was a steady increase in pressure as more fans came through the tunnel to the
favoured area behind the goal. By 2.50 pm these pens were already full to a degree which caused serious
discomfort to many well used to enduring pressure on terraces. The numbers at that time were clearly in excess
of the maximum density stated by the Home Office Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds (1986 Edn) (the Green
Guide) i.e. 54 persons per 10 square metres. (Although the Green Guide has no statutory or legal force, it is the
only official advice available about safety at sports grounds.) In the wing pens 1. 2. 6 and 7, there was still
ample room and bare patches o f concrete were visible.

  64. Meanwhile, the crowd grew at the Leppings Lane entrance. As more arrived at the back the crush at the
front grew worse. Entry to the turnstiles became more difficult. Their efficiency was impaired and their rate
reduced. Arrivals at the back exceeded deliveries through the turnstiles, so the build-up increased. The foot
officers outside were unable to function and in danger themselves so they went through the turnstiles and out
again through gate C where they did wluit they could to relieve pressure by the tubular barrier. The mounted
officers were surrounded by the dense mass o f people and became ineffective. Superintendent Marshall was in
the midst o f the turmoil. He extricated himself and stood on a parapet o fth e bridge to get a clear view. A
drunken fan tried to push him off: a beer can was thrown at a mounted officer. Hut these were isolated acts by
individuals; the menace came from the massive numbers single-mindedly determined to be in for the kick-off
with time running out. At the back o f the crowd fans were frustrated by the lack of progress as 3 o’clock
approached. Some, mostly young men who had been drinking, tried to push and force their way forward. At
the front, people were jammed together and against the turnstile walls. Some panicked as the pressure
intensified. Some youngsters and women were fainting and in distress. They'were helped out through the
tubular barrier by turnstile G or were passed over the turnstiles elsewhere. Fans climbed up and over the
turnstile building or on to the dividing fence. This was to escape the crush rather than to gain free entry since
most of them had tickets.

  65. At 2.44 pm M r Marshall radioed for reinforcements, for the Tannoy to request the crowd to stop
pushing and fora vehicle with loudspeaker equipment to come and request the same. Unhappily, at about 2.40
pm, radio communication on channel 25 became defective. For a period o f two or three minutes the control
room lost contact, A communications officer came promptly and switched to the standby station. With the use
of a handset at control, contact was restored. Despite this hiatus, two of M r Marshall’s requests were received.
The Tannoy was used but with little effect. Reinforcements, including mounted officers from Penistonc Road,
were sent. The third request, for a Landrover. was received direct by its driver PC Buxton who arrived at 2.46
pm and urged the crowd by loudspeaker not to push. This was no more effective than the Tannoy. The
mounted officers besieged near the turnstiles came outside the perimeter gates. An attempt was made to shut
them against the crowd outside, to enable the throng inside to be dispersed or at least thinned through the
turnstiles. The pressure from without, however, opened the gates again. Mounted officers, now reinforced to
greater numbers, formed a cordon across the elbow o f Leppings Lane from the sweet shop to the bridge, again
with the object o f reducing pressure inside the gates. They were successful in this for some minutes despite
desperate individuals forcing their way under or between the horses. However, this exercise was overtaken by a
more dramatic relief o f the pressure.

 “Open the Gates”
    66. Between 2.40 pm and 2.45 pm the crowd inside and outside the turnstile approach had swelled to
 over 5,000. At the head o f the phalanx conditions had become intolerable. Those who got through were short
 o f breath and sweating profusely. Many complained to police officers on the concourse inside the turnstiles
 and asked them in forceful terms to do something. Exit gates A and B were being shaken. It was clear the crowd
 could not pass through the turnstiles by 3 pm. Police Constable Buxton radioed from the Landrover to control
 asking that kick-off be postponed. The suggestion was acknowledged but rejected.

   67. Superintendent Marshall realised the crowd had become unmanageable. Although loth to do so, sincc it
 was contrary to basic police strategy, lie decided to request the exit gates be opened to relieve the pressure.
 Otherwise, he feared fatalities would occur. Other senior officers outside the ground agreed. At 2.47 pm he
 radioed control to permit the gates to be opened. At 2.48 pm. whilst M r Duckenfield was considering the
 request, gate C opened to eject a youth who had climbed in with no ticket. Immediately, fans outside took
 advantage and about 150 managed to gel in before a mounted officer enabled the gate to be closed again. M r
 Marshall repeated his request. Still no response from control. 1le repeated it a third lime, adding that if the

        gates were not opened someone was going to be killed. In the control room. M r Duckcnllcld had not made a
        decision. M r Murray asked him “Arc you going to open the gates?”. M r Duckcnficld gave the order and Sgt
        Goddard radioed to M r Marshall “ Open the gates”. Neither the Club control room nor any police officers
        inside the turnstiles were told o f this order before or after it was given or o f any action it would require.

          68. At 2.52 pm. gate C was opened wide. Fans behind turnstiles A to G and from the concoursc beyond
        came round to flow through it in large numbers.

           69. About two minutes later the pressure outside gate A led Sgt Higgins to radio, despite the gatcman's
        objection, for it to be opened. I f it was not, he said, “It'll go and someone will get killed”. Permission wasgiven.
        but this time reserve serials were alerted to monitor the inrush towards the north stand. Gate B was also briefly
        opened against the gateman's wishes and about 200 o f those pressed at turnstiles A to G gained entry to their
        left.

          70. The largest entry, however, was through gate C. In the five minutes it was open about 2.000 fans passed
        through it steadily at a fast walk. Some may have had tickets for the stands. No doubt some had no tickets at all.
        The majority had tickets for the terraces. O f these, some found their way either right to pens 1 and 2 or left
        through the dividing wall to 6 and 7. But a large proportion headed straight for the tunnel in front o f them.




                                                                   12

  71. The initial influx through gate C, augmented by entrants via the turnstiles, came through the tunnel
with great momentum. Fans spoke o f being swept through, feet o ff the ground. The 1 in 6 gradient acceleratcd
their progress. Upon reaching the crowded pens, some wished to go back but were unable to do so. The new
arrivals found themselves pushed forward and the pressure bccame intense. At 2.54 pm, shortly after this
influx began, the teams came onto the pitch. As usual, this was greeted by a surge forward. Many were now
acutely uncomfortable and some were in distress. The mass seethed about but voluntary movement by any
individual was difficult; hands down could not be raised and some fans found it hard to breathe. Still the flow
continued through the tunnel causing further surges forward. There were sliouls lor help and for llie gates to he
opened to the pitch. Police officers on the perimeter track did not.immediately react. In the deafening noise
from chanting and shouting they did not at first recognise the problem. Realisation c:imc at different moments
to different officers in different places.

  72. Gate 3 sprang open under the intense pressure from within. An officer quickly closed it. Shortly
afterwards, it sprang again; officers tried to shut it. Those seeking to escape were urged and pushed back. Gate
4 was opened by a policeman who noticed the crushing. People began to spill out through it and were directed
to the wing pens where there was still ample room. Meanwhile, gate 4 was closed again and then re-opened. At
gate 3, a Constable, now alive to the crisis, followed strictly his written orders and radioed for permission to
open that gate. Receiving no reply, he took it upon himself to open it,

  73. Just before 3 pm, the match kicked off. At the same time, gate C, which had been closed at 2.57 pm,
was reopened and a steady trickle continued to enter through the tunnel.

   74. To escape the crush, fans began climbing the radial fences out of pens 3 and 4 into pens 2 and 5. Others
tried to get over the front perimeter fence but were at first turned back by police who feared a pitch invasion.
Near the front, fans, mostly youngsters, were weakened to the point of collapse and in some instances death but
they were held upright by pressure all round. Further back, most were so preoccupicd with the pain of being
pressed against barriers and with breathing problems that they saw nothing o f the game. But at the rear there
were many who, although cramped, were watching the football unaware of the distress at the front.

  75. At 3.04 pm, Beardsley for Liverpool struck the crossbar at the Kop end. There was a roar from the
Liverpool fans and at the same time a powerful surge forwards in pen 3. The several surges which occurred after
the influx from gate C carried the pressure down the pens towards the pitch. The force became such as to twist
and break two spans o f a crush barrier towards the front of pen 3. The evidence does not establish with
certainty when this happened. Probably it was triggered by the surge at 3.04 pm. But 1 am sure it occurred after
the influx from gate C so greatly increased the pressure in the pen. When the barrier broke those whom it had
supported were projected towards the perimeter fence. Many fell and the involuntary rush o f those behind
pressed them down. The crushing force was transmitted and dispersed so that all along the front of pen 3 fans
 were pressed hard up against the low wall and the wire mesh o f the fence above it.

   76. In pen 4 no barrier broke. Nevertheless those at the front were crushed against wall and fence. Further
 back, two barriers were bowed and some individuals succumbed to the pressure around them.

    77. Surges on terraces are common. Usually, they go forward, then recede. Here, with the weight o f
 numbers, there was no receding. The pressure stayed and for those crushed breathless by it, standing or prone,
 life was ebbing away. I f no relief came in four minutes there would be irreversible brain damage; if longer,
 death.

   78. In the control room no-one noticed the overcrowding or anything amiss in pens 3 and 4 until the first
 fans spilt out onto the perimeter track just before kick-off. Then, the officers in command assumed that there
 was an attempted pitch invasion. They called up reserve serials waiting in the gymnasium and all available
 officers elsewhere to go to the pitch. A request was made to H Q for dog handlers.

   79. Superintendent Greenwood, the Ground Commander, was by the players’ tunnel at the kick-off. He
 noticed fans on the track and went to the west end behind the goal. As lie approached, he did not think the pens
 overcrowded until lie was very close and saw those pressed against the fence. Even then, he thought the
 situation “retrievable” if those higher up the pen relieved the pressure. He climbed on the wall below the fence
 and signalled with both hands to those behind to move back. Other officers joined him. It was impossible.
 Those fans who would have wished to comply were powerless to do so. Behind them, there were still many

unaware o f the crisis, watching the game. The football continued to joyous shouting and singing round the rest
of the ground while those crushed and trapped slowly expired.

  80.    When M r Greenwood’s signals to move back proved fruitless, he tried to radio for the match to be
stopped. At first, his message was not received by control, so he signalled with his arms towards the control         Rescu

 , the
.11lie       81. From 3 o'clock, gates 3 and 4 had been open and remained so. At first. Fans had walked or staggered out
          winded and faint, lint the final surge at 3.04 pin. and the struggle to reach the open gates. caused a horrendous
          blockage o f bodies. The dead, the dying and the desperate became interwoven in the snnip at the front o ft lie
          pens, especially by the gates. Those with .strength left clambered over others submerged in the human heap and
          tried to climb out over the fence. They were now helped by police and other fans who hauled them up and over.
          Numbers o f fans were climbing over the radial fences into adjacent pens. At the back, many were hauled up
          into the west stand to relieve the pressure.

            82. The steps from the sump at gateways 3 and 4 were so congested with bodies live and dead that each had
          to be prised from the pile by the police. Initially, no officer took effective charge. A number o f individual
          officers and fans worked frantically to free those trapped but the gateways were so narrow that only two or three
          could get at the entwined bodies Willing hands got in one another's wav. More officers arrived from the
          gymnasium and elsewhere in the ground. Many used their own initiative to help those laid out on the pitch, to
          assist in getting others over the fencing and to comfort the distressed. Hut some stood in groups near the
          perimeter fence not knowing what to do. They had been summoned in response to what was thought to be a
          threat to public order. What they found was a horrific scene o f carnage and some young officers were shocked
          into impotence by what they saw.

            83. It was truly gruesome. The victims were blue, cyanotic, incontinent: their mouths open, vomiting; their
          eyes staring. A pilcofdead bodies lay and grew outside gate 3. Extending further and further oil to the pitch, the
          injured were laid down and attempts made to revive them. More and more walking survivors Hooded out on to
          the pitch as the players left. The scene was emotive and chaotic as well as gruesome. As the enormity o f the
          disaster was realised, many o f the fans milling about were bitter and hostile to the police, blaming them for
          what had happened. Officers were confronted, abused, spat upon and even assaulted. A small number o f
          hysterical fans had to be subdued.

            84. Adding to the chaos, a number o f press photographers dodged about among rescue workers apparently
          avid to secure photographs at point blank range of those living through the wire mesh and those laid on the
          pitch. Angry fans sought to assault them. Police hail to intervene.

             85. At about 3.12 pm. Chief Superintendent Ncsbit. Commander o fth e Traffic Division, arrived on the
          pitch. He took charge at gate 3 and organised a chain of officers to simplify and expedite the extraction o f
          casualties from the pen. In the absence o f any mechanical means, police and fans together pulled and worked
          at the wire mesh with their bare hands and their feet to breach the fencing. They succeeded in both pens,
          enabling officers to get in and fans to be got out.

             86. By now, some officers o f their own initiative went round from the pitch to the tunnel where they met
          other officers from the turnstiles and the west stand. Together, they tried to persuade fans at the rear o f the pens
          to go back through the tunnel. Some complied, but many resisted, w ishing to stand their ground. Casualties
          were brought out through the tunnel, anil as the pressure in the pens was relieved, officers were able to get
          further in and bring out more casualties, dead and alive. They were laid on the ground in the concourse outside
          the tunnel and attempts were made to revive them.

          First Aid
            87. The St John Ambulance Brigade had some 30 personnel posted round the ground for the match - 25
          adults and 5 ju n io r cadets. They were quickly on the scene w hen the first casualties emerged and sought to
          revive them. Their Divisional Superintendent. M r Wells, tried unsuccessfully to help those pressed against the
          fencing by feeding oxygen to them through the mesh until they could be got out.

            88. D r Purcell, Sheffield Wednesday's doctor, came from his seat in the south stand anil attempted
          resuscitation. Assisted by a male nurse from the crowd, lie moved from patient to patient doing what he could,
          but in most cases it was too late.

            89. At 3.13 pm a St John's ambulance came onto the pitch at the north-east corner and drove to the
          perimeter fence close to gate 3. There was no call lor doctors and nurses on the public address system until
          nearly 3.30 pm. Nevertheless, as the minutes ticked past, some o f them came onto the pitch to help o f their


                                                                    Is

own accord when they saw the casualties and the ambulance and realised the gravity o f the situation. Many                 gale
fans also worked prodigiously in attempts to revive the dead and the dying, in some cases their own relatives              sere
and friends. Artificial respiration, mouth to mouth respiration and cardiac massage were applied by the skilled            bcci
and the unskilled but usually in vain. Those capable o f survival mostly came round o f their own accord. The               con
rest were mostly doomed before they could be brought out and treated.                                                       fore

   90. There was an urgent need to get casualties off the pitch and to hospital. There were six stretchers in the             9
first aid room and three in the St John's ambulance. They were quickly brought            into use. Then the fans           nie
improvised by tearing down the hoardings around the edge of the pitch and against thestandsso that lengthsof                Du
board could be used as stretchers. Improvising in this way, parties of fans and police ran repeatedly the length            he
o f the pitch bearing casualties to the north-east corner. A number were dead on arrival there.                             opt

In the Control Room                                                                       pu
  91. M r Duckenfield stayed in the control room. Chief Inspector McRobbic was there in civilian clothes as
an observer. M r Duckenfield sent him down to the track to tell a policewoman at gate 1 to admit those                        me
displaced from the centre pens. M r Duckenfield did not realise there were injuries until he saw someone laid
on the pitch. Even then, lie did not realise the nature of the problem or its scale.                                          nl<
                                                                                                                              fo
  92. M r Murray returned from his attempt to stop the match and M r Duckenfield sent him down again to                       <ji
clear the pitch and assess the situation. A message was broadcast requesting fans to dear the pitch. This was
becausc M r Duckenfield could not from the control room see clearly what was happening for the milling and                       j.-j
increasing numbers.

   93. The Assistant Chief Constable ( ( )perations). M r Jackson, had attended the match in civilian clothes as
a guest ofthe ( 'lull. 1le came from his scat in the south stand to ask what hail happened. M r Dnckcn field was                  ‘
unable to say; lie did not tell M r Jackson that the exit gates had been opened on his authority. M r Jackson went
down to the pitch to discover the situation.

  94. At 3.06 pm M r Duckenficld. still primarily concerned about public order, caused a message to be sent
to Headquarters asking for Operation Support. That was a call for all available additional police resources to
come to the ground to strengthen the police presence.                                                                        a

   95. M r Jackson was told by M r Greenwood that there were casualties and returned immediately to control
to make sure emergency services were alerted. Meanwhile, M r Murray had seen the plight of those behind the                             ^
fence. He radioed to control that a licet o f ambulances was required. He also asked for a Tannoy broadcast to                          i'

those in the pens to move back but there is no clear evidence that it was made.

   96. Only when M r Duckenfield received the request for a fleet of ambulances did he realise the nature and                                1
 gravity of the situation. Then, supported by M r Jackson, he caused messages to be sent converting Operation                                s
 Support into calls for the M ajor Disaster Plan.

 No Information
   97. Apart from the message to clear the pitch and the belated call for medical assistance about 3.30 pm, no
 information or advice was broadcast on the public address system. M r Duckenfield feared that the crowd
 might turn hostile or might all attempt to leave together thereby hampering the emergency services if they were
 given information about what had happened. The result was that apart from those close enough at the west end
 to see the terrible truth for themselves, the majority o f the crowd were left in ignorance. Many, especially
 Nottingham supporters in the Kop, still thought there had been a pitch invasion or other misbehaviour by
 Liverpool fans. They continued singing and chanting incongruously. This infuriated some Liverpool fans who
 were already distraught. A few began to run towards the Kop end. The police feared violence might result on
 top o f the existing disaster. Accordingly, they deployed a large number o f officers to form a line across the
 width o f the pitch at the Kop end and advance up to the halfway line sweeping any Liverpool fans back as they
 moved. There the line stood as an insurance against disorder but doing nothing. Other officers were posted to
 the perimeter track facing the north stand for the same purpose. To those distressed and distraught who
 wanted urgent action, this large contingent of passive officers was seen as an affront. Feelings against the police
 intensified.

 Misinformation
   98. At about 3.15 pm, M r Graham Kelly. Chief Executive o f the FA. M r Kirton also o f the FA and M r
 Graham Mackrell, Secretary o f Sheffield Wednesday, went to the control room for information. M r
 Duekcnfield told them lie thought there were fatalities and the game was likely to be abandoned. He also said a

my        gate had been forced and there had been an in rush ofl.ivcrpool suppoi'tcis. 1le pointed to one ofthe television
vcs       screens focussed on gate C by the Lcppings Lane turnstiles and said "1 hat's the gate that's been forced: there's
cd        been an inrush”. Inevitably M r Kelly was interviewed a little In ter live on television. 1le spoke ofthe two stories
lie       concerning the gate - the fans' account that the police hail opened it. the police assertion that the fans hail
          forced their way in.

he           99. About 3.30 pm there was a further meeting in the Club's boardroom. M r Duckenfield went there and
ns        met M r Kelly, the referee and representatives o f the three elubs. ACC Jackson was also there. M r
of        Duckcnficld indicated the match was likely to be abandoned although no firm ruling was given. 1le added that
th        lie did not want people to know it was to be abandoned lest the dispersing crowd hamper the emergency
          operations.

          Public Announcements
is
             100. Later the managers of the two teams were asked to go to the control room. They were invited there to
 c
          make a public announcement to calm the crowd. M r Kenny Dalglish agreed to do so. He told the crowd that
d         there were problems and asked them to assist the police and those rendering first aid. 1le asked for calm and his
          message was well received. It was then 3.56 pm. At 4.10 pm it was announced that the match was abandoned
          for that day. Again that message was received calmly by the crowd most of whom behaved responsibly as they
          dispersed.
I
          Fire Brigade
             101. Meanwhile the emergency services had been in action. At about 3.10 pm a request came from the
          perimeter fence to control for bolt croppers to cut the wire mesh. Sergeant Goddard contacted the police garage
          close by without success. At 3.13 pm, PC Bichard requested Headquarters to call the lire service to bring
          hydraulic cutting equipment to the Leppings Lane entrance.

             102. There was no arrangement for a fire officer to be present during the match. However, the M ajo r
          Disaster Plan required all emergency services to be alerted. After 'phone messages which must be described
          later, fire appliances arrived at both Lcppings Lane and Pcnistone Road at 3.22 pm. At both entrances their
          arrival surprised police who were uninformed as to why they had been callcd or where they should go.

            103. At Lcppings Lane a police Inspector told Station Officer Swain “ 1 don't really think we need you".
          Another police officer then asked for more rcsuscitators as people were dying so M r Swain radioed for ten fire
          appliances. Each carries oxygen and resuscitation equipment.

              104. At the Kop end. Leading Fireman Houslcy arrived with an emergency tender and Station Officer
           Fletcher in another appliance, each with a crew. The emergency tender came along the roadway by the south
           stand but owing to its height was unable to proceed further. It therefore backed out and went to the Lcppings
           Lane entrance losing some eight minutes. From there. M r Housley and his crew went onto the pitch with
           resuscitation equipment. They rendered help there and later at the gymnasium. M r Fletcher and his men ran
           along behind the south stand carrying cutting equipment and oxygen cylinders. When they arrived at the
           fence, the cutting equipment was not required as by then the last of the dead and injured were being removed
           from the pens. M r Fletcher set up a casualty clearing area under the police box and firemen assisted in carrying
           victims as well as rendering first aid on the pitch.

           South Yorkshire Metropolitan Ambulance Service (S Y M AS)
              105. Before 1986 there had been no S Y M A S representative routinely present at Hillsborough matches. The
           Club was content, as indeed arc many other clubs, to rely upon the St John's Ambulance Brigade and a 999 call
           if necessary. From 1986 onwards, alter representations, the Club provided two scats in the south stand lor
           SYMAS staff at League matches. At one stage it was suggested they would be best placcd in the north stand
           close to the gymnasium which had been designated as the casualty centre in the event ol a major incident. The
           south stand scats were allotted as they placcd the SYMAS staff closer to the players' tunnel should a player be
           injured. These scats were, however, not available at Cup scmi-linals. SYM A S representatives nevertheless
           attended at the semi-finals by arrangement with the police in 1988 and again in 1989. The SYMAS officers
           stood on the ramp leading to the pitch at the north-east corner. They hail one ambulance outside the ground
           and one on standby.

               106. On 15 April 1989. Officers Higgins and Eason were at the ground with an ambulance and crew. They
            noticed fans on the track and went to the Leppings Lane end whilst the game was still in progress. 1 bey begun
            to attend to casualties. Meanwhile, at 2.59 pm, there had been a call lrom Police Constable Waugh at police


                                                                     17
Headquarters to the Hillsborough police control asking if ambulances were required. This was on the
instruction o f Chief Inspector Edmundson who had heard over the radio, as had Police Constable Waugh
himself, crowd noise and snatches of speech from Hillsborough suggesting distress and possible injuries. The
reply from the control box was: no reports of injuries but keep standing by. At 3.07 pm after hearing from the
ground that there might lie injuries, police 1Ieadquarters notified SYMAS that ambulances might be required.
Then, seconds later, M r M urray’s request for a licet of ambulances was relayed to SYMAS. They reacted at
once. Ambulances began to arrive at the Lcppings Lane entrance at 3.13 pm and at the Penistonc Road
entrance at 3.17 pm. In all. some 42 ambulances attended, 31 o f them from SYM A S and 11 from
neighbouring authorities. By 4.30 pm, they had conveyed some 172 casualties to the Northern General
Hospital and the Royal Hallamshire Hospital.

Gymnasium
  107. The gymnasium had been in use for serving meals to the police. When the M ajor Disaster Plan was
ordered, it was cleared and divided into two. One end became a temporary mortuary; the other was used as a
casualty clearing area for the injured. As the stretchers, designed and improvised, brought in more and more
casualties, the scene was initially and inevitably chaotic anil harrowing. There was intense distress amongst
the injured and bereaved; relatives were reluctant to be parted from the dead and sought to revive them.There
were people looking for missing friends and relations; there were recriminations, there were scuffles. Some of
those involved were the worse for drink. Doctors and nurses had followed the casualties in from the pitch and
sought to attend the injured as best they could in the adverse circumstances. Those in most urgent need of
hospital treatment were taken to ambulances as they arrived, triage being employed to determine priorities.
Doctors were requested by the police to examine each person thought to be deceased to confirm and certify
death. A policc Constable was detailed to attend and guard each of the dead and a photograph o f each was
taken by a police photographer so that relatives coming to identify bodies could be spared the ordeal of
searching amongst all who had died.

 1'he Dead and the Injured
  108. O f the 95 who died, the evidence suggests that at least 1ft and probably 21 came through gate C a lle r it
opened at 2.52 pm. That is established by the statements of relatives and friends who came through with them
but survived.

   109. By commendable hard work, a team of pathologists headed by Professor Usher completed
post-mortem examinations on all the deceased within 48 hours. They found that 88 of the victims were male
and seven female. Thirty-eight were under 20 years of age, 39 were between 20 and 29 years and only three were
over 50. In virtually every case the cause of death was crush asphyxia due to compression o fth e chest wall
against other bodies or fixed structures so as to prevent inhalation. In all but nine cases that was the sole cause.
In one, pressure on the chest had been so great as to rupture the aorta: in six cases there were also injuries to the
head, neck or chcst; in the remaining two cases, natural disease was a contributory factor. In 18 cases bones
were fractured. Thirteen o f those were rib fractures. However, one was a fractured lemur, one a fractured
radius and the remaining three involved fractures o f bones or cartilagcs round the voice box. These injuries
suggest the victims may have been trodden while on the ground.

had no more than 10 milligrams percent in their blood which is negligible; 15 had over 80 milligrams percent
and six over 120 milligrams per cent.

  111. Although the great majority o f those who died were in pen 3, at least live were in pen 4. Most deaths
occurred at the front o f the pens but there were a few fatalities further back.

  112. In all, some 730 people complained of being injured inside the ground and 36 outside it. O f the 730.
about 30% arc thought to have entered through gate C after 2.52 pm. The largest category o f injury was
bruising, especially to the ribs and chcst.

that they should be closed to further arrivals. Even the numbers coming through the turnstiles in the last 10

and moving spectators from one area to another, if necessary. It is a function beset by three problems. 1) Who
should carry it out? 2) When is an area “full"? 3) Fear of hooliganism.

Who should Monitor the Terraces?
   161. Should it be the host club via its stewards? Should it be the police'.’ Should it be both? O r should it be by
arrangement, depending upon the ground or section of the ground in question?

   162. In principle, a football club which invites the public to a match on its premises for reward is
responsible for securing safety at that event. The Green Guide (1986) provides:

       “ 23. The safety of the public inside the ground is the responsibility o f those who stage the event and
             administer the ground in which it is held, i c the "management”. This responsibility applies in
             both normal and emergency situations...

         195. ...there arc live basic duties which stewards are called upon to carry out. These are:

               (a)   controlling or directing members o f the public who arc entering or leaving the ground, to
                     help achieve an even flow of people to the viewing areas and safe dispersal ofspeeta tors on
                     the terraces or viewing slopes;

               (b)   patrolling the ground to deal with any emergencies,        eg   raising alarms or extinguishing
                     fires;

               (c)   manning entrances, exits and other strategic points, especially exit doors and gates which
                     arc continuously open whilst the ground is in use;

               (d)   assisting police as appropriate or as requested with crowd control: and

               (c)   undertaking specific duties in an emergency.”

The Interim Popplewell Report
   163. There was considerable controversy in the course of the public inquiry held by M r Justice Popplcwcll
in 1985 as to the responsibility of the club and the police. In paragraph 3.6 o f his interim report, M r Justice
Popplewcll quoted from a report produced for the Minister o f Housing and Local Government in 1969 as
follows:-

   “Thc responsibility for controlling crowd behaviour is divided between the police and the club opera ting the
   ground. The broad line o f division being that police arc responsible for movement o f spectators in public
   thoroughfares and from public thoroughfares into the ground, while the club is responsible for the control of
   spectators once they are on the club's premises

V - Vv: w ”.v w .      v - ■.     \\    .a           \r. • . j - v ..a n o n to observe that in practice the police
have to take chuige and be responsible for controlling crowd behaviour. He then said (paragraph 3.8):

  “ It follow's, therefore, that as a matter of practice, while the physical safety o f the building and the
  maintenance and good housekeeping o f the ground must always be the responsibility ofthe club, the police
  have to take the d c f a c t o responsibility o f organising the crowd, with all that entails, during the game . . ”

M r Justice Popplewell went on to instance evacuation of the ground as a procedure in which only the police
could bear the responsibility of supervising the organisation ofthe crowd.

T h e Final Popplewell Report
   164. He harked back to this subject in chapter 4 ol'his Final Report. There, he came down more firmly in
favour o f holding the club responsible for crowd safety. At paragraph 4.13 he said “ Because, as a matter of
practicc, policc officers have regularly attended in large numbers at football grounds, it has somehow been
assumed by the clubs that the responsibility for control o f what goes on inside the ground has passed from
them to the police. A police presence is there to assist in the enforcement of law and order. Those responsible
for organising a private function, however, have the primary and rontiniiiiif' obligation and responsibility to
ensure reasonable safety for those who are invited on to their premises.” M r Justice Popplewell ended that
section as follows: “It cannot be too strongly emphasised that it is upon the club, or the occupier ofthe ground
who is putting on the function, that the primary and continuing obligation rests.”

   165. There remains, however, the question whether there arc some grounds or parts of grounds where the
club may need to rely upon the policc (whom they pay to attend) to control filling of pens and monitoring them
for overcrowding. In other words, whilst the duty in law to ensure safety rests upon the club, they may need,
and by agreement be entitled, to employ the policc to act as their agents in certain circumstances. This very
difficult and grey area as to club and policc responsibility will need to be reviewed in greater depth at stage two
of this Inquiry.

Arrangements at Hillsborough
  166. What is clear, however, is that d e f a c t o the police at Hillsborough had accepted responsibility for
control ofthe pens at the Lcppings Lane end. The evidence o f the senior officers who had been concerned with
policing at Hillsborough over the years was all one way on this point. Only M r Duckcnficld, who had not
policed at Hillsborough for some 10 years prior to 15 April, took a different view.

   167. M r Lock is now security officer at Sheffield Wednesday and was formerly a policc Superintendent at
Hillsborough matches occupying M r Murray's role. He claimed there had been a formal although unwritten
agreement between the Club and the policc in about 1982, whereby the policc agreed to steward the Lcppings
Lane end of the ground. Such a formal agreement is denied by other senior officers and 1 do not accept that a ny
formal agreement was reached. Nevertheless, a practice or arrangement did develop which was known and
accepted by both Club and police. Its effect was that throughout the ground the stewards were responsible for
manning exits and entrances, for controlling entry into the stands, for assisting spectators to their scats in the
stands and for helping to control the exits after the match. They were also responsible at the Kop end on the
terraces for keeping gangways clear and helping to control the crowd which usually consisted of home
supporters. At the Leppings Lane end, however, there were no gangways on the terraces and the crowd
consisted usually (and always since 1987) o f away supporters. M r Mole and other senior officers accepted that
it would have been unreal and unreasonable to expect stewards to go onto those Leppings Lane terraces. They
would not have been effective there; moreover, they could well have been in some danger from hostile away
supporters. The police accepted, therefore, that the proper filling o f the pens and monitoring them for
overcrowding could and would not be carried out by stewards. Many stewards have tended to be cither
extremely young or somewhat elderly. They arc paid only a modest sum (£9 at Hillsborough) and they are not
 suitable either by physique or by training to cope on a crowded terrace with no gangways.

Case for the South Yorkshire Police
   168. Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence from senior policc as already mentioned and from the
 Club, Counsel for the South Yorkshire Police continued throughout the hearing to contend that the Club and
 not the policc were responsible for filling and monitoring the pens and that this was well known to both parties.
 He maintained that the policc were there essentially to secure and preserve law and order. Quite apart from the
 police evidence to the contrary at this Inquiry, the official stance of the South Yorkshire Policc has not always
 been to that effect.

 Harris-v-Sheffield United Football Club Limited
       169. In March 1986, the South Yorkshire Policc Authority obtained a judgement against Sheffield United
 Football Club for money due for policc services provided at Sheffield United's matches’. The defence had been,
 i n t e r a l i a , that the policc were not providing "special policc services”. They were doing no more than

 performing their normal police duties of securing and preserving law and order amongst a crowd. The police
 argument was that they had additional duties. In his judgement, Boreham J summarised the instructions for
 policingas providing for:-

  “(a) the maintenance o f enforcement of law and order;

   (b) the enforcement o f the Club’s ground regulations, many of which arc concerned with law and order;

   (c) the safety and comfort of the spectators, officials and players.”

      1le referred to the argument o f ( omiscl for the South Yorkshire Police ;is lbllows:-

        “Thirdly, here the police were not discharging their own duty to the public: they were in fact discharging the
        Club's duties to the spectators whom the ( i u b invited to the ground. The Club chose to invite large numbers
        to their private premises; it was the Club’s duty to provide for their safety, health and comfort. They could
        have employed a security firm as banks and others have to do to protect their interests; they chose to request
        the policc to perform those duties knowing that the police expected payment. Fourthly, the police within the
        ground provided services which it was not within the scope o f their public duty to perform. For instance,
        they assisted in crowd management and in the enforcement of such ground regulations as refused entry to
        those who tried to enter without paying or prohibited spectators encroaching on parts ofthe ground which
        their entry lee did not entitle them to enter. It may be. submits M r Bentley, that the maintenance o f law and
        order was the predominant aim but there were other services performed.”

      The learned Judge fcuind:-

        “ ln addition to what may be called their law and order role the police were expected and did take part in
        crowd management, ensuring the safety o f spectators, the enforcement ofthe ( 'lub's regulations and to be on
        hand to assist in the event of some emergencies such as fire or accidental injury.”

      Policc Practice at (lie Leppifius Lane I'.nd
         170. At League matches at Hillsborough, the police practice was to decide in advance how many and which
      pens would be used. I f a modest crowd was anticipated only one or two pens might be needed. It was better to
      confine the fans to limited spaces (a) to prevent them running about and (bj to reduce the number o f police
      required. The practice was then to fill the pens one by one. This involved makinga judgement as to when a pen
      was full. There would then be a police decision to close that pen and fill another. It was regarded as impractical
      and unsafe for police officers (just like stewards) to go onto the Leppings Lane terraces with away supporters.
      This meant that monitoring the numbers in any pen had to be done from vantage points outside it. Here, the
      police were much better placcd than the stewards. There was a good view from the control box and the
      television screens there. There were officers on the perimeter track. N o stewards were placed there bccause
      having both policc and stewards interfered with the viewing. There were also police in the west stand who
      could look down on the pens. Intelligence from all these sources could give the policc a good appreciation of
      the state ofthe terraces. When it was necessary to shut o ff acccss to the pens officcrson the concourse could be
      informed by radio and could take the necessary steps.

      “ Find Their Own Level”
          171. At Cup semi-finals, a different approach was adopted. All the pens were opened from the start and the
      policy was “to let the fans find their own level". This phrase was repeated again and again by police officers at
      the Inquiry. What it meant was that no specific direction was given to fans.entering through the turnstiles.
      They were free to go wherever they wished on the terraces. I f they became uncomfortable or wished for any
      other reason to move their position, then theoretically they could move elsewhere. In this way it was hoped that
      the fans on the terraces would level themselves out and that distribution would be achieved without police
      intervention. On these occasions, the gates at the top ofthe radial fences were locked in the open position. It
      was sought to argue, therefore, that there was freedom of movement from one pen to another enabling fans to
      “ find their level”.

          172. This argument was bad both in theory and in practice. In theory, the whole object o f the radial fences
       had been to achieve even distribution by directing fans into desired positions. To say then that they could move
       freely from one pen to another would defeat the object and enable fans to go from a less popular to a more
       popular area without inhibition. In practice this did not happen because the position and size of the gates was
       such that once a substantial number of spectators were in. the gates were unnoticcable and inaccessible
       especially to those towards the front who might have most need of them.

         173. The same argument was deployed to suggest that individual maximum capacities for individual pens
       need not be assessed since the presence ofth e open radial gates still meant that the terrace was one area. In
       practice this simply was not so. The photograph at Appendix 5 taken from the north stand at 2.59 pm shows
       very clearly the congestion in pens 3 and 4 contrasted with the sparseness in pen 6. This gives the lie to the
       suggestion that the fans could, if uncomfortable, "find their own level” .

         174. The effect of this policy was that whereas at l.eaguc matches the policc had to make a positive decision
       when to close one pen and open another, at semi-finals, where overcrowding was much more likely, the police


                                                                3 0
                lel't it to the fans themselves to “ find their own level". ElVcctively, they were left to monitor their own comfort
                and safety so as to avoid overcrowding. The policc would only intervene when there was some overt sign that an
ng the          area was “ full”.

in the          uncomfortable and not infrequently downright dangerous. They are subjected to buffeting and squeezing to

try to          They put up with these conditions because they are devoted lo the game and because there is little they can do
.vliicli        about them. They believe the discomfort will pass and nothing very untoward will happen. Usually that is the
vvand           case and they are reassured by it. Most clubs have not. until very recently, consulted their supporters as to their
                grievances or suggestions. The practice has been to pack them in 0 1 1 the assumption that if they are prepared to
                put up with it the conditions must be tolerable. Although crowd figures at football grounds have been reduced
                in recent years, this lias been due principally to the increased proportion o f seating as against standing
                accommodation. Terraces have still been packed.

                discomfort, weathering sways and surges together and chanting the same songs and slogans <•// m a s s e d o evoke
                good humour and have produced a spirit or cull of the terraces which many enjoy. 1-'quail v there arc many wlio

a pen               177. The Green Guide sought to improve safety and comfort by laying down criteria for maximum
ctieal          capacity, i c defining what is “ full". The standard set was 54 persons per 10 square metres in favourable
rters.          conditions but fewer, down to 27, in less favourable conditions. The tendency may have been to aim off too
e. the          little from the higher figure for shortcomings in the layout. Certainly the figures considered appropriate in
d the           pens 3 and 4 at Hillsborough were too high, as already indicated.
:ause
                    178. Even taking the highest figure suggested in the Green Guide, the problem remained that those
  who
                 supposed to be monitoring pens visually had and have little idea of what 54 persons per 10 square metres look
on o f
           5     like. M r Duckenfield's opinion was that when a pen was full lo capacity, the spectators would be "shoulder to
ild be
           '     shoulder and chest to back”. That view may derive from seeing the sort of density crowds regularly endure
            ■    without injury resulting. But it is much more dense than the Green Guide maximum.

                    179. The South Yorkshire Fire Brigade provided the Inquiry with photographs of people standing in an area
 d the           of 10 square metres at various densities o f packing. Together with my Assessors and others, I took part in a
 :rsat            similar experiment at the Health and Safety Executive’s Sheffield laboratory. We stood in a room o f measured
 tiles,    ,     area at densities o f 54. 80 and 100 per 10 square metres. It was clear from the photographs and from our
 r any     \     experiment that the maximum density set out in the Green Guide left considerably more room than those

                  make room for more. The evidence before the Inquiry and many anecdotal letters I have received clearly show
                  there have been frequent occasions when the packing on terraces, not only at Hillsborough, has caused

 a. In     {     Fear of Hooliganism
 10W S     I        182. Over the last few years, hooliganism at and associated with football matehcs has strongly influenced
 >the      |     the strategy of the policc. In their plans and management they have concentrated on averting or containing
           I     threats to public order. This is understandable and indeed commendable. But it has led to an imbalance
           ?     between the need to quell a minority of troublemakers and the need lo secure the safely and comfort of the
  sion     *     majority. In the police Operational Order, the emphasis was upon prevention o f disorder and in particular
  >licc    »     prevention of acccss to the field of play. There was no express requirement that officers on the perimeter truck
or in the west stand should keep watch for any possible overcrowding on the terraces. Indeed, the view was
expressed in evidence that packing fans close together on the terraces assisted in controlling the unruly since
the less room they had the less scope there was for misbehaviour.

Summary
   183. Although the police had accepted d c f a c t o responsibility for monitoring the pens, their policy on the
day was to leave fans to “ find their own level” and to concentrate their own attention on possible disorder.
Whilst in theory the police would intervene if a pen became “ full”, in practice they permitted the test of
fullness to be what the fans would tolerate.

  184. By 2.52 pm when gate C was opened, pens 3 and 4 were over-full even by this test. Many were
uncomfortable. To allow any more into those pens was likely to cause injuries; to allow in a large stream was
courting disaster.

              185.     The decision lo open gate C. and subsequently gales A and 15 loo. was lb reed on lo the police by the
i the       crowd conditions whieli developed outside the turnstiles. The crush was so severe that injuries were being
•dcr.       suffered and deaths were feared unless the pressure coulil be swiftly relieved. Why the erowd pressure had built
a of        losuch intensity was one ol'lhe principal issues during the hearing. The suggested causes must lie considered in
            turn.

v'crc       The Physical Layout
was            186. 1 have already described and illustrated the approach to the turnstiles (Appendices 1 and 2). At
            Pcnistonc Road and at many other grounds, turnstiles are in a straight line, adequately spaced and with a
            sufficient waiting area for queues to form. Not so at Lcppings Lane. The building line, the bridge over the Don
            and the bend in the road, left a wedge-shaped approach to perimeter gates set in an arc, and across a short
            forecourt, to turnstiles also set in an arc. The pairs o f turnstiles were close together and the forecourt, especially
            as divided by the metal fcncc, provided little space lbra waiting crowd.

            The Number of Turnstiles
               187. The decision to till the whole ofthe north stand from the Leppings Lane end required the 23 turnstiles
            there to admit 24,256 spectators. O f those, the seven turnstiles (A to G) serving the terraces had lo admit
             10,100, i e an average of just under 1.450 through each turnstile. At the Pcnistonc Road end. 29,800 were
            served by 60 turnstiles, or just under 500 per turnstile.

               188. The Green Guide recognises (paragraph 47) that the rale at which spectators can pass through
            turnstiles depends on a variety o f local circumstances but states "in general based on observation and
            cxpcricncc, it is unlikely that the maximum notional rate per turnstile would cxcced 750 per hour” . Sinec the
            semi-final was an all ticket match requiring no cash transactions, the Club considered that a higher rate of
            about 1,000 per hour per turnstile could be expected. Even at this higher rate, which assumes the turnstiles
            working at maximum efficiency non-stop, it would have taken nearly l ’/> hours to admit all those with terrace
            tickets. At 750 per hour, it would have taken nearly two hours.

               189. The Green Guide provides (paragraph 44):-

              "Turnstilcs should be o f such numbers as to admit spectators at a rale whereby no unduly large crowds are
              kept waiting for admission ,.

                190. The Officer Working Party had discussed in 1985 t lie need, and l>r Last wood's various schcmcs. for
             improvement o f the turnstile arrangements. The mathematics arc elementary. Both the police and the Club
             should have realised that the Lcppings Lane turnstiles and the waiting area outside them would be under stmin
             to achnit all the Liverpool supporters in time. Succcss depended on the spectators arriving at a steady rate from
             an early hour and upon the maximum turnstile rate being maintained. In fact neither of these requirements,
             which arc inter-linked, was fulfilled. That they might not be so was in my view foreseeable.

             The “Late” arrival of Liverpool Fans
                191. Between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm the crowd waiting for the turnstiles swelled to over 5,000 and became
             unmanageable. The case made for the police was that large numbers of Liverpool supporters arrived late: a
             high proportion of them were drunk and unco-opcrativc; a high proportion had no tickcts; all of them were
             hell-bent on getting in on time. They say this was unforeseeable and explains why they lost control.

                192. Whether those who arrived between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm were "late” was much debated. The ticket
             simply requested its holder “ to take up [his] position 15 minutes before kick-oft". That may have been
             intended to persuade those with stand tickcts to take their scats, but it would not be unreasonable for a
             standing spectator to arrive at the turnstiles between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm. Whether they were “late” or not,
             however, there was certainly a large concentration o f Liverpool fans arriving at about 2.30 pm and after.

             Traffic Delays
               193. It is unlikely that traffic conditions had any significant effect on this. True, there were delays on the
             Liverpool traffic routes. There were roadworks on the M 62 which was the recommended route. At various

They claim, therefore, that they had no reason to foresee it in 1989. However, in 1988. although the weather               con
was fine, it was 11 ° F cooler than in 1989. 15 April was the sort o f fine spring day which tempted fans to sit or         cvic
stand about in the sun with a drink. I f you had a ticket it would seem more pleasant and sensible to relax in that
way than to enter the ground early and stand on the tcrracc for an extra hour. Pre-match entertainment in the                 2

Was Drunkenness a M ajo r Factor in the Crisis at the Turnstiles?                                                           pm
    196. O f those who arrived at 2.30 pm or after, very many had been drinking at public houses or had
brought drink from home or an off-licence. 1 am satisfied on the evidence, however, that the great majority
                                                                                                                             by

and C h ief Inspector Creascr as well as a number o f responsible civilian witnesses, were in my view right in

anxious to gain entry. There was no criticism of the crowd by any o f the witnesses in the period up to 2.30 pm
                                                                                                                              wi
or even 2.35 pm. What happened then was not a sudden deterioration in the mood or sobriety o f those
                                                                                                                               sv
assembled there. No doubt those coming behind would have had more to drink and would have included the
unruly minority. But the crisis developed because this very large crowd became packed into a confined
                                                                                                                                  1
turnstile area and its very density hampered its passage through the turnstiles.

     197. Superintendent Marshall and other officers criticised the crowd as unco-operative because police                        L
 exhortations to stop pushing and to case back were not heeded. 1low could they be? In that crush most people                     t(
 had no control over their movements at all. Two incidents involving police horses illustrate the point. One                      e
 horse was found afterwards to have cigarette hums on its rump. Clearly that was the despicable work o f a                        tl
 hooligan whether in drink or not. However, there were also eyewitness accounts of a horse being physically
 lifted o ff its feet by the crowd. That occurred, as the police accepted, without malice or intent but as an
 involuntary consequence o f crowd pressure which those by the horse’s flanks could not resist any more than the
 horse itself.

 Reduced Efficiency of the Turnstiles
    198. The labelling o f the turnstiles in the order A. C. 13 was confusing. A fan with a B ticket who went by
 mistake to the wrong side o f the metal fence would.have had the greatest difficulty in getting hack and round to
 the correct side. The colour coding was inefficient because the coloured wooden panels were affixed to the
 turnstile walls so low that they were not easily visible through a crowd. The information on the ticket printed by
 Sheffield Wednesday Football Club was misleading and its layout unhelpful, as M r Mackrell frankly conceded.

    199. The result was that in the early stages, police officers were pestered by fans lbv help as to where they
 should go. Later, as the crowd became more dense, fans were presenting their tickets at the wrung turnstiles.
 There were also Liverpool supporters who had acquired tickets for the Kop end but sought entry at Lcppings
 Lane. They caused delays in the turnstile operation when entry was refused and alter a while the police
 instructed the operators to let them through. There was further delay because the crush made it difficult for
 fans to get into the turnstile entrances. Once there, the pressure from behind was such as. on occasions, to jam
 them in the doorway or against the paddle o f the turnstile. Finally, there were fans without tickets who sought
 to enter by offering payment, by seeking to go over or under the paddle or by sliding through with a ticket
 holder. All of these activities slowed down the turnstile rate which at the worst period was only about 600 per
 hour per turnstile. The waiting crowd therefore expanded and as the minutes passed frustration grew. Visitors
                   f




 heavy                 who had paid lor tiekets and travelled from afar realised they were making little forward progress. Frustration
 lesscs                increased pressure and induced panic at the front. Determination to get into the match was intensified by
                       determination to get out o f the crush.

                       Were Fans Without Tickets a M ajo r Factor in (lie Build-Up?
 four-                   200. It has become a fact o f football lilc that fans do turn up at all-ticket matches without tickets. It is not
 mid a                 possible to give an accurate figure or even a reliable estimate of the number without tickets on 15 April. Policc
                       estimates varied from about 200 to about 2.000. There were certainly frequent requests for tickets or “spares”
                       during the hours before the build-up. Many of those warned o ff by the policc were seen to return to the area.

 athcr                 consider the number o f tickctlcss fans to be inordinately large. This accords with two other sources of
 sit or                evidence.

 nt to                 a late stage well below capacity save for pens 3 and 4. The north stand still had many empty seats and the wing
                       pens were sparse. The match being a sell-out. there were clearly many ticket holders to come and they could
                       account for the large crowd still outside the turnstiles. Had the Liverpool accommodation been full by 2.40

                        The “Conspiracy” Theory
                          203. On behalf o f South Yorkshire police, the theory was advanced that the “late" arrival o f so many
licc                    Liverpool supporters was planned to buck the system. The suggestion was that fans without tickets conspired
 pie           ;        to arrive late and create such trouble as would force the policc to admit them to the match. The slender
 hie           j        evidence upon which this theory rested came from two sources: overheard conversations in public houses and

 an        :■             204. One witness said lie heard three Liverpool supporters saying, in effect, that they would manage to get
[lie                    in without tickets by causing trouble so that policc would open a gate, and that they had done this before.
           1            Another witness heard two of.a group o f Liverpool supporters say they had no tickets, that they would go to the
           si           ground just before k ic k -o ff that no-one would stop them getting in and that they had not been stopped yet.
                        Statements were put in relating to two other small groups talking in similar terms.

                         Liverpool Supporters at Away Matches
                           205. The South Yorkshire policc prepared a dossier o f reports on the behaviour ol Liverpool fans at away
                         matches with the object o f showing a pattern o f troublesome behaviour by large numbers cither without tickets
                         or with forged tickets. Without setting out the whole history, it can be summarised as follows.

                            206. On three occasions Liverpool fans w ithout tickets were allowed into all-ticket matchcs upon payment.
                         (At Watford on 13 February 1988, 1,500 were admitted: at Southampton on 24 September 1988, 150 were
                         admitted; at Southampton again on 12 December 1988. 750 were admitted.) At Norwich on 1 April 1 989,
                         Liverpool supporters arrived without tickcts but 1.272 tickets had been returned and fans from both Liverpool
                         and Norwich were allowed to buy them for cash. A similar situation occurred at Wimbledon on 13 May 1989.
                         There were six other occasions from 1986 to date, including the Cup 1inals o f 1986 and 1989, when numbers of
                          Liverpool supporters turned up without tickcts or otherwise behaved badly.

                            207. Four points must be noted, howev er. ( )n none ol the occasions when tickctless Ians were admitted lor
                          payment was the match a sell-out. There was therefore room in the ground on each occasion. At a sell-ou t Ians

might not expcci to be allowed in, even lor payment. Secondly, no trouble of the kind alleged was encountered
at the 1988 semi-final when Liverpool visited Hillsborough, Thirdly, Liverpool visited Hillsborough again in
January 1989 without any trouble. Finally, no forged tickcts were in use on 15 April apart from three crude
photocopies.

No Conspiracy
   208. 1 have already found that there was not an abnormally large number o f fans without tickets on this
occasion. With one or two exceptions, the police witnesses themselves did not subscribe to the “conspiracy"
theory. I am satisfied that the large concentration at Lcppings Lane from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm did not arrive
as a result o f any concerted plan. There were. 1 accept, small groups without tickets who were willing to exploit
any adventitious chance o f getting into the ground. They, together with the minority who had drunk too much,
certainly aggravated the problem faced by the policc. But that main problem was simply one of large numbers
packed into the small area outside the turnstiles.

The Police Operation at Leppings Lane
  209. The Operational Order for 15 April followed closely that laid down for the 1988 semi-final. The
emphasis was on maintaining law and order. Side roads were to be blocked off to prevent damage in residential
areas. Pairs o f officers were to patrol streets to prevent “clash of rival supporters". Officers were to watch public
houses, shopsand supermarkets "where looting could take place". Chiisidc the turnstiles, officers were toensure
supporters entering did not have banners, weapons, missiles or alcohol.

  210. Unfortunately, hooligan behaviour has made all these steps necessary. Hut the only written provision
aimed at effecting controlled entry to the turnstiles was one enjoining officers "to ensure orderly queues arc
formed''. There was no provision for controlling the entry o f the crowd into the turnstile area.

  211. As long ago as 1924, the Departmental Committee on Crowds statcd:-

  "Tlie control o f crowds should begin at a point some considerable distance from the entrance to the ground.
  The advantages of an arrangement of this kind are ... in preventing congestion at the entrances to grounds."

This was particularly important at Lcppings Lane where the turnstile area was so small and awkwardly laid
out. lfa large crowd was permitted uncontrolled entry through the perimeter gates, the forming ofqucucsat the
turnstiles and control by officers, whether on foot or mounted, would become impracticable. Those waiting at
the turnstiles would become a single growing mass. Once that happened, it would be difficult to retrieve the
situation.

  212. Whether steps were taken and what steps to avoid this happening was left to oral briefing and           m l hoc

instructions on the day.

Previous Experience
  213. The senior police officers said it had never happened before so there was no reason to foresee it. In fact,
the only two previous occasions when the Lcppings Lane terraces had been used to fill the whole of the north
and west sides o f the ground were at the two semi-finals, in 1987 and 1988. In 1987. the match was on a Sunday,
scheduled for 12 noon, and kick-off was postponed for a quarter of an hour because of late arrivals.

Policing in 1988
  214. As to 1988, there was a very large and consistent body of evidence that, on the clay, the police in
Lcppings Lane conducted an efficient filtering exercise designed to keep away those without tickets and
control the flow o f fans towards the ground. 1 do not believe that so many witnesses without either opportunity
or reason to put their heads togethcrcould be mistaken about what they experienced on that occasion. Yet. the
policc maintain that no filtering exercise other than on a random basis was conducted in 1988 and that their
policy and practice then were no different from those of 1989.

  215. The answer to this conflict must. 1 think, be that whilst the policy may have been no diflercnt. in
practice the policing in 1988 was more efficient and was not put to the same test and strain as a year later. There
was not so large a swell in numbers approaching the ground from 2.30 pm to 2.50 pm as in 1989.
Nevertheless, there had been warning signs in 1988. Detective Superintendent M cKay gave the following
evidence:
      tcred           “Q Were you aware o f a build-up o f numbers last year towards the latter stages at the turnstiles?
     iin in
     •ri ill e        A     Yes. . . There was a huge build-up around 10 minutes to 3 when many, many Liverpool supporters
                            came at that time. They had been drinking, the ones that I saw anil there was quite a si/eablc crush

 i th is

 rrivc                       reached back almost to the gates. It never got any bigger than that and the turnstiles operated relatively
 ploit                       freely and they dealt with that crowd. Fans were still arriving at about 10 past 3 but by then th e . . .

                       216. Apart from that experience in 1988, the tendency o f Liverpool supporters to arrive late was not
                     unknown. Witnesses said that they get through the turnstiles at their home ground, Anfield, quite quickly and
lid
                     tend therefore not to arrive early. Indeed, a general recent tendency to postpone arrival was noted by the
lie
                     Sheffield City Council Advisory Group, with police present, on 23 March 1988. The minute reads:-
 at
lie
                       “As far as the turnstile question was concerned, a pattern has developed o f people arriving some 15 minutes
                       before the start of the game hoping to gain admission. This trend may be due to the banning o f alcohol at
                       sports grounds which could lend to people going elsewhere lor refreshment prior to the football match. As
ic
                       the available turnstiles operated quite effectively lor the majority o f the time, anil that the late arrival
                       problem could perhaps only be dealt with by education o f the spectators" ( s i c ) .

                       217. In so far as Liverpool supporters’ behaviour at away matches may have been indicative o f what police
t,                   problems might arise on 15 April, most of the facts should have been available at the planning stage. As in other
h                    forces. South Yorkshire Policc had a liaison officer whose job was to seek, receive and collate relevant
                     information as to the visiting supporters. The Association of Chief Policc Officers’ Guide to Policing Football
                     highlights the importance o f such liaison:-

                       “ It is important that the officcr responsible for policing the match determines the pre-match planning in the
                       light o f the intelligence at hand. Whilst that intelligence can be obtained from a variety of sources, the prime
                       source for football intelligence is the Policc National Intelligence System which is based on the network of
                       police liaison officers. Summaries completed by police officers o f the home club force are forwarded to the
                       visiting club’s liaison officcr making available intelligence about fans’ behaviour at both home and away
                       fixtures. This information will be collated and made available for future matches involving that club”.

                       218. The FA had also laid down in a memorandum issued in the 1985/6 season measures to be adopted by
                     the away club which included the following:-

                          ‘Tt is the responsibility of the away club to advise the home club o f the recent behaviour o f their supporters
                          at away matches, irrespective of whether the behaviour has resulted in disciplinary action by the Football
                          Association or not” .

                          219. It does not seem that information o f this kind was passed to the Sheffield Wednesday Club or played


                                                                               37
any part in the South Yorkshire Policc plans. Had the latter been informed of the history contained in the;
dossier and summarised above it may well have influenced policc strategy in Lcppings Lane.                :•

  220. There is presently a proposal that a national computer-based police loot ball intelligence system should;-
be set up to make the necessary information readily available.                                                 ■

Police Intelligence on the Day                                                                       |
  221. The unfilled spacc in the Liverpool areas inside the ground, the figures for entry available fromthel
Club’s computer and observations on the video scrcen should have enabled those in the control room tor
monitor the numbers arriving and still to arrive at Lcppings Lane. Radio contact with mobile (Tango) patrolst •
detailed to monitor licensed premises in the district could have indicated the numbers still to come. But at 2.30 p'
pm when M r Murray told M r Duckcnficld they would “get them all in by 3 o’clock” he seems not to have £
appreciated that in addition to those visible at the turnstiles there were many more still to conic. Certainly,Mi "
Marshall outside the turnstiles was not told and could not otherwise have known that there were still many
Liverpool ticket holders to arrive.                                                                      1:

M r Marshall and M r Greenwood
   222. The division o f command between these two officers did not help. M r Marshall was in chargc of the |
serials outside the perimeter gates in the Leppings Lane area and in the roads beyond. In practice lie operated |
inside and just outside the turnstile area. M r Greenwood’s area as Ground Commander extended from the f ’
pitch to the peri meter gates. He in fact stationed himself near the players’ tunnel. 1le was wholly unaware ofthe t
growing problems at the turnstiles and was in no position to exercise control over his officers who were under 1
pressure there. No-one in the control room thought to tell him.                                                    5

Control Lost
  223. In the result, the large concentration of arrivals from 2.30 pm to 2.40 pm pressed unrestrained into          j
the turnstile area through the perimeter gates which were fully open. When that area was full, later arrivals
swelled the crowd out to the forccourt and even into the road. As already recounted, the foot officers at the
turnstiles bccamc trapped and endangered and retired through the turnstiles. The mounted officers could noi          ;
operate amidst such a dense crowd in a confincd spacc. They camc out of the turnstile area. There were then          -
the belated attempts to close the perimeter gates and prevent more fans joining the mass until it had a chanceto
diminish through the turnstiles; still later the attempt to put a cordon o f horses across the cntrancc.             [

  224. Despite knowledge o f the difficult layout, the very large number o f fans to be got through so few [
turnstiles and the tendency o f fans to arrive in the last half hour, no contingency plans were made to avoida
crush such as occurrcd. Even on the day, the need to elose Leppings Lane to traffic before 2.30 pm and the
other available intelligence already summarised, should have prompted those in command to take precautions
against such a crush. I f sonic o f the perimeter gates had been closed and cordons of mounted and foot officers
had been placcd a little distance from those gates, the flow o f fans into the turnstile area could have been
controlled before that area became engulfed. It was the crush itself which produced the frustration and the
panic and brought out the worst in those who had drunk too much. Earlier control o f entry would have
prevented the crush and maintained the good mood which had prevailed until 2.30 pm.

   225. It should moreover have been obvious by 2.40 pm, if not earlier, that a large part o f the crowd could
 not be admitted until well after 3 pm. Had a decision to postpone kick-off been made and announced much of
 the frustration and with it the impetus crushing the crowd would have been reduced. A combination of
 controlled filtering and a postponed kick-off would probably have obviated the need to open the gates.

 Postponement of Kick-off
    226. At various stages in his evidence, M r Duckcnfiefd gave three accounts o f why lie thought it too late to
 postpone kick-off. Once it was that one of the teams had already conic onto the pitch. Then it was that a group
 o f photographers at the tunnel had wrongly led him to think that the teams were coming out. Finally, liedid not
 know why lie thought the teams were coming out. They did not in fact come onto the pitch until 2.54 pm. two
 minutes after gate C was opened. Policc Constable Buxton had asked for a postponement o f kick-off before
 gate C was opened. It should not. however, have needed a police Constable in the thick o f the crowd (and there
 wore others o f like mind) to think o f postponing the kick-off. The need should have been clear in the control
 room.

    227. The truth was that M r Duckenfield applied inflexibly the policy he had discussed with M r Murray.
 K ick-off would not be postponed unless there were some major cause for delayed arrivals e g a jam on the
                f
ined in the          motorway or log. 1 accept that the thinking behind this policy was not callous or punitive. 11' kick-off i.s
                     postponed whenever a proportion of fans choose to leave the public houses late, the practice may grow and
                     kick-off times would become meaningless. Hut. a commander iimst deal with the problem o f the day. faced
:cm should           with a situation which was becoming dangerous, crowd safety should have been his paramount consideration.
                      Kick-off should have been delayed.

                     Summary
  from the               228. The layout ofthe turnstilesand the number they were required to serve left no margin ofsafety against
>! room to           an uneven flow o f fans. Because police strategy in advance and on the day did not cater for it, the arrival of a
?o) patrols           large number o f supporters between 2.30 pm and 2.40 pm created an unmanageable crush. The presence o f
*ut at 2.30           a substantial minority o f fans who had drunk too much aggravated that problem. Having lost control and
ot to have       ;     rejected the option o f postponing kick-off, the policc were faced with a serious danger o f deaths or injuries,
tainly. M r    !;     They were left therefore with no alternative but to open the gates. Superintendent Marshall was right at that
still many     j      stage to ask for it and M r Duckcnficld was right to agree. But the possible effects o f so dramatic a step required
               ;      other action.

deal with the consequences. When gate C was opened, a steady stream o f about 2,000 fans poured through it                       2
over some five minutes. Clearly they were going to go into the ground somewhere anil unless they were diverted             :   mci
their likeliest route was through the tunnel for reasons already given. No warning was issued from the control             :   stru
room that the gate was to be opened. Serials on the concourse were not alerted. Neither the Club control room              :   the 1
nor the Chief Steward at the Lcppings Lane end was warned. Not even M r Greenwood, the Ground                              ;   coll.
Commander, was informed. From 2.47 pm when M r Marshall made his first request until 2,52 pin when Mr                          thro
Duckcnfield acceded to it, there were five minutes in which orders could have been given as to how the influx
was to be absorbed. It was not done. In evidence, M r Duckenfield began by saying that no officer made any                 !

wrong decision but lie later conceded he had erred in this regard. He said he did not consider where the people            ■   arm
would go when the gate opened. Even after it opened, when lie could see the influx on the television screen, no
order was given to steer the fans to the wing pens, M r Duckenfield said it did not cross his mind to detail           I

officers on the concourse to shut off the tunnel. Those officers could not have known from their position how          {         se
 full pens 3 and 4 were. That was a matter for the control room to monitor from its own observations and using         I         a‘

  230. Since pens 3 and 4 were full by 2,50 pm, the tunnel should have been closed off whether gate C was to \                 the i
be opened or not. The exercise was a simple one and had been carried out in 1988. All that was necessary was j;                was
for a few officers to act as a cordon at the entrance to the tunnel and divert fans elsewhere. Unfortunately, the j            tragi
1988 closure seems to have been unknown to the senior officers on duty at the time. It did not figure in the ('                thin
debriefing notes. It therefore had no influence on the planning for 1989.                                         j:           rein,

he Ground       collapsed was unbroken by any intervening barrier. 124a was also vulnerable to pressure straight down the pen

                tragedy might have occurred in the tunnel or migln have broken barrier 144 itself. This is speculative and I
're in the
                think unlikely. What remained o f barrier 144 in pen 4 did not cause a build-up; nor did it collapse. Hut its
                remaining in position may well have accounted for no barrier further dow n pen 4 collapsing and for the lesser

 disaster
                  236. Counsel for the South Yorkshire Policc sought to argue that this barrier collapsed or may have
                collapsed at about 2.47 pm. His purpose was to suggest that the openingof gate C was not causally linked with
} to that       the crushing and fatalities resulting from that collapse. I have already found that whilst the evidence does not
t if fans       permit the time of collapse to be fixed with certainty, it was after 2.52 pm. I now give my reasons:
s at the
lvasion           (a) I have several times watched the BBC video tape on which Counsel relied. I do not find the incident he
nto the               identifies at 2.47 pm suggestive o f a collapse at that time;
simply
                  (b) the evidence o f fans who were near or at the barrier was overwhelmingly to the effect that the collapse
                      occurred at or after 3 pm;

                  (c) the biggest group o f witnesses was that which related the collapse to the surge following Beardsley's
                      “ near-miss" at the Kopcnd at 3.04 pnr.

                  (cl) the appearance on video and photographs of fans in the area of harrier 124a after the incident at 2.47 pm
                       and before the final crush is not consistent with it having collapsed so early;

                  (e) it is highly unlikely that if so catastrophic an event had occurred as early as 2.47 pm. the policc on the
                      track and elsewhere would have taken until nearly 3 o'clock to realise something was seriously wrong.
                      Indeed, ifCounscl for the South Yorkshire Police were correct in his timingofthc collapse, the failure of
                      the policc to respond for so long would expose them to even graver.criticism than that made in this
                      Report.

                Dr Eastwood's Testing of the Barriers
                  237. Two sections of barrier 124a in pen 3 collapsed as a result of the overcrowding. That collapse caused a
                number o f deaths. D r Eastwood and his stalT had undertaken the periodical testing of crush barriers required
                by the Green Guide and by the Safety Certificate. Barrier 124a had been tested in July 1988 and passed.

                  238. The test had been carried out in accordance with Dr Eastwood's interpretation of Annex C to the

periods, the interval between applications to be as short as possible. A record has to be kept of the amount o f
deformation during each loading and of the percentage of recovery. I f the recovery is less than 50% after the
third application o f force, the barrier has failed the test. If recovery is between 50% and 75%. there must be a
re-test. The question is: 50% or 75% of what? Is the recovery to be in relation to the position o f the barrier
before the first application o f force or before the third? I f the former, a span of 124a recorded 53% at the 1988
test and should have been re-tested. I f the latter, it recorded 100% and passed. Unfortunately the Green Guide
is unclear as to the correct interpretation. D r Eastwood took the latter view and so passed the barrier, lie
justified his interpretation in evidence. He said failure to recover to the original position could be due to a
“ shake-down” effect related to some giving in the ashes under the concrete or to some other extraneous factor
rather than to any defcct in the material o f the barrier itself.

  239. I think, after consulting Professor Maunder, that safety ought to have dictated recovery should be by
reference to the position o f the barrier before the first application of force. 1 accept, however, that the Green
Guide is ambiguous and D r Eastwood's interpretation is tenable. It has some support from the British
Standards tests on steel structures. Clearly, however, for the future, the Green Guide should be clarified on this
point.

Corrosion
  240. Inspection o f barrier 124a. and indeed other barriers at Hillsborough, by the USE showed
considerable corrosion of the metal at vulnerable points where water could accumulate. D r Eastwood agreed
that i f a significant degree o f corrosion was observed on visual inspection, a barrier should be condemned.

   241. The Green Guide does not specifically refer to corrosion. Paragraph 39 provides,        in te r a lia :



   “Crush barriers and balustrades should be examined for deformation or any other overt signs of weakness”.

Paragraph 6 o f Annex C provides:

   “ I f during any test, even though the b a rrie r... satisfies the above loading requirements, doubt should arise
   for any reason (including such matters as cracking o f the terracing or distortion of connections) as to the
   safety o f the barrier... a detailed investigation should be carried out. Unless the results o f this investigation
   remove the doubt as to safety o f the b arrier... (it) should be deemed to have failed the test”.

   242. Since corrosion is a likely cause of deterioration, a revision o f the Green Guide should make specific
 reference to it.

 Causation
   243. Tests done by the USE suggest that although barrier 124a passed the loading test in 1988 and probably
 would have been able to sustain a force which did not exceed the test load, it was unable to resist the load
 imposed upon it by reason o f the numbers in pen 3, the excessive gap in the barrier higher up the pen and the
 absence o f barrier 144. Corrosion probably played a part, but the effective cause of the collapse was the
 excessive and unanticipated pressure to which the barrier was exposed.

                     245. The 20 officers detailed to the perimeter track were distributed round the pitch so that some five
                   officers were at the west end. Their written instructions made no reference to the avoidance or detection of
                   overcrowding. The same applied to the officers in the west stand, M r Greenwood admitted that his oral

                     246. The Operational Order for 1988 had instructed officers to forbid anyone "access to the track from the

                   Operational Order by being put into capital letters. The combination of no instructions as to overcrowding and

                   response reluctant. Small wonder that the growing pressure and congestion between 2.50 pm and 2.59 pm
                   went unheeded or certainly unrcmedied. Even when officers recognised there was a problem, the rule required
                   consent of a senior officcr before a gate could be opened.

d arise
                     247. “Senior officer'' meant an officer o f Inspector rank or higher. The Inspector in charge of the 20 officers
 to the
                   on the track was M r Darling. He stationed himself by the players' tunnel, the most central position for

                   supervising his men. In evidence he said:

oecific
                     inform ground control and I would expect someone deployed to the back of the stand.”

                      That underlines the inhibition against opening perimeter gates. So did the evidence o f one Constable who
                    said it had been so drummed into officers not to open the gates that when lie saw distress in pen 4, lie “debated''
ibably              with himself before opening the gate, thinking: “ If I'm wrong. I'm going to get a right bollocking for this."

                      248. This is what happened, but not until officers recognised the distress and even then not immediately.
                    Hence, gates 3 and 4. having been opened, were shut again before they were finally opened and at first tho.se
                    seeking to climb out over the fence were pushed back. This reaction of the police did not go on for as long as
                    some witnesses believed. They probably misinterpreted the hand movements from M r Greenwood and others
                    aimed at persuading fans to move back and relieve the pressure as attempts to stop those climbing out at the
                    front.

                      249.     Nevertheless, there was a period during which the failure to recognise the problem and the inhibition
                    against tackling it caused vital time to be lost.

T h e Officers in Command
  250. Even when realisation o f the problem came to officers on the track, it was some minutes before it
reached the control room. When spectators first appeared on the track, the immediate assumption in the
control room was that a pitch invasion was threatened. This was unlikely at the beginning o f a match. It
became still less likely when those on the track made no move towards the pitch. M r Motson, the BBC
commentator, recognised and said, well before the match was stopped, that the trouble seemed to be
overcrowding and not misbehaviour. Still, the assumption to the contrary persisted in the control room. Until
M r Murray radioed for a fleet o f ambulanccs, about 3.06 pm, M r Duckenfield continued to treat the incident
as a threat to the pitch and to public order. The message calling up all available officers mentioned a pitch
invasion. Operation Support was initiated and dog handlers were requested.
   251. Until ChicfSupcrintendent Nesbit arrived, there was no effective leadership either from control or on
the pitch to harness and organise rescue efforts. No orders were given for officers to enter the tunnel and relieve
pressure. Some officers did this on their own initiative. Apart from the Tannoy request to clear the pitch, no
attempt was made to clear and mark off a casualty area where first-aid could be given without hindrance by
fansand photographers millingabout between the bodies. There was no co-ordination of the early provision of
first-aid or of stretcher parties or o f the rescue effort through gates 3 and 4. No request for help was broadcast to
doctors and nurses in the crowd until about 3.29 pm when it was too late. Probably, there was little that could
have been achieved in most cases however soon doctors had been summoned, but there were marginal cases
where earlier attention might have made a difference.
   252. The plight o f those behind the fencing and the existence o f injuries were known to officers at the scene
from 3 pm. But the M ajo r Disaster Plan was not started until 3.06 pm at earliest when the ambulance service
was called. No request for cutting gear or for the fire brigade was made until 3 . 13 p.m. Again, it is unlikely that
these services could have saved lives if they had been called promptly, but it is possible.
P o lice on the Pitch
   253. Despite the initial lack o f leadership, many officers did all they humanly could to rescue and revive the
victims. Many supporters who gave evidence paid tribute to these efforts. It is also fair to say that the number
o f officers who could at first be usefully involved at the two open gates was necessarily limited.
   254. Chief Superintendent Nesbit’s action in deploying a line o f officers across the middle o f the pitch has
already been mentioned. I can well understand the resentment it caused. However, the police assertion that a
rush by some fans towards the Kop end raised fears o f conflict arc well borne out by the video tape. In my
judgement, C hief Superintendent Nesbit was well justified in using some o f the many officers called up
pursuant to Operation Support to prevent possible violence. To have had open fighting in a ground where
some 90 spectators already lay dead would have been an unthinkable and obsccne development.
Fans on the P itch
   255. Many fans who escaped onto the pitch alive were in a state o f collapse or close to it. Most o f those who
retained their strength strove magnificently to assist the victims. They helped pull them clear; they helped with
first-aid; they helped carry the improvised stretchers.
  256. There were fans, however, who were distraught, angry, drunk, or all three. Their conduct in abusing,
assaulting and spitting at the police was disgraceful, the more so since earlier policc failures had little to do
with those officers now doing their best for the injured. In addition, there were abuse and assaults on
ambulance men and firemen in the course o f their rescue work. This was probably because their similar
uniforms caused them to be mistaken for police. However, although the abuse was widespread, the number of
assaults and spittings was on the evidence comparatively small. In deploring them, one must recognise the
uniquely horrifying experience which those responsible had just suffered and were still suffering.
F a lse Reports
   257. Before this Inquiry began, there were stories reported in the press, and said to have emanated from
police officers present at the match, o f “mass drunkenness". It was said that drunken fans urinated on the
police while they were pulling the dead and injured out, that others had even urinated on the bodies of the dead
and stolen their belongings. Not a single witness was called before the Inquiry to support any of those
allegations although every opportunity was afforded for any of the represented parties to have any witness
called whom they wished. As soon as the allegations 1 have mentioned were made in the press, M r Peter
Wright, Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, made a dignified statement dissociating himself from such grave
and emotive calumnies. Those who made them, and those who disseminated them, would have done better to
hold their peace.

          258. The perimeter gates in the pens were not designed as exits. They were intended to afford aeeess by the
 e it   police to cope with any local disorder or with an emergency. The kind of emergency contemplated was not

ntil    tunnel. I f for any reason that option became impracticable, ^ifdue to a bomb threat, then the alternative route
cnt     would be along the back o f the tcrraccs. through the gates in the radial fences and round the sides of the west
Ich     stand. The lire brigade were satisfied that each of these routes would enable the pens to be evacuated in less
        than six minutes, without relying on the gates to the pitch. Those gates would also be available, but their use
        was excluded from the calculation of evacuation time.

          259. The need to provide for speedy and large scale evacuation from the front o f the pens to the pitch was

        not anticipated. The Green Guide ( 1986) provides as follows:

It
          215. For most major stadia, whether used for association football or other sports, the pitch perimeter fencc
          will be required either to prevent access to the pitch as mentioned above, or at least to discourage attempts
          by spectators to enter the playing area. Gates or other access points (minimum width 1.1 metres) should
          nonetheless be provided for use in an emergency . . . Provision of such gates or access points is particularly
          important to allow full access to the playing area (or track) where it is likely to be used as a place o f safety in
          an emergency.        Such gates or access points should be properly stewarded and                           clearly
          marked so that immediate access to the playing area or perimeter track can be ensured".

          260. Gate 3 was .82 metres in width; gate 4 was .79 metres in width. There were therefore clear departures
        from the Green Guide standard.

           261. The Safety Certificate provided (by Schedule 2 Paragraph 24) as follows:

           The (club) shall arrange for the Stadium to be inspected by a suitably qualified Chartered Engineer. . . at
           least once each period o f 12 months . . . and . . . shall as soon as possible after each inspection supply to
           the . . . Council a Certificate by the said Chartered Engineeras to the current compliance or non-compliance
           with . . . the appropriate provisions and recommendations of the (Green) Guide o f all structural parts of the
           Stadium . . .

           262. It was argued that there was no breach of the Safety Certificate since the Green Guide specifically
         provides for flexibility. However, in my view the Safety Certificate cannot and certainly should not be
         interpreted so liberally as in effect to leave such basic requirements as the size o f exit gates to the total
         discretion of the club and its advisers. One of the matters for consideration at stage Iwo of this inquiry will be
         whether, and in what respects, the Green Guide needs to be clarified and toughened.

           263. Dr Eastwood explained the small width o f the gates by reference to the dilemma facing the policc. They
         wanted a gate sufficient for its intended purpose i c policc access and small scale emergencies. On the other
         hand, they did not want a flood gate o f such size as to endanger the prime principle of preventing pitch
         invasions. In the light of Hillsborough, this is perhaps the most poignant example o f the difficulty o f achieving
         a balance between stopping hooliganism and ensuring crowd safety.

           264. Even if the width o f gates 3 and 4 had complied with the present Green Guide standard, they would
         have been wholly inadequate to relieve pressure and release spectators swiftly on 15 April. Moreover, the
         Green Guide says nothing about the number o f gates required for a pen of given size. Whilst the Club.


                                                                  45
D r Eastwood, the Officcr Working Party and the local authority can be criticised for failing strictly to conform
to the Guide, the real failure was common to all those who have been responsible lor considering safety on the
terraces. The anxiety to protect the sanctity o f the pitch has caused insufficient attention to be paid to the risk
of a crush due to overcrowding. Certain it was. that once the crush occurred on 15 April gates 3 and 4 were
wholly inadequate for rescue purposes.

                265. The immediate cause o f the gross overcrowding and hence the disaster was the failure, when gate C was
              opened, to cut off access to the central pens which were already overfull.

                266. They were already overfull because no safe maximum capacities had been laid down, no attempt was
              made to control entry to individual pens numerically and there was no effective visual monitoring of crowd
              density.

                267. When the influx from gate C entered pen 3. the layout of the barriers there afforded less protection
              than it should and a barrier collapsed. Again, the lack of vigilant monitoring caused a sluggish reaction and
              response when the crush occurred. The small size and number of gates to the track retarded rescue efforts. So,
              in the initial stages, did lack of leadership.

         j.      268. The need to open gate C was due to dangerous congestion at the turnstiles. That occurred because, as
               both Club and policc should have realised, the turnstile area could not easily cope with the large numbers
         |    demanded o f it unless they arrived steadily over a lengthy period. The Operational Order and policc tactics on
          ,    the day failed to provide for controlling a concentrated arrival o f large numbers should that occur in a short
          j   period. That it might so occur was foreseeable and it did. The presence o f an unruly minority who had drunk
          i   toomuch aggravated the problem. So did the Club’s confused and inadequate signs and ticketing.

                                                   POLICE

Choice of Ends by the Police
   272. There was much bitterness amongst Liverpool supporters that they had to make do again for the
second year with the Leppings Lane end. But, cogent as their complaints were, they amounted to reasons for
choosing a different ground altogether. Given Hillsborough as the venue, I think the police were right to
allocate the sections of the ground as they did. The direction of arrival and the need for segregation made it
sensible and to reverse the 1988 arrangements would have made for confusion. As with choice of venue, I do
not consider choice of ends was causative o f the disaster. Had it been reversed, the disaster could well have
occurred in a similar manner but to Nottingham supporters.
Police Planning
  273. The Operational Order for 1989 left much unsaid. Apart from the lack of any provision for late or
congested arrivals, or any provision for the avoidance of overcrowding on the terraces, there was a number of
other omissions. For example, there was no specific deployment of officers to man the perimeter gates. The
Order did not detail the duties of the mounted officers deployed at the Leppings Lane entrance, who included
Liverpool officers to assist in marshalling their own fans. The duties of Superintendents (especially Mr
Greenwood and Mr Marshall) were not defined so as to achieve clarity and efficiency. By an oversight, the
provision requiring mobile (Tango) patrols to assist the emergency services was omitted from the text.
  274. The 1988 Order was never substantially reviewed save to reduce the number of officers deployed in
shopping areas and to emphasise in capital letters the embargo on fans having access to the pitch. Satisfaction
with the 1988 event led to complacency. That some thought the pens overfull in 1988 and that the tunnel was
closed off on that occasion did not figure in or influence the plan for 1989.
  275. Mr Duckenfield was promoted and put in charge of F Division only 21 days before this semi-final. The
pre-planning was already in progress under M r Mole who had been in command both in 1987 and in 1988. It
might have been wiser to have left Mr Mole in charge of this operation. On the other hand, it is quite
understandable that Mr Duckenfield should have been expected to take command of events in his Division
from the date of his promotion. In view of his lack of experience at Hillsborough and of a semi-final match,
however, it was imperative that he be fully briefed and that he should also brief himself.
   276. He was not informed of the crushing incident in 1981 nor did he make inquiries which would have
revealed it. He did not know the arrangement as between Club and police for monitoring the Leppings Lane
terraces. He did not visit and tour the ground before approving the Operational Order. Although he attended a •
match on 2 April, there was only a small crowd present and he left control of the game to the Superintendents.
Policing on the Day
  277. One of the regrettable features of the football scene as it has developed is the enormous expenditure of
money, time and effort in employing large numbers of police all over the country to guard against the sort of
disorder and misbehaviour which have become endemic. Police management of a game of football has become
a military operation. The problems faced and the responses received must be disheartening and may have
tended to harden police attitudes to supporters in general.
   278. It is fair to state that over many years the South Yorkshire Police have given excellent service to the
 public. They have handled crowd problems sensitively and successfully at a large number of football games
 including major matches, during strikes in the coal industry and the steel industry, and in other contexts.
 Unfortunately, their policing on 15 April broke down in the ways already described and, although there were
 other causes, the main reason for the disaster was the failure of police control.
    279. In all some 65 police officers gave oral evidence at the Inquiry. Sadly I must report that for the most
 part the quality of their evidence was in inverse proportion to their rank. There were many young Constables
 who as witnesses were alert, intelligent and open. On the day, they and many others strove heroically in ghastly
 circumstances aggravated by hostility to rescue and succour victims. They inspired confidence and hope.
   280. By contrast, with some notable exceptions, the senior officers in command were defensive and evas ive
 witnesses. Their feelings of grief and sorrow were obvious and genuine. No doubt those feelings were
 intensified by the knowledge that such a disaster had occurred under their management. But, neither their
 handling of problems on the day nor their account of it in evidence showed the qualities of leadership to be
 expected of their rank.

   281. Mr Duckenfield leant heavily on Mr Murray’s experience. Between them they misjudged the build-up
at the turnstiles and did little about it until they received Mr Marshall’s request to open the gate. They did not,
for example, check the turnstile figures available from Club control or check with Tango units as to the
numbers still to come. They did not alert Mr Greenwood to the situation at the fringe of his area of command.
They gave no instructions as to the management of the crowd at Leppings Lane. Inflexibly they declined to
postpone kick-off.

  282. When Mr Marshall’s request came, Mr Duckenfield’s capacity to take decisions and give orders
seemed to collapse. Having sanctioned, at last, the opening of the gates, he failed to give necessary
consequential orders or to exert any control when the disaster occurred. He misinterpreted the emergence of
fans from pens 3 and 4. When he was unsure of the problem, he sent others down to “assess the situation”
rather than descend to see for himself. He gave no information to the crowd.

  283. Most surprisingly, he gave Mr Kelly and others to think that there had been an inrush due to Liverpool
fans forcing open a gate. This was not only untruthful. It set off a widely reported allegation against the
supporters which caused grave offence and distress. It revived against football fans, and especially those from
Liverpool, accusations of hooliganism which caused reaction not only nationwide but from Europe too. I can
only assume that Mr Duckenfield’s lack of candour on this occasion was out of character. He said his reason for
not telling the truth was that if the crowd became aware of it there might be a very hostile reaction and this
might impede rescue work. He did not wish to divulge what had happened until he had spoken to a senior
officer. However, reluctance to tell Mr Kelly the truth did not require that he be told a falsehood. Moreover,
although Assistant Chief Constable Jackson was at hand, Mr Duckenfield did not disclose the truth to him
until much later.

  284. The likeliest explanation of Mr Duckenfield’s conduct is that he simply could not face the enormity of
the decision to open the gates and all that flowed therefrom. That would explain what he said to Mr Kelly, what
he did not say to Mr Jackson, his aversion to addressing the crowd and his failure to take effective control of the
disaster situation. He froze.

 The Police Case at the Inquiry
   285. It is a matter of regret that at the hearing, and in their submissions, the South Yorkshire Police were not
 prepared to concede they were in any respect at fault in what occurred. Mr Duckenfield, under pressure of
 cross-examination, apologised for blaming the Liverpool fans for causing the deaths. But, that apart, the police
 case was to blame the fans for being late and drunk, and to blame the Club for failing to monitor the pens. It was
 argued that the fatal crush was not caused by the influx through gate C but was due to barrier 124a being
 defective. Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons have been learnt. It would
 have been more seemly and encouraging for the future if responsibility had been faced.

   303. One problem which impeded policc control and the gathering o f intelligence was the intermittent       ;
failure o f communication by radio. There was the period o f two or three minutes when the control mom was     f
out o f radio contact. Even when that was remedied, it was only by using a hand set in the control mom. This   j
meant that control could not override any other messages. No cffeelivc radio communication seems lo have       !
reached control from the perimeter track at the relevant time. M r Greenwood's request for the match lo be     I
stopped and various messages from Constables reporting the distress in the pens did not register. Likewise,    e
communication from Lcppings Lane to control was unreliable. Undoubtedly these breakdowns made it more          r
difficult for those in command to make proper assessments and exercise effective command.                      !<

The Hearing before Stevn J . on the 20th December 1989
There was a hearing before Steyn J to deal with the stay of the
two existing Lead Actions upoiyterms, directions in the remoteness
Lead Actions (one case has been issued in order to bring the
matter before the judge on that occasion) to deal with Directions
for the contribution proceedings between the Defendants and to
consider the draft Trust Deed in conjunction with the draft Deed
of Appointment as an appropriate vehicle for receipt of damages in
the case of infants.
Ben Hytner QC and Tim King appeared for the Plaintiffs. Mr Payne
Junior Counsel appeared for the First Defendants (the South
Yorkshire Police), Edwin Glasgow QC and Mr. Davies appeared for
the Second Defendant (Sheffield Wednesday).    The Third Defendants
(Sheffield City Council) were not represented but had given
authority to the representatives of the First Defendants to deal
with matters on their behalf.    (They are insured with the same
Insurers, the Municipal Mutual).    Mr. Fenwick appeared for the
Fourth Defendants (Eastwood and Partners).
By consent an order was made in each of the two Lead Actions
staying those actions on the terms contained in a letter from
Hammond Suddards of the 15th December 1989 and countersigned on
behalf of the Steering Committee (a copy of that letter is
enclosed herewith and marked 'B'). In each case am order was made
that the costs of the action should be paid by the First
Defendants.   The Plaintiffs discontinued their action against the
Second, Third and Fourth Defendants, the costs of those Defendants
being reserved and if necessary will be argued at smother date.
Those three Defendants had requested an Undertaking that the
Plaintiffs would not bring other proceedings against them. That
Undertaking was given on behalf of the Plaintiffs in Lead
actions. It was stated in open court that if a very substantial
number of the- Firms in the Group would give a similar undertaking
(which it is sensible and practical to give as the full value of
the claims will be met by the First Defendants) then apparently
none of the other Defendants will seek costs against the
Plaintiffs in the Lead actions.    If costs are sought by them at a
later stage and the cases restored for argument on this point then
     I




there has been an agreement with the First Defendants that   they
will indemnify the Plaintiffs in respect of those costs.
Because the Lead Actions have now been stayed the time reserved
for the hearing of those actions (6 weeks from the 19th June 1990
at Liverpool) was available.
After hearing argument as to the use of that time for the
remoteness cases and/or the contribution proceedings Steyn J
directed that the nervous shock Lead cases (to be argued as to
remoteness only) should be listed for five days commencing on the
19th June.
There was argument between the Defendants as to the validity of
the current contribution proceedings.    He directed that the trial
of the current third party proceedings, between the Defendants and
any additional proceedings for a declaration of non-liability (if
such were taken) should be heard on the 18th October 1990.    That
should resolve the position between the Defendants although of
course no Plaintiffs will be involved in those proceedings and
those proceedings will not delay settlement of individual claims.

As far as the remoteness cases are concerned these affect the
First Defendants (the police) only and both their Counsel, our
Counsel and the Judge were of the view that these should proceed
without any undue delay and - because the arguments are purely
ones of the application of law to particular sets of facts -
without unnecessary pleadings and unnecessary oral evidence.

It is likely that this case will proceed under Order 18 Rule 21
procedure with little oral evidence and the Judge made the
"suggestion" that it will be appropriate for skeleton arguments
and photocopies of relevant cases and Judgments to be lodged prior
to the hearing.
He noted the draft Trust Deeds and adjourned for consideration of
those until a date in January or February when he would give
further consideration assisted by Chancery Counsel.

The "agreement" 15th December 1989 (enclosure

 Following recent authority the Steering Committee cannot and has
 not purported to reach agreement with the First Defendants on
 behalf of the Group as a whole. I would draw your attention to
 the top of page 2 of Hammond Suddards letter. The Steering
C o m m it t e e have’entered into negotiations1with the Defendants
Advisors and Insurers as a result of which' terms of settlement are
on offer to each individual member, of ,    .the„Group in respect of each
individual client; .                     "^            .
I w o u ld   your attention to the fadt that"these terms are on
             d ra w
offer to existing members of the Group and automatically to any
new claimants who instigate claims before the end of 1990.
Between the beginning of 1991 and the' end of the limitation period
each new claim will be looked at on its merits but is not
automatically covered by this agreement.    -
Those clients who sore covered and_ who will receive 100% of their
claims from the First Defendants iarejde^iled.in Bulletin 11. ‘
As far as term 2 is concerned there are one or two matters to note

            (a) The particulars required at 2 (a) are needed by the
First Defendants to enable them.to pursue the contribution
proceedings against the other Defendants.           They appreciate that
the "best particulars" may ip a number of:cases be limited. It is
i m p o r t a n t to them to be able to establish which Pen individuals
were in initially (the agreement to pay covers those who for
example scrambled out of one of the overcrowded pens into one of
the adjoining safe areas) because the liability between Defendants
may vary as to whether the cause of action originated in Pen 3 -
where the barrier broke - or in Pen 4 where it did not.
     From the statements we have seen many peoplevare not aware
which Pen was which. As one came to the ground through the tunnel
those people who went to the right when coming out of the tunnel
went into Pen 3 and those who went to the left went into Pen 4.
      (b) We made it clear during negotiations with the Defendants
 that as far as the supply of medical reports to the Insurers is
 concerned that the normal practice would apply and that we would
 be advising members of the Group that that was the case.

      As in any other case -you are only required to produce medical
 reports upon which you intend to rely and there is no obligation
 to produce those as soon as they are received particularly if this
 is a case where injuries are reasonably•severe and where it would
    be more appropriate-to have simultaneous exchange of medical
    reports between‘Plaintiffs "and Defendants.
          Each case must -of -course depend on its own merits and on the
  judgment of therSolicitor having conduct of the case. The
   Insurers do require some medical evidence within 6 months (in
~ order toxdeal withFthetinter-Defendant proceedings) but you will
   note that-all £thatyis necessau^ is a brief description, of the
•' nat\ire'':6 f Tth€ cinjury' from' a :medical practitioner - in other words
 -you have no obligation to supply the opinion or prognosis part of
   the report at that stage if you do not wish to do so.
           u ia t   s -c is a c t s e i   j:;-   r      •.          ■:r . ;
                  vqf ^coUrs£-the agreement by the Defendants to pay the fees
' *for" medical reports (mentioned in previous Bulletins) only
   o p e r a t e s once those reports have been disclosed.


    - , ~ • "c (j.); vlThe agreement to pay expenses and costs involved in
    supplying further-information for use in the inter-Defendant *

    Procedure for dealing with claims covered bv the Agreement
    :The settlement cor bearing (if quantum is disputed) of individual
     claims is of course a matter for the client's own Solicitor to
     deal with directly with the First Defendant's Insurers.
    We understand from the Insurers that a number of people have not
    yet submitted letters before action although their clients are
    known as members of the Group. For example letters before action
    have not been received in respect of 11 of the 95 fatals.
     If you have not already done so please immediately write a letter
     before action to the Soutlv‘
                                -Yorkshire Police, the Sheffield
     Wednesday Football Club and Eastwood and Partners.
     There is no need to write a letter before action to Sheffield City
     Council as they are covered by the same Insurers as the Police.
     A specimen letter before action and the full names and addresses
     of the Defendants is enclosed at enclosure 'C'.
     At the same time please write directly to the Municipal Mutual at
     Bradford giving details of the claim and marking the letter for
     the attention of          '

I would draw your attention to this Rule in the White Book. All
that is necessary is a Writ - against the single Defendant, "The

An application under Order 18 Rule 21 for trial without pleadings
should be made to which the First Defendants will consent and the
matter should proceed on the basis of a letter setting out details
of the injuries and loss involved.

^)Dear Sirs,


  A.S. Devine - Hillsborough



  Thank you for your letter of the 26th February. We are afraid we are having great in
  obtaining a medical report as we are now told that Dr. Neary is unable to examine and
  report for us due to pressure of work.     In the circumstances we will contact Dr.
  Lascells to see if he can fit this claim in on an urgent basis.       If he cannot we
  will come back to you with another name.

  We note what you say regarding the further Interim payment. As your Client is under
  a disability we think that any further Interim payment will have to be made through
  the Courts particularly if it is to be used for something such as the purchase of
  another house for Mr. and Mrs. Devine.      We must make it clear that we have no
  objection in principle to advising our Clients to make a further Interim payment but
  Court approval will be required in any event.



   Yours faithfully,




   WEIGHTMAN RUTHERFORDS

        unanimous view of all concerned th a t the property which is desired to be acquired is
        ideally suited to Andrew's needs From your point of view, if you are agreeable in
        principle to making th e Interim payment of the sum requested, such sum could be paid
        into Court and th e Court working in conjunction with the- Court of Protection (if
        necessary) would give suitable directions as to the payment out/utilisation of such
        monies bearing in mind Andrew's disability.

        Accordingly, we enclose Consent Summons which we would be grateful if you would
        endorse and return to us within the course of the next 7-days.

        Dear Sirs,

        A.S. Devine - Hillsborough

!       )Following the Wrtier's telephone conversation with Mr. Robin Makin we telephoned our
         Insurance Clients to take some instructions. We regret to say that the question of
         the interim payment as posed to us in your letter of the 16th May is not quite as
         simply as you make out.

        We think that at the end of the day it would be easier                                                                                     if you were to make an
        application to the Court for an interim payment in the usual                                                                              way with the appropriate
        Affidavits and documents in support.

         We are    not    being difficult but there are various       matters which    require
         consideration.   Firstly there is the question of the amount of the interim payment.
         You have told us that it is proposed that a house will        bepurchased and then
         appropriate works carriedout to adapt the house to the needs of Mr.      Devine. We
         completely see  the logic of that if that is what is advised by the Doctors as "being
         appropriate and best for the patient.    However, we cannotsee that the Defendants
         would be responsible for the capital costs of the purchase of the property in any
         event though we accept fully that they would be responsible for those costs        of
         conversion or adaption of the property.

    I




         We have not yet received our own medical report but if you have any further documents
         or medical evidence which you wish to submit to us we will happily consider them and
         advise our Clients as appropriate.

         Yours faithfully,

A.S. DEVINE - HILLSBOROUGH

We refer to your le tte r of. 2 ^ th .:V»ay.

We should be grateful • if you would seek further instructions from your clients as to
whether they are now prepared to make an interim payment of the amount which ;ve
have requested.

In order to deal with the m atter in a satisfactory way we reply to the two points which
you have raised in your le tte r of.    M?.y

Firstly, you raise th e point th at you do not see th a t the Defendants would be
responsible for the capital costs of the purchase o f. th e' property although you accept
th at they would be fully responsible for the costs of conversion or adaption of the
property.

We consider, that you have missed the point of critical significance in this rijiv d .
There are numerous heads of damages which are claimable including loss of earnings,
nursing care, pain and suffering etc. etc. The to tal quantum oi the claim is likely to
far exceed the amount which we are asking to receive by way of interim payment
regardless of whatever discount you are attem pting to advance so far as the capital
cost of the accommodation is concerned. The victim did not own his own
accommodation a t th e date of the accident and the property has to be acquired to
enable him to receive th e best possible attention which can be made available to him
under th e circumstances.



We tru st th at you have now received the report from Dr. W.3.K. Cummings who we
understand has examined our client. Dr. Cummings has had many months to prepare
his report. Please Confirm th a t you have received a report from Dr. Cummings. If you
have not received any report from Dr. Cummings please may we have an explanation as
to the reason for th e del^y.
r 'l




Will you please confirm th a t all the Defendants are prepared to consent to Judgment
being entered against them in this case or, if not, to provide detailed reasons for their
refusal. Please le t us know the specific identities of those who are providing your
instructions.

We are hoping to receive an interim Order from the Court of Protection sometime next
week and also a final report on the property which it is intended to purchase. Once
this information is to hand we would be in a position to exchange C ontracts and to
complete by th e end of July. This would be extrem ely desirable from the point of
view of our client and his family and generally. We do not wish to waste tim e with an
unnecessary application to Court. We are prepared to m eet with you and those who
are instructing you to discuss the m atter early next week to enable this aspect of the
m atter to be suitably dealt with.

Please will you contact the w riter to make mutually convenient arrangements in this
regard.

 Dear Sirs,

 A.S. Devine - Hillsborough

'J Ihank you for your letter of the 3rd July which we have discussed with our Clients.
 We regret to say we cannot deal with the matter in the way in which you are asking.
 Proceedings are in existence and we suggest that you make an application to the Court
 supported by the appropriate Affidavit exhibiting the evidence upon which you are
 intending to rely.

 We are not being difficult but you are asking for a great deal of money and it must
 be dealt with via the proper channels.

 We have not yet received our report from Dr. Cummings but we have sent him a reminder.

 Yours faithfully,




 WEIGHTMAN RUTHERFORDS

)          A.S. DEVINE - HILLSBOROUGH


           We refer to your letters of 9th July.
           The writer has attempted to speak to you by telephone on 10th and 12th July
           without success.
           We are concerned to note that you have not received a report from Dr. Cummings.
           He examined Andrew many months ago. Perhaps you would be good enough to let
           us know the reason for his delay in dealing with the matter.
           The Court of Protection have authorised the purchase of the property by Interim
           Order dated 29th June 1990.
           Will you please let us know whether you and/or those you represent are contending
           that the property should not be purchased in the interests of Mr. Devine?
           Will you please confirm that those you represent are prepared to.make an interim
           payment which will enable the property to be purchased, the necessary works to
           to the property to be undertaken and the other incidental and associated expenses
           to be discharged. A further payment on account of all the other heads of loss
           suffered by our client should also now be appropriate.
           VWefer to dealing with matters via the proper channels.    You are not Solicitors
           on the record. Unfortunately, the way in which you are dealing with this
           particular case is not helpful and we Require you to let us know the following
           by return
            1.     Whether, in view of your reference to proper channels^e should not
            continue to deal with you but should deal with the Solicitors on the record as
            acting for the Defendants.
            2.     If we are to deal with the Solicitors acting on the record for the
            Defendants please will you advise us as to their current references for this
            matter so that we can deal with them quickly.
            3.    Are you and those you represent prepared to agree to a hearing at short
            notice in order to deal with an interim payment? If not, why not?

                                                                                                  contin.
contin • • • •



4.    Why have you declined our invitation to jneet'to discuss this matter with
you    which any legitimate points which you might have with regard to the size
of the interim payment could, be dealt with.
5. . - Are       the Defendants prepared to consent to Judgment being entered against
them? If         not, will you please let us have their detailed reasons for their
refusal?         Please will you provide us with the specific identities of those
providing        your instructions.
We look forward to hearing from you without further delay.

  Dear Sirs, .


  Andrew Divine - Hillsborough.


  We have now received instructions that we are to formally come on the Record as
  acting for the Second Defendant.      We note from the copy Writ that the Second
  Defendant is named as Peter Wright (Sued as the Chief Constable of the West Yorkshire
  Police) whereas the draft Order which you sent us referred to The Chief Constable,
  correctly, of the South Yorkshire Police. We presume that you have amended tlie Writ
  and if that in fact is so can you please let us have a copy of the Amended Writ.



  Yours faithfully,

Dear Sirs,

A.S. Devine - Hillsborough

We acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th August with enclosure.     We are
surprised that you have not exhibited more documentation to your Affidavit and in
particular documents relating to the cost of the purchase of the property you refer
to, Surveyor*s reports and estimates in respect of the carrying out of work. We are
also surprised you have not exhibited the Order which you appear to haveobtained
from the Court of Protection.

Finally we are surprised that there is no Statement of Claim or,                                                                         perhaps more
importantly a schedule of special damages and anticipated future loss.

Yours faithfully,




WEIGH'             RUTHERFORDS

    Andrew S. Devine - Hillsborough Disaster

    Thank you for your letter of 21st August, 1990*

    We enclose copy of Order of the 20th August 1990*

    You are well aware that the totality of our client's claim In th e most conservative
    of estim ates greatly exceeds-the amount of the interim payment which has been
    awarded. Such a position is not altered by the most conservative of estim ates
    with regard to accommodation charges which you have contended are applicable
    We can see no justification whatsoever for your request.

    We are concerned that matters which do require attention are promptly and
    satisfactorily dealt with by you. It would be helpful to le t us have a Banker's
    Draft for            its soon as possible. Will you please ensure that such a Draft is
    delivered to our offices during the course of a morning in order to enable the
    appropriate banking arrangements to be made.

    We are extremely disturbed by the approach which has been adopted on the part of
    those instructing you in this matter. It appears that those you represent wish to
)   aggravate rather than ameliorate the suffering.

We enclose copy of 6rde»r.tOft2$)tH August..^             ;
We are dismayed by your<approach. The words of Lord Justice Taylor in his report
appear to be appropriate to the approach which you are adopting:-
“Such an unrealistic approach gives cause for anxiety as to whether lessons, have
been learnt. It would have been more seemlj <vui encouraging for the future if
responsibility had been faced".                                         ;     ; ;
You do not appear to be prepared to face up to the responsibilities arising froi_j'r
your client's negligence. It is in our client's interests for him to be accommodated
in a suitable home environment. You have known of this objective for a very-long
time and the costs which will be involved.
At the hearing before Mr. Registrar            the Registrar worked on the basis of
the following losses:-
1. Property
2. Future nursing care
3. Income during lost years
4. Loss of future earnings
5. Loss of earnings
6. Pain and suffering
The Registrar rounded this figure up to           bearing in mind that there are a
number of other heads of claim e.g£* Court of Protection fees, transport costs*
special equipment etc to take into account.
 It should, perhaps, be noted that the calculation was based upon minimum figures in
terras of earnings and life expectancy and, in due course, it is likely that
considerably higher figures than those adopted in the calculation will prove to be
appropriate. It is clear from Schott Kem Limited v Bentley (Court of Appeal -
 February 23rd 1990) that the amount of the interim payment should be for such amount
 as the court thinks Just. There is no need to show need. In this case there is a

                                                                                                                                                                         contin

need: it appears that fcke.motivating force behind your approach is to try to
ensure that such need is not satisfied and that our client remains in hospital
contrary to the recommendations of his consultant and all.those who are involved
in dealing with this matter in his interests.
We are not satisfied that any suitable explanation has been given as to why the
Plaintiff should not now have Interlocutory Judgment. The squabbling between the
culpable parties is irrelevant to the quantum of our client's damages. The second
Defendant has accepted responsibility for meeting the quantum of our client's
claim and you have asked us to discontinue our proceedings against the first
Defendants (on the basis of youfipaying the costs).
 Please will you now confirm that you are prepared to consent to Judgment being
 entered against the Second^Defendant. Unless we have Interlocutory Judgment
 entered by.consent the-appropriate steps will have to be taken in the proceedings.
 These will involve a substantial amount of expense and will only lead to a position
"fhichy«5jeyou represent-should face up'to at this stage. If the issue of liability
 <ias to be determined by the Court we think that this should be done at. a split
 Trial and the sooner the appropriate Arrangements are made for the determination .
 of that matter the better it will berfrom,our client's point^of^View.1^ ' ^ ^ ’

Andrew Devine - Hillsborough

We refer to earlier correspondence and to th e w riter's discussion with
        on 29th August 1990.

We can so no reason w h y judgment should not be entered for the Plaintiff against
the Second Defendant.

You have indicated th at the Second Defendant will m eet the Plaintiff’s claim in
full and th at arrangements have been made between the various Defendants in this
regard.

It seems to us to be clearly appropriate th a t the Plaintiff, who is entitled to
judgment , should now have judgment e n te re d . in ...his. 'favour. Will ycu please take
specific instructions from your clients and le t us know the following:-

1.    If they are prepared to consent to judgment being entered against them;

2     If not, why net?                                                           •

3.    What arrangements have been made between the respective Defendants with
      regard to liability and meeting the P lain tiff’s claim; and

4.    If the Second Defendants have already conceded th at they are prepared to
       m eet the Plaintiff’s claim in full on what basis can it be contendedIX ^ th at     0
       judgment on liability should not be entered against the Plaintiff andfcould
       the Second Defendant be prejudiced by such judgment being entered?

We assume on the admission th a t the P laintiff's claims in this m atter will be met
in full       means th at the Second Defendant will m eet all claims as if judgment
has already been entered. Please will you le t us know the date upon which you are
contending th a t a Plaintiff is entitled to the equivalent of having judgment against
your client.

We would hope th a t it v/ili be unnecessary to have a further interlocutory hearing
to deal with the obtaining of judgment or further directions with regard tc tidying
up the liability issue in this case. However, if we do not hear from you
satisfactorily within seven days of the date of this le tte r, we are proposing to
issue a summons for directions so th a t the Court can consider the position further.

We are sending a copy of this letter to the solicitors acting for the First
Defendants.

    We refer to the final paragraph of our letter of the 20th September 1990 and our
    earlier correspondence. We understand th at you and the other Defendants have come
    to term s.

    There is no reason why Judgment could not be entered against your clients forthwith
    with it being agreed th a t th e date upon which the Plaintiff Is entitled to have all the
    benefits of a 3udgment being agreed a t a much earlier date than the date upon which
    the Court actually seals 3udgment.

    If we do not hear from you substantively and satisfactorily within the next seven days
    we fear th at there Is no alternative other than to go to the expense of issuing a
    Summons. Do you agree?

Andrew Devine -    Hillsborough

Thank you for your Without Prejudice letter of 2nd November 1990.

Will you please reply to us by way of open correspondence.

We are In the process of issuing a Summons for Directions and, In th e alternative,
Judgm ent.

You have not replied substantively to all of th e points raised In our le tte r of 30th
August 1990 and we shall be grateful if you will now do so. Are you undertaking to
m eet our client's claim in the same way as your clients would be liable If Judgment
had been entered against them a t the tim e (which is alm ost a year ago) your clients
agreed to m eet the claim in full.

We do not understand your concern about the alleged •additional expense with regard
to obtaining Judgment*. The cost of a Consent Order giving Judgment to our client is
relatively small and would, of course, be far outweighed by the costs of a Summons
for Directions In respect of which Counsel will be instructed on behalf of Mr. Devine.

This case is far too Im portant and critical for m atters to be dealt with In the way in
which your clients appear to wish. Gur client is entitled to have a Judgm ent against
your clients together with th e security and all the benefits which such a Judgment
brings. The way in which you wish m atters to proceed is not in our clien t's Interests
and we cannot allow th e situation to proceed unless the Court specifically directs such
an approach is appropriate.

ANDREW DEVINE - HILLSBOROUGH


Thank you for your le tte rs of 9th and 15th November 1990.

Will you please tak e specific instructions from your clients and ascertain from them
whether:-

a)    Their servants or agents (including yourselves) are of the opinion th at they can
      depose to an Affidavit disputing liability in this m atter;


b)    If, as you now appear to insist, your clients wish us to go the expense of serving a
      Statem ent of Claim and to swear a further Affidavit indicating th at as far as we
      are concerned, th ere is no Defence on liability.


The costs involved should be paid by your clients on an indemnity basis in any event.

Dear Sirs,

Andrew Devine - Hillsborough

Thank you for your letter of the 19th November.       As you have asked we will take
specific instructions but in the meantime will you please serve a Statement of
Claim.   We do not see how the Court can be asked to give directions without a
Statement of Claim which you will appreciate will deal not only with the liability
issue but also with that of quantum. The Defendants are entitled to know hov your
Client pleads his claim for damages and without knowing that or the headings under
which your Client will claim we cannot deal properly with discovery.

 Yours faithfully,




 VEIGHTMAN RUTHERFORDS

Thank you for your le tte r of the 22nd November 1990.

What possible justifiction could your clients have for there not being Judgment on
liability. Quantum could be dealt with separately. Are your clients prepared to agree
to judgment being entered for the Plaintiff with damages to be assessed?

We look forward to hearing from you as a m atter or urgency.

 We. restrain ourselves from replying to your le tte r of 30th November in term s which might
 be more appropriate. We will, however, confine ourselves to saying th a t what you have
 w ritten is sententious rubbish. Your clients have proclaimed to th e world there is no issue
 on liability and they and their confederates (the other Insurance Companies) then had the
 m atter listed before a High Court Judge and announced to the world again th a t ail parties
 w ere agreed th ere was no issue on liability. Do you dispute this? The reason for our
 putting this to you in this way is quite simple; either liability is in issue or i t is not in
 issue. If it is not in issue it will be pleaded in full and Counsel will have to se ttle
 proceedings, which will increase costs.

 We consider you have been instructed to deal with this m atter in a chicane way and we
 reg ret very much having to use th at term but we can find no justification for not
 regarding your approach as such. This is one of the reasons we have asked to s e e ___
________and we repeat th a t request which both you and he apper to have shuffled off and
 avoided. It is a very serious m atter for those who instruct you to appear to have misled
 th e world a t large, the bona fides of your clients are called into question.

 We look forward to hearing from you constructively by return.

 We hesitate to say th a t th e age of casuistry is not yet dead.

2.     Copy le tte r which we have today sent to Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords
      who are now on th e record for the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire
      Police.

Will you please confirm th a t th e re is no reason why judgment should not now been
entered against the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police. If judgment cannot
be entered by consent we are proposing to issue a Summons for direction so as to
ensure that the liability aspect of this m atter is dutifully dealt with without
further delay.

    Dear Sirs
    Andrew Stanley Devine
    We thank you for your letter dated the 30th August together
    with the enclosures.
    We note what you say concerning the entry of Judgement against
    the Second Defendants. However, as we were not privy to the
    discussions that    took place, we are not in a position to
    confirm whether it is appropriate for Judgment to be entered.
    It is our understanding that the Chief Constable agreed with
    the Hillsborough Steering Committee to pay damages, without
    admission of liability, to claimants save as to nervous shock
    cases where a remoteness of damage issue arose. We anticipate
    that Messrs. Weightman Rutherfords are proceeding on this
    basis to settle the claim, and therefore we cannot see any
    real purpose achieved by attempting to enter Judgment.
    We would add that the lead actions of Chapman and Rimmer have
    been regarded by   the court as theproper proceedings for the
    determination of      liability. It has been indicated by Mr
    Justice Steyn that a Defendant to these actions is entitled to
    make an application to stay any other action brought by a
    party, as clearly it would not be in the interests of
    efficiency if a multitude of actions were allowed to proceed.
    As you may be aware, the trial of the Chapman and Rimmer and
    lead actions will commence on the 2nd October 1990.
    In the event that a Summons for Directions is issued to deal
    with liability, it is likely that such a step will be met by a
    joint application for a stay. A copy of this letter has been

Thank you for your letter of the 4th September 1990.

Will you please confirm that there Is no reason why the Chief Constable cannot
admit liability In a case such as this and, if necessary, seek to recover something
from your clients.

There has to be a Judgment in this matter before the case can be finalised. We
do not see what purpose is served by liability not being resolved In this particular
case. "    '                                           •          ’•* '      ‘

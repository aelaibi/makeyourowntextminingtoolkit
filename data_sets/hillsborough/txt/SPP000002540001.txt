Dear Sarah,

I refer to my telephone conversation with you about two to three
weeks ago regarding the reimbursement of expenses and the payment
of a fee or honorarium or whatever it should be called arising out of the
time and effort I had to put in as a result of the Judicial
Review proceedings.
                                              I indicated that I
had also mentioned this sort of amount to the current coroner and
he and indeed you felt that this was a proper amount. Can you
please arrange to have this paid to me.

In addition there is the reimbursement of expenditure which I
incurred.

The Hotel costs in London which in the account amount to £628.27
were paid by you direct and so need no reimbursement. You will
see on the account that there were some telephone calls.  Some of
these were personal ie to wife and I think my daughter but you
have indicated that it would be in order to claim these and I am
not therefore making any adjustment. I also made two calls in
connection with Hillsborough. One was to Mr. Dorries and the other Dr.
John Clarke whom I wanted to ask something which in fact I cannot now
remember. These may well have been the longer ones but cannot say for
sure.




I travelled to Sheffield twice. Once on 1st July 1993 to
see Elisabeth Bashforth and Mark Webster and the second time on
18th Aug 199 3 on my own initiative and volition to look through
some of the paper work at the Medico Legal Centre. I estimate the
return journeys at say 90 miles each ie a total of 180 miles. Can you
please reimburse me with the appropriate amount and let me know
what your current mileage rate is so that I can make a record of
it.

You will a p p r e c ia te t h a t t h e task of assem b lin g th e ev id en ce for th e Inquiry is a
fo rm id ab le one. And s t a t e m e n t s a r e s till being ta k en . H ow ever, it seem ed right to let
you have w hat m u st be a p re lim in a ry in d icatio n of criticism s- which may be levelled at
th e South Yorkshire P olice as soon as possible b e fo re t h e c o m m e n c e m e n t of th e
Inquiry.       We s u sp e ct t h a t you a r e a lr e a d y a w a r e o f th e g en era l th r u s t of criticism s
which h av e been m ad e and t h a t w h a t is s e t o u t in this l e t t e r will b e no surprise to you.

The following a r e th e m ain g e n e r a l c r itic is m s which so far a p p e a r from th e evidence
av a ila b le to us:-

L.      F a ilu re to ta k e any a d e q u a te s te p s to co n tro l s u p p o rte rs so t h a t th e crush, which
        built up from a b o u t 2.20 to 2.30pm o u tside th e Leppings Lane e n tra n c e to the
        ground and which led to th e decision to open 'C* g a t e b ecau se of a perceived
        dan g er to life, did n o t o c c u r. In p a r tic u la r , t h e r e w e re not p roper arran g e m en ts
        to check s u p p o rte rs a t a fa r enough d is ta n c e from th e grolind and insufficient
        o f f ic e r s w e re a v a ila b le to c o n tr o l t h e crowd o u ts id e th e tu rn stiles.       Having
        reg ard to th e lim ited s p a c e a v a ila b le , th e disposition of m ounted police may not
        have been o f any use and m ay h av e c o n s titu te d a p ositive d anger. It should
        have been a n t ic i p a te d t h a t m an y su p p o rters would a rriv e shortly b efo re kick-off
        and t h a t som e would n o t h av e tic k e ts . Steps should have been ta k en to stop
        n o n -tic k e t holders g e t tin g n e a r th e ground and adding to th e congestion.
    2.     F a ilu r e by o f f ic e r s o u ts id e to liaise adequately with those inside the ground and
           vice versa. T h ere w e re in ad d ition problems with radio co m m u nication s and th e
           noise of th e crow d re n d e r e d such tannoy or loudspeaker an no u n ce m en ts (if any)
           as w e re m ade in e f f e c ti v e . When it was decided th a t a g a t e or g a te s m ust be
           o p e n e d to re lie v e p r e s s u re o u ts id e (and th e decision to open g a te s m ay well have
           been a n e c e ssa ry o ne in th e c ircu m stan c es), th e r e w ere no s te p s ta k e n to ensure
           th a t th e r e was an y po lice o r ste w a rd p resen ce to p re v e n t th ose en te rin g going to
           th e tunnel which led o n to th e alread y overcrow ded Pens 3 and 4. It ought to
           have been realised t h a t w ith o u t such p resen ce all those com ing in the gates
           w e re likely to go down t h e tunnel because of inadequacy o f signing ar.d because
           th e tunnel was th e only visible w ay to the te rra cin g .

    3.     No s te p s w ere ta k e n to m o n ito r properly the s t a t e o f Pens 3 and 4. O fficers
           ought to have been s ta tio n e d in the tunnel an d /o r a t th e r e a r o f th e pens and
           should in co n ju n ctio n w ith th o s e a t th e front h ave ensu red t h a t the pens did not
           b eco m e to o full. It was known t h a t th e r e was likely to be a full house and th a t
           it was e s s e n tia l to e n s u re an ev e n distribution o f s p e c t a to r s in all th e pens on
           th e te r r a c e s , p a r tic u la r ly as th e decision had been m a d e to give Liverpool th e
           sm aller end o f th e ground.

    4.      When people b egan to b e c r u s h e d and to lose th e ir lives, th e o f f ic e r s *?h front of
            Pens 3 and 4 took too long to r e a c t to w hat was happening. They seem ed to be
            thinking in te r m s o f p re v e n tio n o f disorder and pitch invasion r a t h e r than sa fe ty .
            Th ere was no p rop er g u id a n c e given to th e individual o f f ic e r s b e c a u s e no proper
            plans had been m a d e to d e a l w ith overcrow ding in th e pens. The g ates leading
            on to th e pitch w e re no t o pen ed in tim e and, when th e y w ere, o fficers w ere
            in itially try in g to p r e v e n t people g e ttin g o u t. O ffic e rs seem ed n o t to know w hat
            th e y should do and, alth o u g h m any individual o ffic e rs showed g r e a t presence of
            mind and d evotion to d u ty , valuable m inutes w en t by b e fo re th e n a tu re of w hat
            was happening w as a p p r e c i a t e d .

    5.      T h ere w e re in a d e q u a te c o n tin g e n c y plans to deal w ith         th e s o r t of em ergency
            which a ro se . In p a r t ic u l a r , t h e em erg ency serv ice s may        not h ave been called as
            expeditiously as th e y should h av e been and in su ffic ien t                  a r r a n g e m e n ts had been
            m ade to e n a b le th e m to gain a c c e s s to the ground, y e lp             for th e injured was not
            c o -o rd in a te d and no use w as m a d e of th e tannoy sy stem              to explain to s p e c ta to rs
            w h a t had happened o r to o rg a n ise assistance.


*   6.      Since th e r e was no c h a n c e t h a t all those trying to e n t e r th e ground would be
            ab le to do so by 3pm, co n sid e ra tio n should have been given to deferring th e
            k ick-off a t a much e a r l i e r s ta g e . It seem s t h a t it was no t until about 2.55 th a t
            this s te p was co n sid e re d an d by then it was th o ug ht to be too l a te because th e

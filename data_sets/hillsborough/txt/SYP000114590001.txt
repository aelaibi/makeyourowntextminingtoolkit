            At    11.15 am Saturday,             15.04.89,        I commenced        turnstile     duties    on gates

            A - G , lea^y^g to the Leppings Lane                   terracing.         I    was engaged      on search

            duties with PC 963 Evans.

            The gates were            opened at       12 mid- da y and a steady stream of Liverpool

            fans went          inside.       They were       in good spirits and well              behaved.

            About 2 pm (1400)               I saw a y outh of negro           origin a r r e st e d by      pJ^cL
                                                                                                                sL?
            Payne      for a tt e mp ti ng     to enter       the ground      in possession of alcohol.

            There were a number               of Liverpool         fans standing          both on the a pproaches

            to and       in the       roadway at Leppings Lane              from     converations     ove rh ea rd       it

            a p p e a r e d they      were    not   in possession of m atch tickets,                but seemed

            d e termined        to    get    inside and
                                                     and wal
                                                          w atch the match.

            At 2.26       pm    <1426)      I a ss is te d P d C ol ey     to arrest a jTiale in            ^ossess^on

            two       ca^nnatd^j^e^f^rs.            This y outh was        later taken to the         charge

            office.        I returned via the               rear of of the South S tand and               saw numerous

            Liverpool          fans    congregating         outside    the turnstiles         in L ep pi ng s Lane,

            m any were young            persons who were swearing               continually and          their     breath

            smelled strongly             of alcohol.          Many of      these were        the same persons        I

            had earlier          seen on the a pproaches              to   the ground.

            The       crowd surged       towards      the                                 and sjnovjjig and

            despite       continual         pleas    from both m ou n te d arid foot officers               they
                                                                                                     PAGE      2
                                                                                                     R386

refused to form up             in an orderly manner,

I saw several young             boys    no more    than    14 years of age         being       crushed

against       the turnstiles at B and a c t u al l y saw               Insp.    Purdy    pick up a

lad and pull        him out.

The Liverpool          fans    still    pushed forwards and towards a metal                     shutter

gate.        They were    repeatedly told to           refrain but again           refused.           I saw

the gate       bowing and heard a S up e ri n te n dn e t        shouting        to officers          to open

the gates.         1 considered         this the    right    decision as         persons were

becoming       trapped.

The    gates were       opened and there was a surge forward of a p p r ox i ma t el y

3,0(30 Liverpool         fans mamy of who m were            drunk and a g g r e s s i v e .         They all

prtade their way down the central                 tunnel    into the terracing.
                         ■■■mu mi— — ill           in
A few minuts        later      I heard a message          on I think a Tanrioy system

requesting all          police    onto the       pitch.     I made my way towards               the

pitch via the Police             control    room.      I was about        to go onto          the    pitch

when    Insp.    Sykes    direc te d me to the         tunnel    on the L ep pi ng s Lane

terracing.                                                         *

I arri ve d about 3 . 0 5 pm           (1505)    to find PC 3217 W a d s w o rt h giving              first

aid to a female.

Alo ng si de    this    female was a male aged about 25 years,                     I checked him

for a pulse and          couLd not find anything,              he a pp eared dead.

I then a ss is te d PC ^ d s w & V t h      with the female            before    going    into the

rear of the tunnel            with other        officers.      I removed a male who was

obv io us ly dead from beneath the tunnel          having been d ra g ge d there                       by
                                                  -
s upporters and as            I did so I saw a teenage boy laid face down

u n d e r n eath this man.        The y ou th was      removed by other           officers and

taken to outside an exit.

I a g a i n went    into the      tunnel    and a ss is t ed other        officers       to    remove

bodies,       all male,       several    a pp ea r ed to be dead.

Desp i t e    continued       pleas    from myself and other            officers    for the able

            bodied fans to make a clearance most                       refused and    in fact   jostled

            police officers               carrying    bodies about.       Fans were    continually

            swearing and directing abuse at myself and other                          officers.

            On    leaving         the    tunnel   I a ss is t ed officers   to form an em er ge nc y

            ambulance            bay and to sort an eme rg en cy         priorty list of     casualties.

            1' saw a total              of a ro u nd 40   casualties    together with 8 or 9 dead

            bodies all            laid on the main d ri veway          leading   to the dir ec to rs   suite.

            T h r o u g h ou t    the entire      incident at no stage did I hear any

            instructions            to officers       given by any senior        officer.

            The     radio seemed           c onti nually used by PS and PC's.

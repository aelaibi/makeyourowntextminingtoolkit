   Tnank you for your letter of 13 July about the cost of the
   investigations by the West Midlands Police into the Hillsborough
   Stadium Tragedy.
   Lord Ferrers wrote to Councillor Ablett on 17 July informing him
   that a proposal had been put to the South Yorkshire Police
   Authority about how the costs incurred on the investigations should
   be met.     It would involve South Yorkshire meeting the costs
   initially but with special assistance from Central Government in
   recognition of the special features of the case.
   South Yorkshire are now considering the proposal and we hope that
   an agr^fiient can be reached quickly on the reimbursement of the West
   Midlands' additional police costs. We are awaiting a response from
   South Yorkshire.

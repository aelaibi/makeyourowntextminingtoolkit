STATEMENT OP PETER WRIGHT, CHIEF CONSTABLE, SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE,
IN RESPONSE TO THE HILLSBOROUGH INQUIRY REPORT
The report of the Inquiry by Lord Justice Taylor has been received by
me and I have noted the criticisms that have been directed against
members of the South Yorkshire Police both individually and collectively.
To make it clear to all concerned I would say at the outset that I
accept the findings and the conclusions of the Inquiry insofar as they
relate to the South Yorkshire Police.
The fact that we are held to have contributed to the terrible tragedy
of Hillsborough is a matter of profound sadness to all members of the
Force, and both personally and on their behalf I once again extend my
heartfelt regret to those who have lost loved ones or suffered injury.
Lord Justice Taylor and all concerned may be assured that the South
Yorkshire Police will pursue every action available to then to ensure
that such an event could not occur again.    I amgrateful for the
coomenta he has made regarding the manner in which the Forcehas
handled crowd control and public order events generally and for his
recognition of the heroic efforts of many of my        officers on the day.
The Home Secretary has asked me for a report on       the action Ipropose
to take in the light of the Inquiry and this will be pursued. Before
responding to the Home Secretary it will be necessary for me to consult
with members of my Police Authority, the Director of Public Prosecutions,
the Police Complaints Authority, and others.
In my report to the Police Authority on 21 April 1989 I indicated that
I accepted full responsibility for police action in connection with
this event. In pursuance of this responsibility, and in the light of
Lord Justice Taylor's findings, I have written to my Chairman and
offered my resignation to the Police Authority so that members will
have the opportunity to consider my continuance as Chief Constable,
and my Office is now at their disposal.

Hillsborough Justice Concert in Liverpoo/fl: tomorrow Saturday 10 May

Issue

To alert you to tomorrow’s Hillsborough justice concert, and increased media
interest in whether you plan to hold a further public inquiry into the disaster.

Recommendation

That you note that the concert is taking place and agree the attached lines to
take.

Consideration

There is likely to be considerable media interest in the concert tomorrow,
coupled with renewed requests from the families for a new public inquiry.
Coverage from today’s Liverpool Echo is attached for information.

As you know, CD has fielded regional media enquiries and TV and radio bids
throughout this week on this topic; press interest is likely to be renewed partly
because of the location (Anfield) and the high profile of many of the bands
involved (eg Beautiful South, Space, Manic Street Preachers).

You should also be aware that some local MPs, including OPS minister Peter
Kilfoyle, may attend the event, which could attract further media attention.

                                                     - 9 MAY

Lines to take:


• I met some of the Hillsborough families after the broadcast of the drama-
  documentary last year, and was conscious of their strength of feeling on
  this issue

• I have also met MPs from both Merseyside and S Yorkshire, who have
  expressed their concerns

• I am considering the requests for a new inquiry very carefully, and will
  make a decision as soon as I can.

(If pressed:)

• I am currently looking at the material the families passed to the Home
  Office earlier this year

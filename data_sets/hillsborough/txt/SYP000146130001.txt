        VITAL TO THIS J UD IC IA L         INQUIRY?



               In my opinion there            should be a Senior          Police      Officer,

              Senior Firs Officer and Senior Amb ul an ce Officer

              located together at every football                 match,            Should a major

              incident     occur      these    people would     immediately be aware                of

              the    nature       of the   incident and     could take         control     from

              the beginning,          this would a ll eviate what happened on                     15«4.89

              when    nobody knew what was            happening,,

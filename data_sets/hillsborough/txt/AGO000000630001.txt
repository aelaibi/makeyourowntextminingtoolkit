Home Secretary


HILLSBOROUGH


Issue


1.    To consider the possible scope of the judicial examination of the recent
representations.

Timing

2.    We are to discuss this on 4 June. You asked for advice on the terms of
reference as a basis for that discussion.

Consideration

3.        There are seven key issues to consider:

            (i)        the nature of the inquiry

            (ii)       its scope

            (iii)      its purpose

            (iv)       terms of reference

            (v)        timetable

•
                     (vi)        who should do it?

                     (vii)       handling.

        4.      On the nature of the inquiry, it will not fit any of the conventional patterns for
        inquiries - such as Royai Commission, tribunal of inquiry, inquiry under the Police
        Act, or non-statutory judicial inquiry. (Those different forms of inquiry are considered
        in detail in my submission of today's date about an inquiry into policing of minority
        ethnic communities.) This will be a judicial examination of the substance of
         representations calling for a full public inquiry, inquest or prosecution - in effect to
        determine whether a full-blown inquiry is warranted.

        5.     You have indicated that the scooe of the judicial examination should not
        extend to a re-opening of all the matters dealt with by Taylor. No-one has
        questioned Taylor's conclusions and recommendations about safety at sports
        grounds and the policing of football matches. The scope should be limited to
        consideration of the recent representations made by the Hillsborough families and
        others. Those representations fall under four broad headings:

                      (i)         the ten allegedly 'unresolved questions’ raised in the Granada
                                  programme;

                       (ii)        allegations about video evidence;

                       (iii)       medical evidence about the time of death of the victims;

                       (iv)        other allegations by the families about police conduct.

         6.      I suggest the focus should be the evidence which has been put forward to us,
         together with any other relevant material which those concerned want to submit. It
         should be mainly a review of the written material, although you wanted to allow the
         opportunity for representations. If the examination is, to be manageable, however,
         we will need to avoid hearings or legal representation; there are (at this stage) no
          parties or plaintiffs.

          7.    The purpose of the examination will have to be several-fold, because - as my
          submission of 8 May drew out - it is very difficult to separate matters potentially
          relevant to an inquiry, or inquest, possible criminal proceedings or disciplinary
          matters. In practice, the inquirer will have to form a view about whether there are
          grounds for;

                         public inquiry:

                         consenting to a new inquest;

                         new criminal investigations;

           ^          instigating disciplinary procedures;

                      or any combination of those options.

           That means that the inquirer must report not just to you as Home Secretary,
           because only the first of those four issues is for you to determine. The inquirer must
           report also to the Attorney General, the DPP, and - on the last point - to the relevant
           chief officer of police.
   |
           8.         That suggests terms of reference something (ike:

                      “To carry out an independent examination of whether there is new evidence
                      relating to the disaster at the Hillsborough Stadium on 15 April 1989 which
                      provides sufficient grounds for:

                                  (i)          the Attorney-General to apply to the High Court under section
                                               13 of the Coroners Act 1988 for another inquest;

                                  (ii)         the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider bringing criminal
                                               charges against any person;

                                   (iii)       the relevant Chief Police Officer to take disciplinary action
                                               against any police officer.

                       Or which means that it would be in the public interest for the Home Secretary
                       to establish a public inquiry"

           9.     It is important that we should put an ©nd to speculation with the minimum of
           delay. A timetable of no more than 2 or 3 months is important. That will have a
           Bearing on who should do the job. You have already said that it is essential to
           appoint a judge. Anyone starting from scratch in considering these issues would
           have a huge amount of background to assimilate - the Taylor inquiry alone produced
           over 120 files of written material. One possible candidate for the job with a head
           start would be Mr Justice Collins, now a High Court judge, but Counsel to the Taylor
           inquiry in 1989. We have not approached LCD to see if he would be available, but
           could do so if you wish. There would be some risk that he might be perceived -
           although not, I think, by the Hillsborough families - as not totally impartial because of
           his previous involvement with the inquiry,

           10.   The scope and timetable will have implications for the costs to the
           department. There is no provision for such costs at present.

           11-     On handling the next step will be to secure the agreement of the Attorney and
           the DPP. I have told their offices broadly what you have in mind and that you are
           likely to approach them formally soon. The Heritage Secretary should also be kept
           informed because of his responsibility for safety at sports grounds. The Lord
           Chancellor will have to be approached to nominate a judge.

                Once you have colleagues’ agreement we will put forward advice on handling
         an announcement and how to inform the main players. We see those as being the
         Hillsborough families, the Merseyside MPs, and the South Yorkshire Police. Others,
         however, also have a close interest and arrangements will have to be made to warn
         them in advance - particularly former chief superintendent Duckenfield who will be a
         focus of media attention.

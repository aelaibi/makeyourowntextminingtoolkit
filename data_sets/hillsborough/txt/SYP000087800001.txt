              I am a single             man       residing          at    the    above      address.

              On     the   afternoon           of S a t u r d a y        15 A p r i l     1989   ( 1 5 04 8 9 )    I attended       the F A

       Police,

There       were    also       four       other       lads w i t h       us,       who    were        unknown          to me,       they

were    friends          of

We    travelled          to S h e f f i e l d        in a v a n w h i c h          is u s e d      by              md               in

the    course       of    their work.                 It w a s     independently                organised.

W e a ll     left    for       the m a t c h         from my       house       at a b o u t        quarter         to    eleven          on

the    morning.           I c a n ’t r e m e m b e r         what      route        we    t oo k      and    I can       only

recall       one    traffic          hold       up on the way.                I can ' t        remember           where       it w a s

as    I was       in the       back       of    the     van w h i c h       d i d not      have         side windows,               so    I

was    unable       to see          out.

We    arrived       in S h e f f i e l d        at a b o u t    quarter        past        one        (1315).           We    parked

on a m a i n       road w h i c h w a s          about       a mile away             f r o m the         ground.             We    then

walked       towards          the    ground,          stopping         off     at    a    pub on the w a y               for a

drink.        I c a n ’t       remember          the n a me of          the    pub.         This        pub w a s       full        with

other       Liverpool          sup por te rs . The             pu b     was    very        busy because                there        were

two    'bouncers*             on the m a i n          door who         s a i d we        couldn't           come       in to       start

with    but we       got       in t h r o u g h a s i d e d o o r w h e r e              there        weren't          any    doormen

We    all    had    s om e     cans w i t h          us w h e n we w e n t          into    the pub,           except

who    was    driving.              We    each       had a     couple         of    cans w h i c h we             had    brought

with    us    from Liverpool.                    It w a s      very      b u s y at       the      bar      in the       pub,       so we

drank       our    own    cans.           We    did    in f a c t      split        up w h e n we           got    to    that

pub b e c a u s e    only       so m a n y       could       get      in at a n y         one      time.          I actually

went    in w i t h                              We    only stopped             in the          pu b for a b o u t            ten

look    around       for       the       other       lads w h e n we          left       the     pub     but we         couldn't

see    them.        Because          of    this       I walked         to    the     g r o u n d w i t h ___

A s we w a l k e d       towards          the    ground,         I saw        people       with         cans      of    beer       in the

street,       but    there was             no    sort     of     disorder           or a n y       fighting.             There       was

no    obvious       drunkeness,                everybody         just       seemed        to     be     in g o o d      spirits.

We     did    not    receive         any       directions               from     the P o l i c e          or a n y     escort       to       the

ground.            I knew where              to     go as        I had a t t e n d e d        the         corresponding/match

at H i l l s b o r o u g h    last y e a r .

two     (14 2 5).         Upon arrival               at      the    turnstiles             it w a s        very       qu/et       and    we

were     able       to w a l k      straight            to a t u r n s t i l e .         I was            very        surprised          as I

thought        it w o u l d      have        been a          lot    busier.             Id o n ' t        rec a l l    seeing       any

Policemen           by the       turnstiles.                  There       were      two     stewards              by the      turnstile

that     we w e n t       through.             The      stewards          were      wearing           green        flourescent

b ibs.        I handed my            ticket          to      the    turnstile            operator            and was         handed          the

stub     back.        The     outer          perimeter             gates       w h i c h lead        into      the     turnstile

area     were       open,     but       I    did      not      see a n y       other gates open apart                        from       the

turnstiles.               I did      not       see a ny          form     of    unauthorised                 entry      into       the

ground.            Having     got       into        the      g r o u n d we m a d e       for        the     central         tunnel

under        the    stand.          I used          t h at    tunnel       last        y e ar .       There were             no    signs

indicating           that     you       could        get      onto       the    terraces             any     other      w a y a n d as

far    as     I was       concerned            that        tunnel       was     the      only way            in.       Once       inside

the     ground       I did       not        see     any      disorder,          fighting             or    drunkeness.              I di d

not    se e    any    people         drinking.                I walked          along       the       tunnel          with              quite

freely.            There     were       no P o l i c e        or    stewards, e i t h e r             at     the      entrance          to

the     tunnel       or    inside           it.      At      the    end    o / the        tunnel           there       was    a solid

mass     of    p e o ple.        It w a s         twenty         f i v e /to    three        (1435)          at    this      time,       as       I

behind        the    goal.          Whenever            I am       standing         on the        K o p at A n f i e l d           I like

to s t a n d       behind     the       goal,        so we         tried       to get       a spot           in the       centre         of

the     pen    to/the        r i gh t     at      the      end     of    the    tunnel.              I now know           this      to       be

for    a / o o t b a l 1 crowd.                We    pushed         our w a y       through           the      crowd and m o ve d

towards        the     centre        of      the      pen.         It    took     us     three        or     f o ur m i n t u e s       to

get    through          the       c r o w d a n d we       took       up a    position            pretty well              in the

centre       of    the       pen.         I have m a r k e d          this    position            on the       separate             scaled

plan    of      pens     three          and     four      using       the    figure        one.         We    stopped          in this

position          for a b o u t         five       minutes.           We w e r e      going       to    remain          in t h i s

position          because           the      other       lads    in our       group would               have m ad e           for       there

as w e l l .       It w o u l d         have       been a meeting             place        for     us.        A s we       stood         in

this    p o s i t i o n we w e r e            gradually          becoming          more        and more        squeezed             in by

the    crowd.           At a b o u t         quarter       to    three       (1445)        we      d e c i d e d to      try a nd

move    across          to    our       left       hand    side.        The      main          reason     for m o v i n g w a s          to

try and         get a w a y         from      the       squeeze,       but we w a n t e d          to    try a nd          find a

fence      to     sit    on a n d         see      if    the    other       lads      in our       group were              in the

ground.           At    that        time      nobody appeared                i n j u r e d at all,            and       n o b o d y wa s

in a n y     obvious          distress,             but    it w a s     very       unconfortable               in the          pen.           We

mov ed across            to       our     left      and    pushed        past      people         before       coming          to a

dividing          fence       that        ran      down    the       terraces.           This      was       the    dividing

fence      between           pens       three       and    four.         It d i d n ' t        take     us    long       to get

across       to    the       f en c e .       We    both       climbed       onto      this       fence       and       dropped          into

pen    four.           I t h i n k we m a y             have    stood       on a      crush       barrier          near       to    the

fence      to     help       us     up,      but    I *m not         sure.       As    s o o n as we          got       into       pen

four,      it w a s      also        very       tight.          In f a c t    it w a s         probably        tighter             in

there      than        it w as       in      pen thre e .            I*m not       sure        what     the    time w o u l d            have

been    then,          but     the      players          had    not y e t     come        onto     the       p/tch.           Myself

and             struggled            our w a y          through       the    crowd        in pen.fi/ur a nd

eventually             got     to    the      dividing          fence,       on     the        other     s i d e of      the pen,

between         pen f o ur          and      five,       the    narrow       one.        We     then     stood          by t h i s

fence      intending              to w a t c h      the m a t c h      from       th e r e .

I have       indicated              t hi s    position          on the       separate           scaled        plan       of    pens

three      and     four        using         the    figure       two.        Whilst        standing           in    position             two

t he   squeeze          became          more       and    more       intense,         becoming          unbearable.

There      were        two     people         in f r o n t      of    us w h o     were        up a g a i n s t     a    crush

It w a s     an     elderly man and                  his       daughter.

We m a n a g e d     to m o v e       them away              from       the      barrier             to    the

Because        of    the       squeeze         we    decided            to    climb          onto         the     dividing          fence

between        pen      four a n d        pen       five       to    try and              get     away      from        it.        We    both

got    on t o p      of    the      fence         and     got       some      relief            from       the       pressure.             We

hadn't       been       on the        fence         very       long,         when         I c o u l d see            that     the       elderly

man    and     his      daughter          were       being          crushed again.                        I thought           it w a s        just

a    reaction        to the         players          coming          out      onto         the       pitch,          but     the     pressure

did    not     ease       off    and      I became             concerned              for       t h em.         We    jumped        back         down

into       pen four.            Myself         and               physically                helped          the       daughter           o v er

the    dividing           fence       and      i n to     pen five.                  We    then       helped          the     father          over

as w e l l .        It t o o k      a while          to g et         him over              as     he w a s        elderly and              quite

frail.         Other       f an s     helped         to get          the      elderly man                  over       the     fe n c e.          I'm

not    sure       whether        he      got      over       himself          or      if     he      collapsed             over     the       fence

as    he    didn't        seem      to    be m o v i n g .           It w a s         absolute             chaos       in the           pen at

that       time a n d      I didn't            see      the     elderly man again.                              Having        got       this

as    he wa s       climbing          o ve r      the     fence         and      t hi s      caused         him       to fall

it w a s     just          a    crowd        spillage           I think          I had        been       in pe n f i i / e          for a b o u t

five    minutes                when     I saw a          policeman wearing                        a flat        cap/with            braid,

standing          by the           gate       at    the       front        of    pen f i v e w i t h            his      hand       on th e

gate,       as    though           he w a s        about        to    open        it.        He    did       not a c t u a l l y         open       the

gate    but       the          people        were       really        shouting           at       him    to o p f f f the           gate.           The

officer          did e v e n t u a l l y           open       the     gate       after        a b o u t tj/o m i n u t e s .              As       soon

as    the    gate was              opened          there        was    a     rush       to    get       out.        There          were       a    lot

of    people          in       pen f i v e     by n o w w h o           had      spilled           over       from       pen four.

Myself       and                 got     out       onto       the     track       next        to     the      pitch via             the       open

gate.        I remember                 that       as    I was        getting           out       through          the       gate       there       was

a Policeman wearing                          a helmet           who    said        "Get       back       in y o u        b ^ s ^ a r d s .11

We    took       no    notice           of    him and went                 straight           onto       the       pitch.           The       match

had    stopped             by now a n d            there were              a fe w       other        supporters               on    the       pitch.

We    then went                over     the    goal          mouth and           sat     down.           We w e r e          having       a       laugh

because          we w e r e        sitting          on the           p i t c h a n d we           were       away       from       the

crowd       spillage.                          said          he wa s       in s o m e        pain       so    he    took       his       shoe       and

sock    of f      f r o m his           right       f oot.           I have        been a member                   of    the T e r r i t o r i a l

More    and more                people        came       onto        the     pitch while                we w e r e       sitting          in the

goal    mouth and                I also        became           aware        of a       lot       of a c t i v i t y         f r o m St       Johns

alright.              He       said     he was.              We w e r e      s t il l    in h i g h          spirits          at    this          time

through          the       goal       net     I could           see     genuine          panic          on    the       face       of    people

in the       pens          behind        me.        There        were        a    lot    of P o l i c e m e n           by    now stand in g

was    happening,                more    than just              a crowd             spillage.            We      both       got     up a n d

started walking                   around          the a r e a        of     the      goal       mouth.           We     then      saw     people

being        carried         on a d v e r t i s i n g          hoardings,                being     used       like       stretchers,                to

the    other         e n d of      the       ground.            We       thought          they were           injured          fans.           We

then     ran o v e r         towards             pen f i ve         to    see       if we       could       help        in a n y way.

While        we w e r e      outside             pen f i v e we           saw a          person       on a n a d v e r t i s i n g

know    exactly where                     we w e r e      going.            We      followed other                fans      who      were

carrying         hoardings                in t h a t      direction.                 W h e n we got          to    the        far    corner

while        we w e r e      running          back        somebody             said        " H e 's not      breathing."                  I

of    them were             just      walking              around       the       pitch      not    really knowing               what          to

                                                                          video' and/ohot ooraohs            of 'LMe

                I have       been shown a recent              photograph of the deceased ISLacry. BENNbi I ?

               B ody No 88,           taken at home,, and I can identify him as being                              the    person

                I described           in m y original         statement as a tt em pt in g            to revive and

                placing a leather             jacket      over his head whe n we failed to revive                          him.

                In my original             statement       1 stated that           I believed the deceased to have

                w orn a white shirt.              I think        now I must         have    been     confused because           I

                can defin i t el y         identify B arry BENN ET T as the one                    1 can remember

                                                                                                               S3206A



          I have        seen myself       on video Refs           MAP7    15.30.40.18,       and   I am engaged           in

cat       carrying a body on a hoarding                     towards       the S pion Kop.          I think at this

V   A t i m e     it was        the body of the deceased B arry Bfc.NNfc.Tl , but                    I cannot       be

          one hundred           per   cent    certain.



          I was     engaged       in t ra ns porting        two other          bodies    to the S pion Kop,         but    I

          nave    no     recollection of their              identities          or descriptions.



          I can recall           placing all         of the bodies            I dealt w i t h , i n c 1uding S arry

          BENNETT,        in the tunnel         between the Spion Kop and the N Stand.



          I have ma rk ed on a plan of the                      pitch by means          of three   blue dots

          indicated by numbers               1, 2,    3,    the    positions where          I had dealings          with

          B a rr y BENNETT.           P os it i on   1 is where         I first     saw the deceased.          He    had

          a l re ad y    been    placed on the hoarding and his                     face was    covered by a

          black     leather       bomber     jacket.        P os it i on 2 is where we          put the

          hoarding        down on the        pitch after          c a r r y i n g him from P os it io n 1.

          Some on e      had said that         he had stopped breathing,                  so we dec,iHuri—      —

          have a go at           reviving him.          I gave him m o u t h — to— m outh and.

          gave    him heart massage.                 We worked on him for about                ten ny^mtes,

          without       any success.           Someone      then    covered his head with the

          jacket and we           carried him across              the    pitch to the tunnel          between

          S pi on Kop and the N Stand,                P os it io n 3.          I now produce this        plan as

          Ref Nos               (Exhibit No                )«



          I have also seen a p hotograph of the d ec ea se d taken                             in the M o r t u a r y ,

          Ref Nos        88   (Exhibit No               ), and      can recognise          this as being       the

          deceased Barry BENNfc. FT, but                I cannot         be    iOO.4.

               On    page 8      (July)         I describe                a    policeman with whbm                                           had an

               that    this      wa s     a different                policeman                from       the    one whcx d i d         heart

               massage       as we        attempted             to    revive             him.

                         sp o k e .        For       my    part       I make             no    formal          complaint         against       that

               officer,        whoever          he    is,       nor       in     respect            of a n y      other        incidents       on       the

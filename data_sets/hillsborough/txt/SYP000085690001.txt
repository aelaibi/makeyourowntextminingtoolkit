             At about      11.00am this           date,     we were         taken by our G r o u p             Inspect/or,      Mr

T here was a steady            flow of buses all               day,     some 76 or so.                 Most    were

were    little     or no buses after 2.40.                   Almost all           of the N o t t i n g h a m

drabs who were          late.



At about      3.00pm,      our     Inspector       told us that we                had better            go and have

a meal,      so we    s 1owly made         our way to C l e a r w a y s Lane where                      the mobile

Inspector was          listening       to his      radio,       as    he said that            there a p p e a r e d

to be a problem at             the Leppings         Lane       e n / of the ground,                this,       the end

w hi c h had been a l l o c a t e d to L i v e r p o o 1 / S u p p o r t e r s . We were                not

required,       so we s lowly c a r r i e ^ on J^ar our                 refreshments.              We had only

gone a hundred yards               or s o , w h k / w e      were a g a i n halted.             Our      Inspector

said    that we all         had to make          haste      to L a p p i n g s   L a n e as a major             problem

had developed.          We went       quickly to our d e s t i n a t i o n and as we arrived,

just    short     of L e p p i n g s Lane,       I saw a large           group of Po l i c e O f f i c e r s

all    in rank file.         We were       put    in rank file and                iden t i f i e d an d        checked.

                    .ane.      Just    outside       these    doors       I saw two a m b u l a p / e s avid quite a few

                   persons       on the floor.           They a p p e a r e d    either        djead or unconscious and

                   some       injured quite          badly.       All a p p e a r e d to have         someone w ith them,            so

                   we went       into the a r e a        just      through the        gates.         There,    I saw quite a

                   large       crowd of s up p o r t e r s all mewing about.                    There were        injured      person*

                   all    over       the    place.    Some    unconscious,          some most          probably dead          or

                   ser i o u s l y    injured.       Wit h Pc      '1344 H a n s o n / we     just    gave all       the assistanes

                   was a male          person.        They    had just        come thro u g h         the tunnel       and    I could

                   see    by the size of the man that                      they were          struggling.        I ran and gave

                   a s s is ta n c e and we         carried him through             the       conse n t i n a gates where

                   medical       a ss is ta nc e was        given,,    I had a l r e a d y seen a young               lady on the

                   floor and was             being a tt e n d e d to by either                friends    of    relatives.          She

                   w o u ld    be about £0 years             of age and quite well                   made.    She was

                   uncons c i o u s and        I went       back    to assist.         The      people w ith her         requested

                   i mmediate medical               assistance.        I saw an a m b u l a n c e man,           I summoned         him

                   and we all          carried her          to an await i n g       ambulance,          at the side          of the

                   wire       fencing       outside    the    ground,       I can     remember         seeing a n      elde r l y man.

                   He was a p p ar en tl y dead and his teeth were                            on the floor at          the side of

                   his    head.       Also    near a wire          fence    I s/w a ma n about 20                plus and      he had

On                 gi ngerish hair,           he was        slimly buijA and he                had beeri cer t i f i e d as         dead v

               ,   by one of the             Doctors, lying          b^fiide him,         I    can remember          seeing a lad

                   hostile       to us       and spat at          us and    called us          murderers,       bastards       and

     1 ‘11         blamed us for             what    had happened.         There were          appeals        over   the tannoy

         &         for    calm and gradually,                all    the    injured      in sight were           taken outside

                   the    ground and made as                comfortable as we               could.     I put several          who were

                   not    so serious as             some agai n s t a wall          so that          they were       ready to be

picked up by ambulance.                 Near    to a wire      fence     on the other side of the

inlet doors were             several     dead bodies.         I saw a doctor            in casual

clothing and some            nurses      and a black         doctor and they were t r e ating or

trying       to treat      these   people       but   it was all       in vain.         It was       obvious         by

the    colour       of some of these           bodies    that they were            dead and some           had       ,

even    been      covered up.      We    then suddenly         came under          the s u p e r v i s i o r y o f
        litoif         /
Inspector S y b . e f e w ho told us           <about    12 or so officers)              to forrn/a cordon

a r o u n d the     bodies   to k eep them out           of view.      A while        later     someone

brought       some    barriers     and a tarpeline            sheet and this was               put    round the

bodies.       All    the time,     there were         s u pporters     in the upper            part of       the

s tand and they were            shout ing abuse at us.              Bystanders          kept    coming      up to

us and       called us names.           Whe n all     the    injured     had been e v e n t u a l l y

taken    to hospital,          transit      vans a n d a m b u l a n c e s    a r r i v e d and together

with    other       officers    I assisted        in the      removal        of   I think about          10 or

11    dead    bodies w hich we          placed    in these       vehicles         w hich we were         told

w o u ld be taken to the           gymnasium.         After    the bodies          had all      been taken

away,    we were       found by our         serial      S e r g e a n t and went      to the C a n t i l e n a

S t a nd for briefing.         Whi l s t    sitting      there,     Inspector Bateiaan cabled                    oui

Hospi t a l    to assist w i t h the arrival                of the overspill            of bodies.         We all

a g r e e d and were       taken there         by a transit       van.       On arrival        we were      told

by Inspector B at e m a n that             they were        not using        the hospital         mortuary

and we had to          return back         to C 1a y w h e e 1s Lane.        It was     by this      time

               At about          I J f f O Q am    (1100)    that    date,      I was      taken by the G roup

      O '      There was a steady                   flow of buses all              day,    spme     se v e n t y - s i x   or so.

               Most     were      full and o r d e r l y taut, to the                 latter       e n d , about       five a r r i v e d

whilst         it was moving               s t e a di ly      near      to the       ground.          There were              1.i 1 1 1 e

or no buses after 2.4 0                        prri (1440).             Almost all         Forest          suppo r t e r s         had

gone to the ground?                      there were              just    "dribs and            d r a b s ’ who were               late.

At about             3.00    pm     ( 1 5 0 0 ) , our       Inspector          told us that we had better                               go

and have a meal,                    so we slowly made                   our way to C l a y w h e e l s Ln,                   where       the

mo b i l e     canteen was             situated.             We were          halted on two occasions

whilst         the     Inspector           listened           to his      radio,        as he said there a p p e a r e d

to be a problem at                     the L e p p i n g s Ln end of the                   ground,          this       the        end

a l l o c a t e d to Liverpool                supporters.                We were        not     required,             so we        slowly

carried on for our                     refreshments.                 We had only gone                 100 yards              or    so

w h e n we were a gain halted.                             Our    Inspector         said that we had to make

haste        to the L e p pings Ln,                   as    there had d e v e l o p e d a major                     problem.             We

we nt qui ckIy t o our                   de s t i nat i on, and as we arrived,                            just      shor t of

L e p p in gs        L n , I saw a         1arge       group of Po 1 ice,               a 11    in rank f i 1e /                  We ware

We a pp e a r e d to be the                 last       to arrive at              this     time and the first                       to be

deployed.              I think         there were            two Serials            of us and we were                    taken to

the    co n c ertina          doors at the                 rear of L e p p i n q s       Ln.         Just       outside           these

doors        I saw two a m b u l a n c e s and quite a few                            p e r s o n s o n t h e f 1 o o r , they

a pp e a r e d       either       dead,     u n c o n s c i o u s or some           q u i t e badly             injured.           All

a p p e a r e d to have someone                  wit h them,             so we went            into the a rea just

t h ro ug h the gate.                  There      I saw quite a large                     crowd of supporters,                          all

m ul l i n g     about.           T he re ^ w e r e    injured          persons all            over       the     place,          some

a mbulanc es.               All    the    time we were               doing       this,     the s u pporters were

h ost i l e      to us,       and spat at              us,       calling       us    " Murderers" and                 " B astards"

a nd blamed us for what                       had happened.                   There were appeals                    over      the

tan n o y for          cairn, and g r a d ua ll y all                   the    injured         in sight were                 taken

outside       the ground and made as                 comfortable as we          could make         them.           i

put several           who were     not as      s e riously    injured as some against a wall,

so that       they were        ready to be        picked up by the ambulance.

Near     to a wire        fence    on the      other   side     of the     inlet door were               several

dead bodies,            I saw a doctor         in casual      clothes and a black              doctor         and

they were           treating    or trying       to treat      these     p e o p l e , but    it was all            in

vain.       It was obvious,          by the       colour     of some     of these       bodies,          that

they were           d e a d , and some    had bep-rr cove r ed u p »        We the n q radua 11 y came

under     the s up er vi s i o n    of\ Ijgrspector S YKES who            told us      (that w ould           be

about      12 or so of us)          to form a cordon a r o u n d the             bodies       to keep them

out    of view.          A while    later,      someone      brought     some barriers           and a

tarpau 1 i n sheet and this was                 put a r o u n d the     bodies.       All     1 1")e t im e

there were s upporters              i n the upper        part    of the     covered stand and                 they

were     shouting abuse at           us.       B y standers     kept    coming     up to us and

calling       us names.         When all       the   injured     had e v e n t u a l l y been taken             to

about     10 or       11 dead bodies          in the vehicles          and we were          to'ld they w ould

be taken           to the gymnasium.           After   the    bodies     had all       been taken away,

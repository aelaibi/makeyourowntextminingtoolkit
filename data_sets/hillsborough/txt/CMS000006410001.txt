FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT 1989: SUBMISSION TO MINISTERS ABOUT THE
NEED TO MAKE AN ORDER UNDER S. 11

I enclose the first draft of a submission to Ministers seeking
authority to prepare an Order under s .11 of the Football
Spectators Act 1989 directing the Football Licensing Authority
to include in licences, conditions as respects seating. As you
know there are legal difficulties in facilitating the wishes of
the FLA due to the inadequacies of the Act which was drafted to
serve a purpose markedly different from that to which we are nofc)
trying to apply it. We have discussed this at length.

The problem is very difficult to explain briefly but           in
sufficient detail to make it clear. While I would not claim that
the enclosed effort succeeds in explaining the legal niceties (it
doesn't) I am anxious that it does not become too        long or
convoluted.   I am not sure that Ministers need, or would wish,
to know all the fine details of the problems.       It should be
sufficient to convince them of the need to issue licences this
year, that this requires a s.11 Order which perforce has to be
general and wide, that it might be politically unwelcome to
devolve so much authority to the FLA, but we see no real danger
and recommend this solution.

I am also unsure whether it would be worthwhile adding a separate
paragraph summarising the difficulties of not authorising a s. 11
Order (could not issue licences this year, the football world
would interpret this as the beginning of a Government U-turn, the
FLA would be seriousfacompromised). I would welcome views on this
along with any comments on the draft as it* stands.

Could I have comments by 11 February please?

FOOTBALL SPECTATORS ACT 1989 - ORDER UNDER SECTION 11 DIRECTING
THE FOOTBALL LICENSING AUTHORITY (FLA) TO INCLUDE IN LICENCES
CONDITIONS AS RESPECTS SEATING


This submission seeks the Minister's approval to make an Order
under Section 11 of the Football Spectators Act 1989 directing
the FLA to include in licences conditions as respects seating.
This will enable the FLA to enforce the deadlines recommended by
Lord Justice Taylor for the elimination of standing accommodation
at Football League grounds which were accepted as Government
policy.


Background


2.       Following the publication of Lord Justice Taylor's Final
Report into the Hillsborough Stadium Disaster,                          the Government
decided        that   the    FLA   should    take   the   lead     in     ensuring   the
implementation of certain key recommendations concerning safety
at football grounds.  In particular:-


         (a)     operating    a    licensing   scheme     for    grounds      at which
                 designated football matches are played;
*
         (b)     advising ,the Government on the introduction of all­
                 seated accommodation at Football League grounds and
                 the     national       stadia        in     accordance       with       Taylor
                 recommendations 1-4; and,


         (c)     keeping     under       review            the     discharge        by     local
                 authorities       of their functions under the Safety of
                 Sports Grounds Act 1975 (Taylor recommendation 6(a)).


    3.   Unfortunately, the Football Spectators Act 1989 under which
    the FLA was set up, was introduced primarily to facilitate the
    introduction of the Football Membership Scheme.                       These plans were
    later changed but the effect of this                         is to try to implement
    revised Government policy (all-seated stadia) with legislation
    designed for another - completely different - purpose.                                  This
    presents several legal difficulties.


    4.   However,        while     local       authority           safety     certification
    procedures    will     remain       the    main    vehicle        for    ensuring       that
    football grounds are safe,                the FLA have only the             (not wholly
    suitable) Football Spectators Act to implement Government policy
    on all-seater stadia.          This they intend to do by means of their
    licensing function.


    5.   The   deadlines         laid   down     by    Taylor       and     which    now    form
    Government policy are:


         (a)     For the 1st and 2nd divisions of the Football League
                 and the National Stadia, standing accommodation must
                 be eliminated by August 1994;


         (b)     For the 3rd and 4th divisions of the Football League,
                 standing accommodation must be eliminated by August
                 1999.


    6.   The   Minister      is     aware      from    recent        news    coverage       that
    opposition from football clubs and some supporters is mounting
    to the imposition of these deadlines.                        However, press reports
that Lord Justice Taylor may have changed his mind about all­
seated requirement have been strongly denied          (by Lord Justice
Taylor himself).       But the Labour party indication that they may
review the Taylor recommendations if they are elected has added
heat to the debate.


7.     Consequently it is not only important that the FLA is given
the necessary powers for it to carry out its role effectively,
this   is vital   if    it is to maintain    its   credibility    at this
important stage in its development.


The Licensing Scheme and All-Seated Accommodation


8.     In accordance with public announcements,        the FLA wish to
issue licences in readiness for the start of the 1992/93 football
season.     This will entail sending out licence applications, the
form of which has yet to be determined, within in the next few
weeks.    There is therefore, a degree of urgency in this matter.


9.     The intention is to maintain the pressure on clubs to meet
the Taylor deadlines by calling for individual business plans
(showing how and when all-seated accommodation will be achieved
and funded) with the licence applications.           It was originally
envisaged that where business plans were not furnished, or where
such plans were inadequate, the FLA would threaten to withhold
licences.


10.    Unfortunately, there are legal difficulties involved in this
due to our now trying to use the 1989 Act for a purpose different
from that for which it was designed.          However,   the FLA still
intend to seek business jyfcsaas, as a separate request from the
licence application.       They could not now abandon this without
seriously compromising their credibility.          Nor could they defer
licensing     without    the   football   world    interpreting     it   as
backtracking and^weakenincf^the Government's resolve especially
                   A
at this time with the growing lobby trying to get Government to
review their policy or extend the timescales.             But     they are
working in concert with the Football Trust and the Football
League who require        the same   information       and no problems          are
anticipated in obtaining the required information.



The Need For a Section 11 Order

11.    Section 11 of the 1989 Act empowers the Secretary of State
to direct the FLA by Order to include in any licence a condition
imposing      requirements   as   regards   the   seating     of   spectators.
Requirements or conditions relating to seating cannot be included
in the licensing procedures until this is done.               To do so would
render     the    procedures      vulnerable      to     judicial        review.
Nonetheless,      because of the     inadequacies       of   the Act and the
wording of it an Order under s. 11 as respects seating is required
before licences to admit spectators can be granted.


Other Considerations

 12.     Sections 11(4) and (5) of the 1989 Act require that before
a direction is given the FLA must be given the opportunity to
make recommendations.          Before making any such recommendations,
 the FLA must      consult    the local     authority    in whose        area    the
 premises affected by the Order are situated.


 13.     Because of   this requirement no specific direction could
 reasonably be given in respect of licences to be issued by August
 1992.     Any such Order must therefore,          of necessity,         be very
 general.


 Scope of a Section 11 Order

 14.     Given that an Order is required for licences to be issued
 this year, and faced with the difficulties of directing the FLA
 to    make    specific   conditions   regarding        seating     as   respects
 particular premises,        the Order^ will have to be very broad and
 general.        The only way                this would be         to virtually
 reproduce the wording of section 11 by directing the Authority
 to:
.   .   ^




*
                   "include      in    licences    to    admit     spectators           to    specified
                   premises (which would include all 93 league clubs listed in
                   a schedule)        conditions imposing requirements as respects
                   seating of spectators at designated football matches at the
                   premises ..." I b W


            This   may    be     politically       unacceptable        because          it    devolves
            considerable authority to the FLA.                    While it would be possible
            to vary such an Order, it is doubtful whether it could be revoked
            at some future date.


            15.    But this is unlikely to cause difficulties since the FLA has
            been set up to by Government to implement Government policy on
            all-seating.        Moreover, more general policy (eg the 'Next Steps'
            initiative) is to move away from central control towards greater
            autonomy     for non-departmental public bodies                    such as the FLA.
            Indeed, it may be advantageous for Government, having decided the
            all-seating policy, to distance                  themselves      slightly         from the
            direct application of it.


            Summary and Recommendations


            16.    Ministers      are    therefore        recommended        to     authorise       the
            preparation     of    an    Order     under      Section    11     of       the   Football
            Spectators Act in the broad general terms to allow the FLA the
            maximum possible discretion to implement Government policy on
            all-seated stadia in line with agreed timescales.


            17.    Should the Minister accept these proposals,                          arrangements
            will   be    made    for    the   Order     to   be    drafted     and       laid    before
            Parliament     at    the    earliest      convenient       date.        A    Ministerial
            statement will also be prepared so that the decision may be
            announced at that time.

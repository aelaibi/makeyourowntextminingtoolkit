END   Of   R E P O R 1"
REPORT BY PHILLIP NORMAN FOSTER. POLICE CONSTABLE 1734


I commenced duty at Doncaster DHQ Saturday 15th April 1989,
at 0830 for duties as a member of serial 26, to police the football             semi
final at Hillsborough, Sheffield.  In charge of this serial was
PS 2620 Cropley.


We travelled to Sheffield via PSV and paraded in the ground
along with all other officers working the match.  the duties of
my serial was to patrol in pairs on Catchbar Lane from its junction
with Leppings Lane, along the length of the ground(with the river
Don in between) to the main road at the bottom of the ground.


This duty allowed us to see both the Notts Forest supporters and the
Liverpool fans.  I worked together with PC 1789 Flatman.  No
incidents occurred of any significance until around 1300.  We were at
the furthest extent of our 'beat' when we noticed a large group of
Liverpool supporters, lingering on the shop fronts, close to the
Leppings Lane entrance to the ground.   It is difficult to estimate
numbers but I would say at least 50 to 70 supporters were stood
around or sat on walls.  They were all drinking alcohol.  it was
evident that large quantities had been already consumed judging from
the empty cans and bottles strewn around.

Yet more fans were arriving and they all headed for the 'Willis
Discount' Supermarket.  We went to investigate what was happening
inside, intent on speaking with the Manager.

As we reached the s h o p fi the M a n a g e r 'named I recall Ian) met us at
the door.  He requested our assistance to control a number of
Liverpool fans who were inside the store. He asked us to reinforce
his rule that fans were only allowed to buy one can or bottle.
I explained this to about 20 supporters who replaced armfuls of
bottles and cans of beer etc and just bought one item each.              The
fans moaned a little but they accepted what was said.

As I entered the store I noticed that the majority of the members of
staff were in the licensed section of the supermarket, which had
been partially screened by moveable screens to restrict entrance and
exit.  The manager informed us that he had already had trouble from
fans and we sugessted that he shut his doors to prevent a recurrence.

The Manager initially stood at the door with PC 1789 and myself
and we turned supporters away by only allowing regular customers
to enter.  The flow of rejected fans increased and after about 30
minutes outside the shop, two other officers took over from us and
we continued patrol.  (Iunderstand that soon after we left the
Manager locked the doors as had been suggested.)

We walked to the other end of Leppings Lane and stood watching the
Notts Forest fans arrive.  One memorable incident was when a
number of obviously drunken fans crossed the junction with Catchaar
                               -2-


Lane and the main road.  They were messing around on the junction
itself when one of the group fell; he was unable to get his hands
to the ground and slid along the tarmac road surface on the left
hand side of his face.  When he was helped to his feet, he was
laughing but the side of his face was badly graized and bleeding.
It was not long after this that PS Cropley came to us and said that
we were needed at the other end of our beat, with the Liverpool
supporters.  As we arrived at the Leppings Lane, Catchbar Lane
traffic lights I saw that it was extremely busy.  Large groups of
supporters were stood near these lights.  Many were asking for
spare tickets, and some were walking against the flow of supporters,
trying to buy tickets.

I had words with a middle aged man I had seen at the other end of
the ground.   I had seen him buy a ticket from a supporter who said
that his friend was unable to attend the match.   The middle aged
man paid face value for the ticket (£7.50 I believe).
I saw this man again dealing in tickets at the Liverpool end of
the ground.   I believed him to be a tout.  I went to him and the
group of supporters around him.   I told him in no uncertain terms
to remove his presence from the corner where he was stood and what
I thought he was doing was diabolical.   At that time a large bottle
exploded in the centre of the road (after being thrown from a
large group of youths stood on the other side of the road)   I left
the man with instructions that he should leave.   Whilst I was
clearing the glass from the road the man came to me attempting to
explain that on this occasion he was only swopping the ticket with
another.  I did not believe himbut said it was time for him to
leave anyway.

Around this time I overheard an order over the radio which was
carried by PC 1789(him being at that time a cummunity constable
who are issued with their own).  This order was for traffic to be
stopped from entering Leppings Lane because of the number of fans
streaming down the road and congregating outside the entrance to
the ground.

I along with PC 2354 Plumridge, PC 184 Geeson,   PC Harratt and
1?C Flatman stopped traffic. Many local residents and taxi drivers
showed their resentment to this action.  Buses were allowed through.

I remember a mounted officer assisting us remove the fans from clogging
the junction.  He spoke to them in their own accent and they responded
to him (and the size of his horse.)

I was still employed with traffic directions when I saw a bit of
a skermish, with a police transit driving away containing PS Cropley
plus arrested fan.
By now it was nearing kick off time, the junction had been cleared
of the fans who had been trying to buy tickets,    they presumeably
were in the large crowd outside the Leppings Lane entrance.    The
numer of supporters arriving grew.    They were all travelling across
the crossroads, straight into Leppings Lane itself.    I would say
that all these persons had been drinking.    They displayed all the
associated signs normally seen of persons that had been drinking
heavily.  They were shouting, swearing, chanting their allegience
to Liverpool.    There was however an amount of urgency with these
people.  Nothing unusual, the normal desire for people not to be
late for an e v e n t .

I could not even try to estimate the number of these folk all I can
say is that both pavements and the whole of the road was filled by
these supporters.  Traffic attempting to cross the crossroads were
often held up to allow the more determined fans across.
The point arrived when we were discussing if we should reopen the
road for traffic.  The fans were all off Leppings Lane and none
were crossing the junction.  The other officers and I were all
huddled around PC Flatman's radio.  I overheard someone ask for
for the gate to be opened.  I remember it must have been urgent
because of the tone of the man's voice.

I then heard a request for all available officers to attend the
cinder track inside the ground.   Our job stopping traffic was
completed and so along with the officers already mentioned, we
ran to the ground.  As we entered I saw a line of police horses
to our left.  A few people were milling around but not many.   Someone
banged on the blue concertina type gates and we were admitted.
Luckily an officer who knew his way around the ground led us to
the right of the Lepping Lane stand and we queued along a very narrow
passageway for a few seconds.   We then went straight onto the cinder
track infront of the Leppings Lane stand.

On my arrival I saw a small gate had been opened in the perimeter
fence and that people were emerging from this tiny hole.   I also
saw fans were being pulled up from the standing area into the
seated area.  No one was co ordinating any rescue attempt.   Fans
were pushing trying to get to the fence to climb over or to the
entrance.  I helped pull some through the hole.  At first they were
what I would describe as 'walking wounded' I directed them to the
left side of the pitch(when facing the Leppings Lane Stand) to
some St.Johns Ambulance members.

More and more fans were pushing towards the small hole in the fence.
This confusion was slowing them from leaving.  PC Flatman said he
was going into the stand to try and regulate the fans leaving
through the fence.  He went against the flow of fans and I was set
to follow when a man was passed through.  He was obviously very
badly injured.  I assisted in carrying him onto the pitch.  Along
wirn a StlCJonns of Rea Cross man, after making an initial
                                                                          <   ZJtf

examination, it was apparent that he was not breathing, nor was
there any sign of a pulse.  I adminstered heart massage whilst the
other man commenced mouth to mouth.   As we did this other persons
were placed close by.  PC Harratt was working on reviving another
man and PC Geeson had a boy or youth.

I know that at sometime PC Harrattassisted me with my casualty,
also two young St.Johns girls came and helped.           I distinctly remember
continuing mouth to mouth with my patient whilst I was feeling for
a pulse from the man whom PC Harratt was working on.            I did not
detect any signs of life.        In a last ditch effort with my patient
I took as deep a breath as I could and blew into the man's month.
I saw his chest i n f l a t . _________________________________

___________ I continued both mouth to mouth and heart massage I thought
 I felt a slight flicker of a pulse around the same time as a number
of Lverpool fans arrived with an advertising hoarding.     I made the
decision that if this man was to stand any sort of chance he needed
 immediate medical attention of the sort I was not able to give.

Before this moment in time I was able to see PC G eeson w o rking on
reviving his young patient.  Eventually the youth            | and his
airways were cleared.  A doctor placed an airway in his mouth and
I saw PC Geeson keeping him on his side.   I am not too sure what
happened to the young man but I remember PC Geeson and PC Harratt
helping me take my casualty off the pitch.   We did not know where
to go.  There was no one to ask.  I guessed that if there was any
help to be gained for the man then it might be near the gym.      I also
argued that there might be less confusion at the other side of the
ground.  It was for these reasons that we headed through a growing
sea of people on the pitCx..

As we slowed from running to negotiate the exit from the pitch,
I remember seeing the hatred on the faces of the Notts Forest supporters
who were in the stand directly opposite the Leppings Lane stand.
They were shouting and goading the Liverpool fans I was with and
the ones directly in front of us.  They were calling them scouse
bastards and making similar derogatory remarks.  It was then that
whilst we were being held up from leaving the pitch, while carrying
the man on the hoarding that we were spat upon.  It was too much
for the fans helping in front of us. Two or three reacted and nearly
dropped their patient onto the floor.  I virtually screamed at them
to ignore what was happening and to concentrate on helping their man.

We left the pitch to find further confusion.  No one was
co ordinating what we should do or saying where to go.   I saw the
back doors of an ambulance open and without further ado I thrust
my patient into the rear of the vehicle.  I explained quickly what
had happened to the crew.


The fans with the hoarding we had used returned to the pitch and
when I had finished with the crew PC's Geeson and Harratt had
disappeared.

In an attempt to assist with the reception of the casualties I entered
the gym.  It was only then that the scale of the disaster became
evident.  Two or three bodies were in the gym and a man with ginger
hair (in civilian clothes) came to me and said that it was imperative
that someone stay at the door directing dead persons straight on
and injured into the middle of the gym.

I did this for some time trying to cope with the narrowness of the
gym doors.  A sergeant took over from me and I carried an injured
man into the middle section of the gym.  I was able to render first
aid and reassurance to him and eventually three other men.

When doctors started to arrive and medical supplies I was able to
act as assistant when introveinous drips were placed in the arms
of patients.

I do not know how long I worked in the gym but I saw it fill with
injured and them empty of them after their initial treatment.  I
also saw the number of bodies increase.  A similar number of senior
officers were in the gym apparently talking.

At 1730 I lookedat my watch and as I left the gym I received my
first instruction since the tragedy began to go and sit in the stand.
I walked into the playing area and walked across the pitch to recover
my helmet.  After examining a large pile (and providing fodder for
the hunting photographers) I recovered it.

I have tried to recall this event chronologically for the most part
it is.  The only section I could not swear to is the order in which
the fans disappeared from view on Leppings Lane and the message
to open the gates.

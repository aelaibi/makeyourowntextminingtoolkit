                                                             10 September 1990




Dear Sir

HILLSBOROUGH - COMPLAINTS AGAINST POLICE

Acting on the advice of the Police Complaints Authority, which was received
today, I have arranged for all reports, statements, documents, video films
and other supporting evidence to be transported to South Yorkshire Police
Headquarters during theafternoon of 10 September1990.

The    reports relate to complaints made   by various   members   of the   public
against the following officers:-

      Chief Superintendent DUCKENFIELD
      Superintendent MURRAY
      Superintendent MARSHALL
      Sup e r int endent GREENWOOD
      Police Constable ILLINGWORTH
      Police Constable        SMITH

Your Police Authority is already in possession of my report and supporting
documents in respect of Mr Walter JACKSON, your Assistant Chief Constable.

When you are ready I shall be willing to come to see you to discuss the
matter further. You, or your representative, will wish to confirm with the
Police Complaints Authority (Captain Noel TAYLOR) when you have received
the reports, etc.

I do not intend to make any announcement to the press, media or otherwise
because the press releases made to date seem to cover the matter.

I understand that the South Yorkshire Police Authority will consider the
file in respect of Mr JACKSON on Friday 14 September 1990, and although it
is likely that no decisions will be made at that time, you may consider it
prudent to liaise with the Clerk to the Police Authority about that.
H M Coroner is aware that the files will be with you shortly and you will
be aware that he intends to reconvene the adjourned inquests in the near
future. The Coroner’s Officer is Mr Mervyn JONES, Deputy Chief Constable
of the Cheshire Constabulary, and you may wish to liaise with him about
that matter.

If I can be of any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact
me.  When you consider the time is right I know that Captain TAYLOR of the
PCA will be willing to join me and you in Sheffield to discuss matters
arising.

Yours faithfully




Chief Constable
Investigating Officer

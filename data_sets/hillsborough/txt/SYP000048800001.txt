         HILLSBOROUGH INQUESTS

         The Inquests into how the ninety-five met their deaths have been concluded
         today and adjourned sine die. The Inquests passed without too much
         difficulty and there are no issues outstanding.

         Whilst at the hearings I took the opportunity of advising the solicitors
         for the Hillsborough Steering Group and the barristers for Sheffield
         Wednesday Football Club, the Police Federation and South Yorkshire Police,
         that I was departing from the investigation with effect from this
         afternoon. I assured them that in your taking command on 1 April 1990
         there had been no loss of momentum or continuity in the overall
         investigation.

         As you know I return to the Police Staff College with effect from Tuesday,
         8 May to take up my full time responsibility for the Senior Command Course.
         Can I assure you that if you need any help or wish to explore any
         particular avenues with me you only have to make contact. I will give you
         every assistance I can. Furthermore, in Detective Chief Superintendent
         Foster and Superintendents Taylor and Beechey and their staff, you have a
         first class team of loyal, dedicated and efficient investigators. I am
         sure they will give you their support which I have enjoyed over the past
         twelve months.

         In closing, may I take this opportunity to wish you and the investigation
         good luck, albeit I know you will not need it.

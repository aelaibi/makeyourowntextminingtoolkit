^                INTERIM STATEMENT RELATING TO A COMPLAINT AGAINST
                      AN OFFICER OF THE SOUTH YORKSHIRE POLICE
(                                 BY MR S P HENDRY


    Following the tragedy at the Hillsborough stadium on 15 April 1989 Mr S P Hendry made
    the following complaints against PC P E Smith:-

        He (Mr Hendry) was getting crushed and could not breathe properly, so together
        with others he screamed at a policeman standing at the Gate numbered 3 who was
        facing the crowd, "Open the gate let us out". Mr Hendry says the policeman waved
        his arms and shouted "push back, push back", but would not open the gate:

        That when some supporters climbed onto the perimeter fence the same policeman
        grabbed one unknown person by the collar and belt and pushed him back over the
        fence into Pen 3.

    The m atter was referred to the Police Complaints Authority under Section 87(l)(a)(i) of
    th e Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The Authority decided to supervise the
    investigation under Section 89(l)(a) of the Act and approved the appointment of Chief
    C o n stab le L Sharp of th e C um bria C o n stab u lary as the In vestigating O ffic e r.
                                      t

    The overall investigation has examined 9560 questionnaires, 5341 statem ents, 2392 sets
    of docum ents including 71 hours of video reco rd in g s, 2411 photographs and the
    transcripts of the 174 persons who gave evidence to the Lord Justice Taylor enquiry.

    The Investigating Officer's final report covering these complaints was received by
    Authority on 2 August 1990. The report was supported by 109 statem ents, video
    recordings of the events taking place, photographic evidence, plans of the stadium,
    together with copies of video recordings and transcripts of the interviews with PC P E
    Smith.

    The complaints have been thoroughly investigated to the satisfaction of the Police
    Complaints Authority.

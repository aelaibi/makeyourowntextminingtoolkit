Dear Member

BUDGET SEMINAR ; 7 JANUARY 2000

I hope everyone had a good Christmas and that you all survive the Millennium. I am
writing with an outline of what we are planning to present to you at next Friday’s seminar.
It will fall broadly into four sections:-

A:           The budget background

•       National trends

             •   recap on 2000/2001 settlement
             •   future expenditure prospects - implications for Police Authorities

•       Key issues for South Yorkshire 2000/2001

•       Position statement

             •   recent budget/Council tax trends
             •   reserves and provisions - current status

•       Budget guidelines and options 2000/2001

•       Capping/Council tax benefit subsidy

B:           Detailed Budget and Capital Programme Options
             (excluding future options on Hillsborough)

•       1999/2000 outturn
•       Base budget 2000/2001
•       Development options
•       3 year revenue forecast
•       Potential savings
C:      Hillsborough

•    Impact on the forecasts
•    Options

D:      Strategy

•    Spending levels
•    Financing options
•    Council tax levels

As you see, we will include current forecasts on Hillsborough (both legal and insurance
costs) within the base, but deal with future options as a separate issue. By the time that
the precept has to be set - 28 February - we should have a clear idea on the trial costs
and the tax issue, and how these will affect the budget strategy for 2000/2001.

Yours sincerely



Bill Wilkinson
Clerk and Treasurer

CAPPING - DETR GUIDANCE
The Government hopes not to use these powers.
. Local Authorities have the responsibility to set their
  Council Taxes responding to local circumstances in the
  light of the Government’s spending plans and in a
  substantial increase in grants for local government. The
  Government expects that Authorities will behave
  responsibly when setting their budget requirements and
  Council Tax. However they are prepared to use these
  powers to protect local taxpayers in Authorities where
  Council Tax rises unacceptably.”

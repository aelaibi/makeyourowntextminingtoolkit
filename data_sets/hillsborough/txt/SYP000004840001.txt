numerous       other Liverpool           Football     Fans,     /he         bus stopped         in L ep pings

                 police officer.

                 Up on    entering    the ground        I looked to the           rear of the West S tand and

                 saw a tunnel,        above     the    tunnel a card bearing the               letter      ’A" was on the

                 right     hand side      of the      tunnel and a card bearing               the    letter       *B ’ was

        I was    forced onto          the Ae-fl hand side            of the terrace whi ch I now

        identify as          'Pen 4* .» The         terrace was       very tightly        packed and where            I

        came    to    rest after       the surge was          half way down the t e r r a c e .              Where

        I came to       rest    I was       facing    the West S tand with my back               to^the       pitch.

        A fter a few minutes            I m a n ag ed to turn         round to face t h ^ ^ i tch.

        was    just    kicking       off.

        P eo p l e were      being    pressed up tightly to me,                people were       screaming and

        shouting       trying to get space.                 1 was having       diffi cu lt y breathing          as

        people were          pushing agai ns t me.            The heat     coming      up from below me was

        tremendous.           A number       of   people around me were              fainting and Jurying to

        get o u t .     I cannot       say whether          I saw    people    die    it was     panoemonium.

        I realised that my             life was       in danger and        I panicked,         I /fas almost

        certain that          I was    going      to die.      I was    having       d ifficulty b reathing           I

        felt    that my       1ungs were about          to cave       is/ due to the tremendous amount

        of pressure          be i ng e xc elled on my body           p y sur roundi ng fans.

        I realis ed that         I was       fighting       for\lirfe   I forced my way I went

        through       the    crowd towards          the front       of the terrace.         I kept

        screaming       ’Get    out my way          I want    to get out *.          In my^pa ni c     I realised

        I was going          the wrong way          I was    t o t a 1ly disorientated.          Someone

        shouted       *You * re go i ng the wrong w a y ' and             po i nted A a    the stand and

        tunnel.        1 turned       round and       I fought my way tckythe tunnel.                   During

        the struggle          I lost my       right    shoe.        I w al k e d through the tunnel a

        quarter       of the tunnel          near    the exit to the terrace was full                   of

        fans still          standing watch in g        the match,       this    part of the tunnel was

      I left the ground at 3 .1 0 p m                 (1510).      Because       I had lost my/right                    shoe

      I took my           left shoe    off and walked           in stocking              feet.

      I made my way back to the terrace                        t urnstiles where               I saw a

      p o 1i cewoman who           pointed to a        ’P o r t a c a b i n ’ type       b u i 1d i ng     and told me

      to take a pair of shoes,                 there was a couple              of pairs            there. I took                  a

      pair      of black        lace up shoes.          I only took the shoes with the

      p ermission of the             police    officer.         I have       since thrown these                   shoes

      a wa y    I only needed them to get home.

      I w a l k e d straight         back    to w h e r e _______had        parked the vehicle,                   as    I

      w a l k e d up 1 saw fifteen            police officers              standing         in Leppings Lane.

      They must have had a radio message as they all                                     ran off towards               the

      ground.            1 stopped one of them and spoke                    to him I told him about                         the

      problem          in the ground and that             I thought         people wee           dead.       He    ran and

      joined his           colleagues.

      During my visit              to and from the ground - and                  including               the time       I was

      a c t ua l l y     in the ground I did not see anyone                    commit a criminal                   offence,

      It was 5 . 1 5 pm (1715)            before we all         regrouped then we all                      drove       home       I

      returned           in the Red Nis sa n Mi c ra Saloon. 0/fe thing                       I can recollect was

      that while           I was    standing     in    'Pen 4*         /             .                        I        t/

     and the           crush was at       its height       I noticed a police officer                        inSfae J

      seating          tier of the West S tand just jfbove me                    I shouted,                "Please help

      us'      he could see that            something 'Mas/wr on g and he radioed for

      assistance.              A lot of     people around me were also                      shouting and asking

      for assistance.

      1 can add nothi ng mo re that would be r e 1evant                              to the enquiry               into       this

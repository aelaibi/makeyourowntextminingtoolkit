We    drove       from                               towards          Sheffield                Wednesday's             football            ground

along       Middlewood                R d A s        we       were    unable          to       turn       from       Middlewood            Rd

into       Leppings          Ln                dropped          in M i d d l e s w o o d            Rd    and    we    started          to /wa1 k

 own       Leppings          Ln.




As    we    walked          we    noticed           that       all    the       shop          door       ways    had       empty       beer

cans       and    bottles             in a n d      as    we    walked          down          Leppings          Ln    we    saw      that        a

large       crowd       had       already           gathered          outside             of    the       ground       the      tiffie at

T o qe t h e r w i t h                   I joined             the    queue          for       the    turnstiles             roughly             where

the      b r id g e    e nds      n ea re s t       to    g ro u n d .




AlthfiTOrgh       I cannot              estimate          how       many       people          were       waiting          outside         the

      1e area          outside           the       ground       was       a mass          of    people.




The      crowd        were       acting        in    a    disorderly                behaviour             ie    pushing         and

jostling          and       swearing           that       although             we    had       seating          tickets         for     the

West       End    stand          we    decided           to    walk       to    the       Penistone             Rd    end    to      try        and

gain       admission             so    we    could        get       away       from       the       queuing          fans.




we         arted       to    walk        away       but       the    time       element             was    such       that      we     decided

that       if    we    did       not     stick       it       out    we    wouldn't             get       into       the    match       on       time

so    we    returned             to    our     original             position.




The      time     at    this          stage        was    approximately                   a    quarter          to    three       pm    ( '14413

hrs)       and    at    this          time     I    could       see       fans       climbing             the    perimeter             fen c e, to

gain       access       to       the     ground          without          paying.              I a 1 so        seen    fa n s     c 1 im   'a   ing

over          the    bridge           and    dropping            onto       the       bank       and    then        climbing

another             fence        to    gain       entrance        .


The       crowd          had     at    this       stage         got    even        bigger         the    Police         or      the       stewards

were          attempting              to    control        the        flow       of    people          into     the     area         before          the

  ^ r n s t i 1 es         by    opening          and    closing            the       perimeter          fence.




Although             I did        not       t&ke    particular               notice          of    the      police         or       stewards          I

          o              f f i ce r a n d     his       horse         were       pinned      against            a   spiked           railed          fence

     d    I    remember           watching          and         thinking           that      any       minute        either          the

officer             or     the    horse       was       going         to    be     impaled         on     the       spiked          fence.




The       officer           managed          to    get      out       of    T.ne      corner       and     move       away          from       the

fence          to    the        other       side    of      the       corrugated             iron       fence        separating                the

At       this       stage           I was         really frightened                          by     what I       saw and             heard       be;cause

I       had    never          been       in       such         as i t u a t i o n        before,,

The        whole         of     the      area        was       full          of     fans      rushing        around             who       were    not

                all    around          these        people          were        living      people           who      were       crying      and were

                0 b v iously          d i st r a s s e d      and       i n s hock.

                I eventually                left        the    ground           and    walked         back       to                                           0n«

             the    flare      gave      off    a   red    glow       like       a    fireball.          The   mini   bus    drove       off

             and    the    f ans      ran a f t e r    it.

             I can      honestly         say    that       I feared         for       my    own   safety.

            Hillsborough               Football        Ground,         Sheffield,          to w a t c h        the S e m i    Fi n a l

            between          Liverpool         and     Nottingham           Forest.

            We     a r r i v e d at     the    Leppings          Lane    entrance          at    around 2.35            pm    (1435)          and

            th e     crowd was          massed        around      the    entrances.

            The      outer        perimeter         gates    were       c l o s e d at     this      t im e     and    du e   to     the

            pressure             of   the    crowd     they a p p e ar ed       to    be      bending          with    the    c r u sh

            against          them.

            A mounted Police                  Officer       was a t t e m p t i n g      to     co n t r o l    the    crowd and           the

            horse      was        pinned      against       the       spiked    fence,          this     particular           one    was

            down      in the          right    hand     corner        and     the    officer         who       had a m ou s ta ch e           wa s

            having         great       difficulty        staying         on    his    h or s e .

            The      crowd were             being     abusive         towards       him and a c t i n g          like    a    pack       of

           wild animals             in    their      attempts         to   ge t    into    the    ground.

           I am      not a     football          fan      but w a s    disgusted          with    the    behaviour        of    the   so

           called          fans.

           I did        not   see    the       Police      do a n y t h i n g     wrong,       they were       just    overwhelmed

           by    th e      massive       crow d.

           After        the   match       had    been      stopped         I walked       back    to

           and     there      discussed with                                      what    had    happened.        I then        saw a

           iroup of y o u t h s           in                               one     of    these    youths       then    f i r e d an

           emergency          flare       g u n at     a blue      minibus.             I do    not    know who       these     youths

           were      and which           team    they      supported.             The    flare    hit    the    minibus        and

           just      bounced        off,       the   vehicle       drove        off     with    these    youths       chasing

           after        it.

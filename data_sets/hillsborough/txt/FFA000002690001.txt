Dear Councillor Chase,


                           Hillsborough


      Thank you for your letter of 15th May.
               £
      I would like to be able to help you by attending the
public meeting on 25th May, but I am afraid I am not
prepared to duplicate the work already being undertaken by
The Football Association for Lord Justice Taylor's Inquiry.

      I am sorry I am not in a position to attend. You may
be aware that I responded fully to the public debate in the
immediate aftermath of the disaster - but I will, of course,
be pleased to receive any relevant information which the
“Hillsborough Working Party" wishes to pass on.




                         Yours sincerely,




                         Chief Executive

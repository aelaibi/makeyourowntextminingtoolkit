              that    public houses                some   distance      from the        ground had       large numbers        of

              footbal l       fans     congregating           outside      drinking,        they were wearing           red and

              white    football         regalia and           I took them to be L i verpool                 fans,    being on

              the N o r t h e r n side of the               city,    at this time           I saw no sign of any

              trouble     though the d r i n k e r s were               boisterous.

There       were        also      a large           number          of       people          walking          the      streets           carrying

cans       and    bottles          of     drinks.                  As    tha/kick             off       time      approached              at       about

1430       hours        I noti ced            that       large          groups          of    fans       w e re     making          their          way

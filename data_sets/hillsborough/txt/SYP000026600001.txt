DEAR SIR,                             LuN u u N, 19TH APRIL,   1989


IN THE WAKE uF THE TRAGIC 'c.VENTo AT HILLb'BuROUGH I COULD NO
LONGER SIT STILL AND HIDE MY ANGER. ANGER BECAUSE SO MANY TIMES
COULD THIS TRAGEDY HAVE HAPPENED BEFORE.
THIS IS NEITHER MEANT TO BE AN 111 TOLD YOU SO" LETTER NOR MEANT
TO BE A LETTER TO EXPRESS WISDOM AFTER THE EVENT. MAYBE THIS
LETTER h H u ULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN EARLIER ALTHOIJGH I FEAR NO ONE
WOULD HAVE TAKEN ANY NOTICE.

EARLIER THIS SEASON I ATTENDED A LEAGUE GAME AT THE DEN BETWEEN
MILLWALL AND ARSENAL. AS AN ARSENAL SEASON TICKET HOLDER I WAS
ABLE TO OBTAIN A TICKET FOR THE TERRACES AT THE END DESIGNATED
FuR THE VISITING SUPPORTERS. THIS PART WAS WELL FILLED WITH
ARSENAL SUPPORTERS BUT -TO BE FAIR- NOT OVER CROWDED. TWO
TICKET CHECKS WERE MADE IN ORDER TO PREVENT NON TICKET HOLDERS
T*J GET ANYWHERE NEAR THE TURNSTILES'. IN MY OPINION THE DOUBLE
L-HEcK OUGHT TO BE INTRODUCED IN THE FUTURE FOR ALL "ALL TICKET
GAMES”. THIS HAS' BEEN COMMON PRACTISE AT GAMES IN EUROPE FOR
YEARS.

THE PROBLEM OCCURED AFTER THE FINAL WHISTLE. AS IS THE CUSTOM
THESE DAYS' FOR PREVENTING CROWD TROUBLE, THE VISITING SUPPORTERS
WERE HELD BACK FOR A WHILE IN ORDER TO HAVE OTHER PARTS OF THE
GROUND CLEARED FIRST. AS THIS TOOK LONGER THAN ANNOUNCED OVER
THE PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM THE CROWD BECAME RESTLESST
I WAS STANDING RIGHT OPPOSITE THE ROW OF POLICEMEN BLOCKING THE
EXIT DOOR. PEOF'LE -MYSELF INCLUDED- STARTED TO PLEAD TO OPEN THE
SOLITARY GATE OF THAT AREA AS THE PUSHING FROM THE CROWD -WHO
GREW MORE RESTLESS ALL THE TIME- BECAME MORE APPARENT AND
FRIGHTENING.
THE RESPONSE OF THE POLICEMEN WAS THAT OF DECIDING EITHER TO
IGNORE THE PLEAS OR TO GRIN AT US. THE SITUATION GOT WORSE AND
WORSE. PEOPLE STARTED TO SHOUT AT THE POLICE. AGAIN NO RESPONSE.
IN THE END BECAUSE OF THE PUSHING FROM A FEW THOLiSAND PEOPLE
FROM BEHIND THE GATE WAS FORCED OPENED. THE POLICE AND PEOPLE
STANDING IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THEM WERE UNINTENTIONALY USED
Ay ■"TUULS" Tu r URCE THE GA !E OPENED1. SOME GRINNING POLICEMEN
DISAPPEARED BELuW OUR STIJMyLING BODIES. A GENTLEMAN WHO WAS
STANDING NEXT TO ME FELL OVER AND HURT HIS ARM. I GOT OUT AFTER
HIM. WHAT HAPPENED TO OTHERS I DO NOT KNOW. WHAT I REMEMBER VERY
CLEARLY WAS THAT I STUMBLED THROUGH THE GATE INTO A LINE OF
POLICEMEN WAITING OUTSIDE THIS GATE.
BY THAT TIME I WAS SO ANGRY AND SO SHAKEN THAT.-'I' SHOUTED AT THE
FIRST POLICEMAN I. SAW. I REMEMBER MY WORDS AND REACTION VE.%
WELL, i .SA'iD Tu. HIM iHAT TU KEEP THE GATES' SHUT FOR SO LONG" WAS
STUPID AND PEOPLE COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED IN THERE. T H E POLICEMAN
ONLY ASKED ME WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AND GRINNED WITH THE SAME
GRIN AS THE POLICEMEN INSIDE THE GATES. IF HE REMEMBERS THIS
INCIDENT A S T DO I WONDER WHETHER HE IS STILL GRINNING TODAY.


IHb REASuN FuR WRITING }HIS' LET iEh AND USING THJ.S EXAMPLE    _L'->   TO
    MAKE ONE POINT:    THE ORDINARY FOOTBALL SUPPORTER IS NO HOOLIGAN,
    MO ANIMAL- THE POLICE HAVE LONG HAD THE ATTITUDE THAT FOOTBALL
    SUPPORTERS ARE NOT TO BE TREATED SERIOUSLY. THEY DID IN MY
    EXAMPLE NOT LISTEN TO OUR PLEAS. LAST SATURDAY THEY DID NOT
    LISTEN T U MM NY UF \HE Li.v'ERHUUL bUPF’OKT^.i-.'b 1 F’LEA’
                                                               c'. UJHi^N HUr^AM
    BEINGcS HAVE sU cSHl^_JT AND SL'Rc.AM IN DIb iREScr- Tu BE TAKEN
    SERIOUSLY IT IS OFTEN -AS SATURDAY'S TRAGIC EVENT SHOWS- TOO
    i arc


    THIS IS NOT A "HATE LETTER" AGAINST THE POLICE. THE POLICEMEN
    DECIDING TO OPEN THE GATE ARE -IN MY OPINION- NOT TO BE BLAMED
    AS INDIVIDUALS. BUT IT IS ABOUT TIME THAT THE AUTHORITIES AND
    THIS INCLUDES AUTHORITIES AND CLUBS RUNNING THE GAME LISTEN TO
    THE PEOPLE WHO FEEL PASSIONATELY ABOUT THE GAME-

                        T H E    S' U P P 0 R T E R .

    I HAVE BEEN ATTENDING FOOTBALL GAMES' SINCE I WAS 7 YEARS OF AGE.
    I HAVE oEEN UUUMTLtSS GAMfc-S AS A HAMBLiRG SUPPORTER; ON THE
    CONTINENT AND ALSO IN THE UK -SINCE BEING "EXILED" IN 1978- AS A
    SUPPORTER OF MY TWO ADOPTED TEAMS ARSENAL AND ORIENT AND ALSO AS
    A REGULAR ATTENDER OF MANY OTHER LEAGUE AND NON LEAGUE GAMES.

    I AM TELLING THIS TO EMPHASISE THAT THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF
    PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO LOVE THE GAME, WHO UNDERSTAND THE PASSION OF
    SUPPORTING -NOT ONLY "ONES OWN TEAM"- BUT FOOTBALL IN GENERAL
    NATIONALY AND INTERNATIONALY WHO ARE SICK.AND TIRED OF
    INTERFERENCE AND LACK OF CONSIDERATION FROM THE BUREAUCRACY OF
    THE FOOTBALL AUTHORITIES, SOME CLUBS AND INSTITUTIONS OUTSIDE
    THE GAME.

    THE DECISION OF THE GOVEF:NMENT TO INSIST ON CONTINUING WITH THE
    IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ID CARD MEMBERSHIP SCHEME IS AN INSULT TO
^   THE FELLOW SUPPORTERS WHO ARE SADLY NO LONGER WITH US.

                                       HILLSBOROUGH ENQUIRY



                Wibh regard to the correspondence -dated 3 May 1989 from solicitors acting
                on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, I would report that the
                South Yorkshire Police are aware of the suspected theft of the two video
                tapes described in the attached letter.

                On Monday 17 April 19 89 in my capacity of senior investigating officer and
                a person in charge of the incident room set up to enquire into the
                Hillsborough Disaster, I became aware of the existence of a number of
                video cameras located at the football ground which were operated by and on
                be n a n off the football club.   I immediately realised the importance of
                the video cassettes which had been used in the cameras on Saturday 15
                April 1989, and raised an enquiry for those tapes to be taken into police
                possession. (Attached is a copy of Action No. A39).        This action was
                allocated to Detective Sergeant                ;ho made enquiries into the
                matter, the results of which are outlined in his report attached.

                At 4.00 p.m. on Tuesday 18 April 19 89 I had a meeting at Hammer ton Road
                Police-^ Station with Assistant    Chief Constable   Mr  Jones  and  Chief
                Superintendent Pemberton of the West Midlands Police.         We discussed
                enquiries todate and the procedures to be adopted in respect of handing
                over to the West Midlands Police. I was instructed by Mr* Jones that all
                enquiries should be terminated and merely to keep things ticking over. We
                were not to carry out any interviews of possible witnesses but if a
                telephone call was received from a person who wanted to offer information,
                that person was to be interviewed and a record of the conversation made in
                the form of a report which was to be inputted to the computer.   I pointed
                out to Mr Jones the enquiry which had been made in respect of the
                Sheffield Wednesday Football Club video tapes of the incident and the fact
                that it had been alleged that two of these were missing and we had been
                informed that they were not relevant to the Leppings Lane end of the
                football ground.   He acknowledged the importance of the recovery of the
                video cassette tapes from the club but pointed out that from then on all
                policy decisions would be made by West Midlands Police and Superintendent
                Roy Taylor would' undertake the role from 9-00 a.m. Wednesday 19 April
                1989.

                I have attached a copy of a report by Police Constable 1421 Guest
                outlining the procedures which are undertaken by Sheffield Wednesday
                Football Club in relation to their own cameras and TV monitors which cover
                all 95 turnstiles around the ground and the areas between the west and
                south stands.     It would appear that over a number of years Police
                Constable Guest's duties in respect of football matches at Hillsborough,
                have included working in the video room with the. chief security officer,
                Mr Lock (ex Police Superintendent Lock, South Yorkshire Police).  He gives
                details in the report of his perceptions on Saturday 15 April 1989 at
                Hillsborough.




Gen/2
      f ^ ached is a c°py of a South Yorkshire Crime Report,        number
Fl/4424/89, and accompanying report in relation to the completion of the
crime report by Detective Chief Inspector Tope of the West Midlands Police
who is currently investigating the allegation of the missing         video
cassette tapes.

There are a number of interesting facts which        emerge   from   the   attached
reports and I would itemise these as follows

1.   The video operator employed ’oy Sheffield Wednesday Football Club, Mr
     Roger Hallsworth, who operated the video cameras on the day of the
     disaster, informed Detective Sergeant           [hat following the
     departure of Police Constable Guest from the video room at 5-35 p.m.
     on Saturday 15 April 1989, he partially ejected the cassettes of all
     of the video recorders (put cassettes in the non record position),
     and then locked the doors of the cupboard housing this equipment . He
     then set the alarm system covering the video room and locked the
     door on leaving.  In order to ensure the security of the video
     cassette tapes, he had used the Club Secretary Mr Mackrell's keys,
     but it would appear that there is another set of identical keys in
     existence at~the football club.             "                  s-------

     On Mr Hallsworth's return the following morning, Sunday 16 April
     1989 he discovered that two video cassette tapes were missing and,
     according to him, he informed Mr Mackrell of this fact.    The matter
     was not reported to the Police at this time.               ~~

     When      Detective   Sergeant             ontacted  Mr  Mackrell   on  the
     telephone on Monday 17 April 19 89 requesting that the tapes be handed
     over to the police, he was handed over to                     , a solicitor
     acting for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club.          Neither Mr Mackrell
     2 2 £|_______________ informed the officer of the missing tapes.

     Some  twenty minutes or so after speaking to Mr Mackrell and
                 Detective Sergeant          ^as contacted by
     who said   I wish to report that two tapes are missing from Sheffield
     Wednesday Football Club, they were apparently taken on Saturday from
     the room where they are kept, they are not relevant to the Leppings
     Lane end."     It would appear that on j              I discussing the
     police request with other persons at Sheffield Wednesday Football
     Club (most likely the secretary Mr Mackrell) he was then informed of
     the missing tapes which he then reported to the police.    It should be
     noted that he had not reported these two video cassette tapes as
     being stolen, merely as missing.
                                                - 3 -




It has come to my notice, unofficially, that Detective Chief Inspector
Tope of the West Midlands Police interviewed Police Constable 1421 Guest
on the 27 April 1989 concerning his duties in the Sheffield Wednesday
Football Club video room.          Police Constable Guest has made a Criminal
Justice Act statement concerning his duties on 15 April 1989 and it
appears that he has been interviewed on two subsequent occasions by the
West Midlands Police who, it appears, seems somewhat dissatisfied with our
officers explanations.       On the other hand, however, I am likewise informed
that either the editor or a reporter at the Daily Mirror newspaper has
contacted Detective Chief Inspector Tope concerning their knowledge of the
missing tapes and whilst he has no evidence that they are in possession of
those t a p e s , he is considering making a recommendation that this person is
brought before Lord Justice Taylor in respect of the matter.

I would emphasise the South Yorkshire Police did as much as they were
allowed to in this particular investigation and could not take the matter
any further m view of the way and timing of the handing over to the West
Midlands Police.

Submitted for information and_-,cons iaeration please.

                SUBJECT:                     HILLSBOROUGH DISASTER




                I have to report that on Monday, 17 April 1 9 8 9 , at Hammerton Road Police
                Station I was given an action no. A39 raised by Detective Chief
                Superintendent Addis, to recover the video recordings from Sheffield
                Wednesday Football Club for 15 April 1 9 8 9 .

                I telephoned the football ground and spoke to the secretary, Mr. Mackrell,
                and told him that I wanted the video tapes.  He immediately gave the
                telephone to the solicitor for Sheffield Wednesday Football Club's
                insurance company - a j                      I.                 informed
                me that the tapes were in a locked safe at the ground, but that he was
                unwilling to release them until it had been decided who would have
                precedence - either the Police or the judicial enquiry.  He said that a
                decision was to be made later that day with regard to the judicial
                enquiry.  I completed A39 and returned it to the Incident Room.

                At 1.35 p.m. the same day ________________ telephoned me at Hammerton Road
                Police Station and stated that two of the video tapes were missing.    He
                stated that they had apparently gone missing on Saturday, 1 5 , but that
                they were not relevant to the Leppings Lane end.    I informed him that it
                may be that all the tapes may prove to be relevant as the enquiry
                progressed and that I would no doubt have to speak to him again.    He
                assured me that the remainder of the tapes were locked in a safe at
                S.W.F.C.  I asked                 I if I could see Roger Holdsworth, the
                video operator.   He told me that he would be seeing Mr. Holdsworth later
                that day for probably 2 hours and that he would tell him to contact me
                when they had finished.   Mr. Holdsworth did not contact me and when I
                contacted S.W.F.C. later that date I was informed that he had gone home.

                I saw Roger Holdsworth the following date at S.W.F.C.  He showed me the
                room where the video screens were kept and a cupboard in that room where
                the actual videos recorders were kept.

                He stated that on Saturday, 15 April 1 9 8 9 , he had been in the room with
                P.C. Harold Guest.   Once the incident at the Leppings Lane end began, he
                left the room and went on to the pitch to give assistance.      P.C. Guest
                remained in the room.   He returned to the room later and estimates that
                P.C. Guest left at about 5-35 p.m.   Realising that the tapes would
                probably be required at a later date, he physically 'ejected' the tapes
                from the recorders , although they remained partially in the recorders in
                order that they would not be accidentally erased. He then locked the
                cupboard and when he left the room, locked the door.      The room is on alarm
                and this was set.

                On returning to the room the following morning, Sunday, 16 April 1 9 8 9 , to
                collect the tapes for Mr. Mackrell, he found that two of the tapes were
                missing.  There were no signs of forced entry to the room or the cupboard.
                The cupboard doors, however, are not entirely secure when locked   and
                appear to be quite easily opened without the key.

                He showed me the layout of the screens and the video recorders.  One of
Gen/2           the missing tapes shows a view of Gate B, and the other one is blank due
                to the camera involved facing a newly erected wall.
As far as I am aware, the video recorders are not numbered to match the
screens and it appears that whoever is responsible for taking the taDes
was conversant with the layout of the system.

Mr. Holdsworth stated that over a period of weeks prior to the incident of
the 1 5 , several members of the media had been shown the layout of the room
and the system.

He also stated that he had locked the cupboard and the room with Mr.
Mackrell's keys.  I seem to recollect, but I am not certain, that Mr.
Holdsworth said that there was a second set of keys in existence.
He went on to say that as soon as he had discovered the tapes missing he
had informed Mr. Mackrell.

Liverpool           and       Nottingham              Forest,             and    commenced                my       duties        at

10 a . m .     that          date.         At    about          12.45       p.m.          after          the       turnstiles              were        cps

I switched           all          video        recorders             cn    to    record             all       the    fans        as    they        as

were     entering             the       ground        via       the       turnstiles.

During        the    afternoon                 leading          up    to    kick-off                time       at    about        2.15        p.m.          I

noticed        that          the       crowd     appeared             to    be       slow          in a r r i v i n g       at    the

turnstiles.                  I am       n ot    sure       of    the       size          of       the    crowd       but     believe              it       to

be     25,000       and       20,000.

At     2.40    p.m.          that       same     date          I checked             with          the    camera           which        covers

t he    Fenistone             Road       area        and       noticed          that          there       were       very        few       people

in     the    streets,             and     on    checking             the       computer,                it    was     shewing             19,000

plus,        and    when          each     area       of       the    ground             gets       near       to    capacity              the

totals        start          to    pulsate,           the       total       capacity                for       that     area       of       t he

ground        being          21,000,           which       told       me    that          nearly          all       th e    Nottingham

supporters           were          in    the     ground          and       it    was          near       to    full        capacity.              . '• T v .

I then        switched             to    the     camera          that       was          covering             the    Leppings              Lane        end

of     the    ground          and       noticed           that       there       was          a    large       gathering              of    fans           in

that     area,           I    could        sea       that       the       fans       were          spread          from     the       t u r n s t iIe

entrance           right,         back     into       Leppings             Lane,          fully          blocking           the       road.            I

would        estimate             that     there          would       be    between                3,000       and    5,000           fans.            I

made     a    check          of    the     computer             and       saw    oha t t h e             figures           for    the       Wa s t

eland        were    pulsating                 and    showing             near       to       capacity,             ana     the       L-«cpi ng s

Lane     figures             were       showing           in    excess          of       7,000,          which       would        be       near        to

capacity           and       the       computer           would       be    at       a    point          ready       to     start

pulsating.               The       figures           on    the       computer             start          to    pulsate           when       the

capacities           get          to    within        15%       of    the       total.              It    was       obvious           that

not     be    sufficient                room     for       all       to    be    accommodated.                       As     I looked              at

the     scene       I could             see     the       crowd       ge'tting            larger          and       many     at       the    back

of     the    crowd                     surging           forward          pushing                violently          t o w a r d s .the

turnstiles.                 From       that       point         I could            also       see    Police           Offleers                      trying

tc    get    the       crowd          into       some      sort       of    order            but    they       were        being               pushed

to    one    side       out       of    the       way.          I saw       several            missiles             being           thrown

towards        t he     Police.              A    large         contingent               of    the       fans       were        climbing

onto    t he      backs       cf       others         and       climbing            the       walls       over        the       top            of     the

turnstiles;             they          were       landing         onto       the         asbestos          roofs           on    the            inside

of    the    ground          and       jumping           onto     people            who       were       on    the        inside               of     the

ground       to     break         their          fall      as    they       landed.

On    the    South          Stand       of       this      area       I saw         a    mounted          Policeman                 being

pushed       on     his      horse          down      towards          a    large            double       door        which             leads              int

the    rear       of    the       West       Stand.

Dtrfing a l l          this       I    could        hear        several            officers          including

Superintendent                Marshall,               requesting                further            assistance              in       t    C3.   "t -3r 8 8     ;

At    this     point         I noticed              that        the     large           door       situated           on       the       South

that    the       large       doors          of     the     North          side         of    Lsupings             Lane        open            and

heavily        intoxicated                  with      drink.

I then       turned          to       the    camera         that       was         inside          the    ground           and          covered

the    area       of    the       West       Stand         and    it       was      obvious          that          t he    situation                       was

             I    car. s a y      that       during          the    time       prior         to    the       major       incident             the     Police

             personal          radios            were       working        very         well, but             during          thed a y     t h e fa

             appeared          to      be    some          distortion          and      some         messages            could       not      be r e a d

             clearly.

             I would          only      like          to    add    that     in     mv    opinion,             the     main       cause         of     this

             major       incident            was       caused       by     the     Liverpool                fans    arriving             at    the     match

             too     la te     and      being          under       the     influence              of    drink       and       trying          tc    enter

             the    ground-^ithout                     tickets.            It w a s      obvious             that     looking            at    the     crowd

             outside          the      ground          prior       to    kick-off            there          were    several           thousands               t ha

             were, a t t e m p t i n g           to    enter       without         tickets             at    all    cost        to   the       safety              of

             other       Liverpool               supporters             inside       the      ground.

             During         the     incident               I was    trying         to    concentrate                on    messages             being

             received          on      the       Police       radio        network,           but       did    not       listen          to    what      wa£

    YOUR REF


    Dear Sir,

    The Hillsborough Disaster

    We act on behalf of Sheffield Wednesday Football Club with
    recard   to   the public inquiry, andwrite regarding       the
    circumstances of a suspected theft from our client's premises.
    You are no doubt already well aware of the matter.

    Mr Roger Holdsworth,“ an electronics expert, and consultant to
    the Club responsible for the Club’s close circuit television
    system,   attended Hillsborough on 15th^ April 1989 and    was
    stationed in the Club’s control room.      Before leaving the
    cf^ound ,    about 7.30 pm, . he locked the video cupboard
    containing the video recordings and activated the alarm system
    for the control room. He retained the key.

    Mr Holdsworth returned the following morning at about 9 am, but
    discovered that two video tapes were missing from the cupboard.
    One tape related to the camera which views gates 9 - 1 6 and the
    other tape was from the VCR which had not been activated at the
    time.   Neither Mr Holdsworth nor any officials from the Club
    are aware of who might have removed these tapes.

    .Tne matter was duly notified to Detective Sergeant          jf
     Hammerton Road Police Station on17th April by I
      ------ [ a Partner in this         firm.  Detective Sergeant
              recorded the matter and no doubt investigations are
     already under way.

    Our clients are greatly concerned that this very sensitive
    matter is one that should, if possible, be resolved quickly.
    Obviously, one of the tapes constitutes .important evidence
    which should be submitted to the public inquiry, and it is in

                                                                                           cont/d...

    everyone's interest that the tape is found.

    Accordingly , we ^would ask you to keep us fully acpraised    of
    any developments in the investigations you are conducting.

    We have copied this letter to the Chief Constable of the   South
    Yorkshire Police Authority.

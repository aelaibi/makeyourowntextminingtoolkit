           I am a single man and I live at the above address with my parents

           and one younger sister.

           I am a supporter of l~ivert/6ol football C l u b , I have been attending

           games at Anfield regularly for about the last five years and have been

           a season ticket for the last two years.

           On Saturday 15 April 89 I attended the Football                   Association Challenge

           Cup Semi final game between Liverpool F o o t b a 11 Club and Nottingham

           Forest Football      club held at the S heffield Wednesday Football Ground

           in Hillsborough,      Sheffield.

           I obtained my ticket for the game from Liverpool Football Club u sing

           my season ticket voucher it was a six pounds standing ticket for the

           Leppings Ln terraces.

           I travelled to the- game in a mini bus with eleven other people some of
                                                                                  PAGE

those people being friends               others I had never seen before that day.

We travelled in a mini           bus which had been h,i r e d by one of my friends



The details       I know about the people        I travelled to Sheffield tyith are

as follows:

The pers          amed above numbers 8 and 9 I had seen before Saturday

15 April 89       (150489)     but I only knew them casually,         they were

The persons named above,           number    10 and 11 I had never seen before,        I

 met them on the morning of 15th April                1989 (150489)    for the

first time.       They also were both f riends of

On the morning of Saturday 15th April 1989 (150489)                   I walked up to

                  house   in                   with                         and met

              and

We set off in the mini bus to collect the others who were travelling

with us.

We collected                       from his house,      then we went to
                                                                          PAGE         3.;
                                                                          S3366

house in               where we picked up                                     Tony

OWEN,                    and Gary CHURCH. Finally we collected

from his house in
                                        tA\S
We cofnmenced our journey to Sheffield at about         1115 am,   I cannot

recall what route we took cHfner than we travelled mainly on motorways

and on one of the motorways,      I can’t jsemember which one, we were

delayed because of the heavy ^oliyiffc of traf f i e ,j   We stopped just

outside Sheffield to get petrol and ask directions to Hillsborough.

We were also stopped by the Police on the/Gutskirts of Sheffield,               they

ehecked to make sure there was no d r i j w o n the Bus and also checked

some of our match t i c k e t s , althoughXiot all of them, after this check

the Police put a     white sticker y h the windscreen and despite this we

were again stopped by 1\he Police a few minutes along the same road.

I never saw anyone     cons&fliij*% alcohol during the journey

During the journey to Sheffield I was sat in a double seat

           of the mini bus                     was sitting next to me

Gary CHURCH was sitting in a double seat by a window either

                  of my position.     I cannot recall who was sitting next

to Gary.

There was a happy atmosphere on the bus during the journey,            everyone

partaking in general group conversation.           I cannot say specifically

what kind of mood Gary CHURCH                  I never really studied him       that
                                     iiffA *
closely.

We arrived in S h ^ ^ i e l j and parked the mini bus on a car park      at about

2.00 pm (14QEj)y? I c a n ’t recall where abouts the car park was,       it was

only about five minutes      walk from the ground.

We all got out the mini      bus and started to walk towards the ground

following a lot of other Liverpool supporters.            Everyone seemed to

spread out,    I ca n’t say who Gary CHURCH w a l k e r l o w n to the ground with.

J. met a friend from work in the crowd and walked down to the ground
                                                                                PAGE
                                                                                S3366

    with him and
                       v:
    As we approached the Leppings Ln entrance to the ground I had lost

    sight of the other people        I had travelled with,    I had remained w
                                                                             with

                     because we both had seating tickets for thek
                                                                    \ / t /    nd“
    Although I had originally got a terrace ticket from Anfield I had

    later been given a seating ticket for the N stand by a friend at

    work.      I had given my terrace ticket away as I preffered to sit to

    watch the game.

    Prior to leaving the van we had all arranged that we would all meet

    back at the van when the game was over.

    The last time I saw Gary CHURCH was         shc^tly after we left the mini

    bus,    I can’t remember at that timeXwfyf he was with,      to the best of

    my knowledge the last time I saw Gary CHURCH he was happy,            fit and

    tivse 1 f >and                got to the Leppirw? i-m turnstiles at about

            pm (1420).      We had no problems finding which turnstiles we had to

    er^er through.       We didn't have any problems entering the ground,            there

    weren't that many people by the N        stand turnstiles at that time.          We

    both entered through a t u rns tile, I handed my ticket into         the

    turnstile operator.

    I did not see any gates open other than the turnstile gates,

    During our walk to the ground I can't recall seeing anyone            consuming

    alcohol,    or seeing any signs of disorder or fighting,        but I w a s n ’t

    really looking,      I was talking to this work colleague I had met.

    I cannot recabt seeing any stewards outside the N stand turnstiles,

    the only P o l/t ce I saw were standing by the turnstile gates searching

    people as\/hey entered the turnstiles.

    Once we got inside the ground I saw some letters displayed and had no

    problem finding my seat which was        in aisle *Q* .

    Myself and           took up our seats   at about 2.40 pm    (1440) after we had
                                                                                  PAGE

     got programmes and food from the refreshment bar in the N stand.

     Between entering the ground and getting to our seats I had not

     witnessed any sort of disorder or other i n c i d e n t s ^     I had not seen

     anyone consuming alcohol     in the ground.

     Both                and myself were sitting y l f adjoining seats.          At the

     time of taking up our seats at about cUTkQ pm (1440) the only unusual

     thing I noticed was t('iat the area J m the centre of the Leppinqs Ln

     terraces behind the goal seemec/to be very f ul 1.n p,^but at that time I

     d i d n ’t pay any partici       ,ention to this

     I was sat in the N stai       I did not see the barrier break' in pen

     number three.

     I cannot say that I actually witnessed / a n y      crowd crush, all       I can

S'   remember seeing is about five or ten^ninutes before the game kicked

     off I could see people .being pull§® up into the W stand above tile

     Leppinqs Ln ter races.

     I cannot say that I saw anyNs'Srt of surge occurring in the Leppings Ln

     te rraces.

     I was not     involved in any kind of crowd crush myself        during    that

     afternoon I was not injured in any way.

     I did not personally witness any deaths,        I was not in a position to be

     able to assist any of the dead or injured.

     I did not     witness anything that Iconsidered to Jri? a criminal offence.

     1 left the football ground with                    ,S *fe   left of our   own accord

     at about 3.30 pm (1530).

     We went back to where we had left the/mini bus and eventually everyone

     of my travelling companions      returjjred to the mini bus except Gary

     CHURCH.

     When Gary did not return we all got in the mini bj#C and went to a

     Police S tation not too far away from the groj^fd,          1 think Tony OWEN

     reported Gar.y CHURCH to the Police as a jxTssing person.
                                                                                     PAGE
                                                                                     S3366

          After this we all went to a hall where we were told to stay and await

          news about Gary CHURCH.

          At about 9.45 pm (g145) some of my tjj^ve 11 ing companions including

                    and Tony OWEN left the \y fl 1.   When they later returned I

          found out that Gary CHURCH h a y d i e d and his body had been identified

          by one or more of the peopj/e who had earlier left the hall.

          As previously stated prior to Saturday 15th April         1989 (150489? I had

           never met Gary CHURCH,     I   cannot say that I spoke to Gary

          specifically during that day as during the          ney     we were all

          engaged in group conversation.

          I would describe Gary CHURCH as a whita^male,      aged about    18 to 19

          years, about 5*8 tall,    I would say iVclium in build,    he had blond hair

           cut short at the back and longer/in top with a step cut at the back,.

           he was fair skinned.    I cannot ./emember what he was wearing.

                                                                                    SIGNED

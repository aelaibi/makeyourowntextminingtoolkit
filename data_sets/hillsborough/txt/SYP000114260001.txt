                 bodies agai n s t              the wall.        My estimate was                between 3 0 50.

            outside       of the          e n t rance     gates and           placed       in a line.-     I returned down

            the      tunnel        and went        onto     the     p i t c h , ■there was a cordon of officers

            across       the       pitch at        the S p i o n Ho p end,            some    I-nspector b o r r o w e d my

            obviously wanting                   retribution against                  someone.

               I stayed     there w i t h PC Binns                  until      the    game was       c a n celled over       the'

            An       Inspector       then told me to get                  some men and a c c o m p a n y      the Liverpool

            supp o r t e r s       back    to    their      transport.           This       I did and we went          via

            L e p p i n g s Lan e     to C l a y w h e e l s      Lane,       talking       to supporters.        On    reaching

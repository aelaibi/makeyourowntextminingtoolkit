           Some    ten to fifteen minu t e s                 later,        I eventually         got    through to the

           ihe four       of us made         our way         to the tunnel             leading       to the tsrraces

           thro u g h    the    tunnel     as         it was o b viously full. There                  was    no one      in

           authority          restricting             access to the         tunnel       so        we all      made    our way

           Initially,          we all     stood       together       at    the    rear/t^i the         left about        three

           Pen we were          in was     f u l l,     it w a s n ’t unbearable,              but    it really was at

           the    point where           no other       s upporters         should/have          been    let    in,.

           At this       time,     my view was           obst r u c t e d so      I/decided          to move    to my

           right.        The    other     three       did    not join me W i t h o ugh            I noticed         that Geoff

           BR1DSQN       had moved also              sligh t l y    to his       right.        This was       the     last    I

           saw of all          the others        until       after     the game         had been abandoned,,

           forward.           I was able        to move       slightly          to the    left,       but    I then began

           to be     pushed forward.                 I couldn't        control         this and       I just went wit h

           the    forward m o vements            of the       crowd.        I did       not    lose    contact w ith

            I eventually           came    to    rest a bout          10 ~ 12 feet         from the front         perimeter

            fence.         I was    compacted         in the         crowd for   some       10       12 minu t e s   unable

            to     physi c a l l y move as         the   crowd subsided and                supporters       had got     out

            of    the     pen   I brought my s e l f        to my feet,,
